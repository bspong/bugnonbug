Web Site which worked with firefox 2 no longer work with 3.0. Deleting site cookie fix problem.

For school I have to log into blackboard.umbc.edu with my username and password. In firefox 2 a little redirection screen would come up with the message "Your are being redirect to some page, if it doe not automatically load click here to load it"

Then a firefox pop up come up. and say

"Although this page is encrypted, the information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party.

Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?"

I now click yes and then the pop up reappears infinitely no matter how many time I click yes.

This did not used to happen in firefox 2 so I believe it do be a problem with 3.0.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
You will not be able to reproduce it a it requires a login to make it happen but I will give the steps.

1.go to http://blackboard.umbc.edu
2.click login
3.enter username and pas on login page which us my school login page (some sort of webauth software)
4.get redirected to the site and the popup will infinitely come up.

Actual Results:
infinite popups and can not get to webpage

Expected Results:
infinite popups and can not get to webpage. If I delete the cookie manually then I can.

The only way I have found to get it to go to the web page is to manually delete the cookie. I think it might be a problem with the cookies.
