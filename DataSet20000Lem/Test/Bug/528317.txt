I wa dragging text from an edit box to Google Earth. In order to do so, I have to drag the text past the sidebar a the GE window wa in my second monitor. The sidebar wa collapsed, but even so, a I went past it, it opened. The sidebar that wa active at the time (Customize Your Web) didn't have use for the text (which wa a distance in miles).

I think that unless the mouse hovers over the sidebar splitter, the sidebar should ignore drags.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Mostly, the probability that it will happen depends on the mouse speed. If it is moved fast enough, no problem.

1. Select some text.
2. Attempt to drag the text past the sidebar into a non-Firefox window.
Actual Results:
If it happens, Firefox will open the sidebar.

Expected Results:
The sidebar should ignore the drag unless the mouse hovers over the sidebar's splitter

While I listed x86_64 a my platform, that is only the version of Vista I run. This is a 32-bit build of Firefox.
