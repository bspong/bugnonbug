Opening local file via explorer fails if name contains space

Opening local file in "my documents" via explorer result in the following four page being opened in separate tabs:
- file:///C:/Documents - titled "Problem loading page", which say file cannot be found
- http://www.cdc.gov/
- http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/using/howto/security/settings.mspx
- http://www.law.ou.edu/hist/

I presume the last three are the result of an automated google? But why would it directly open 3 results, and always the same results?

The first page with the error "Firefox can't find the file at /C:/Documents" seems to indicate that the file name ha been truncated at the first space. The file I wa trying to open was: "C:\Documents and Settings\steve\My Documents\test.htm".

I have firefox set a the default browser.

file with the extension "html" do not cause a problem and open correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set firefox a the default browser
2. create a file with the extension "htm" in a folder with a space in the name (ie: "C:\Documents and Settings")
3. double-click the file to open in the default browser

Actual Results:
the following four page being opened in separate tabs:
- file:///C:/Documents - titled "Problem loading page", which say file cannot be found
- http://www.cdc.gov/
- http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/using/howto/security/settings.mspx
- http://www.law.ou.edu/hist/

Expected Results:
file displayed in firefox

file the the extension "html" open withoyut problem.
firefox is set a default browser.
cannot view advanced file association detail for "htm" via explorer, so cannot compare difference between "html" and "htm" handling.
previously had latest release version of firefox (1.07?) installed, and installed beta 1 etc without uninstalling previous version.
