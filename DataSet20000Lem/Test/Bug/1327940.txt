After regression in bug 1267617 I can no longer work around your bug 1231025 with CSS -moz-box-ordinal-group
>>> My Info: Win7_64, Nightly 50, 32bit, ID 20160715063552 (2016-07-15)
"-moz-box-ordinal-group" CSS property is used to change sequence of item in -moz-box.
Using that CSS property, I wa able to fix the terrible bug 1231025 (showing how much Firefox
developer are focused on useless improvement rather than real bug and don't have any well-defined
plan on development (if they had a plan, they whouldn't regress bug 1231025 further and further, would
they?)). Now it's not possible, due to poor implementation of identity block (result of completely
random change including bug 1267617 not requested/approved by any user)

AR: Bug 1231025 is present, unlike on Firefox 49
ER: There should be a way to work around bug 1231025 with CSS while FX team is breaking other thing

Notes:
1) Looking at what ha been broken in bug 1267617, I see that there's no way to fix this using CSS.
2) There're really obvious solutions: (I only mention them, because everybody would pretend that
they don't understand what I meant. It only happens when people refuse to think on the topic)
2.1) Display http/https icon instead of terrible (i) button (you'll need it anyway to fix
bug 1231025), and place notification anchor right after identity block,
i.e. in the next sibling, not inside identity block
2.2) Just place notification anchor right after identity block, i.e. in the next sibling, not inside
identity block. Thus, sequence of displayed icon will be: (i) - http - notification anchor
Note that (2.2) partially fix another type of twitching in identity block - when button is
added below mouse pointer 0.1s before click. See bug 1238637, bug 1251864, bug 1258687 comment 5
2.3) Move http button to the END of notification anchor and place notification anchor right
after identity block, i.e. in the next sibling, not inside identity block.
(2.3) visually look just like current design.
2.4) Move http button to the START of notification anchor and place notification anchor right
after identity block, i.e. in the next sibling, not inside identity block.
(2.4) visually look just like (2.2), and also fix twitching "button appears 0.1s before click"
2.5) Actually fix bug 1231025
(I don't even hope, because for past 2 year FX team wa breaking UI, saying it's for good)

This is regression from bug 1267617. Regression range:

It seems that this is a regresion caused by your change. Please have a look.
