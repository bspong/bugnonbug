Font spacing wa Drastically increased on a few page after installing TTF fonts.
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.8

the url example above ha a forum post where i stated the entire problem
(http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=53367 )

but the major issue pretty much is that after installing TTF font from
windows, some pages, or part of page that used Tahoma had extreamly
streatched out letter spacing after. only tahoma font seemed to be affected,
though i cant be shure all tahoma wa affected, jsut the one that were, had
that font. normal mozilla displayed it perfect with that font.
for now i just un installed that 1 TTF font, the rest of them work fine. that
forum post ha link to 2 site where that problem is evident if you have that
font installed (this is only on linux version, wondows one is un affected)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Tahoma TTF font from window font folder to linux fonts/ttf folder
(just copy over)
2. thats it, check out this site now http://djeyl.net/forum/index.php?c=7 then
look at it after removing the font
3.

Actual Results:
the font change from normal spacing (but a default wrong font is displayed) to
the correct ahoma font but the letter spacing look like "a b c d e"
instead of "abcde"

Expected Results:
i imagine display the text properly like the normal Mozilla that came stock
with Redhat 9.0 did with the tahoma fonts.

i cant be shure if it just Tahoma or a coincidence with the page code causeing
the problem and they just happen to be using the font, but removing that font
solved the problems. and Firefox work fine with the other TTF font like
verdana and such.
