Idle Firefox memory grows - overnight OOM Killer - javascript - safe mode

When Firefox is left idle with certain web page open in tab -- active for the tab, even if not the active tab -- memory consumption grows without limit (until OOM Killer). Moving the mouse over the Firefox window or pressing even the Shift Key with Firefox in front free the memory. The specific example requires Javascript (disable and re-enable JS, no leak until page refresh), but there may be other way to consume memory -- I don't visit many fancy site with, e.g., Flash or Java. This happens when Firefox is in either normal mode or safe mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit a site with running javascript, such a a Google result page.
2. move the mouse off Firefox window.
3. wait overnight for OOM Killer (or watch Firefox RSS in top).
4. move mouse over Firefox window, see memory use drop.
Actual Results:
Growing memory use.

Expected Results:
Same memory use (approximately).

I monitored memory use with the command `while : ; do p -o rss= -o time= -C firefox ; sleep 10 ; done`.

This may have been a problem for years. Recently Google fancied up their web page with extra Javascript, and I started seeing in the morning a sluggish computer or missing Firefox or even Firefox vanishing shortly after clicking on it, but I think I've experienced it off and on for a while.

As the bug happens in safe mode, it is not due to some rogue extension.
