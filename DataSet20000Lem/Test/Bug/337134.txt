Good Day . . .

While viewing page FireFox view area go blank for an indeterminate time. It seems to happen on every page. The time go from 1 or 2 second to ten to 15 seconds. When I used snapshot to capture an image snapshot and the Firefox page did not disappear just froze. It happens about every minute or less.

I used top to check for memory and cpu usage and everything appears normal.

All other program function normally if they are outside the FireFox program.

The KDE character AMOR waks about a usual over FireFox except that the previous instance are not refreshed. The attachment try to show this.

No other program is affected. I used fc5's built in Firefox then I downloaded the latest version and installed it in my home directory. The problem is still present.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
