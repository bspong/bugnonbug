Reduce startup time by showing window before loading customized toolbars
I have a basic idea of how the start up loading time could be reduced. I don't
know if the gain would even be measurable, and if not, just WONTFIX this.

Anyway, from what I can see with my bare eyes, it appears that all toolbar
button and bookmark are fully loaded and placed on the toolbar when the window
is first displayed on screen. I can only assume that loading and placing all the
button on the toolbar take at least 1/10th of a second, and possibly more than
that. My idea on how the startup speed could be slightly increased is to paint
the window before actually loading the toolbar and processing the bookmarks.htm
file. Since I haven't seen the code for Phoenix, I can only assume that it could
take long to process a large bookmarks.htm file, and since the personal toolbar
data is stored inside that file, the startup speed must suffer.

I am a programmer myself and I have made a text editor with customizable
toolbars. Since startup speed is very important in a text editor, I have managed
to reduce the startup time by painting the main window before actually loading
all the button in the toolbar. The placeholder for the toolbar is there, but
the actual button are not loaded until afterwards. This give the impression
that it start faster than it actually does.
