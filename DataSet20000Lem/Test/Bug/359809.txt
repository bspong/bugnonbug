Quick Search doe not URL-encode plus sign (+).

Searching for "c++" (without quotes), the %s (replaced portion of the URL) appears in the URL as:
c++
Instead of:
c%2B%2B

The encoding (++) being decoded by the server a two spaces.


Reproducible: Always

http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&q=%s&btnG=Google+Search&meta=

2) Assign a keyword to the bookmark, i.e: 'g' (without quotes).

3) Type "g c++" (without quotes) in the address bar and press Enter.

Actual Results:
The plus sign (+) do not get URL-encoded.

Expected Results:
+ should be encoded a %2B

This may be a regression a it is reported a bug 319169 and bug 316863 (and an number of others mentioned therein). The status of these bug report have been set to "Resolved".

But this feature ha never worked for me since Firefox 1.0 and (mostly) automatic update version up to 2.0.

This is a fresh install of Firefox 2.0 (no previous version) on a fresh install of Windows.
