Firefox on Mac OSX.5 force me to close all tab when multi window on view instead of allowing me to choose which to close.

At any screen of any web site. I want to leave the page on view and return to a previous page. I need to click on go away "x" button of page on view. BUT I am forced to close all tab open at that stage instead of having a choice a to which tab should close. This mean I have to keep restarting my visit to that web site to be able to navigate the site. I hope this is the right place to draw attention to this problem - if not please advise. Using a PC and IE seems not to have this prolem?? Meantime I look forward to a solution and may I wish you all thanks in antiipation a well a best wish for a lovely New Year
