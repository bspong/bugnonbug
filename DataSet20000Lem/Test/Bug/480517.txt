When trying to submit a broken web page, I have an 'Error Sending Report' message
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

I visited that web site (URL above) and found out that it will not work with neither Firefox 3.0.6 or Firefox 2.0.0.20. This web site shall not load after clicking the image (page will be blank). Works with K-Meleon 1.5.2 and MSIE 6.0 (aggghhhhh...).

So I go to 'Help' > 'Report Broken Web Site...' > I choose 'Browser not supported', and click on 'Submit Report' button.

All I got is:

'Error Sending Report'

'There wa an error creating the report, and so no information wa sent to mozilla.org'

Into 'Show Details':

'Error Details
Invalid SysID'

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit any web site not supported by Firefox.
2. Try to report that broken web site.
3. Fill in the field of 'Report A Broken Web Site' window and press the 'Submit Report' button.
Actual Results:
Got the 'Error Sending Report' message.

Expected Results:
Sends the report quickly.

Sometimes I spoof my user agent string and I thought this wa the cause, but with my original user agent string the issue still exists.
