doing an auto search from the location bar doesn't work for number

in the location bar, you can enter a work and it will return:
- feeling lucky result if there is one
- a set of search result
- a no result were found page

I enter a phrase "31415926" and it attempt to take me to http://31415926/ which time out. What is odd, is that if I search for "31415926" in google I get result and a feeling lucky (always take me to piratebay). Entering other number such a my ssn, a birthdate, or other size of pi "314159" return the same type of result

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. hit ctrl+l to get to the location bar
2. hit delete to clear it out
3. type "31415926"
4. press <ENTER>

Actual Results:
a timeout connecting to http://31415926

Expected Results:
a google search result (or feeling lucky) for 31415926

I have tried this in 3.0.1, 3.0.3, and 3.1b1 on windows/linux/mac and it seems to be pretty consistent.

I suspect it is google returning result differently not firefox, but this is me speculating.
