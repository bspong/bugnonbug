These are contest that all entry on a daily basis. What I have noticed is that
even though I have enabled the "Save Form Information" option when I revisit the
page to enter the contest again, sometime the stored form data is there and
sometimes it is not. I can click in the field in the form and press the
down-arrow key and sometimes the stored information for those field is
available, other time nothing happened. It seems to be somewhat random a to
when it doe or doe not work. I did notice that the emptying the cache and
restarting the browser seemed to help but that may have just been a coincidence,
a the problem is sporadic in nature.
