After setting the "block pop-up windows" checkbox, and then clicking the enabled "Exceptions..." button in the Options/Content tab doe not launch it dialog. It's almost a if the dialog is itself being blocked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drill down to the Tools/Options/Content (or the Security) tab.
2. Set a checkbox associated with a button labeled "Exceptions..."
3. Click on that associated button.
Actual Results:
The button depresses but no resulting dialog is launched.

Expected Results:
A dialog to open allowing exception to be entered.

This happened immediately after I installed FireFox 3.6. I went to my web e-mail application and when attempting to click on an embedded link in the e-mail message, a new Help dialog wa launched indicating that the site wa being blocked a well a providing the step needed to add the site a an exception.
I have tried it many time in different scenario with the same results.
