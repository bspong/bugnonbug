This occurs with multiple elements, I tried turning on caret browsing for kick and experienced same results. I wa unable to find this bug anywhere else, though I am sure it is here. Could you create another category for Accessibility?

Now low vision user who use magnifier can use Firefox. Just imagine if every time you began typing in your application it instantly went to the top of the page. This is critical for low vision accessibility.
