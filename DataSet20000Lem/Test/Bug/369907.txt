In some site where I have a personal account like <http://netclub.fr/> or <http://www.bouyguestelecom.fr/> some .ASP web page are not opened.

Depending of the site I have a dialog box to ask me what I want to do : Save on the disk or Open withe Active Server Document (defaut). With other web site this dialog box doesn't appeared and Dreamweaver try to open it but there is no way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Problem to explain this : it is personal account and this typical ASP page is very private.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
My MacOSX identify the .ASP file to be open by Dreamweaver (because I have Dreamweaver software on my mac)... and then this issue is bad : the OS work slowly and after 1 or 2 minute to try launch Dreamweaver MacOS is blocked (it is not a kernel panic but the mac is totally busy and blocked, no more way).

Expected Results:
Normally the same clic - tested with Opera and Safari - is opening the .asp web page, why not with FireFox... ?

My MacOS X is MacOS 10.2.8

My bug is like <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=321524> but if I'm trying to save the ASP file with the HTML extension... it is not a HTML file (no HTML tags).
