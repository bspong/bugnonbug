Password manager offer to remember proxy authentication info on startup page

When I started up 3.0.8 for the first time, the browser went through the phase of checking all addons for compatibility. This required providing the proxy authentication name and password. After getting through startup the browser had my home page and the "Firefox Updated" page open in two tabs. On each tab, the browser wa offering "Should Firefox remember this password?" on the bar at the top of the tab. Presumably this is referring to the proxy authentication password, but it is not correct to remember that associated with whatever happens to be open in the tab where Firefox start up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use authenticating proxy.
2. Start new Firefox forcing addon compatibility check.
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox offer to remember proxy authentication password on all open tabs.

Expected Results:
Offer to remember proxy authentication password in separate dialog or not at all.
