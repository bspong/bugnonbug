After viewing embedded virtual earth map (safe mode, no plugins enabled) on realtor.com, I get 100% cpu usage and firefox flash a message in the status bar every so often saying that it is getting data from dev.virtualearth.net. I have to close the browser or everything get real slow.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to realtor.com, find a house that ha neighborhood info tab (not all housing listing do).
2. Click on neighborhood info and then get 'birds eye view'.
3. Zoom in and out, rotate, then click on listing detail
4. View a few picture of the house (click on different picture on the left, if the house doe not have pictures, then pick a different listing and go back to step 1).
5. Click on map and direction tab at top and bring up satellite view
6. Move around the map a bit
7. Go back to listing detail and view some more picture of the house

Not all step are probably necessary, but this is how I reproduce it every time. You will notice on the bottom that the status bar flash a message saying that it is getting data from dev.virtualearth.net every once in a while.

Actual Results:
100% cpu usage. Cannot browse, must reboot. You can see firefox in task manager using all the CPU. It will keep it at 100% CPU until you close all browser windows.

Expected Results:
Not constant 100% cpu usage

No plugins are activated, so I don't know how this thing works. I think you can even click on file->new window, and close the realtor.com window, and the 100% cpu usage continues on. You have to actually close all browser instance to get back your CPU.
