AOL WebMail's message box no longer respond to mouse event
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.8

Whenever an e-mail is sent, or e-mail is sent to the Spam folder or back into
New item from the Spam folder, a message box is generated inside the web page
and prevents you from clicking anything else on the page. This box contains an
'x' box in the upper-right corner, and an "OK" button. Usually, and up through
Firefox 0.8, both of those function closed the dialog box a they should have.
It is only now using Firefox 0.9 that I've had this problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to webmail.aol.com (if you have an AOL account)
2.Compose and send an e-mail to yourself to generate one of the message boxes.
3.Try clicking the boxes' "X" or the OK button. (you can still close the window
with the normal OS-provided close button)
4.Refresh the inbox and send your message to the Spam folder to generate another
message box. Try closing that box with the provided controls.


Actual Results:
For the e-mail confirmation, it fails to close the "Write Mail" window, which
can be manually accomplished with the handy close button. However, the other
message box's disability prevents you from using WebMail any further until you
reload and re-sign in.

Expected Results:
In the former case, it should have closed the Write Mail window. In the latter,
it should have just closed the box and allowed you to read your other e-mails.

Remember: Worked in 0.8, doesn't in 0.9
