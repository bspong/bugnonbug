Page up and page down, arrow key randomly stop working unless I switch to another window first

since the latest update to Firefox, I randomly get an error where I can not scroll up or down using the page up, page down, or arrow key on my keyboard. I can scroll down using the space bar, or using my mouse. Fixing the problem seems to require activating a window in another program first, then switching back to Firefox (with an actual click inside the firefox window). I'm seeing this error on multiple machines. It seems to occur when I open a new firefox window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new Firefox window to a page that requires scrolling (say, nytimes.com). The page that initially open in Firefox doe not have to require scrolling. For example. opening Google.com, then switching to nytimes.com still demonstrates the problem.

2. Try to scroll with page up/down or up/down arrow keys. (Space bar scrolling should work.

3. If the scrolling doe not work, click in a window for a different program, then click in the Firefox window. Scrolling should work once again.
Actual Results:
Keyboard up/down scrolling won't work until you click in another program's window. Side to side scrolling does.

Expected Results:
scrolling up and down should work properly.
