When an image that ha been included inline a an object is above a certain size
threshhold, bringing up the Element Properties dialog box (right click and
select Properties from the context menu) cause the entire system to hang. A
slightly smaller image doe not cause this to happen. As far a I can tell, the
threshhold above which this occurs is somewhere around 48KB.

It appears that since the data attribute of the object tag is used a the
"location" of the element, more than 48K of data cause a buffer to overflow
when the location is displayed in the Element Properties dialog. The Media tab
of the Page Info is similarly affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://jon.x13designs.com/firefox_crash.html
2. Right click on the second image (the one with the geometric shapes).
3. Select Properties from the context menu.


Actual Results:
The Element Properties dialog pop up, but without any control rendered. At
this point, the entire system is completely locked up.

Expected Results:
The Element Properties dialog should open.

I am marking this a security problem since it appears that the problem is a
buffer overflow.
