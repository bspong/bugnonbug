I use a custom tree view in a XUL project which run a a FF extension for an inhouse application. The tree is moved from one location to another, with the view being reset after the move to ensure it's visibility in the new location. This worked in 1.5 and 2.0 but no longer work in 3.0 (tried b1 -> b4). The moving is simple:

newParent.appendChild(treeElement);
treeElement.view = treeView;


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run http://demeter.vegcrew.net/~ewaters/tree_bug_ff3.xul with full chrome permission (I did so by running it in my installed extension).
2. Click the button "Collapse to toolbar".
3. See if the data of the tree remains visible.
Actual Results:
In 3.0, the tree appears to move but the content doesn't reappear.

Expected Results:
In 2.0.0.12, it will move the tree with content underneath the label "Below is the hidden toolbar" and back again, keeping the content visible.

The test wa performed in a relatively empty profile, setup for development purposes.
