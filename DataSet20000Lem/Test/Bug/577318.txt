Intermittent issue, several image link example from many web pages, but Google image search is typical.

If an image is clicked to select it, the browser often close (all browser window if several are open) with no crash message or report. Relaunch usually restores the session, bug is repeated.

Of particular note, if a right click is used instead of a left click, and "open in new tab" is selected, the link work without issue.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse for image in Google (other image link do this too in other sites)
2. Left click an image to select it
3. Browser close without crash report
4. Try again, use right click/open in new tab...no problem
Actual Results:
Browser close without a crash report on left click navigating from an image, like those on Google's image search (but many other image link from other pages). Problem is not always, but frequently doe this.

Expected Results:
Expect the link to navigate to a new page of the selected image.

I'm using XP x64 with SP2 and current Microsoft update applied. Issue appeared to my notice first in earlier 3.6.x version of Firefox - never noticed it in prior versions.

Also tried this in a VM of Vista and Windows 7 (VMWare - I'm a developer, several OS installation for various application development, research and testing) - the problem seems to occur in 32bit OS version and 64 bit versions, haven't been able to reproduce the bug in Linux (Ubuntu, 32 bit), but a the issue is intermittent I can't say that's evidence it doesn't happen there.
