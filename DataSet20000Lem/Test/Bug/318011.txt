While waiting for a requested web page to load in a new tab, if I expand a live bookmark (open it from the bookmark toolbar like a dropdown menu) and then a "Confirm Cookie Setting" dialog box open (due to the earlier requested web page) - Firefox freeze and I have no way of killing it, and no way to continue using my computer - both the keyboard and mouse button are ignored. I have waited a long a an hour before giving and killing the Firefox process from another terminal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Background: set Firefox to prompt you before setting cookies. In "Preferences" dialog, select "Privacy", expand "Cookies", check "Allow site to set cookies" check box, beside "Keep Cookies", select "Ask me every time", click "OK" in "Preferences" dialog. Continue browsing the web, allowing or denying cooky when the "Confirm Cookie Setting" dialog appears.

To freeze Firefox and disable all input (mouse and keyboard):

1.
Click on live bookmark in bookmark tool bar. Live bookmark expands and look like a drop-down menu.

2.
Richt-click on one of the item in the expanded live bookmark. A context menu opens.

3.
In that context menu, click on "Open in New Tab". A new tab open and focus switch to that tab, momentarily blank before/while the web page is rendered.

4.
While the page is blank/being rendered, click on live bookmark in bookmark toolbar. Live bookmark expands and look like a drop-down menu.

5.
Repeat step 2 through 4 until, after expanding a live bookmark from the bookmark toolbar, a page which is being rendered in the meantime in a new tab cause a "Confirm Cookie Setting" dialog to be displayed.




Actual Results:
The "Confirm Cookie Setting" dialog is displayed under the expanded live bookmark.

Clicking any keyboard on the keyboard or any button on the mouse, ha no effect. I can't cannot "Allow" the cookie. I can't "Deny" the cookie. I can't close the expanded live bookmark to reveal either the "Allow" or "Deny" bottons on the "Confirm Cookie Setting" dialog box. I can't open a new tab. I can't close any of the open tabs. I can't close the Firefox window. I can't switch to any other open window. I can't start a command prompt to kill the Firefox process. Keyboard is out. My only solution so far is use a seperate computer to access the first by ssh and kill the Firefox process.

Expected Results:
The "Confirm Cookie Setting" dialog should be display on top of the expanded live bookmark. I should be able to click on one of the dialog button to dismiss and then have access to the still-expanded live bookmark.

Running on KDE 3.3.0. Default Firefox theme.
