Permit plugins to interact with user

Please permit plugins to interact with user.

Firefox routinely hang when a plugin - routinely QuickTime - is waiting for a
response from a user. Firefox prevents the dialog from being visible, thus a
response cannot be provided, and Firefox remains unresponsive and must be
forcefully terminated.

In the past I have noticed this problem even with some of Firefox's own dialog
hanging the browser.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install QuickTime 6.5.2, but accept only the default addons
2. Visit http://www.hummingbirds.net/midi/midi.html
3. Click on one of the MIDI link under "Organ:"
4. Firefox should have hung by now.
5. Try the same link in Internet Explorer. Notice that you DO get a QuickTime
prompt to install some additional modules.

Actual Results:
Firefox doe not allow visibility and user interaction with plugin-generated
prompts.


Expected Results:
Behavior should be similar to that of IE, in that the prompt should be visible
and permit user interaction.


I realize that many problem related to this shortcoming have been reported
before. Therefore I am reporting this a an enhancement request. If the
developer support this, many of the related bug report should eventually stop.
