Disable "View Background Image" in context menu for stand-alone video content (Firefox)
Originally filed for SeaMonkey:

+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #729633 +++

Recently the layout for displaying stand-alone image or video ha been changed (likely in Toolkit, so maybe some change wa missing that SeaMonkey yet need to port), showing the content now centered on dark background.

For videos, the background contains a texture which is treated a a background image and coincidentally can be viewed in isolation. The suggestion is (similar to the disabled "Page Info" menu item) to disable "View Background Image" in the context menu in this mode.

Steps to reproduce:
- Open an OGG or WebM video file or stream
- place cursor outside the video content
- right-click to get the context menu
- select "View Background Image"
- video stops, a small texture image is displayed
- location bar show "data:image/png..."

Not a big deal, but irritating if hit accidentally. As a workaround, the background image could simply be overridden by the themes, also given that it's apparently not used when viewing stand-alone image (inconsistent).

I don't see any immediate fix when looking at the SeaMonkey implementation, specifically where to get the context from that it's a stand-alone video content, thus filing for Firefox in parallel a suggested.
