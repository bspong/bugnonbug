for several day i have observed a full crash of firefox anytime the page being viewed is displaying a .pdf document. The tab disappear and a dialog box come up asking if i want to send the error report and i click yes, have done this 5 time or so in the past couple days. i wa opening a pdf document on a web page, it show the first pdf page just fine, i wa on another tab typing an email when it all went away. everything i had typed, gone.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.rollanet.org/~eksi/2008EPHEM.pdf
2. mozilla browser crash
3.

Actual Results:
after several second the browser crash and a screen say an error occured, do you want to send data to mozilla. This ha happened on ANY page i have tried that is showing a PDF document

Expected Results:
past version of mozilla show the pdf document just fine, a doe ie and chrome

It should give a dialog screen saying that an update for adobe .pdf viewer is needed, click <HERE> to get and install the update, then restart firefox to apply changes.

Im guessing that when the pdf is opened, it expects that adobe acrobat reader will open and handle putting the object into the browser, but it doesnt happen and hand off control to some invalid or null pointer.
