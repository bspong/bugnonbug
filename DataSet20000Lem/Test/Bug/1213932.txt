Service Worker log in webconsole show up in all tab (even one that aren't on the same origin a the worker)
STR:

Make sure devtools.webconsole.filter.serviceworkers is true in about:config or by checking the Logging -> Service Workers item in the webconsole

1) Open https://bgrins.github.io/devtools-demos/worker/push.html
2) Click 'init service worker'
3) Open webconsole
4) Notice a bunch of logs:
* ServiceWorker initialized [object ServiceWorkerGlobalScope]
* Handling fetch event for "https://bgrins.github.io/devtools-demos/worker/push.html"
* ..etc (a bunch more logs)
5) Reload the page and notice that one of the log is missing:
* ServiceWorker initialized [object ServiceWorkerGlobalScope]
6) Close and reopen the toolbox and notice that the same log is back
* ServiceWorker initialized [object ServiceWorkerGlobalScope]

The visible log shouldn't ever change due to closing and reopening the toolbox.

The particular log in question is running outside of any callback in the SW: https://github.com/bgrins/devtools-demos/blob/37098cda65656d028f0c2db33d9387c035d2f460/worker/push-service-worker.js#L13.

The behavior seems unpredictable too - if I close the toolbox, reload the page, reopen the toolbox enough time it seems like I see the "ServiceWorker initialized [object ServiceWorkerGlobalScope]" a varying number of time in the log (it showed up three time and one point and then after opening and closing again it showed up twice).
