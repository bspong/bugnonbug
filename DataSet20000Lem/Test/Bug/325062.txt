Site doe not display anything because browser.cache.memory.enable is set to false
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

site www.paypay.com doe not display: only a blank screen shows.

re-starting Firefox doe not affect problem.

This <i>might</i> be OK if IE did not properly display the site.

Downloading site using IE, then loading resullting file, result in proper display....

...so this side doe not seem to rely on some IE only specification (one might assume)

(I've marked this a major feature since displaying page seems to be important to some people :)

suggestion: problem in HTTP protocol?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type www.paypay.com into location field at top of browser.
2. click "go" or press "return"
3. observe a blank page

Actual Results:
uh... maybe remember to start Firefox first?

Expected Results:
blank screen (filling this out is getting a bit repetative)

[an error message of the sort "Can't access page content because...." might be a bit better.]

Displayed the site a viewed with IE... if behaving like an inferior product can be considered proper result :)
