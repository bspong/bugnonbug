I have started a new/unique firefox.exe process using the following command making use of the -no-remote command line option.

firefox -no-remote -profile "path to my custom profile" yahoo.com

Now I simply want to open a new tab in the instance of Firefox created with the above command. I have tried the following command without success...

firefox -profile "path to my custom profile" -new-tab google.com

I get the classic popup telling me that Firefox is already running. I would expect this if I tried to open a new instance/process with the same profile via the -no-remote option, but that is not what I am doing on the 2nd call a I have omitted the -no-remote option. I just want it to open a new tab in the "already running" firefox instance using the same profile referenced when calling via the -no-remote option.

Interestingly I found that if after opening firefox with a custom profile using the -no-remote I open a new instance running the default profile, then the following command will indeed open google.com in a new tab, but in my default profile and completely ignore the reference in my -profile argument...

firefox -profile "path to my custom profile" -new-tab google.com

Does anybody know how to get around this problem?
