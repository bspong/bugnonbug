This happens in WinXP a well in 3.5.5 (WinXP SP3 on VMWare Fusion on OS X 10.6) (also happened in 3.5.5 on OS X 10.6)

When printing to PDF a web page than span >1 print page, the page break is messed up so that there are several line missing from the print out.

This doe NOT happen with Chrome on WinXP or with Safari on OS X (i.e. they both print properly).

So far this problem exhibit only when printing from Guardian web pages. Maybe it ha something to do with the Guardian option to set text larger or smaller?



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to guardian.co.uk
2. pick an article of sufficient length (spans >1 print page)
3. select printable view (though I think it also exhibit from basic page)
4. file>print
4a. in WinXP, I wa using Acrobat Distiller 5 to create the pdf. (file>print select Distiller a the printer).
4b. in OS X, select PDF>save a PDF from the print dialogue.

In both case the corruption occurs. I did not test with an actual hard copy print.
Actual Results:
A readable pdf is created but there is text missing at the page breaks.

Expected Results:
the printout correctly contains all the page text.
