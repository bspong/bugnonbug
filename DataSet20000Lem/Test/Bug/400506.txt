Wrong rendering box, immediately after dynamic change div height

http://mrdummy.net/zooi/got/cal-css-2st.png
This is good rendered box, this happens when i resize FF browser window, or recalling Javascript with same height.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build a div box with almost nothing inside. It must have background color. Make it hidden with display:none. The height of div is very low (100 px or lower)
2. Make box visible with display:block when needed to see the box
3. Fill inside box with some data, some divs.
4. With Javascript i change dynamic the div style.height with more higher height value. (to fit the box around the new data, but only height)
5. See the problem.
The step 2-4 is done immediately in very short time (placed in same script)
Actual Results:
You should see the missed part in div box which is not good rendered. The FF is not closed or resized itself (which cause re-render the whole page)

Expected Results:
The box itself must fully rendered, good filled with color and nothing missed. IE doe good job, but FF failed.

You must not minimize or resize FF window. It cause re-render the page and the problem is gone. Let Javascript dynamically change the height of the div box, with Alternative Ajax method.
I have force FF to render box with small 1px move in style.left, to make whole box rendered good. But it's not nice solution.
