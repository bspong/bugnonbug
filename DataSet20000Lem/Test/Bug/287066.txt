History is useful to find page you consulted some time ago. However, when you
browse a site, the title of each page is often the same. The history result in
ten of link with the same title and no way to know which page is relevant to you.

Also, when you browse the Web, you can go through a very large number of site
and do not remember at all the title/name/URL of the site. You simply remember
some keywords related to the content of the page (e.g. firefox, block, image for
http://adblock.mozdev.org/)

A very nice functionnality would be to have an automatic indexing (as performed
by a web crawler) of the history. When you access a web page, it is added to the
history and automatically indexed for future search. When you do a fast history
search, the search is performed on the title, and also of the index database.

This bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=126621 present a solution
based on cache for mozilla. However, this solution ha many drawback
(limitation in the number of page cached, solution slower than a keyword
indexing, cache can be flushed, etc.)

Reproducible: Always
