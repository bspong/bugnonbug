This is pretty strange

To review all of the motivation here:
1) reuse code to reduce complexity
2) use a consistent interface so that user are not confused

I think everyone is on board with both of those motivations, but I'm not sure how far we go with matching the bookmark contextual dialog (the thing that hang off of the star in the location bar) in the other instance of the bookmark property dialog. Here is the list Marco gave me on irc:

1. history sidebar, right click and choose Bookmark this link
2. place view (menu, toolbar) context menu New Bookmark, New Folder
3. subscribe a livemark
4. Add keyword for this search
5. add a sidebar panel clicking on a link or through j function addPanel
6. drop a bookmark over the bookmark Library icon after customize toolbars
7. Bookmark all tab
8. Context menu property

Also, I think:
9. Library window property pane (?)
10. "Bookmark this Link" on the contextual menu of a hyperlink in the content area (screenshot in attachment).

There might be more instance of creating / editing a bookmark properties, but those are all of the one I know about.

In term of Dietrich's comment:

The bookmark contextual dialog is instant apply, and ha a click outside to dismiss behavior (the click outside to dismiss behavior is conveyed visually by referencing other interface that are click outside to dismiss).

Adapting the instant apply nature of the interface to other instance of the bookmark property dialog is fine, but carrying over click outside to dismiss behavior doesn't make any sense in the other contexts. For instance, the "Bookmark this Link" interface isn't visually associated with anything that could recreate the interface (like the star in the location bar) and it is kind of awkward in the upper left hand corner of the content area.

So I propose that we leverage some of the existing code, which mean that they will become instant apply. However, they should really remain (including the "Bookmark this Link" instance) real modal dialog boxes, with Done / Cancel buttons.

Also, the large star icon, title and "Remove bookmark" item don't need to appear in these other instance of the bookmark property interfaces, since a contextual command already set the context of what the user is doing, and there wa also a contextual delete command.

I probably still need to clarify a bunch of stuff, but what do people think of that overall approach?
