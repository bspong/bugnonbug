Floating point exception when visiting http://www.debian.org/

I don't believe that I've tried visiting Debian's site recently (since upgrading
to Firefox 1.0); when I tried to go to www.debian.org Firefox downloads enough
to set the title bar (but not display anything but white) and grab the favicon,
then crashes. The entire console session look like:

$ firefox
(QFA)Talkback error: Can't initialize.
/usr/lib/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 451: 29498 Floating point exception"$prog"
${1+"$@"}

I have clear cache, history and cookies, and have disabled every extension and
the problem still persists.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter www.debian.org in Location field
2. Watch Firefox display Debian title in window titlebar
3. Watch Firefox display favicon
4. Watch Firefox crater:-)

Actual Results:
It crashed completely, leaving no running instance.

Expected Results:
Displayed the Debian page:-)

Using the default theme. Built firefox RPM using Thomas Chung's data (Thomas
