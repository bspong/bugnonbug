I wa logging bug 488434 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=488434) and found this problem along the way.

Basically, the 'sort by name' pop-up menu becomes greyed out even within the Bookmarks context menu which work in bug 488434.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Bookmarks context menu
2. Scramble several bookmark by drag-and-drop it randomly within 'Bookmarks' context menu
3. Once done scrambling the bookmarks, right-click on either one of the first four Bookmarks sub-context menu (Bookmark This Page, Subscribe to This Page, Bookmark All Tabs, or Organize Bookmarks)

Pay attention to 'Sort by name' option in the pop-up menu.

NOTE: in case 'sort by name' work or Bookmark context menu wa closed by accident, repeat the above step once again.
Actual Results:
'Sort by name' should not be greyed-out

Expected Results:
'Sort by name' wa greyed-out

Workaround:
- close the Bookmark context menu,
- re-open again and right-click on either: Bookmark This Page, Subscribe to This Page, Bookmark All Tabs, or Organize Bookmarks,
- choose 'Sort by Name' to sort

In case 'Sort by name' doe not work, it maybe related to bug 488434 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=488434)

Side notes:
I frequently found user accidentally moved around the bookmark due to unknown reason. Re-sorting it back is one of the possible option to bring back from chaos ;)
