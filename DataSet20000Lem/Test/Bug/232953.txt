Strange behaviour with query string and PHP header location command

Developing a shopping cart, and my basket script, I notice the following bug,
which is not present in Mozilla 1.6 or IE. The basket script us a query string
to add a product to the basket, in order to prevent multiple item being added
when using browser forward/back buttons, I add a header("Location:....") command
to my php code. This directs back to the same basket page without the query
string. However, when pressing refresh or using the forward/back buttons, the
page still process the now non-existant query string.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a PHP page with an incremental count based on a query string.
2. Add a header() location command back to the same page after processing the
script.
3. Link to the page with a query string, which in turn process the query
string, then reloads the page without the query string. Refresh the page.

Actual Results:
Firebird still process a non-existant query string.

Expected Results:
Pressing F5 should refresh the page without the query string and thus have no
affect on the increment.
