When using Netvibes to read article from an RSS feed, FF3 decides to zoom-in whenever I click on a new link and make everything too large to read. I suspect that somehow FF3 think that the frame in which the story is being displayed is the same size a the whole FF3 window, but it's not. I think this might occur with any framed layout that look like what Netvibes uses. I made some screencaps that explain a bit better.

Steps:

1) Load my Consumerist feed on Netvibes. Hit Ctrl-0 to Zero my zooming.

2) Click on another story. Watch helpless a FF3 zooms-in too much!

FF3 shouldn't be zooming at all, but again I suspect that it see the drawable size a window size and not frame size, but that's just my guess.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See details.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
FF3 zoom in my frame way too far.

Expected Results:
FF3 should zoom to match the frame size and in this case, I didn't expect any zooming to occur.
