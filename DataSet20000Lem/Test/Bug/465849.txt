the content of ftp://ftp.spss.com/pub/web/drivers/sdap/datadirect/OA/win32/localodbc/ is a .exe file which downloads properly with IE6 but Firefox just see it a a link that cannot be activated. More web page than ever work with Firefox, but here is an example of non-functionality that I hope can be corrected in future releases.

Thanks,
Bob

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on ftp://ftp.spss.com/pub/web/drivers/sdap/datadirect/OA/win32/localodbc/
2.click on the link that is found on that page
3. it simply show an empty folder rather than invoking a download/activation menu
4. the link that is found on the page in step 1. doe not allow for 'save target as' right click command, but rather 'save link as' which say that the .exe file is not being properly recognized?
Actual Results:
above is self explanatory

Expected Results:
do the step above from IE and you will see that the .exe file is easily invoked (or downloaded.)

enabled downloading of the .exe file.
