To customize menu order, number 1 through 7 signify order from left to right. Customizing and adding the following code to your userChrome.css file, menu order of appearance can be changed:

1. file-menu {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 1 !important;}
2. edit-menu {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 2 !important;}
3. view-menu {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 3 !important;}
4. history-menu {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 4 !important;}
5. bookmarks-menu {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 5 !important;}
6. tools-menu {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 6 !important;}
7. helpMenu {-moz-box-ordinal-group: 7 !important;}

Except with Firefox 3, Bookmarks menu can only be moved to the left, not to the right (to 6th or 7th place).

Is this a bug?
