I cannot copy and paste a part of a comment for quoting in forum sites, i am allowed to copy and paste the entire comment, so i is not possible to quote the entire comment. How to solve that? Such problem happens many time in many differebt forum sites, especially on www.multiply.com.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.i select a text
2.copy and paste fro quoting
3.it copy and paste the entire comment, not what i selected

Actual Results:
it did not copied and pasted the selection i did, it copied and pasted the entire text, when i performed the action on IE browser, it worked all right, i could copy and paste the selected part of the text without any problem.

Expected Results:
it should copy and paste what i selected for quoting in another window, the way it used to do before when i wa working with the Mozilla 1.0.7, after i downloaded this new version, the problem started.
