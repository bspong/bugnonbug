This is not a problem for Firefox 2.0.0.16 or on Windows XP running Firefox 2.0.0.16. On the Windows XP machine running Firefox 3.0 isn't possible due to lack of ram. The Pages would never load (I've tried it and it didn't happen so I down graded to Firefox 2.0.0.16 on Windows XP) with just 256mb and only 192mbs available.
