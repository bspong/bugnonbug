Firefox 3 doe not remember that I want to add my Live Bookmark to the Bookmark Toolbar. Every time I add a Live Bookmark, the add bookmark dialogue's selection always default to Bookmark Menu instead of my last selection, which requires me to perform extra mouse click for selecting Bookmark Toolbar every time. This is different from Firefox 2, where whenever I add a Live Bookmark, it always appear on the Bookmark Toolbar without making any need of selection.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/
2. At the address bar, click the RSS icon
3. Choose either 'subscribe to Atom' or 'subscribe to RSS 2.0'
4. At the RSS page, click 'Subscribe Now' button
5. The default is to add my Live Bookmark to Bookmarks Menu
6. Change it to Bookmarks Toolbar (at this point on I assume it will be set a default)
7. Revisit http://www.michaelnygard.com/blog/ again
8. Add Live Bookmark again following step 2 to 4
Actual Results:
The default selection of place to add the Live Bookmark is still Bookmarks Menu not Live Bookmark Toolbar

Expected Results:
At step 8, I expected Bookmarks Toolbar a the default place to add my Live Bookmark

I'm using Firefox 3.0 RC2
