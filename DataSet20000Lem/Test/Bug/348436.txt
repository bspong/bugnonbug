Extensions are not able to provide toolbar button with an acceptable look [Fx 2.0]

I haven't looked into the detail of the previous theme checkins, but
with Fx20061108 (Win) it is not possible anymore for an extension to provide
a toolbarbutton which more or le will fit into different themes.

I have tried several extension: all button are aligned horribly.
No margins.

In 20061108 I found entry in browser.css like this:
=====================================================
#reload-button {
-moz-image-region: rect(0px 96px 24px 72px);
margin: 0 5px !important;
}
=====================================================

In Fx 1.5/1.0 there wa no margin specified for each single
button, allowing extension to provide a generic button fitting
more or le with different themes.
This is not possible anymore.

Okay, this wasn't working well with a lot themes, but it wa at least
a possibility to give the user a button without totally destroying
the look of a toolbar.

Is there a way to provide a toolbarbutton within an extension without
breaking "downwards-compatibility" to Fx 1.5?

The old "system" of hoping the button will fit wa bad enough,
but I think that now it is nearly impossible for an extension author
to provide an "acceptable" solution for "all".

Tested with Mouse Gestures 1.5, Button Pack 0.8.5.5, Autohide 1.1.2 and
some others. -> horrible button placement on nav-toolbar.
