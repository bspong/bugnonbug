Command-backtick is the Mac OS X keyboard shortcut to switch between window within the foreground app. In Firefox, I am unable to switch window using that method, unless I hold down the key for over 2 seconds. Holding down the key combination cause Firefox to switch rapidly between all open window a keyboard repeat kick in.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open at least two window in Firefox.
2. Press and release cmd-`.
3. Press and hold cmd-`.

Actual Results:
Does nothing in step 2. Cycles rapidly in step 3.

Expected Results:
Should switch to the next Firefox window in step 2.

I have experienced this problem in both Firefox 1.5 and BonEcho Alpha 2.

Cmd-` behaves a expected in most other applications, including all application from Apple and Camino.

I don't know if it's at all related, but I am running this on a "Dual USB" iBook with a 600MHz G3 Processor and 384MB of RAM. It is however running a fairly recent clean install of Mac OS X 10.4 without Application Enhancer or any other software which should interfere with program UI.
