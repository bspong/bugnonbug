a page with username and 2400 checkboxes load properly under window ff, window ie, mac safari, mac chrome but not under mac ff 3.16.13... it did load properly in previous version of mac ff. under 3.6.13 mac ff, now present spinning wheel and can take several minute to load. normal load time previously wa le than several seconds. load time for other browers are normal. web server is not affected, but local mac ff browser go to 100% cpu when tried on page with 2400 names/checkboxes.

haven't done any test to see at what point it fails, but page with le checkboxes do load properly in mac ff 3.6.13. it's only the page with lot of checkboxes (2400 will show the problem)

if i remove the checkbox code, leaving just name/email... it load fine, albeit a little slower (3-4 seconds) than other browser which load everything, 2400 names/email/box in le than 3 seconds. previous mac ff browser also loaded all in under 3.

all run on macbook pro (windows running with parallels)

hope this helps. please let me know if additional data would be helpful, thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. haven't stripped our code, but make a page with 50 char name and checkboxes
2. if 2400 record are tried, fails on my system
3.
Actual Results:
spinning wheel... eventually load

Expected Results:
should load 2400 names/checkboxes in several second

within our html page, this code put up spinning wheel when there are 2400 record involved. userlist is a list of 2400 name

<input type=checkbox name=user<@currow> value="Yes"> @@local$userlist[<@currow>,2]<br>


this code work (no checkboxes)
@@local$userlist[<@currow>,2]<br>

only mac ff 3.6.13 produce spinning wheel with first code previous version of mac ff and all other browser work a expected.

the page that produce this problem are not publicly available.
