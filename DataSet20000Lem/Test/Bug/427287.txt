crash on startup for xulrunner-dependent apps on Vista x64

For each of the following programs, launching (including attempt to launch into -safe-mode or the profile manager) lead to the "XXX had a problem and crashed" window without ever opening the software's main window. I've tried running in compatibility mode, uninstalling and reinstalling, deleting profile folders. I didn't see this problem until after installing Vista SP1, but wa not at the computer much around that install and can't be sure about the timing.
* Firefox 3 beta 3 - 5 (I never used beta 1 or 2)
* Songbird release candidate and beta up to 0.5
* Flickr Uploadr
Software that continues to work fine:
* Emusic remote manager
* Firefox 2.0.0.x

This is possibly a duplicate of https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=386826 , but much of the discussion on that thread is over my head. Speaking of my lack of proficiency, I may need some explicit instruction on how to provide any debugging report that may be helpful. I'm not sure that not being able to run beta or the Flickr uploadr is a critical issue, but I'm a bit concerned that when Firefox 3 come out of beta I'll get left behind.

Below is a crash report from a recent attempt to launch Songbird 0.5. I'll return and post a report from a failed Firefox 3b5 launch momentarily.
