When a block (div) is set to render column (using -moz-column-width) with column rule (using -moz-column-rule) the setting of overflow: directly affect the display of the rule line in way that the web-kit version (using -webkit-columns and -webkit-column-gap) are not affected.

With overflow:visible the rule line appear a expected. With either overflow:auto, overflow:hidden and overflow:scroll the rule line are not displayed whatsoever (also, the layout of the page slightly changes).

In web-kit based browser the line always display (if not always in the right place if "auto" is used!) and the layout never changes.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the example page (http://www.davidviner.com/rule0.html) which is displaying using overflow:visible to see the rule line displayed.
2. Try the alternative via the link at the bottom of the example page which only differ by the overflow: settings.
3. Compare by using the same page on web-kit based browser (Safari, Chrome).
Actual Results:
In Gecko the rule line are not displayed when overflow: is set to anything other than "visible" (I also checked "scroll", "hidden", "auto" none of which display the line - with "inherit" on the test code it responded a "visible" but I suspect this really depends upon exactly what it is inheriting from). When the rule line are not displayed, the layout of the displayed text also change when compared to when the line are displayed.



Expected Results:
Should not have changed the display at all with the different overflow settings.

I have checked this using both FireFox 3.5 (under Windows XP) and Minefield 3.6a1pre (under Windows 7 RC1) obtaining the same result in both cases.

The web-kit based browser used for comparison were:
Chrome 2.0.172.33
Chrome 3.0.191.3
Safari 4.0.2
