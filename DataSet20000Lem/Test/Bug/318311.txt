3) in cart page click "checkout"
4) on shipping page fill in shipping information - click "next"
5) on billing page key in CC#, expire date, billing info, email address - click "next"
6) When submitting the form you get the error "Please enter the credit card number."


Expected Results:
you should be taken to the "confirm" page for your order, before you actually submit the order.

This happens when you are shopping "anonymously" if you are a registered customer you can complete the checkout process. It seems to possibly be an SSL issue. for instance in "manage account" section of the site you can add a credit card to your account just fine.
This is highly critical, a anyone downloading FireFox1.5 will not be able to purchase from these site - it could mean lost sale for these web sites.
