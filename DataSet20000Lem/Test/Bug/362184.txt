Chinese font problem under Mac OS platform

If using a different font setting of Chinese character other than "»ªÎÄºÚÌå"(the default font of Mac OS X Chinese version), some web page would turned out to be unreadable.
Whenever I started my computer and then open Firefox 2, font set to something other than the default Chinese font of Mac, if I visit a major search engine website like Google/Baidu, the webpage usually became messed up with some symbol and marks.
And in some cases, any website I visit would be full of such things.
This happens to ANY Chinese font other than the pre-installed Chinese font in Mac OS X, even though those font have been verified by Mac's Font Book program and can be properly used by any other major Mac software like Pages, Photoshop, etc.
However, whenever I restart the Firefox 2 program, everything come back to normal. But if I reboot the computer, those web page become a mess again. The problem happends ONLY during the first time I start the Firefox 2 program after booting the computer.
