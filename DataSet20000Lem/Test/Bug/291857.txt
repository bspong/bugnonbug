When clicking on a link in an email (outlook) or "Check Hotmail" in trillian,
the Firefox window opens, the page title appears in the title of the window, but
nothing else happens. This always occurs. No URL is populated in to the URL
window, nonw of the menu (File, Edit, ...) work, but the window can be closed.
This happens in 1.0.3 after upgrading from 1.0.2 where this behavior wa never
seen. I am running the default profile with 0.9.5.06 version of the googlebar.
But this problem also occurs when the gogglebar is deleted.

This problem also occurs about 50% of the time when starting Firefox from a
desktop icon using the default Firefox home page.
