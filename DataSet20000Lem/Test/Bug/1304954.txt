User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0
Build ID: 20160916101415

Steps to reproduce:

Created small .docx Microsoft Word file.
Emailed it to my own comcast.net email address.
Attempted to download the attached small .docx file by selecting path in computer directory to place it.
Download failed. Delivered error: This file contains a virus or malware. - comcast.net



Actual results:

Error message (as described above) seen. File wa NOT downloaded to designated path on computer.


Expected results:

Should have placed file there.
NOTE: I searched for similar problem and found solution at this address which worked for me, too. Solution involves re-selecting "Microsoft Word" a the default application to use for this type of files. Note 2: Microsoft Word WAS shown a the selected application to run, but, I went ahead and selected "Other" then "Microsoft Word" and APPLY and "voila" I am now able to download docx file again.
