Cache seems to occupy physical ram but should occupy hard drive space instead.

On Windows 98 with only 64 Meg of ram when Firefox is run it bog the system down and us gross amount of physical ram which brings the system almost to a halt and make window thrash the hard drive, presumably swapping stuff in and out of swap space.

When the cache setting is changed to 8 Meg from the 50 Meg there is a vast improvement in performance which appears to indicate that caching is in physical ram rather than occupying hard drive space which it should considering it is cheaper real estate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Increase cache size back up to the default.
2.
3.




Use only hard drive for cache a it is cheaper real estate, especially on system without a lot of ram of which there are no doubt many, rather than catering only for those with high end system that have physical memory to burn.

Either that, or put in a setting to set the 50 Meg to use physical ram or virtual ram (hard drive) a required or if little physical ram is detected, automatically use the hard drive for caching and not physical ram.
