Add Galeonesque search toolbar functionality

Hmm. While the toolbar to the side is an interesting idea, I find it much
better the way Galeon doe it. There is a "URL" and "SMART URL" field in the
bookmark editor; the URL is activated by pressing the favicon, while the SMART
URL is similar in functionality to the keyword search. Basically, entering,
say, "http://everything2.org/index.pl?node=%s" automatically creates a resizable
entry field (with a favicon or text button) in a special "Smart Bookmarks
Toolbar". It is possible to have any number of search engine in it--it act
just like the Bookmarks Toolbar, but with entry field that send input to %s. I
think this is a good replacement for both the small, dynamically selectable
search item on the normal toolbar, and the keyword search, and the numerous
extension that provide this. It's handy for, say, Debian user to have a smart
bookmark of "http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=%s",
a opposed to relying on the limited functionality provided by extensions.

I would imagine it wouldn't take too much work.
