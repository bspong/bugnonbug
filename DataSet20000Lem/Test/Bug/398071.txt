After the automatic upgrade to Firefox 2.0.0.7, cannot access page www.sirius.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.7

Firefox automatically upgraded to 2.0.0.7 on both a Windows XP and a Windows Vista computer. Immediately after the upgrade, on both computers, I can no longer access the page www.sirius.com . I get no error message, but rather, what look like an endless loop of attempt to access the page. The tab say "Loading" and the status bar say "waiting for www.sirius.com...", while the Progress Bar on the lower right keep repeatedly flashing blue. Note: There is no problem accessing this page on Internet Explorer, and had no problem just prior to the upgrade.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade to Firefox 2.0.0.7, from the prior auto-upgrade version.
2. Go to www.sirius.com
Actual Results:
Inability to access the page www.sirius.com. Looked like the browser wa stuck in an endless loop while trying to access the page. I received no error message, or message of any kind. The tab say "Loading" and the status bar say "waiting for www.sirius.com...", while the Progress Bar on the lower right keep repeatedly flashing blue. Note: There is no problem accessing this page on Internet Explorer, and had no problem just prior to the upgrade.

Expected Results:
Page would be accessed normally.

There is no problem accessing this page on Internet Explorer, and had no problem just prior to the upgrade.
