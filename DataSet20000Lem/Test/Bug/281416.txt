plug-in disabling should replace plug-in content with place holder

In web page with embedded plugin content, where the respective plugin is
disabled, a place holder should appear and allow for immediate viewing of the
content by clicking, much like Flashblock (http://flashblock.mozdev.org/). This
should be the behaviour for ANY plugin installed.

The main reason for this is very annoying flash add which cannot be disabled by
blocking image from certain servers, but one is still liable to want to watch
animations, or play games, etc, without having to deal with the CPU hogging and
general annoyance of flash adds.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
N/A
Actual Results:
Content simply doe not appear and cannot be made to appear by clicking.

Expected Results:
A place holder should appear so that content can selectively be viewed even if
plugins are disabled.

I imagine that this should be easy to implement by anyone that can code, simply
by following the implementation of Flashblocker and modifying the
enabling/disabling operation for the plugins.
