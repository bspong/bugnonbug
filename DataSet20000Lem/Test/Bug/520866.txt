I canceled my AOL account thinking it wa an AOL problem, but it happens with Yahoo a well. Typing word with a contraction (using the apostrophe) brings up something at the bottom of the screen called 'quick find'. You can't finish typing the email using any apostrophe until this eventually go away. I notice this bug wa reported in 2008, but not recently. I have been having this problem for several months.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type an email with a contraction in the text
2.as soon a you type an apostrophe, 'quick find' show up at the bottom of the screen in the grey area (where the word 'done' often appears).
3.You can't finish the email with apostrophe until this finally go away, often by canceling the email, closing the browser, and starting over.
Actual Results:
Does not happen every single time, but most day it does.

Expected Results:
Should be able to use the apostrophe!
