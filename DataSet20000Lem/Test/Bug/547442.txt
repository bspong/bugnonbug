Not any more for the above spec but what I notice happening is with the
antivirus integration - scan on downloads. The browse will lockup on file
downloads of any size. Disabled the option in about:config.

current hardware spec:
Dell optiplex 710
window 7 (no issue with xp or vista)

other issue a well:

DHTML forms:

Server side: return html <select>...options1..options2...</select>

client side: take string and assign to <div id="some_control">... using
getElementID('some_control").innerHTML = xmlHttp.text

update the DOM with the string.
now when submit is clicked the control returned via the XML request is not
present during the submit but it work in IE. Worked prior 3.6.

resolution wa to return a key value string via JSON and script the creation of
the form element and append them on to the control which fixed the above from
going missing during a submit.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
the field is rendered but not present during the submission of the form.
