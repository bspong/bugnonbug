I downloaded the 3.0 Firefox and installed it. The procedure seemed to go correctly until I reached the final stage which offer the option of running Firefox. Nothing happened --- no fault message - nothing. I then went to the firefox.exe and instructed it to Open -- Nothing I instructed Windows (XP) to run the same file ... No response. Multiple try of other thing .... Finally,
I then went to Opera and downloaded the 2.0 version of Firefox, installed it and got back on the Internet with no trouble at all. That is, except for the hassle of evicting the new version and replacing it with the older version.
The upgraded version of Firefox simply would not run. Please tell me why not?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I even went thru the procedure of downloading a new copy and reinstalling the Firefox 3.0 version with the same result.
Sorry I can't provide more specific but if the browser won't load and run --- how would I know why not?

2.
3.


Expected Results:
Your kidding .... I never had a problem installing any part of the Firefox browser, options, etc. I expected to get directly back on the Internet. I had to load Opera, just to retrieve the original Firefox.

The install procedure should tell me what ha gone wrong.
