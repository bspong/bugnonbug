Help > About Firefox Developer Edition

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS / 'uname -a':
Linux XXXXXXXX 3.13.0-39-generic #66-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 28 13:30:27 UTC 2014 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I configured my Ubuntu install to use Aurora instead of Firefox, a per these instructions:
http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/ppa/firefox_aurora

The morning of the Developer Edition's announcement, I unlocked my laptop and found a (**beautiful**, BTW) new DevEd browser window open on my desktop. My previous instance of Aurora wa still running, so I closed DevEd, then closed Aurora, then clicked on the new DevEd icon, and selected my old Aurora profile.

DevEd restored my session fine and everything is working properly.

But I've noticed that when I middle-click on the DevEd icon in Ubuntu's taskbar, that the new browser window open with the following URL:

chrome://branding/locale/browserconfig.properties
