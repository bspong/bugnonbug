With firefox > 3.7a3 opening an email message in Gmail doesn't open at the top of the page, i.e. the scroll bar isn't at the top, a it should be when clicking an email message.

This problem seems to happen when I have a long list of emails, e.g. a 100 emails, when I scroll down in the page and click an email at the bottom, the message open with the scroll bar not at the top. It doesn't happen the first time, but with all subsequent email message opening.

This happens when both clicking back or pressing "u" to go back to the list of emails.

I have gtk+2.0-2.20.0 and running the x86_64 nightly build, up-to-date a of 23 of Feb. 2010.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to gmail account page
2. make sure you have a long list of emails, open a couple at the top
3. scroll down and open an email, I notice that it doesn't open at the top

If I go back, then go forward the email message open at the top a expected.
