"Bookmark this page" behavior very non-intuitive

When attempting to bookmark a page, Firefox's behavior deviate significantly
and very unintuitively from normal browser behavior. By bringing up a window
asking where to save the bookmark, it force another step in the process of
bookmarking a page that is completely unnecessary, and in fact very harmful the
way it's done right now.

The default selection of folder for where to save the bookmark is always
'Bookmarks toolbar folder'. Any user hitting enter or 'add' to try to bypass
this new and unnecessary dialog will have their bookmark dropped in this folder,
which place the bookmark in the toolbar under the menu. This is decidedly NOT
where the user intended to place the bookmark.

In order to accomplish what user have been doing forever, one ha to first know
the difference between "Bookmarks toolbar folder" and plain "Bookmarks", which
itself make no sense simply because "Bookmarks" is in fact the strict parent of
all the other folder listed in the given dropdown, and not a sibling. Once one
get past this logical problem, you have to actively go and fix the selection
before hitting "Add".

The most basic fix is to a) move "Bookmarks" to the top of the dropdown list and
visually separate it from it child folder with a horizontal line and optional
indentation of the child a per all other folder views, and b) make
"Bookmarks" the default choice at all times.

A much more user-friendly approach that retains the behavior that user have
expected and received from browser for a very long time now is to make the
normal "Bookmark this page" command do exactly what it say it will, and place
the bookmark where it is expected to go, specifically at the bottom of the
primary bookmark list.

The ability to place the bookmark in any folder can be done either with a
secondary command "Bookmark in..." a per Netscape 4.x, or with a secondary
"Bookmark in..." submenu a per Mozilla ~1.x.

Fundamentally, user should not be force to make a choice that a) they never had
to in the past, and b) is unnecessary to make. Especially important is that if
such a choice ABSOLUTELY MUST NO MATTER WHAT be force upon the user (which this
definitely doe NOT classify as), then the default must be sane, which they are
currently not.

Almost any user attempting to switch from IE to Firefox is going to run into and
be severely annoyed by this behavior.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose "Bookmark this page" from the Bookmarks menu.
Actual Results:
A dialog appears asking me where to place the bookmark, with the default
location being completely wrong

Expected Results:
No dialog at all should appear, the bookmark should be put where I want it: at
the bottom of my list of bookmarks. If I want to put the bookmark somewhere
special, that is an exceptional operation and therefore must be treated and
presented a such.
