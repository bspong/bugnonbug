Floating container are SOMETIME break down in Firefox instead of other browser
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have two column div with float left that wrapped with another div with style width=100% and display:table.
The two divs inside it ha float:left. And for first div I set width: 49% meanwhile for the second div I set width: 50%.

SOMETIME the second div is break down bellow the first div. And the strange is:
I have firebug and I inspect element for second div, I disable float:left on it and then set back float:left on second div. And now the second div show correctly, it placed floating exactly on the left first div.

NOTE: I don't change the width at all, so there is no problem with the width.

I have prepared simple running sample for you which you can download at http://www.intersoftpt.com/tdn/downloads/FirefoxRenderIssue.zip

2.Check the screenshots from attached file and run the sample then.
3.If the issue can be reproduced try to refresh the page using CRTL+R or CTRL+F5 until the issue can be reproduce.
Actual Results:
The floating div sometime go down, check screenshot1.png, screenshot2.png from http://www.intersoftpt.com/tdn/downloads/FirefoxRenderIssue.zip

Expected Results:
the floating div rendered correctly, check expectedResult.png from http://www.intersoftpt.com/tdn/downloads/FirefoxRenderIssue.zip

So far I make workaround using javascript. So when the float container is break down I set float:none and then use setTimeout to set float:left after 10ms.
It is impossible to create workaround for all floating div scenarios. So I suggest Firefox dev team can fix this issue immediately. I really appreciate if it can be fixed in the next released build version.

Thanks Dicky.
