removing 127.0.0.1 from the list of proxy exclusion cause reference to that IP to be relative to the proxy-server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050513 Fedora/1.0.4-1.3.1 Firefox/1.0.4

I never really understood why default profile always included 127.0.0.1 and
localhost in the list of proxy exclusions. Then I found out from one of our
user that http://127.0.0.1/ brought up a page they weren't expecting, which in
fact turned out to be the root page of our proxy-server.

I don't know if this is intentional, but if it _is_, what is the reasoning for
this? It would be nice if a user wa able to enable/disable local intranet
address from being accessed via the proxy using a checkbox, rather than having
to explicitly list "localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.0/24, 10.0.0.0/8".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Remove 127.0.0.1 from list of proxy exclusion
2. Make sure browser is set up to use a proxy
3. Make sure proxy is serving web page
4. Set URL to http://127.0.0.1/
Actual Results:
Loaded web page being served by proxy server

Expected Results:
Load web page being served by local host.
