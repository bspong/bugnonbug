NTLM auth not working for extension in Minefield

I use Firefox in our intranet environment. That mean that I rely on the functionality of (automatic) NTLM authentication to access all stuff that is in the intranet. This work fine for Firefox 2.x but with recent Minefield build I run into an issue.

example:

I have an address for a webservice: http://it.mycompany.com/WebService

I can open this address in Firefox 2 and Minefield without getting asked for my NT password. That is fine.

Now, I have an Firefox-Extension that us the webservice to pull data (SOAP) and do something to it. This extension doe also work fine in Firefox 2.


Watching the traffic I see that every call to the given address result in
- a first non-authenticated call that return a 401 and asks the browser to authenticate
- a second call where Firefox/the extension sends NTLM auth data along with the request and finally get the response


But when the extension is used in minefield it doe try to call the address, get the first 401 response and stops. It doe not issue the second request.


Note again that in Minefield it doe work but not in the extension running in Minefield

Also, it make no difference whether I use automated NTLM ("network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris" set to "it.mycompany.com") or have the auth dialog come up ("network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris" not set)

Reproducible: Always
