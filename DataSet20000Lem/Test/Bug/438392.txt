I have a suckerfish nav - that go over everything in FF - except window real medium - - apparently this is a common problem. Are there plan to fix this - Windows ha its' own - which of course only work for IE.x

for example this work in IE <param>

there is nothing for FF

obviously the solution I need would require nothing to be downloaded on the browser part

you can see an example of what I am talking about her:

(notice in FF the dropdown go "under" the window media.

thanks
