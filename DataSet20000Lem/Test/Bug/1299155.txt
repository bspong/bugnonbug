Can't access techblog.netflix.com, mis-redirect to http
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160819105407

Steps to reproduce:

Using Firefox 48 I can't access anything from http://techblog.netflix.com, for example:
http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/08/a-large-scale-comparison-of-x264-x265.html

Browser always get redirected to https:// url (https://techblog.netflix.com/2016/08/a-large-scale-comparison-of-x264-x265.html), which won't work:

"Secure Connection Failed
The connection to techblog.netflix.com wa interrupted while the page wa loading."



Actual results:

Firefox 48 somehow us https:// url even when it is given plain http:// url.


Expected results:

Firefox 47 doe NOT get redirected to https:// url, so using Firefox 47 it is actually possible to browse and read http://techblog.netflix.com .

techblog.netflix.com seems to be a CNAME to ghs.google.com .. is this somehow part of the problem?

I used tcpdump/wireshark to see what's happening and it seems Firefox 48 browser doesn't even try to use http when given http url to that site, already the first connection is made using http / 443..

What might cause this?
