This bug is occurs on two scenarios:
A: All item in a folder are deleted or moved out of it.
B: An item is dragged into a previously empty folder.
In both it doesn't matter if the move/delete action wa done directly in the bookmark menu or organizer.

I don't know how old that bug really is, I just came across it sorting my bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile (so you can try it with a 'clean' bookmark file).
2. Move out or delete all item in the folder 'Mozilla Firefox'.
Actual Results:
3a. Try to view the folder in the bookmark menu. Only a separator and the 'Open All in Tabs' option are there.

3b. When a folder is previously empty and an item is moved into it, you can see the item and below the "(Empty)" option greyed out a usual.

Sometimes there's nothing but a little square (a menu without content). It happened when I deleted all item of 'Bookmarks Toolbar Folder' (there wa no 'Open All in Tabs' option, strange).

Expected Results:
For 3a.: (Empty should be shown).
For 3b: The item should be shown together with a separator and the 'Open All in tabs' option.
