Mozilla: courier > monospacer; IE 6.0: monospace > courier

When "font-family:courier" is specified in the style, it seems that Mozilla
display the text in courier font with the point size specified for serifs. This
result in big text, since courier 10 is bigger than time 10. When font-family
is "monospace" Mozilla honor monospace font size specified in options, and the
text look fine.

IE ha different behavior. When font family is "courier", it try to find point
size, such that actual character height more or le match that of serifs.
When font family is "monospace", it display the text in courier font with the
reguilar point size, resulting in huge text.

This make problematic writing a page with courier that look good in both IE
and Mozilla. If I set font family "monospace", text is OK in Mozilla, but big in
IE. If I set family "courier", text is OK in IE, but huge in Mozilla.

If "courier" wa treated the same a monospace, I could just set font faily to
"courier" and leave it alone.
