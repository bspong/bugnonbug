Firefox freeze Winamp if Winamp is playing audio from a mapped drive when Firefox is opened.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Firefox/0.9.2

I have a mapped drive to my file server which is where I store all of my MP3's.
If Winamp is playing when Firefox is opened Winamp freeze completely. After 30
second it is possible to click the play button in Winamp and it will restart to
play the song. Winamp is fine after that, unless Firefox is closed and reopened.
This doe not occur if Winamp is playing a local file. I am not sure if this is
a Firefox bug or a Winamp bug, so I am filing a bug report both places. I am
using Winamp v5.04.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox v0.9.2 on a Windows XP Professional build 2600.
2.Install all of the latest patch for Windows XP Professional
3.Install Winamp v5.04 on the Windows XP Professional workstation.
4.Map a drive from the Windows XP Professional workstation to a remote
workstation/server.
5.On the remote workstation/server place an MP3 file in the share that is mapped
from the other workstation.
6. From the local Windows XP Professional workstation play the file on the
remote workstation/server.
7. After the song is playing, open Firefox.

Actual Results:
Winamp completely freezes, will not respond at all for approx 30 seconds. After
30 second Winamp is no longer hung, however the song will not play until it is
manually stopped and restarted. Winamp doe not need to be closed and reopend.

Expected Results:
Winamp should have played a normal. Firefox is the only program that cause
this to happen.

I have 512MB of RAM and no page file.
