I'm working trying to make apache forward request to a given location to a
Outlook Web Access service.

After having spent some time working on it, I wa finally able to make it "look
like" it wa a OWA service itself (using mod_proxy and mod_proxy_html)...
however, I did notice that the INBOX, and CONTACTS, and the CALENDAR weren't
working. After having studied the link for a while I noticed that they were
starting with "./"... and then firefox wa "going back" a path level... like it
wa ../

I tested with konqueror, and it worked fine. So... who's to blame? the ./ of
course. :-) right?

I just noticed that the same happens with mozilla (a rather old version:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040115)

And Internet Explorer doesn't even display the main page after authenticating.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a apache forward location to display OWA. (mod_proxy and mod_proxy_html)
2. Authenticate with the OWA service.

Actual Results:
The link starting with ./ were being treated like they were ../

Expected Results:
treat the ./ to stay in that same directory
