After JAVA 2 is installed, the plugin fails to work. Additionally , what used to work in Windows Explorer also cease working
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Firefox showed a missing JAVA Applet. Icon wa clicked on to obtain JAVA2. It
wa installed but the applet still fails to work after installation. The coffe
cup incon appears where text should be. Additionally, the installation of JAVA2
also caused Microsoft Internet Explorer apletts to cease functioning. The same
coffe cup icon appears but applet do not work. Once JAVA2 is removed, Internet
Explorer work but Firefox still doesn't work. Internet Explorer is version
6.0.2900_xpsp2_rc2_.040610-1520. Problem existed even prior to installing the
beta2 of SP2 for XP.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Installed JAVA2 and ran both browser which failed to work.
2. Uninstalled JAVA2. Firefox doe not work but Explorer does.
3. Re-installed JAVA2 and both failed again.

Actual Results:
Firefox wa never able to successfully run the JAVA2 applets. The coffee cup
icon appreaed in place of the text. Internet Explorer produced the same result
until JAVA2 wa uninstalled and it then functioned properly.

Expected Results:
When the JAVA applet wa installed, an interactive text page should have
appeared allowing entry into various menu of the web page. Instead, there were
no text hyperlink at all.

As I stated earlier, I am running the BETA2 of XP SP2 but the problem is
reproducable on a non SP2 machine so it is not SP2. Definitely appears to be a
JAVA2 problem with both Firefox and Internet Explorer.

This bug doe prevent me from using Firefox a my sole web browser. I have to
use Internet Explorer when Ineed to access web page requiring (certain?)JAVA
applets.
