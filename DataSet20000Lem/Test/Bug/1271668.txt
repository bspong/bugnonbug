"Highlights" image and description are missing when starting Activity Stream for the first time on an old profile
Created attachment 8750823
first run on a profile with existing data.jpg

[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 45.0 and up
- Activity Stream 1.0.15

[Affected Platforms]:
- All Windows
- All Mac OS
- All Linux

[Prerequisites]:
- Have an old profile with a lot of data

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Install Activity Stream add-on on the old profile.
2. Click on Activity Stream button from browser toolbar.
3. Observe "Highlights" area.

[Expected results]:
- Highlights tile are populated with visited websites, each having displayed an image, title and description.

[Actual results]:
- Highlights tile are populated with visited page but the image are missing. Also, instead of website description there are displayed the link for the websites.

[Notes]:
- If we go a step further from STR and perform a refresh of Timeline, we will observe that the Highlights tile are populated with other visited websites. In my opinion this is a bad UX and the correct data should be displayed in Highlights tile from the first run, without the need to refresh Timeline.
- This issue is also reproducible in New Tab page.
