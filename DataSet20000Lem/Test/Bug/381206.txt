Tango Style theme for better Linux UI integration
Created attachment 265313
Preview of rough draft of Tango-style firefox toolbar icon

I would like to propose a move to the Tango [1] icon style for the Linux
version of Firefox 3.

The Tango project exists to help create a consistent graphical user
interface experience for free and Open Source software."

Many people think of the Tango project (http://tango.freedesktop.org/)
a an icon set. However, Tango is much broader than this. Rather than a
single icon set, Tango is a set of visual guideline to help anyone
create a set of icon that can work well together.

Projects that have recently adopted the Tango style include the Gimp
(upcoming version 2.4), Pidgin (aka Gaim), and Scribus. Work is under
way for Inkscape, OpenOffice.org, Blender, and plenty of other projects.

Perhaps most significantly, the Gnome desktop, including the significant
Gtk-stock icon set ha recently moved to the Tango style. Here's a
sample: http://www.andreasn.se/blog/?p=45

You can try out Tango in Firefox using the Tango theme:

Keep in mind, though, that we are not limited to that exact icon set. We
could develop a new set of icon that match the metaphor of the
Winstripe/Pinstripe themes, but redrawn to better tie in with the Tango
style (and hence the rest of the Linux desktop).

While most of the integration work I have seen for Firefox on the Linux
desktop ha focused on Gnome, it is worth noting that the visual style
of Tango wa also designed to fit in relatively well in the KDE environment.

Andreas Nilssen, one of the primary icon designers/illustrators with the
Tango project ha expressed a keen interest in helping out with Tango in
Firefox 3. He's willing to redraw icons, and offer them in whatever
license is necessary for inclusion upstream in Firefox.

Also note that everything I have said here also applies to Thunderbird.

I'm looking for some direction on who in particular I should speak to
about this - who is driving the visual style of the UI for Firefox 3,
and who is driving the Linux aspect in particular.
