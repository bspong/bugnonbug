Hi.

A large number of symbol visibility patch landed into the GCC development tree at the end of June and beginning of July. The change rework how GCC determines symbol visibility in C/C++ code, and according to the changelogs fix numerous bug within GCC. However, the Mozilla/Firefox code now will no longer compile when being built with the current GCC development build containing these fixes.

As the development version of the compiler will branch at some point and become what will be GCC-4.2, it would be advantageous to try and resolve the symbol visibility problem before the official release of that version of GCC.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download, build, and install GCC development compiler
2. Configure a Mozilla/Firefox build using the development GCC compiler
3. Try to build while saving the build log for the warning/error messages.

Actual Results:
Builds fail with numerous warnings/errors regarding symbol visibility.

Expected Results:
A successful build.

The big patch regarding C++ visibility landed on June 29, and there have been various subsequent patch since then addressing other visiblity issues. Prior to the patch(es) landing, Firefox would build without problem; Mozilla/SeaMonkey
build would work mostly but there wa an error in the mail/news code.
