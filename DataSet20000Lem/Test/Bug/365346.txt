newest version of firefox crash very frequently or doe not start up
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla 2.0.0.1

I downloaded 2.0.0.1 recently and ever since then Firefox ha been unstable and crash at least every hour. This problem doesn't involve a particular website, nor a particular button or function (example: sometimes it crash if left idle, sometimes it crash if I use the bookmarks, etc.) When I say it crash I mean that the window message come up saying "Firefox encountered an error and had to close... report this error?" It seemed like there wa some data corruption when I installed it, so I re-installed the latest version, but to no avail. In addition to the crash (and maybe this is related), sometimes when I try to open firefox nothing happens even after waiting 15 or 20 minutes, and then when I look into my computer proccess (ctrl+alt+del-Processes), I see that firefox.exe is running, although no window ha opened. Rebooting the computer will then allow firefox to start. I wish I could be more specific, but that's all I've been able to gather after watching it for a few weeks.
