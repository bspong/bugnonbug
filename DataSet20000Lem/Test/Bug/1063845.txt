Fix remaining style inspector e10s test
I thought that these were all passing when I first opened Bug 1058875, but a it turn out there are still some failure (see https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Holly&rev=a9cc7f174c26, for instance). Looking at error like this (https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=47401370&tree=Holly&full=1#error0) make me think that these are legitimate timeouts where the test is still running when it get killed. Also, the exact list of failing test doesn't seem to be the same across platforms, which also make me think it could be an issue of them just not having enough time to finish.
