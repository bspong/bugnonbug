Most website will return an error if I try to enter information that requires a server POST request.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8

When I click the link on the site it will give me the error,"Bad Request Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand." This happens all the time when I am submitting a comment on a support forum, or any such data input fields. I am not sure if this is related, but It will also never play an embedded youtube video. Also, if I go to Help>Report Broken Website... in the browser, it will give me an error and not send the error report. I think this started since it updated to 3.6.8. Please fix this for the next version or tell me what is wrong if it's me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to "http://www.youtube.com/html5"
2. click "Join the HTML5 Beta"
Actual Results:
it give you the error: "Length Required
POST request require a Content-length header." or "Bad Request Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand."

Expected Results:
it should have given me the same page, but with "Leave the HTML5 Beta" instead of "Join the HTML5 Beta" and made it so that I watched video on YouTube using the <video> tag instead of flash.

I think it started this version (3.6.8) and it happens on other website (can't remember the specific address, but it's many different website where information is submitted).

It DOES NOT happen in Safari or Google Chrome
