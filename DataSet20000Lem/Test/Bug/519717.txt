There is a domain e.g. www.aaa.com with a redirect and a virtual directory www.aaa.com/xxx with application X. The application X in www.aaa.com/xxx ha no explicit link to a favicon file. When a user access application X Firefox 3.5.3 will try to fetch favicon.ico from www.aaa.com instead of www.aaa.com/xxx.
Thir will trigger the redirect in www.aaa.com and lead the user to a different applicaction, but keeping the Session variabled from application X.
This problem doe not exist in earlier version of Firefox or in IE7.

The default if there is no explicit link to a favicon.ico should be either not to look for it at all, or to look in the current virtual folder.
