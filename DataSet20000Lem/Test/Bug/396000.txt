support a "search:" protocol
support a "search:" protocol

the "search" protocol (that your browser would register for) would make it easy search for some text in your "default" engine.

(This seems related to have web apps a content handlers, right?)

Instead of allowing search engine (like google / yahoo / msn, etc) to register, the browser just us whatever your default search is (as IE, Firefox, Opera, Safari all have search box these days)

One use: adding a context menu to the message pane in Thunderbird that would launch my default browser to my default search engine with the selected text.

Another use, but an internal to firefox one, wa for bug #373352. When a user typed "foo bar" in the url bar, we could present a "Search for 'foo bar'" option, that would send the search to the default search engine.

(Maybe application like thunderbird could be smart and only show that context menu if the search protocol wa registered with the OS? not sure.)

Of course for thing like this, it is only useful if other browser followed along, and that's always the tough part.

see also bug #395998

My only concern is adding protocol to firefox might open up attack vectors, so I'll cc the right people so they can weigh in.
