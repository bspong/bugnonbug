When on a plurk.com profile page: An iframe's url get loaded a main content into a tab when the tab is inactive and I select the "Refresh tab" item from the tab's context menu.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a plurk.com account and go to your profile page ("own timeline").
2. Switch to another tab.
3. Select "Refresh tab" from the context menu of the plurk.com page's tab without switching to that tab
Actual Results:
The url of an iframe get loaded a main content in the tab.

Expected Results:
The actual profile page should be reloaded, not an inner iframe a main content.

The mentioned iframe is used for long polling or similar technique to achieve realtime notification about new content.
When I switch back to the tab with the plurk page and hit refresh button on the toolbar, the correct profile page get reloaded. Sometimes I need to press reload multiple times. By selecting "Refresh tab" context menu I can't achieve this.
