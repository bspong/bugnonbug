Navigation toolbar and bookmark do not work if Firefox profile is saved in a network folder that go offline
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.9) Gecko/20100315 Firefox/3.5.9 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This happens only if Firefox is in use.

If Firefox profile (User's Application Data) is saved in a network folder that go offline, at the time of the folder's synchronization (that is, when the network folder go back online) all Bookmarks disappear and the Address Toolbar stop working (when you type something, and you hit Enter it doe not work anymore). The search engine bar (Google by default) doe not work either.

In order to fix this, Firefox must be closed and opened again.
