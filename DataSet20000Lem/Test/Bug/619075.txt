Trying to upload a SVG file on one wiki will quickly generate memory crash
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.6.13

When I try to load one SVG file under my configuration (Firefox 3.6.13, Ubuntu 8.04 or 9.04) for a simple upload on a wikipedia-like, the parent directory is displayed into Nautilus (my file manager) but quickly the need for firefox-bin process increases, I need to kill the application.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_page (login)
2. try to upload a specific SVG file (seems not malformed)
3. need to kill firefox-bin, else I will quickly out of memory
Actual Results:
Sorry, I cannot return any traceback (also with command line)
memory quickly increase (50M -> 400M) and my system slow down, I need to kill application

Expected Results:
To properly load the file without memory cache issue



I suppose it is related to File:// preview on the directory where this SVG is stored. But I am not dev, so I cannot give a better proof, except the SVG file which generates this buffer problem.

Also happens with Firefox4beta7

Give me a way to share this SVG file.

Bests regards,
