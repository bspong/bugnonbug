36 hour after uploading Microsoft's latest critical security patch (Friday, October 24) and running without issue during that 36 hours, Firefox fails on our desktop after 3 to 5 minute of operation and display a series of error in a "Module #" format. Internet connection is lost.

Our system is XP Media edition if that is significant.

A specific stand alone error message read: "The instruction at 0x6010e920" referenced memory at "0x40110318". The memory could not be "read".
