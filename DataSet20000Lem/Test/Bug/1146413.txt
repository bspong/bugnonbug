Steps to reproduce:

1) Go to affected site
2) Browse to a page of the site
3) Try and go back clicking the back button

Tested with clean, new profile in Firefox stable (36.0.4) and nightly (39.0a1/2015-03-23/e730012260a4) with same result. No Flash installed.

I also tested with Firefox 31-35, Chrome 41 and IE 11, which don't show this behavior.

Example affected sites: androidayuda.com, adslzone.net, elotrolado.net, testdevelocidad.es


Actual results:

About 70-80% of the times, back button won't work, that is, it won't load the last page. From my observation I couldn't work out why it's not reproducible 100% of the time. Maybe it ha something to do with the different ad Google loads.

If you open the Network panel, you can see a new request to http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads when you click the back button.

I know the step to reproduce are a bit fuzzy and the bug somehow doesn't always happen, so I'm attaching a screen capture with the hope it clarifies something.


Expected results:

Back button should work normally, loading the last page.
