Problem with Firefox 3.6.4 and plugins

Ok, two problems: 1) I still have the same upgrade problem that I had with Firefox 3.6.2 and 3.6.3. The upgrade process consistently fails. I have to go to your website and download the full install and run that to upgrade. However, this time I have a new problem with 3.6.4. After installation, if I go to ANY web site that ha video (like youtube), or java, the strangest thing happens. You don't even had to try to play a video, just go to the home page. The problem is with a program that's part of Firefox i think is called ''pluginchecker.exe'', or something like that. If I bring up task manager and look at the processes, this pluginchecker.exe program just keep starting up, and shutting down... starting up, and shutting down... starting up, and shutting down... etc., etc., etc. You can see it show up on the list, then disappear from the list... show up on the list, then disappear from the list... show up on the list, then disappear from the list... etc., etc. This constant starting and stopping is causing Firefox to not only run VERY SLOW, but function improperly. Also, this process is sucking down about 40% of my cpu, so my entire system slows down. The only way I could get it to stop doing this wa to re-install Firefox 3.6.3. Any idea on how I can fix this? I hope this problem isn't going to be a permanent part of Firefox from this revision onward.
