I just recently upgraded my computer to a BFG 8800GTX video card. After the upgrade I noticed that menu rendering in Firefox wa extremely slow. In many vBulletin based forum the rendering of forum menu would take 2-3 seconds. Also if I use the navigation arrow to scroll the page the scrolling take place one line at a time.

This behavior doesn't happen with IE7 on the same sites.

Thought it might be just this computer. So I pulled the GFX card and put it in my testing system. Fresh install of Windows XP. Fresh install of FF. Same problems.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Obtain a 8800 based Nvida based GFX card and install it.
2. Visit a vBulletin based web forum.
3. Either use the forum menu or scroll using the navigation arrow.

Actual Results:
Very poor menu rendering time and scrolling one line at a time.

Expected Results:
Menus should render almost instantly.

Scrolling should be a smooth a glass.
