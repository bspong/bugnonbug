Remote firefox via SSH share state with local firefox [linux]

I don't know if this is a bug or not. I do think it is unexpected behavior though. If I start firefox on my ubuntu (feisty) machine, open an ssh shell to a remote machine (rhel 4) and then launch a firefox on the remote machine, the firefox display on the ubuntu box but ha all the feature (plugins, download location, etc) of the ubuntu installation. How can this be?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox on a ubuntu box (feisty)
2. Open a shell on the ubuntu box
3. SSH to a remote machine (rhel 4).
4. On the remote machine, launch a firefox without specifying a display. SSH tunnelling will put the display on the ubuntu box.
5. Download a file. The file will download to the folder specified by the ubuntu firefox preferences. That is, both the ubuntu and remote box specify the same path, ~/download, but on different machines. There is no NFS or other file sharing between the boxes.
6. An inspection of the preference in the remote firefox displayed on the ubuntu machine reveals that the preference are those of the ubuntu instance, not the remote instance.
Actual Results:
A download performed in the remote firefox window displayed on the ubuntu box saved the file on the ubuntu box.

Expected Results:
The file should have been saved to the download directory of the remote box.
