FF crashed when an URL is dragged and dropped on a tab
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040823 Firefox/0.9.3

I tried to drag and drop an URL from a KDE application (KSIrc) and drop it on
the tab title on a newly opened tab. Firefox crashed.


Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
As said, I tried a few time to reproduce the problem without success. This is
what I did:

1. Open a new tab Ctrl+T
2. Click on a highlighted URL in KSIrc.
3. Drag it to the tab title and drop it.

Actual Results:
The browser crashed. In my .xsession-errors, I found a lot of line like (the
report is truncated, they are identical):

(Gecko:2342): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkdnd.c: line 643 (gtk_drag_get_data): asse
rtion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed

(Gecko:2342): Gtk-CRITICAL **: file gtkdnd.c: line 643 (gtk_drag_get_data): asse

The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadImplementation (server doe not implement operation)'.
(Details: serial 2929506 error_code 17 request_code 20 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X error are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


Expected Results:
Open the URL in the tab.

My Firefox is installed from Debian Sid packages, and I have tabbrowser
extension 1.11.2004082102 installed.

That's about all I have. Sorry I couldn't reproduce it and for being somewhat
out of date, but I figured I should report it anyway.
