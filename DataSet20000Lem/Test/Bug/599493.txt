See Steps to reproduce, going to attach screenshot to show result.

Flash plugin version being used is 10.2.161.22 a downloaded at http://download.macromedia.com/pub/labs/flashplayer10/flashplayer_square_p1_64bit_linux_091510.tar.gz

However, it seems that it's not caused by the Flash plugin itself. The same work on Google Chrome with the same Flash plugin version and I managed to reproduce this bug on other platform (Windows, Linux 32bit) with Flash Plugin 10.1.85.3 a well.

System is Fedora 13, 64bit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://maps.google.com/
2. zoom into an area where Street View is available
3. place the Street View marker on a Street where Street View is available; Street View is not being accessed
4. move Street View marker to another spot where Street View is available
Actual Results:
Minefield is stuck and pretty messed up, please see screenshot.

Expected Results:
Street View should be accessed (already in step #3)

There is another issue with showing photo in Google Maps which may be related. I'm going to file it a separate bug (will cross post the bug IDs for reference).
