100% CPU

CPU usage ramp up to 100% every time I:
- open a web page in a new browser window from Bookmarks,
- open a web page in a new tab within a window,
- click a link to navigate to a new page within the current window/tab,
- cut/paste to move bookmark around in the Bookmarks Manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This seems a little redundant but it's in the form so I'll fill it in:

1. Open Bookmarks Manager.
2. Use UpArrow & DownArrow to select a bookmark.
3. Hit Enter.

or

1. Use Tab key or text search to arrive at a hyperlink within a web page.
2. Hit Enter, Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Enter, or Ctrl+Shift+Enter to open another page in the same tab, another window, or another tab with or without changing focus to that tab.

or

1. Within Bookmarks Manger, use UpArrow & DownArrow to select a bookmark.
2. Hit Ctrl+X to cut the bookmark.
3. UpArrow & DownArrow to reposition selection.
4. Hit Ctrl+V to paste the bookmark in it new position.

(You may have noticed I hate using the mouse.)
Actual Results:
With Enter, Shift+Enter, and Ctrl+Shift+Enter, focus go to the new target web page, in either the current window/tab or a new window or a new tab. The page load fine, render fine, look great. Wait 2-3 second. CPU skyrocket to 100% & stay there for about 25 seconds. Then it drop to 0% (more or less) and the browser return to good behavior. Until you do one of these thing again.

With Ctrl+Tab, the new web page load in another tab while focus remains in the current web page. The symptom are almost a above. Within a second or two of launching the load of the new web page in a background tab, CPU go to 100% but for only about 10-15 seconds. When the page completes loading, the short delay & then the 100% CPU for 25 second happens, same a above.

For cut/paste of bookmarks, I see 100% CPU immediately upon Ctrl+X. After waiting, I can reposition the highlight & hit Ctrl+V. CPU again jump to 100% for about 25 seconds.

Expected Results:
Ummm...... again, I'm just filling this in because it's in the form. Obviously, the expected result should be that if CPU doe need to go to 100%, it should be for no more than 3 or 4 seconds, if that. 25 second of 100% CPU, which make the browser totally unusable during that time, is just not on.

You may be wondering why I'm reporting this for a stinky old backlevel version of Firefox. Well, it's because I tried to use the latest version offered at mozilla.com, which I believe is 2.0.0.3 at the moment. It cause CPU to spike to 100% for 25 second at a time on nearly every operation. Web browsing that should have taken me about an hour took me three hours. (I'm persistent. I wanted to give it a good test.) So then I got a nightly build (I think it wa from 2 night ago) and the problem wa entirely unchanged. So I dropped back to this version just so I could browse around in le pain. With version 2 & the nightly build, CPU would go to 100% a soon a I hit Tab, UpArrow, DownArrow, PageUp, PageDown, hover the mouse over a hyperlink (I thought that might go faster than my preferred mouseless operations). I'm tempted to include in the list of activity causing 100% CPU looking sideways at my monitor, breathing hard on my keyboard, and imagining using the mouse. But that would be cruel. And just a skosh exaggerated.

My system is a P3-600 with 128Meg of RAM. Great system for 5 year ago, I know. But there it is. At least I am on a DSL connection that usually give me about 2Meg download speed, according to my ISP's speed testing site.

I can provide URLs where I observed this on request, but I saw it at several different site so I'm thinking it's not site-specific.

I did spend about an hour sifting through other Bugzilla report of 100% CPU usage & none of them seemed to be quite like what I'm reporting here. They mostly referred to specific site whereas I'm seeing this on all sites.

There wa mention of an interaction with antivirus programs. When my system go to 100% CPU, I do see two of the executables making up my antivirus program waking up & using up about 10% of the CPU each, with most of the rest being used by Firefox. So I unloaded my antivirus for a time to see if it made a difference. No. The share of the 100% CPU just went to Firefox instead of being divvied up. It shortened the period of unusability by 3 or 4 second each time, but that's all. I must say it is curious that Firefox should be doing something so regularly that doe catch the antivirus programs' collective attention. (I suppose everything doe but my system doesn't come it knee in those other case so I've never noticed it before.) But the antivirus program doesn't report that Firefox is doing anything it doesn't approve of. So I think it's a red herring in my case.

I also saw advice about using a different profile. Well, gee. I looked in every Firefox drop down menu, cascading out everything that cascade out, every page of Tools -> Options, and even the Help. If I knew how to do anything at all with a profile, even just display it never mind change it, I'd try that.

Since it's mentioned here, I'll provide it. I don't know if it's relevant but it can't hurt, I suppose.

I have cutomized Firefox not at all. I just downloaded it, installed it, & started running it. I adjusted a few Options, but I doubt any of that is relevant. Do disabuse me of this misconception, if misconception it be.
