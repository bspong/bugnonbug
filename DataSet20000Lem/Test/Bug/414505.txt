awesome bar should order primarily by number of tag match before frequency

Using Edward Lee's recent build of firefox from here:
https://build.mozilla.org/tryserver-builds/2008-01-19_00:36-edward.lee@engineering.uiuc.edu-glob.fast.adap.book.matc/edward.lee@engineering.uiuc.edu-glob.fast.adap.book.matc-firefox-try-linux.tar.bz2
a linked from his blog post here:
http://ed.agadak.net/2008/01/another-way-to-awesome
I am able to search for 2 tag at once. Good.

But URLs matching only one of the two tag are appearing before the only URL that match both tags.

I posted a comment on his blog, saying:

This is markedly more awesome than the trunk build I’ve been running, but it could be even more awesome.

I just tagged your blog a “firefox” and “blog”. Your blog in the only URL I have tagged in such a way, and yet when I type
firefox blog
into the location bar, your blog appears third in the list. The first two result are both tagged “blog”, but neither of them ha ever even mentioned firefox. Typing “sdlkjwsljvlskdjv” a a separate word in the location bar doesn’t reduce the list any further either.

I think it would be better if ALL word in the address bar had to match, rather than ANY, a now seems to be the case. Or, at least, order the result by the number of word each page match first. I would expect to see your blog first when typing “firefox blog”.

but he suggested I should report a bug instead. So I have done.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. use the above-linked version of firefox
1. tag your most frequently visited page with "tag23"
2. tag a page you rarely view with "tag23" and "tag24"
3. type "tag23 tag24" into the address bar
Actual Results:
the frequently visited page is listed first, even though it only match one of the two typed tag

Expected Results:
the rarely visited page should be listed first, because it match both of the two typed tag

Another example, not involving tags:

I want to visit http://synfig.org/Special:Allpages but can't remember the exact URL.

I type "synfig allpages". The page I want is listed, but 14th. I have to scroll the list of suggested page to find it. The first offered URL is http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=144022&atid=757416 , which ha absolutely nothing to do with 'allpages', but the other 13 are tagged with 'synfig', whereas this page isn't tagged at all. I think the fact that this is the only page matching both search term should make it the highest ranked result.
