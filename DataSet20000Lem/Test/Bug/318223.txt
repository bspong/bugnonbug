When I remote access my computer from another computer, the bookmark show up on the computer I'm remote accessing from. When the remote access is terminated (i.e. forced off because someone log onto the computer being remote accessed) the bookmark all disappear. If I log off the connection through the start up menu all is fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Remote access computer.
2.Use Mozilla Firefox browser
3.Terminate the connection

Actual Results:
First you remote access the computer. Then you use Mozilla Firefox (using one of the bookmark is not necessary). Without logging off of the remote access connection, terminate the connection by logging onto the computer being remote accessed.

Expected Results:
This ha caused my bookmark to dissappear every time. I don't know where they go. They don't show up when the computer is remote accessed again. They're just gone.

The software should allow for the use of the bookmark when remote accessed, and also on the computer after remote access is terminated an indefinite number of times.
