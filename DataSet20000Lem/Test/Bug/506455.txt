popped up. Of course different popups apear each time you try this.

No change were made to the default install of 3.5. The really strange thing is that this happens when you follow the corresponding step in IE8 on vist home premium. I haven't tried it on any other OS or browser. I am going to click the security button since this could be used by a malicious site to launch a drive by attack (although it woujld rely on a user to follow my step above). Feel free to uncheck if you disagree. Also, I have no idea how to report this bug to Microsoft.
