When printing selected text, via "file" , "print..." then "print selection" to my networked Konica Minolta 2430dl on this Dell with a 700mhz processor and 384 mb ram, the print job hang and never get sent to the printer. It just show "printing " in the printer status box. This doe not occur with firefox 2.0 or IE . And any subsequent print job of any type will back up in the queue , waiting for it to finish the first job, which never starts. I can't pause or delete the job without a reboot. Printing entire page work fine, issue only occurs with selected text. Website doe not matter. It will hang with any site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.select any text, any method
2.click "file", "print.." (or Ctrl+P )
3. check "selection" radio button in "print range section"
4. click "ok"
Actual Results:
printing never occurs, just sends a print job into queue that never get sent to printer, while hanging up any subsequent jobs. Only a reboot will allow that job to be deleted.

Expected Results:
I expected it to print my selection.

no problem printing entire pages, only selected text
