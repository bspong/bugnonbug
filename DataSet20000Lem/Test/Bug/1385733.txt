"bookmark all tabs" doesn't save most tab from 2017-07-26 nightly or earlier

Steps to reproduce:

I started Firefox Nightly with many tab restored from the previous session, about 880 tabs. Right clicked over the first tab, and clicked "Bookmark All Tabs"



Actual results:

The dialog appears without the usual "[Folder Name]" and Folder (the parent folder) input fields, therefore I cannot type a folder name.
Only the "Add Bookmarks" and "Cancel" button appear.
Since I couldn't type a folder name to use, I clicked the "Add Bookmarks" button, without giving a folder name.

In Nightly 2017-07-26, a default bookmark folder with the name "[Folder Name]" wa created, but wa empty (instead of with about 880 tab ...)

After updating to the latest Nightly 2017-07-30, a default bookmark folder with the name "[Folder Name]" wa created, is not empty like with Nightly 2017-07-26, but ha only 76 tabs, most of the tab are missing (instead of about 880 tab ...)

After some tries, I found out later that if you wait long enough (about 30 seconds) after clicking "Bookmark all tabs", the missing 2 input field folder name and Folder (parent folder), suddenly appear (!) in the dialog box, enlarging it, and giving me the option to type the folder name. When this happens, all tab seem to be bookmarked correctly, without missing tabs.

The time it take for the missing input field to appear, sometimes depend on the number of tab you have in the window, so if you bookmark all tab on window with a small number of tabs, you might not notice this.




Expected results:

The input field on the "bookmark all tabs" dialog box should have appeared immediately.

When bookmarking all tab without entering a folder name (with the default folder name) before those input field suddenly appear, all tab should be bookmarked and there should not be many missing tab that are not bookmarked.
