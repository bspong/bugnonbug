Created attachment 620125
Example HTML file showing 'speak selected text' feature not working when there is a text field form widget

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:15.0) Gecko/15.0 Firefox/15.0a1
Build ID: 20120501030504

Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded Nightly to 15.0a1 (2012-05-01).

Ensure that 'speak selected text' is available in OS X.

- System Preferences -> Speech -> Text to Speech,

- Ensure 'Speak selected text when key is pressed' with an appropriate shortcut key. I use Shift+Command+R

Go to any page in Firefox that doe not have a text field or text area form widget.

Highlight text with the mouse.

Press the 'speak selected text' key sequence.

Observe that OS X speaks your selection out loud.

Next go to a page that contains a text field or textarea form widget. Enter some text into that widget.

Change focus by clicking outside the widget within the page.

Highlight some text from the page.

Press the 'speak selected text' key sequence.


Actual results:

OS X speaks the content of the text field, not the text I've selected


Expected results:

OS X should have spoken the text that I selected a it doe on page that contain no text field form widgets.
