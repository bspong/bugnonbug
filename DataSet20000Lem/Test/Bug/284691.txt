I customized my toolbar by going to view/toolbars/customize. I grabbed and
dragged the print, bookmarks, and history to the main menu toolbar (next to
Help). I then successfully grabbed and dragged the address bar and search bar
to the top menu bar. Finally, I dragged the TinyURL extension there.

That, I thought, would allow me to eliminate the navigation bar and leave me
with only one toolbar so a to maximize the viewable window... until I realized
that I would lose the forward, back, reload and homepage buttons. So I tried to
drag everything back but the item became locked on the top bar.

Now if I view the navigation toolbar, I get a duplicate address and search bar,
and cannot get the print, bookmark or history item to the navigation bar since
they are locked...

Any ideas?

Actual Results:

back out
