When a URL is typed into the URL bar that result in a redirect, history list show the page in an incorrect order.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I type google.com into the URL bar. This redirects to http://www.google.com, and since I live in Canada, redirects again to http://www.google.ca
2. Look at either the history menu, the history sidebar (and select View->By Last Visited), or the library history (History->Show All History)
Actual Results:
Pages appear in the all of the above mentioned list in the following order:

1. http://google.com
2. http://www.google.ca
3. http://www.google.com



Expected Results:
They should appear in the correct chronological order:

1. http://www.google.ca
2. http://www.google.com
3. http://google.com

Maybe all 3 entry shouldn't even be shown; but if they are, the should appear in the correct order.

I have verified that this problem also appears on Mac OS (3.0.1), but doe not happen in Firefox 2.0.0.16 (Mac)

I ran wget to see exactly how the redirect is happening:
