I use the http://au.answers.yahoo.com site quite a lot, and frequently do cut & paste operations. Using the 3.1b2 version, page generally load without hogging the CPU a much a before (yay!), but I noticed some curious behavior. If you highlight some text then right-click to copy it to the clipboard, it take a very long time for the menu to pop up. When it doe come up, clicking on copy doe not always result in copying to the clipboard. They are currently displaying ad that play using Shockwave. I disabled the shockwave plugin, and the ad were replaced by animated GIFs and the strange copy behavior disappeared. I realize that this is probably more of a shockwave hogging issue, but it definitely work differently in the beta than it did in 3.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable Shockwave
2.Surf to any specific question page on http://au.answers.yahoo.com or likely anybody that is using flash display. On this site, it happens only at the single question display level; flash is not used on the higher level menus/lists
3.
Actual Results:
Flash display just fine; some keyboard operation slow to a crawl

Expected Results:
Displaying flash should not affect simple keyboard operation

I have temporarily resolved the problem by leaving shockwave disabled and continue to test the V3.1B2 version. I never really thought that much of flash in the first place; it ha always been a hog.
