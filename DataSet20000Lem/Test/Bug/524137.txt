Firefox time out or URL can't be found if two machine are attempting to use the internet over a network through a router.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082707 Firefox/3.0.14 (.NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.5.3

This problem started showing up soon after upgrading the second machine to 5.3.5. I did it one at a time so that at least one machine can access the net. I did a long troubleshoot, including an hour with my ISP, Qwest. They found no problem with their end of the system. I replaced the router, multiple reboots, reset the internal IP to be sure there is no conflict. So, I reloaded 3.0. No dice. Then I did an upgrade to 3.0.14. Conflict resolved!Access is nominal now for both machines.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start FF on one machine and begin using search or any otherwise run like e-mail
2.Start FF on other machine.
3.
Actual Results:
Observe a huge slowdown (whirling icons)ending with "Loading Prob..." showing up in all or most of the tabs. Then, both machine are denied further operations, resulting in loading problem for both.

Expected Results:
I expect both machine to load up the tab with the proper url.

Curiously, I can open additional FF browser window on a machine that is running alone with no conflicts. That led me to believe it is a network or ISP problem, but it appears not so. At this point, I cannot run 3.5.3 on both.
