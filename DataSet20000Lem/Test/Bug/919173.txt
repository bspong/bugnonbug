Session restore fails to restore comment
Hello,

I have Firefox 23.0.1 on Mac OS X.

I am at the page :
http://superuser.com/questions/645717/how-can-the-webserver-replace-on-the-fly-the-image-with-a-webpage
On Sickest's answer, I click on "add comment", so I have a comment text area, and I start to write a comment.

Later, Firefox crashes, and I restore the session.

First problem : in the restored tab, I do not have the comment text area.

I click on "add comment". Now I have the comment text area.

Second problem : I don't have my text in the comment text area.

The good news is that I am able to find my text in the file sessionstore.js. But the user is not supposed to even know about this file. So, typically, there is data loss in this case.

Expected behaviour :

In my restored tab, I have the comment text area, and I have my text in it.

In case it helps, I had this in my file sessionstore.js :
