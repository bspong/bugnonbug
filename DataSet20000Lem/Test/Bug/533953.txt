In a text box, you can make multiple spelling mistakes. If the user make a correction near the end of the text box, all prior spelling mistake that were marked become unmarked. All text that is incorrect after the spelling correction is still correctly marked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type three misspelled word in a text box.
2. Right click the middle word and opt to correct it with a suggestion from Firefox.
3. First misspelled word will be marked a correctly spelled. Last misspelled word will remain marked a incorrectly spelled.
Actual Results:
First misspelled word will be marked incorrectly a spelled right. Last misspelled word will remain correctly marked a incorrectly spelled.

First and last misspelled word should be marked a incorrectly spelled.

The problem can be worked around by scrolling to the beginning of the text box and correcting spelling from start to finish instead of arbitrarily.
