Click OK to see a technical note at mozilla.org which show how to allow a script to access the clipboard". The pop-up ha two buttons, "OK" and "Cancel". After pushing OK button a requested the pop-up vanishes and text is normally pasted in the new mail. But the pop-up is annoying and I would like to switch it of. How can I do it, when not able to get to those technical note?
