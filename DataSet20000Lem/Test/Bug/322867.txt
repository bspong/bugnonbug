Firefox 1.5 thru Google Personalized Home Page fails to find my personal webpage. But when I use Mozilla 1.7.12 thru the same Google Personalized Home Page I can locate my personal webpage. I used Internet Explorer's (version 6.0.29) Address bar and it located my webpage same a Mozilla. But using my IP server's home page (thru Internet Explorer) Google search, it failed to find the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I loaded a test page (using Mozilla Composer) onto ftp server provided by IP (free webpage provided by IP).
2. Used Mozilla first to locate it. Found it.
3. Then used Firefox (default browser) to locate but failed ("Not Found" page appears).
4. Wondered if Internet Explorer could locate. It did. Tried IP home page Google (which is the home page for Internet Explorer) to see results. Not found.

Actual Results:
Mixed results. 2 browser action found page and 2 others did not.

Expected Results:
Find page.

I wa developing a new website provided for free by my IP server. My skill are rather new. But both browser from Mozilla.org should find the same webpage thru Google.
