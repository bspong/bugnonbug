User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8

if close firefox and reopen after just 1-2 seconds, appear the messaje:

"Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."

So is too much inertia for Mozilla after closing. It have to close the process more quickly. For example for Chrome doe not happen this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.close firefox
3.after 1-2 second if you reopen firefox, appear the message:

"Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."


Expected Results:
appear that message. So is too much inertia for firefox. The process of firefox have to close more quickly.

I think is a easier task to make a software to close it process more quickly than to make it open faster.

So will be a easy work for firefox developer to make firefox close completely more quickly.
