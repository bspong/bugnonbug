Bug turned Firefox to all default setting & never save changes.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I just updated to 3.6.9 and I can't get Firefox to save my settings. It reset everything to default, and after several attempt in using Tools > Options, hitting OK, then closing FF, it return to default when I re-open it. Considering I've had the same theme and setting the past 4 month with no trouble, and this includes updates, I should be fine. But it not only defaults, it act a if I have just installed the current plug in I've had for several months. It open all of the release note for each plug-in in tabs. So every time I open Firefox, I have many tab opening, telling me welcome or otherwise along with noting my them and privacy/other setting are returned to default.

I tried going to an earlier version, but it reacts the same way. I may try going down to a version from several month ago to see if this change anything. I realize Beta happens. I would also like to note that I'm very internet/troubleshoot savvy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up FireFox.
Actual Results:
Default settings, default theme, never save settings, open multiple tab from plug-ins.

Expected Results:
Keeping my current theme and settings.

It save my password from site I visit. The one thing it never doe is log me out.
