Actual results:

All other previously viewed tab display a blank white page, Even if I Reload or click in navigation bar and hit enter. The page act a if it's 'going', but again, nothing is displayed, blank white page.
The only page that display are 'New Tabs' with an address not on a Tab from Restored Session and the 'first' page from the Restored Session.

Expected results:

I can reproduce this over again a of today's update.
