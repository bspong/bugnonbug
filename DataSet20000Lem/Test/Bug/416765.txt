For when restarting Firefox with the "show my window and tab from last time" startup option turned on, and the previous session contained a lot of tab (but not enough to trigger the "Loading all tab may slow Firefox down" warning), a "Stop Loading All Tabs" option/button would be really nice.

This may be an "editable threshold for triggering the 'too many tabs' alert" request, which would also then apply to the situation of loading a large group of "Bookmark All Tabs" folder, but I really would like to see: a startup bookmark folder view of the tab in question, with something like an "open all" or "open selected", perhaps even with a "don't ask me again" option.

The problem (and especially important for either metered or bandwidth-challenged connections) is reloading a lot of page with graphics, embedded audio and video, when you really only want one specific page. (Later you could easily hit the reload button for any particular page you want to see again.)

When you want one page only, it take a long time to load with lot of other page loading simultaneously, and right now you have to manually focus on each page and then hit the "stop loading" button for that page, repeat for next page... etc.

(I've long retired from anything that actually resembled coding, but I hope this sound like a relatively simple tweak.)

Thank folks, you're doing a great job!
