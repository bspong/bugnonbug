When invoking signText, the dropdown list of certificate in the confirmation form will display only one item for a nickname. If I have several certificate with the same subject and hence nickname, only the newest one will be shown, and I cannot use older one to sign the text. This is a problem if I have certificate with the same subject name that are signed by different CAs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Clear the client certificate list
1. Import two sample CA certificate
2. Import two client certificate signed by the two different CAs, but with the same subject (i.e., same CN and emailAddress)
3. Open an HTML containing the following JavaScript code
signText("Sample text", "ask")

Actual Results:
The confirmation form will popup, listing only one entry to choose from.

Expected Results:
A confirmation form with the two certificate listed, perhaps listed a
Nickname
Nickname #2

Please let me know if I should provide more information.
