While my wife wa playing the "SuperPets" myspace application, Windows Vista launch it problem reporter stating that Firefox encountered a problem and needed to close. Upon checking the Event Log for Windows it stated a follows:

Log Name: Application
Source: Application Error
Date: 9/21/2008 3:50:16 AM
Event ID: 1000
Task Category: (100)
Level: Error
Keywords: Classic
User: N/A
Computer: WOPRXII
Description:
Faulting application firefox.exe, version 1.9.0.3180, time stamp 0x48d0865b, faulting module xul.dll, version 1.9.0.3180, time stamp 0x48d086b7, exception code 0xc0000005, fault offset 0x0022eae8, process id 0x1700, application start time 0x01c91b92fba32b11.

That suggests to me that the fault may not be on a part of the browser and may be the app itsself being poorly written, but I figure others should have a look at it a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on to MySpace
2. Open "SuperPets" application
3. Play for about 5 minute
4. Browser will slow down, while Network throughput remains the same
5. Windows will state the browser encountered an error and will close it
Actual Results:
Browser crashed

Expected Results:
Browser should not have crashed

I wa using several extensions, I have Nautopolis running a my theme, ForecastFox, FoxLingo, HeaderSpy, InfoCon Monitor, and Live HTTP headers. Disabling any or all of these extension and the theme had no impact on testing this bug for me, the browser would still crash 100% of the time no matter what extension were or were not running.
