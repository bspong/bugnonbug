FireFox 3.0.3 with 1 or more tab open and nothing else happening on the computer in 8 hour or so can grab all available memory. It is not totally consistent, but happens so often that I often revert back to using FF 2.x to keep from the problem. As far a I can tell there is no Flash running. All the tab are fully loaded. The modem is hung up so nothing is updating.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FF3 and 10:30 PM. Load the following tabs:

Available memory: 186844 KB
Check at 6 am next morning
Available Memory: 129696 KB
Nothing wa running between time of checking.

At 8 am same morning after using the computer I added one tab:

Available Memory now: 123396 KB.

Check at 6 pm:
Available Memory: 80800 KB

11:30 PM after using FF3 for a number of thing closed all tab including the
test 5 tabs. Available memory still 88000 KB. Close FF3 and available memory:
275000 KB. So with nothing even displaying it still wa holding almost
200000KB of memory.

No Flash wa running a far a I can tell. All tab were fully loaded. Modem wa hung up so no updating wa going on.

Actual Results:
See above.

Expected Results:
No additional memory should have been used. Performed the same test with FF 2.0.0.19 and no memory leak at all. The same plugins and extension are loaded in both version of the browser.
