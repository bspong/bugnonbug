With visual problems, window theme must be set to high contrast black. I have allowed firefox to take on system color so that website are also inverted. When the mouse set overtop of a link that drop down a window, the word are visible, but so is everything beneath the window making it impossible to read the menu entirely. This only happens when using system color under preferences. This problem ha been the only reason for recent Internet Explorer uses. Thanks ^_^

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In windows, set the appearance to "windows classic".
2. Next, set the style to "high contrast black".
3. In mozilla's option section, set the color setting to "allow system colors"
4. Set text color to white and background to black
5. Remove the check beside "allow page to use their own colors"

(all page should have pure black background with white text now)

6. Go to nearly any site containing a mouse over menu.
7. Mouse over an option that ha something underneath of it.

(the example website wa a random example, but there are many menu out there)

Actual Results:
The drop down option should be unreadable, or atleast very difficult to see. There are several web site that I have encountered that have a very specific menu layout and do not have transparent backgrounds.

Expected Results:
The background of the displayed menu should not have displayed a clear background with white letters, but a black background with white letter

The only other bit I've got is that I know Internet explorer doe just fine, so it's obviously a code interpretation or browser overlay issue and not the coder mistake.
