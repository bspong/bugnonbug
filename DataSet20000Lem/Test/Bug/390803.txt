WMV Plugin behaves differently when loading a local file v a file on a web server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5

There are 2 issues:
Issue #1: A WMV file will not play if you are accessing a file from a relative path while looking at an HTML page you opened from your local computer (File, Open File)

Issue #2: Auto re-sizing doe not always work properly in firefox, but work properly in IE. The video will get stretched when required, but will not get resized smaller if the player is smaller than the video.


Test File:

<html><body>
<object id="MediaPlayer" width="420" height="360" classid="CLSID:22D6F312-B0F6-11D0-94AB-0080C74C7E95" standby="Loading Windows Media Player components..." type="application/x-oleobject">
<param name="FileName" value="http://yourserver/yourfile.wmv">
<param name="ShowControls" value="true">
<param name="ShowStatusBar" value="true">
<param name="ShowDisplay" value="false">
<param name="autostart" value="false">
<embed type="application/x-mplayer2" src="http://yourserver/yourfile.wmv" name="MediaPlayer" width="420" height="360" ShowControls="1" ShowStatusBar="1" ShowDisplay="0" autostart="0"> </EMBED>
</object>
</body></html>
