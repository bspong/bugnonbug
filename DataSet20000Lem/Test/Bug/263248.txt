When visiting a page that contains a JS link which open an article in a new
page, the pop-up blocker kill it - even when the domain ha been whitelisted or
the popup blocker ha been disabled entirely. Also, in the 0.10.1 release, which
ha the funky new GUI for the popup blocker, you should be able to right click
on the popup blocker bar and opt to show the popup anyway. Clicking this fails
to open the article, and simply cause multiple instance of the URI to be
listed at the bottom of the context menu for showing.
Reproduced in a nightly downloaded 10 minute ago, and the official release of
0.10.1.
Note: Although the error can be reproduced at the above site, I can't actually
find another site that us JS to open a link in a new window at the current
moment. If someone would like to throw one at me, i'd be more than happy to test it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit site containing JS link to open page in new window.

3. Cry.

Actual Results:
