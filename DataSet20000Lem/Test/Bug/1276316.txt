Browser Lags With Lots of Tabs
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
Build ID: 20160526140250

Steps to reproduce:

Open Firefox with 100+ tab set to restore.
Wait 15 minutes.


Actual results:

The browser start being really laggy. Videos will skip every second, the browser will lock up for a few second every minute or so, and the window will hang open for a few second when you attempt to close the browser. Everything is just very sluggish and slow. Closing and opening the browser again with the 100+ tab set to restore make it return to normal operation until some time ha passed and then it start being laggy again. Basically, I just have to close and reopen the browser every 15 minutes. Sometimes it will happen much faster, other time it will take much longer.


Expected results:

The browser should continue operating normally no matter how long it wa left open. This ha been a recurring issue for year when I have this many tab open, on multiple computer and version of Firefox, so I figured that I should finally report this a a bug so that it can be looked into. I suppose it is due to the extensive amount of tab I usually have open, so it would be a rare bug.
