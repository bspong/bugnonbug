If a program known a eMule is opened, FireFox seems to have great difficulty in opening new tabs. This wa not an issue with the same eMule program up to and including FireFox 3 Beta 5. This problem started with RC 1.

When opening new tabs, often it will put the link in the location bar, but it will not do anything. The tab's title on the tab browser will be "(Untitled)". Hitting enter on the location bar or clicking the Go symbol multiple time will not do anything. There is also an increase in Page Load Errors (Connection Interrupted)

I have tested this with eMule not doing any activity, and merely being open, and the problem persists. Already open web page will not do anything if you click a link. This problem occurs on multiple web pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Occurs while eMule is running every time.
2.
3.


Expected Results:
New tab should open and load the page they are supposed to. This occurs when there is no traffic in eMule, so bandwidth is not a problem.
