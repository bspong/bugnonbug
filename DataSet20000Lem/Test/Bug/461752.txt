A bug of http auth in Firefox 3 -- when access two resources, the http auth pop-up show
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; zh-CN; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3

I configured two resource in the server side which need basic
authentication. The authentication is very simple: if the password is
'123456', then it's a valid request, otherwise return status 401.

And here is the test code in the client side:

<html>
<body onload="testXhr();">
<head>
<script language="JavaScript">
var url = ["/first_resources.json", "/second_resources.json"];
var count = 0;

function testXhr() {
var resource_url = urls[count%2];
var username = "guest";
var password = "123456";

var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.onreadystatechange = xhrCallback;
xhr.open("GET", resource_url, true, username, password);
xhr.send(null);
count++;

setTimeout(testXhr, 8000);
}

function xhrCallback() {
}
</script>
</head>
</body>
</html>

In the statement "setTimeout", if I use a below value such a 1000,
http auth pop-up shows. I must set it to a very high value to wait the
resend of last request fully completed.
I think this behavior is a bug, I had never seen this behavor in IE.

BTW, If you want to test this behavior in your local host, you must
clean the cached data of Firefox first.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
the http auth pop-up show

Expected Results:
the http auth pop-up shouldn't show
