Here is how I use my Bookmarks Toolbar:
Create a "category" folder in root of Bookmarks Toolbar (examples: News, Technology, Gaming, etc).
Place RSS Feeds within these category folders.

Whenever I move the cursor across the text of the RSS name (or whitespace afterwards including the submenu arrow), the submenu repeatedly open and close for each pixel of movement (up/down and left/right). This *appears* to be happening only after the folder menu is a certain width (and strangely only the middle RSS feed - NOT the first or last).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder in Bookmarks Toolbar
2. Place more than 2 RSS feed in this folder (try one with *long* names)
3. Click the folder in the Bookmarks Toolbar to drop it down
4. Move mouse cursor across middle RSS entry (which normally expands them)

Actual Results:
It will keep the folder menu open, however if the submenu name is long enough, after a certain point it will cause the submenu to open on a pixel and close on any neighboring pixel.

Moving the mouse across the name repeatedly open and close the RSS feed submenu, making it really hard to actually get mouse access the submenu's content.

Expected Results:
Should keep the submenu open a you move across the name.

No theme or add-in installed.
