After I had upgraded from FF3.6 Hebrew to FF4 Hebrew (via the built in upgrade tool in FF), I wa amazed to see that the window button (close, minimize, maximize) moved to the left hand side, instead of the right hand side.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF3.6 Hebrew on an English Windows 7 (mine is 64bit).
2. Make sure the window button are on the right hand side.
3. Upgrade via FF to FF4, then look where they are (hint: the wrong side).

Actual Results:
The window button (close, minimize, maximize) switched over to the left hand side instead of the right hand side.
Needless to say, no other software on my computer ha the window button on that side

Expected Results:
The window button should have stayed on the right hand side, where they have always been.
It's important to mention that on Win XP, I upgraded a well, but there the window button remained on the right hand side, so it must be something with FF in Win7, and not all Operating Systems.
