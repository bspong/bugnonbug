When I print preview the Groupwise WebAccess calendar in IE, the toolbar
display an option to print "as laid out on screen" (in 1 page). Firefox doe
not give that option, but give two others: ("shrink to fit" and
portrait/landscape). The result is that Firefox print out all calendar frame
individually, so it take 4-5 page to print a 1-page calendar. Not so good.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Since Firefox doesn't give an option to print "as laid out on screen" (1 page)
2.each frame is printed separately
3.

Actual Results:
Each frame of the calendar (toolbars, buttons, etc.) print separately, so the
calendar is printed a several page instead of a one page

Expected Results:
The calendar should print a one page. I think the intention of Firefox wa to
have the "shrink to fit" command form the calendar to one page and print one
page but, using Groupwise Web Access, the calendar extends to 2 page and print
a multiple pages. It should perform a IE doe using it print "as laid out on
screen" option
