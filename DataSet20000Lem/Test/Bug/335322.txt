Hi: Iam running thsi Firefox ofr few year without any problem ,but for the last month i expiriencing moore and moore instance of Hang browesr [Not responding].i didnt install any new software i run XP Pro ,3.6Ghz P4 processor 1Gb memory 128 mb ATI radeon video 160 seagate SATA hdd.is the system specs.10 month old.

Then i restart Pc, and all is fine for few days.
I read similar trouble here just litle diferent then mine. i dont get this troulbe with any apps on my Pc,
