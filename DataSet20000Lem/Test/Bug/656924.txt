It happens on semi-regular basis. Haven't tried to nail exact reproducibility method but will try to be a informative a can be.

Usually, Firefox is open in multiple window (3), each having a lot of tab open (about 15+ per window). Usually among the lot there are a few tabbed page that have script running (hotmail, twitter, bandcamp, youtube...)
Put the computer in low-power/sleep mode for the night. Resumed work in the morning, application is sluggish. Close unnecessary tab in one window. Browser ha long response time, but should improve upon closing down more tabs.

- Often will receive prompt about process that stopped responding (often coming from hotmail's tab and the such, but sometimes from browser add-on too). Stopping or letting them run usually work either way. -

Change to another window, proceed to close more tab judged superfluous. Browser crashes. Mozilla crash reporter come up, press button to send crash report. Receive message that there wa an error in sending the crash report.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open high amount of tabs, separated in different Firefox windows.
2.Computer go to sleep/power save mode, let sit few hours.
3.Awaken computer, if Firefox is sluggish, start closing tab from window to window.

Actual Results:
Browser crashes. Crash reporter give error message when submitting report.

Expected Results:
1.Tabs successfully close. Firefox regains some speed, hurray!
OR
2.Browser still crash under the load but crash reporter sends report successfully.

Expected crash reporter might fail, had copied the detail log. Can provide if needed.
