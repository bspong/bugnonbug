Created attachment 8701646
testcase 1 - It's possible to accidentally end up with browser consuming 25 CPU.htm

>>> My Info: Win7_64, Nightly 46, 32bit, ID 20151223030323
STR:
1.A) Detach this tab in a new window
1.B) Open attached "testcase 1" in a new window
2. Middle-click the link 'data:text/html,<body onbeforeunload="return 1">' on the page from Step 1
to open it in a new tab.
3. Switch to that tab with "data:" url, click on content area
4. Open new tab
5. Switch to the tab from Step 1
6. Middle-click the tab with "data:" url from Steps 2-3 [tab title will become bold]
7. Click the tab with "data:" url from Steps 2-3 [you'll switch to that tab]
8. Click Reload button in urlbar or middle-click the tab
9. Middle-click the tab

Result:
After Step 7 only blank confirm dialog is visible. Also, the tab from Step 1 stay visually selected
After Step 8 the normal onbeforeunload dialog appears
After Step 9 two tab are visually selected: the tab from Step 1 and New Tab from Step 4
New Tab infinitely display the loading spinner at the center of content area.
Firefox consumes 25% of CPU and stay at this rate until I close the application
If after Step 9 I open other tab in the window from Step 1, they are initially unresponsive too.

Expectations:
(1) Normal onbeforeunload dialog (2) Only one selected tab
(3) Normal CPU usage (4) No infinite loading spinner
