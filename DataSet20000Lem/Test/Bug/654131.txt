Firefox 4 update/installer failed to scrub old java extension
bug 597235 wa supposed to deal with this....

I'm visiting a work computer, it ha the following in
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\extensions:
{CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0017-ABCDEFFEDCBA}
{CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0020-ABCDEFFEDCBA}
{CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0023-ABCDEFFEDCBA}
{CAFEEFAC-0016-0000-0024-ABCDEFFEDCBA}
(as well a .net framework and skype extensions...)

these are apparently u17, u20, u23, and u24. only u24 should be present - it isn't current, but it's the latest one installed on this system.

I wa asked to file this bug by someone in mozilla.public.dev-planning. I will not have access to this computer in the future.

If there's a mozilla installer/updater log file that should be collected, please indicate it ASAP or else it is unlikely that anyone will be able to retrieve it. I believe this wa an update via the menu from firefox3.6.x.

for internal reference, this is the team Skype computer.
