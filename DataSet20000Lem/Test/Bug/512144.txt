I'm very sorry if this is the wrong area to post this, but I've given up trying to find the appropriate place!

Starting about 10 day ago when forwarding email with images, the image did not go through. There wa only an empty box with the red “x” on the recipient end. Sometimes in my "sent" box the email would show an empty box with what looked like a piece of paper torn in half in the upper left corner and other time it had the red "x". Right clicking on the red “x” (either in my sent box or by the recipient) and on “show picture” did not open the picture. This happened when using Firefox and Explorer. I wa able to forward email containing image using Outlook, and wa able to send photo using Yahoo email. Our son wa able to forward email with image using his Yahoo account on my computer. I’m sure it wa not the source or form of the images, because my husband could forward the same emails/images received from the same people I received them from using Yahoo on his computer. I wa thinking it wa a hang up with my browser software, but since it happened with both browser I wa thinking it had to be in the computer programming or whatever. Obviously I'm not very computer literate! I don't remember changing any settings, etc. before this started. I contacted Yahoo, Firefox and Kaspersky, my virus program, with no success, and posted on various help sites, but did not received any answer that helped. Most just said to hold the "ctrl" key while clicking on forward, which only worked once.

Yesterday I decided to try again to forward an email with image thinking maybe whatever had started the problem had stopped a suddenly. I had saved a couple of email containing picture in my draft folder to send when the problem wa solved. When I opened my draft folder I noticed a couple of email from Pet Wellbeing, a site I had ordered a product from. I had kept the email so I would have all of the information in case I wanted to order again. At this point I knew I wa not going to reorder, so I clicked on the first Pet Wellbeing email to delete it. Immediately my “My Pictures” (in “My Documents”) opened. I thought, “I wonder how I did that,” but didn’t think anything else about it. I closed the picture and deleted the email. When I clicked on the second Pet Wellbeing email to delete it, the same thing happened with the pictures! I again closed it and deleted the email. Immediately after this I wa able to send email containing images! All I can think is that Pet Wellbeing ha something in their email that is somehow overriding Yahoo’s, Kaspersky’s and Firefox’s programming or something! I thought this might be of interest to you in case this problem happens to someone else in the future.



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
I'm guessing saving another Pet Wellbeing email to my draft would reporduce the problem, but I'm not going to do that! From now on their email will be going to spam!

Expected Results:
I didn't try again.
