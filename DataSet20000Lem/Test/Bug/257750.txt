JPopupMenu fails to fire event under JDK 1.5 and Firefox 0.9.3

When a JPopupMenu on a simple Panel is shown (via a right click), if the
JPopupMenu doe not extend beyond the bound of the JApplet (onto the HTML page
itself), it doe not recieve event from it's item being clicked on. The
attached java file demonstrates this, it is a simple JApplet with a JPopupMenu
with one item. Clicking on this item show an alert box. However if the
JPopupMenu remains wholly inside the applet's bounds, the event is never
recieved, and the alert box is not shown.

This behavious is exhibited in all Java 1.5 version that I have tried (up to
today Release Candidate)

I am using RedHat linux 2.4.20-28.8, JDK 1.5RC and Firefox 0.9.3

The plugin is in the plugins directory a a symbolic link to:
JAVA_HOME/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile the attatched java file by using the command:
javac JPopupBug.java
2. Save the attatched HTML to the same directory a the generated class file
3. Open the HTML file in Firefox 0.9.3 with the 1.5 plugin
4. Right click on the applet (so that the JPopupMenu is entirely within the
bound of the applet)
5. Select the "Show Alert Box!" menu item
6. Notice no popup
7. Right click the applet on the far right hand side (so that the JPopupMenu
extends beyond the bound of the applet)
8. Select the item
9. You should then see the required behaviour. And a popup box should appear

Actual Results:
No popup alert when JPopupBox contained within bound of applet

Expected Results:
Popup alert no matter of location of JPopupMenu

I believe this is some sort of focus issue, where the applet is not getting
focus correctly...
