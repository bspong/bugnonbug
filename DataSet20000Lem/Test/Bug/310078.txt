Java Plugin Discovery problem (OJI Plugin textual description lack JVM version)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4

I notice that the OJI Java Plugin ha no indication of which JVM version(s) it
support within the textual description. Currently the description is

"Runs Java applet using the <APPLET>, <OBJECT> and <EMBED> HTML elements. For
more information see MRJ Plugin and MRJ Plugin JEP."

whereas all other Mac Java Plugins include something like "Java 1.3.1 Plugin" or
some such thing.

I understand that there's probably no requirement for what's put in this
description, but it doe appear that some site expect there to be both the
string 'Java' and some form of version number(s) in there. One example of this
is the HP Insight Manager's login page which requires there to be at least a
1.4.1 JVM on the client machine. Unfortunately the Insight Manager is
incompatible with Safari (for HTML/JavaScript reasons) but should work fine with
Firefox if only it could be convinced that there wa a valid JVM on board.

Is this something that can be handled by Firefox or is this an OJI plugin bug
(or a problem somewhere else?)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. write or try to use a page that try to figure out JVM version via
<code>
// example code which try to determine what version of the java
// plugin exists.
for (var i = 0; i < navigator.plugins.length; i++)
{
var description = navigator.plugins.item(i).description;

if (description.indexOf("Java") == -1)
continue;

// look for 1.4
var version = "1.3";
var vIdx = description.indexOf("1.4");
// not found?, look for 1.5
if (vIdx == -1)
vIdx = description.indexOf("1.5");


if (vIdx >= 0)
{
version = description.substr(vIdx, 3);

if (version < "1.4")
continue;
}

// do something with the knowledge ...
}
</code>

Actual Results:
OJI plugin is not found to be a valid Java Plugin

Expected Results:
Include the Java VM version it provides in the text description.
