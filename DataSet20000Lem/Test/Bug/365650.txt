i have not requested firefox, it just override what ever i am doing and appears. I lose what i am doing and when i try to remove firefox ( which is difficult because it show up at the top and so i cannot access to close a window) what i wa doing is gone and i have to start over. then in the middle of what i am doing firefox will show up again and override what i am doing. so, i downloaded it so that it will leave me alone (as you can see, i am not computer literate) but now it will not allow me to access what i wa doing before. it say i need more plugins (which i didnt for the same thing before) and when i try to download, it tell me that i cannot connect and the wizard cannot finish so now i cannot even do what i wa doing before!! i do not like this system and if it cannot be corrected i want it to stop showing up on my computer. how can i do this?
