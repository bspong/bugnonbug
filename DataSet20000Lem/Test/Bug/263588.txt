Refuses to load links/new page after having many windows/tabs open, address bar stop responding.

Difficult to reproduce in exact steps, but in general, I usually have 5-12
actual FireFox window open at any time, with a varying number of tab within
each going. After awhile (~2-5 day continuously open, browsing about 3 hr a
day), I'll click on a link or attempt to open a new web page and Firefox will
hang... alt-tabbing to a new application, then returning to Firefox will bring
*some* partial functionality (able to go between the tabs, able to scroll, able
to close tabs, but that's it). At that point, the swirling "Loading" icon on
the tab is there but doe not move. Clicking on tab is slowed down
substantially, and clicking on the tab which initially froze everything produce
a gray screen, eventually causing Windows to call Firefox "Not Responding".

During this time, the address bar take the address of one of the tab in the
window, but fails to update/change a I click on other tabs. Right-click menu
are very slow to load (10 second - sometimes never) and are unresponsive, a is
every function in Firefox which would create a new window/dialog box. Closing
tab at this point works...but fails to free up RAM occupied by Firefox. Once
all of the window have been manually closed, Firefox.exe still remains resident
in memory, still holding onto all of the RAM it wa prior to the crash. For
some reason, Firefox seems to consume ~123MB of RAM during this, page file'd
portion being about double that. The only "remedy" at this point is to open up
Task Manager, End Task on Firefox.exe, then start over... very annoying when
you're in the middle of a few research project and have thing grouped by window.
