When working with proxy turned on, going to a website that requires logging in such a hotmail.com, the webpage load but when you try to log in the page doesn't load and you get a Network Timeout, this also happens when trying to visit addons.mozilla.org and bugzilla.mozilla.org but in these case the page doesn't open at all (I've had to log this bug in IE, with the same proxy on in IE everything work fine). With proxy turned off in FireFox everything work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on proxy
2. Visit a page that requires logging in, such a hotmail.com
3. Try to log in
Actual Results:
Nothing will happen, the loading bar at the bottom will remain empty and after a while you will get a screen saying 'Network Timeout. The server at login.live.com is taking too long to respond.'

Expected Results:
The page should have logged in to my account

My proxy were 'edupass' port '800'
When visiting addons.mozilla.org and bugzilla.mozilla.org I get the same error but the page doesn't load at all, mozilla.org doe work
