THe adobe 7 plugin work every time in the first tab of a multi tab session. The
problem occurs when there are no pdf's viewed in the first tab and you open a
pdf in the second or higher tab the pdf fails to display. If a pdf is opened in
the first tab then the later tab will display the pdfs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox that ha teh adobe 7 plugin and open about 4 tab
2.In the fourth tab attempt to view a pdf (
http://cs.ua.edu/202/new202FPnotes/FrontPage%201.pdf ,to make it easy)


Actual Results:
Firefox act like it load the pdf, but fails to display it leave a blank canvas
the same color a the border.

Expected Results:
Displayed the loaded pdf.

If you go back and load a pdf in the first tab, the pdf in the forth tab will
suddenly display. The pdf do not have to be related at all. As long a the Pdf
is in the first tab it work fine close the first tab pdf(ie: by going to a new
page) then the fourth tab will stop displaying again if you refresh it.

I have found no log message relating to it on my system.
