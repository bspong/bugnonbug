When exiting Firefox with both the "Always clear my private data when I close Firefox" and "Ask me before clearing private data" option enabled, the Clear Private Data dialog appears a normal when exiting Firefox. However, the button labeled "Clear Private Data" in that dialog doesn't work. Clicking it doe not do anything - it doesn't clear any private data, and it also doesn't dismiss the dialog.

This is different from other similar reported bugs, because in this case, using the Clear Private Data option from the Tools menu or in the Options dialog work properly. The problem only occurs when exiting Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable "Always clear my private data when I close Firefox".
2. Enable "Ask me before clearing private data".
3. Close Firefox.
4. Click the "Clear Private Data" button on the resulting dialog.
Actual Results:
Nothing. The button behaved a any good Windows button will, but no private data wa cleared and the dialog didn't go away.

Expected Results:
The dialog should have been dismissed and the selected private data should have been cleared.

This may be related to updating to the latest version of NoScript (1.1.6). However, I maintain that it is a Firefox bug rather than a bug with NoScript, because it should not be possible for an extension to block the functionality of the CPD dialog under any circumstances.
