Bookmarks toolbar after bookmark import (from JSON, or HTML file) doesn't contain saved icon (*.ico).
Moreover, when any of bookmark is updated and icon appears on toolbar, after Firefox restart it's lost again.
Checked on Linux Mandiva 32-bit, Windows 7 64-bit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Collect some bookmark into Bookmars Toolbar.
2.Make sure all of them have own icon (*.ico) on left side (it's enough to wait until site is loaded fully)
3.Make a copy of your Bookmarks (Import/Export -> Make a backup).
4.Delete all of the bookmark (I've reinstalled the system)
5.Restore saved bookmark (Import/Export -> Restore from JSON file).
6.Look at Bookmarks Toolbar again - there are just default BLUE FLOWER icon at each of bookmark.
7.ONLY DO AFTER IMPORT: refresh some page from Bookmarks Toolbar to get *ico file appeared on Bookmarks Toolbar.
8. ONLY DO AFTER 7: restart browser and see how the icon dissapeared.
Actual Results:
1. Bookmarks toolbar after bookmark import doesn't contain saved icon (*.ico)
2. After import - even when you reload some page from Bookmarks Toolbar - icon are stored just temporarily and don't show after restart.

Expected Results:
1. Saved icon (*.ico) should be stored in JSON file.
2. Bookmars Toolbar should contain icon picture (*.ico) after (1) import Bookmarks AND (2) refreshing some page AND (3) browser restart.
