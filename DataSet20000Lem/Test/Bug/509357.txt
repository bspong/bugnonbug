When i go to homepages, pressing buttons, changing page on list my cpu get up too 100% sometimes not always but it happens sometimes
(it doe not just go to 100% the siter stop load until the cpu go down again which take a while sometimes)

i dident notice it first but my friend told me his cpu get up to 100% sometimes (he ha a really good computer)

i had notice it for a while that my internet speed wa really slow but only when i wa visiting site in mozzila. so then i checked it upp and it happend on mine computer and my gfs computer (all have 3.5.2 also happend in 3.5.1)
