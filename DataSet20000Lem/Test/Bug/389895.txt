Places db is full of useless redirect entry

This is fallout/side effect from bug 381453. Tho that bug intended for the url to not be displayed in the History sidebar since they were not really a url a user would understand or want to browse to. And to maintain Fx2 parity.

Most are ad laden junk entry from my investigation while browsing places.sqlite w/ the Sqlite Database Browser utility:
http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=87946


If you navigate to Browse Data > Table: moz_places, you'll see them here. Depending on your surfing habit of ad infested site w/o Adblock installed, I believe these quite easily bloat places.sqlite unnecessarily.

So the question is, if these url are not worthy enough to display/intended to be viewed why continue to hold them in the db for more than a day or session?

I may be wrong but I thought that bug 319455 fixed this inadvertently or partially. And I guess my other question was: I can't always remember pre Fx 2 version or trunk for that matter saving these kind of url at all - how did they handle these url when it came to storage? This may have been introduced from the Mork move to sqlite.
