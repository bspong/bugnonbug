Hello,

I use Firefox for long time, always having the last version.
Since, I got 2.0.0.9 I have lot of problem with memory usage and CPU usage from Firefox.

I use to always have firefox open with two window and seven open tabs.
First window with a account on the old interface of mail.yahoo.com, an account on gmail.com on my local ISP webmail, slashdot and slashgear.com
Second windows, radio-canada.ca/nouvelles and cyberpresse.ca

Since I have 2.0.0.9, firefox is now @ 200mg and 97% CPU on a system with athlon 3500+ (2,2 ghz, single core 64bit cpu) with 1g of ram.

that really huge usage of memory and CPU.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two window of mozilla
2. Open five site in the two window
3. look the machine be unusable
Actual Results:
Firefox use 97% CPU and 200m of memory, the computer become unresponsible. I need to open the task manager to kill firefox... how sad is it !

Expected Results:
Less CPU power (less than 20% usage) and le memory usage (less than 60m)
