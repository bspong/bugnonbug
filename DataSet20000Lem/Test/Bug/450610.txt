Firefox freeze when History Menu or sidebar is opened

Anytime I click on the 'History' menu on the menu bar, or try to open the History sidebar, I get the colorful spinning wheel of death. The browser immediately freezes, and I can't click anywhere on the window or even on the Apple menu. It even lock up my dock menu thing (i.e. I can't force quit by holding down the mouse on the 'Mozilla' icon). In order to force quit it, I have to click onto another open application, wait a while for it to switch, then go to the force quit menu directly from the Apple menu.

It sucks, because my immediate instinct anytime I accidentally close a tab I'd been using is to go to History > Recently Closed Tabs. It work fine in FF2 on my machine also, only break with FF3, and ha been this way since I installed it on Download Day.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on History menu, from anywhere.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Mac spinning wheel of death.

Expected Results:
Opened the History drop down menu.

I don't use any themes, but I am using the Firefox profile manager to run FF2 and FF3 simultaneously.
