I have a laptop on which I connect a monitor at home. The monitor replaces the laptop screen. (No dual screen or extended desktop). This monitor ha a higher resolution then the laptop screen.

If firefox is running while doing that a very small window appears ON TOP. It is 236px in width and 1px in height and it is entirely filled with the color #9C967B. The position of this window is either top left of my screen or on the bottom right of the old screen resolution.

When all window of firefox are closed, this window remains and the firefox process keep running. Running firefox again cause this process to be reused. firefox.exe ha to be closed by the task manager to get rid of this bug.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox and navigate to a website
2. Attach a monitor with a different resolution, but keep operating under single window.
3. The tiny window appears somewhere and is on top of every application
4. Exit all window of firefox
Actual Results:
Firefox keep running

Expected Results:
Firefox close and no window should remain behind
