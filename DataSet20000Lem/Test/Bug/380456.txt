"window names" for window.open / target are not global (multiple window can have the same name)

Window name do not seem to be universal, but instead are only recognized by the original opening window and it children.

Example:

site a, b and c all have link to one another (each link opening the respective site in a window of the same name. If site a is open and the user open both site b and c and then try to open site b from site c, two site b window (both with the name "b") will now exist: the one originally opened by site a and the one opened from site c.

Expected behaviour: the site b opened from site c should have open ed in the existing window named "b" which wa opened from site a.

Note: this is happened across site (different hosts). I have not checked to see if the behaviour is identical within a site.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a site A with link to two other sites. These link use javascript window.open() to open other site in uniquely named window (B & C).
2. Click on one of the link to open site B in window B.
3. Click on the other link to open site C in window C.
4. Site C ha a link which us javascript window.open to open site B in window B. click on this link.
Actual Results:
A second instance of site B will now be opened. There will now be two window both named "B".

Expected Results:
The link should have caused site B to open in the existing window B.

It look like window are only aware of the name of their child and their children's child in a tree hierarchy (one way down). They have no awareness of window opened by their parent or other windows.

Again, this may be a specifically cross-site (different host) problem.

this problem doe NOt occur with any other browser (safari, IE6, IE7).
