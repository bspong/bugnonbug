The most recent upgrade of Mozilla Firefox installed itself, and function have disappeared from Bookmarks pull down menu. I can no longer Bookmark a
New Page nor Organize Bookmarks. I have View/Status Bar checked, and all three View/Toolbars checked.

There is probably some key to press to restore Bookmarks pulldown menu, but I don;t know what they are, or where to find them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.L Click Bookmarks Pulldown
3.R Click Bookmarks Pulldown
Actual Results:
After I r-clicked Bookmarks pull down, I checked an open box, and the problem wa cured. I stumbled on the solution by accident. Seems like this should not happen with an upgrade, or a note provided with upgrade a to how to restore lost functiobs.

Expected Results:
Functional Defect caused by upgrade corrected.

Upgrade should not have changed settings,
