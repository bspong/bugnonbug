there is a frameset on http://www.shopdigital.hu/ which contains this line:
<frame src="middleframe.php" name="middleFrame" scrolling="auto" frameborder="no">

The middle frame should scroll if longer than the screen, but it doesn't scroll.
I'm not sure is the stylesheet ha an effect on this behaviour.
The CSS contains these line (among others):
overflow-x:hidden;
overflow-y:hidden;

Sorry about my poor English.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.shopdigital.hu/
2. Choose a specific digital camera or a manufacturer with lot of camera
3. Try to scroll with the mouse, there is no scrollbar and the mouse wheel/touchpad ha no effect

Actual Results:
No scrollba appeared, can't scroll with mouse/touchpad at all, only with up/down arrow

Scrollbar appears, normal scrolling with mouse, mouse wheel, touchpad

IE 6.0 and Firefox 1.0.* is perfectly working with this site, Firefox 1.5.* and above ha the problem described above.
