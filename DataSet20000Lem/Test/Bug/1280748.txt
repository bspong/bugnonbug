Steps to reproduce:

Back in 2010, there wa a bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=618353 . I wasn't an active Firefox user back then so I've no idea what it might look back then, but a for today, I found Firefox's window frame is one pixel too thin comparing to other windows.

And the weird thing is, when border is 1px too thin, the close button is 2px too near to the border (that is, even if the window frame is fixed, the button is still 1px too near) - I don't know why is this happening, perhaps something to do with the patch linked with the older bug I mentioned at the beginning.

Now, please check the image attached. I've draw two red line across three windows: the inner (left) line is the border of window content (for a browser it should be webpage), the outer (right) line is window outside border. There are three window aligned alone the outer line: Windows Explorer (as example of standard window frame), Firefox (nothing changed) and the Firefox I've "fixed" with Photoshop: I've moved the upper-right corner button by 2px, made border 1px thicker (in fact I did this with css, but that wouldn't work on the upper-right corner buttons) and added the bright line (outside window content) which Firefox have removed back.

I can understand that removing the bright line is meant to fit Firefox's design, but in my opinion that shouldn't affect window frame thickness. Even if the window frame is made 1px thinner than a normal window by design to counteract the extra 1px transparent area after removing the bright line, or just doing that so we have 2px extra width when browsing webpage - there is absolutely no reason to move the upper-right corner buttons.

I wa using Google Chrome before the recent change to Firefox so I know that Chrome also have this dame problem (the button are even more closed to window border, they look ugly!) but that doesn't mean Firefox need to follow this stupid design right?


BTW, both window frame and upper-right corner button are fine when maximized.
