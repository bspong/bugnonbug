The problem is simple and i can not believe it ha not been addressed:

Firefox start allocating memory since it start and a you browse web page and never seem to release most of it. it grows in size so quickly that it pass 100M in le than an hour.... ( i do not have any plugins enabled).

I tested this for a long time on various machine including: VISTA x64, XP64, XP32 and all have the same problem...
