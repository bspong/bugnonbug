a. When you attempt to Print Preview with the Print Spooler service stopped,
Mozilla fails to render the preview. (This is expected behavior.)
b. However, if you start the Print Spooler service and then attempt to Print
Preview, Mozilla will continue to fail to render the preview or print.
c. If you exit and restart Mozilla, Print Preview functionality will be restored.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Stop Print Spooler service
2. Go to website (any website will do)
3. File | Print Preview (will cause "unknown error")
4. Start Print Spooler service
5. File | Print Preview (will cause "unknown error")
6. Exit FireFox, restart
7. File | Print Preview (will succeed)

Actual Results:
post-Step 3: "An unknown error ha occurred while printing."
post-Step 5: "An unknown error ha occurred while printing."
post-Step 7: Succeeded.

Expected Results:
At step 5, FireFox should have succeeded the Print Preview.
