Hi,

I came across a very weird problem with the Textbox control of any HTML website. The “4k character problem” is described below ::

The Textbox under test wa defined a follows ::

<input type="text" ID="TextBox1" name="TextBox1">

After i type in 4000 (“4k”) character in the text field i wa not be able to SEE any further character which wa typed by me, though the cursor keep on moving further and i saw a space (“ “) being typed instead of the character which i entered. Now assuming that after i typed 4005 character (out of which only first 4000 char wa visible ) i send the data to the server using POST method, the server receives the complete set of 4005 characters, which mean the textbox is accepting the input but is not able to display it !!!

What is the reason that i wa not able to see whatever i typed after the 4000th character. (Let me declare that i did not have any client side script running which might have been responsible for the same)


Thanking you

Ronak
