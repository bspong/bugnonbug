Memory usage start to increase every few hours. At 9AM for instance, my memory usage wa around 80k, then at 11am it wa 90k (I attributed this to a flash site I wa opening), which wa closed later and now at 12.31pm (my time) the memory is at 103.5k.

The same thing happened after lunch, when I closed the browser around 12.45pm and then went out for lunch around 1pm. Came back an hour later and memory wa again at 103.5k thereabouts.

The only thing I did wa to keep GMail, Livejournal, Meebo and Google Docs open. The rest were opened and closed on an as-and-when basis.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox a per normal. When running and browsing, open task manager. Note memory usage.
2. Reopen task manager about an hour or so after the first time.
3. Rinse, repeat.
Actual Results:
Memory usage kept increasing and eventually slowed down the PC's performance. Was unable to use Opera and switching from one window to another had a one, two second lag instead of being instant.

Expected Results:
Memory usage should not have increased and I should still be able to swap window after a few hours.

Default theme used. I also have these plugins installed, but all but Chatzilla have been updated. They are:

- IE Tab
- Video Download
- Brit. English Dictionary. Thanks.
