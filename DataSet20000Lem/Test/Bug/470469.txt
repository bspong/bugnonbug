I have a laptop computer which is sometimes hooked up to an external display. When I have that display on, I have the FireFox browser on that display.

When I go home, I put the computer to sleep, don't shut it down, with all program still open.

When I open the computer again, and don't have the second display plugged in, Firefox is hidden from view.

I have to right click the program in the task bar, and select move. Then use the arrow key to move the browser to the main laptop display.

When i click the file browser dialog from any webpage, when I am uploading file for example, the dialog appears on the disabled display and there is no way for me to move that dialog to the laptop display.

The only thing I can do is close Firefox down, and restart the program.

It seems like Firefox still think the other monitor is in use.

I have UltraMon running on the computer if that help any ...
