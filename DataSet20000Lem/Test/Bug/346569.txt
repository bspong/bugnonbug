"That depends on what we want to achieve with the flash notification in the
first place:
* only note about new tab being added off-screen
* note about all sort of stuff going on in off-screen tab

The second (more comprehensive) alternative would probably not only include a
notification for automatically loading new URLs in off-screen tabs, but also a
notification about tab being closed off-screen, tab being refreshed/reloaded
off-screen, etc. Not sure where that'd be to stop...

Then there's the issue then that user might think that all tab are replaced
with the bookmark folder while technically it's only their content which is
replaced. OTOH I doubt that many will notice the (missing) flashing at all.

Anyway since this is an edge case to an edge case (loading a big bookmark group
while having a lot of tab open) I'd not worry too much about it and probably
go with the technically simpler solution we've got now (at least for Firefox
2)."
