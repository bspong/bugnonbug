Firefox won't start
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier:

I downloaded Firefox 1.5 and installed it on my system, a Compaq Presario 2199US laptop running Windows XP 5.1.2600. Except for one successful start after the initial install, Firefox now will not start at all. No matter what method I use to start it (command line, direct opening of the executable, shortcut, associated file,) it will load the program (the firefox.exe entry becomes visible in Task Manager's Processes list,) and then immediately quit. I have tried soft rebooting, hard rebooting, and a complete uninstall/reinstall, but the problem persists.
Until this problem is fixed, is there somewhere I could download an older version of Firefox? I believe 1.4 worked just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a system like mine, described in the summary.
2. Install Firefox 1.5.
3. After closing the initial opening of Firefox, restart Firefox by any method.

Actual Results:
Nothing, essentially. The program is loaded and then immediately quits, without even displaying anything.

Expected Results:
Open a new Firefox window.

No custom theme wa in use. My computer's configuration is described in the summary.
