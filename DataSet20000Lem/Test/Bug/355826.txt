I often have multiple window of Firefox open with multiple tabs. When switching between windows, I click on the top of the window. Sometimes this cause a different tab on the window I click on to be displayed. Unfortunately for testing purposes, it is not consistent. Sometimes it will do it every time I switch windows, but when I tested it dozen of time just now it only did it three times. I think there may be a relation to where on the window that you click and which tab is selected for display, since it is always a tab close to the middle and that is where I click. When I tested it, it did not happen enough to tell. Also, I think you may have to keep going to different website rather than just clicking back and forth between them. The bug is only a significant problem when it change on each switch between windows. When that happens, it can be extremely annoying.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two Firefox window and open four tab in each. It help to use different website for each tab so that you can keep them straight.
2. Switch back and forth between them while visiting multiple different website in between the switches. It is most successful if you do it while you are actually using the browser rather than testing it.
3. See if the tab displayed changes.
Actual Results:
Tab displayed change when clicking on the top of the window.

Expected Results:
The tab that you left displayed should still be displayed.

I have changed a lot of preference through about:config. However, the problem started before I made most of the change (and possibly all of them) and none of the change are relevant to tabbed browsing. The one that I may have changed before the problem started were mostly dom.* preferences.
