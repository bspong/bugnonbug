Simply opening zhopa.net result in a viral process running, and dropping a
payload. In my case the payload ha been detected by AVG and deleted. The
initial viral process seems to run (according to Task Manager) from the binary
called bitmap.tmp.

What's particularly bad about this, is that there is no user interaction
required to run a binary off of a malicious web site.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Have AVG antivirus installed
Have Task Manager open

1. Type zhopa.net in address bar and hit enter
2. Watch your box get infected
3. Enjoy:-)

Actual Results:
1. Task manager briefly show "bitmap.tmp" process. The process seems to run
only briefly, so Task Manager won't show it every time, you might have to try it
several time

2. AVG antivirus report infected file "sbar[1]" in the cache directory, which
get deleted all by itself.

3. AVG antivirus report infected file C:\WINDOWS\system32\t.exe.


Expected Results:
:-)
