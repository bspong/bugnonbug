Do not test with the Windows High Contrast themes. These theme are not usable in the wrold world since they also strip out graphic and navigation objects. They also, somehow, sometimes resolve this problem and change colour on the fly.

For a fuller test go through all Windows object and change all font/background setting to white on black. To aid troubleshooting it can help to use unusual colour such a lime green text on a red background - such colour make it easier to see which colour have not been set in the user interface and which have defaulted to the OS colour settings.

It is also impossible to see the text on Tabs too.
