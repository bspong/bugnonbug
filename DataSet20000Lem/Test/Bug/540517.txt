double clicking a flash object dispatch keyboard event that can be caught inside the flash code. this make the mouse action behave exactly like pressing keyboard key in the following order:
1. key down - char code 17
2. key down - char code 45
3. key up - char code 45
4. key up - char code 17

this is confirmed in window version of FF 3.5 and 3.6b
this behavior doe not happen in: IE7, IE8, Safari and FF 3.5 under Ubuntu linux.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto http://www.vayer.com/dblclickbug/
there is a simple example written in Adobe Flex.
2. double click the button few time
Actual Results:
char code of pressed key will be added to the textbox


Expected Results:
nothing should be added to the text area. mouse action should not dispatch keyboard events.

right click the flash object, select "view source" to understand what is going on (trivial code). this work a expected in IE and Safari browser and in FF on linux.
current behaviour is very disturbing because of character code 45 - this is like pressing the `insert` button on the keyboard. it make all text-input field switch between `insert` and `type over` writing modes. making the use of flex application very annoying.

*** please let me know when i can remove the example from my webserver ***

thanks and good luck!
