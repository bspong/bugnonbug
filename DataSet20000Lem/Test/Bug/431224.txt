'open tab' get slow and slower during a browsing session

Over the course of a few hour of browsing -- a few hundred new tab --, cmd-t (open a new tab) go from being immediate to taking a second or two. I'd not noticed this until the most recent update, to 2.0.0.14.

This seems not to be a syndrome previously reported: Opening a new window is still fast; opening a link in a new tab is also fast. Closing a tab is fast, and so is switching tabs. It's just opening a new blank tab that is slow.

Workaround: restart firefox daily or twice daily.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox anew
2. browse the web by opening a new tab every time you do a google search, a hundred or two time
3. hit cmd-t just one more time
4. continue browsing, then hit cmd-t
Actual Results:
At (2), a new tab open immediately with the cursor in the address bar. At (3), a new tab pop up immediately, then I wait for a noticeable 1 or 2 second before the focus go to the address bar of the new tab. At (4), it take a noticeable 1 or 2 second before the new tab opens, then a bit longer before the focus moves.
