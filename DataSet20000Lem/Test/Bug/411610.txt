I wa going through, organizing bookmark by tags, a I have been doing on and off for some time, when the bookmark 'star' suddenly quit allowing bookmark folder to be moved automatically from certain folder to others.

Moving those bookmark manually from the sidebar also fails - no error generated, drag and drop simply ha no actual effect. Firefox open the affected bookmark without issue and seems to append tag fine, however accessing the affected folder from place organizer give the following error

[Assertion Failed]
ASSERT: empty URL spec
Stack Trace:
0:PU__uri(null)
1:PTV_getCellText(4,[object TreeColumn])

Restoring bookmark from backup file ha no effect. Have not yet attempted reinstall. No obvious cause.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
open place organizer and select the affected folder.
Actual Results:
open place organizer and select the affected folder.

Expected Results:
show the bookmark in the folder

[Assertion Failed]
ASSERT: empty URL spec
Stack Trace:
