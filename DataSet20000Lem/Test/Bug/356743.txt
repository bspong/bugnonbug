* Short Description:
If there is more than one plugin for a MIME-type installed, Firefox doesn't always correctly inform the user which plugin will be used.

There is a forum discussion on this issue: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=474607
There is an existing bugzilla report (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19118) that list related issue of the Plugin Manager, but that bug is listed a an enhancement, and seems to be stuck in limbo. I believe my bug is addressing a more specific defect.

* Longer Description:
(Also read the forum link above)
Basically, in my test, I have 2 plugins that handle TIF image (MIME types: image/tiff, image/x-tiff). The 2 plugins are Quicktime Plugin 7.1 (npqtplugin7.dll) and AlternaTIFF (npzzatif.dll).

The "about:plugins" page show both plugins a "Enabled=Yes" for these MIME types. This cause minor confusion.

The main problem is that the Profile Manager (titled: Download Actions) doe not always list the correct action. On one computer I have, it wa correct. On another computer I have, it said "Open with AlternaTIFF", but in fact, Firefox used Quicktime to open it.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Quicktime such that a plugin is enabled to open TIF images.
2. Install AlternaTIFF (http://www.alternatiff.com/)
3. See both plugins listed in "about:plugins"
4. See which plugin is listed in "Download Actions"
5. Download a test TIF image (e.g. http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/fax/QSTA00.TIF)
6. See if the plugin list in "Download Actions" wa the plugin used to view the image.
7. If the correct plugin wa used, try to disable, then re-enable Quicktime support of TIF image (in Quicktime: go to Edit > Preferences > QT Prefs > Browser: click MIME Settings)
8. repeat from step 4.

Actual Results:
In some cases, the plugin listed in "Download Actions" in not the plugin that Firefox actually uses.

Expected Results:
The plugin the Firefox us should match the one listed in "Download Actions"
