Tab drag&drop can confuse tabbrowser

If you heavily drag and drop tab around, it can happen that tabbrowser loses
count of the tab and behaves strangely. Symptoms include: a tab can't be moved
to the end; the tab at the end can't be closed with Ctrl+W; when closing the
last tab, a warning about closing 2 tab is shown; the tabbar can get
"disconnected" from the browser.

This ha been reproduced on today's nightly, on a clean profile, in safe-mode.
So it's surely not related to extension problem (no dupe of the FLST bug 304456).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open your homepage and two additional (blank) tabs.
2. Move the third tab to the start and close it.
3. Move the tab with your homepage to the end.
4. Close both tab with Ctrl+W.
Actual Results:
Step 3 fails and step 4 result in the warning about closing multiple tab (if
it work at all). Occasionally, after step 3 the browser is not usable anymore,
since the tabbar seems disconnected (not tabbable, no active tab).

Expected Results:
Steps 3 and 4 succeed without warning or error in the console (I've seen once:
Error: uncaught exception: 2147500037 and some error in tabbrowser.xml due to
the absence of a tab - such a failing to call removeTab).
