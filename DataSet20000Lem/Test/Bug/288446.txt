Since a day I changed the screen resolution with Dark Basic a few time with
FireFox opened (other apps never did this), the Bookmarks and status bar are
continously changing their height (by 5 pixel or so each one), so if the
status bar change it's height, it's just annoying. But also the bookmark menu
does, and when it does, the "screen" where the webpage is seen go up and down
because the bookmark bar get thicker and thiner and make reading very
difficult. Also I noticed that all my Bookmarks are gone and I had to put them
back again. The Weather toolbar that go at the Bookmarks ha never left.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Guess it was:
1. Opening Mozilla FireFox (I had some www.DarkBasic.com window opened)
2. I opened Dark Basic demo (IDE), which changed my screen resolution from
1024x768x32 to 800x600x16, and then to 1024x768x16 and so when I wa executing
the code.
3. I pressed Alt+Tab to check another tutorial, so Dark Basic went minimized
Actual Results:
The bug started :( and the bookmark were gone. I mean:
"the Bookmarks and status bar are continously changing their height (by 5
pixel or so each one)". They looked like hiperactive.

Expected Results:
Not deleting my bookmark and keep the bookmark and status (the bar at the
lower part of the screen) bar at their original height.

Note: Just to let you know, when I close or open a tab it stop moving, but
sometimes it just come back by entering into a new webpage or something.
