Whenever I go to
http://www.renotahoefun.com/casino/virtualcasino/funkyfruit2/index.html, only a
partial shockwave image is displayed. Rather than try to describe what it look
like, I have posted a screen shot at http://www.quincycam.us/failure.jpg. This
is not the entire page, but I believe I included enough to demonstraate the
problem. This page work perfectly in IE6, but for some reason, it and Mozilla
don;t like each other.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just go to the page with Mozilla
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Same thing, just a described and available for your viewing pleasure at
http://www.quincycam.us/failure.jpg.

Expected Results:
It should look like this screen shot of the same page a rendered on IE6:
http://www.quincycam.us/good.jpg

I'm no programmer, so I don't know how much more help I can be. The site itself
(renotahoefun.com) ha no technical support whatsoever, and I'll be darned if I
can find anything at Macromedia's place, either. I hope I'm not wasting your
time. Please feel free to contact me if necessary.
