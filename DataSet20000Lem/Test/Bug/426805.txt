The Copy-drag seems to go pretty unchecked in Places, it allows copying of the All Bookmarks which is not normally allowed. Also of note, it allows copying of the 3 main sub-folders in the right-hand pane, but usually you can do that through copy-paste.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ctrl-drag the All Bookmarks in Places
2. Drop it in Unfiled Bookmarks
Actual Results:
Firefox will hang the first time you do this. If you kill the process and go back to place you can navigate the circular folder without problem, but attempting to drag the All Bookmarks again (with or without ctrl) will hang. Also, trying to copy the Unfiled bookmark in the right pane after doing this will hang.

Expected Results:
I don't think it should be possible to duplicate the All Bookmarks in the first place.

This is another way to hit Bug 424884, but this one cause a hang.
The tag folder doesn't allow dragging or copy-dragging, we should probably do the same to All Bookmarks.
