Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

Watched any video or surf any page on the internet.


Actual results:

The firefox browser 5.0 freeze after so many minute about 15 minute into watching a movie or watching anything on youtube it freeze occasionally within 3 minute apart. ONLY the firefox broswer is doing this nothing on my system freeze only the browser!


Expected results:

Well it should play the video don't you think?
I have unistalled firefox and then installed it different time and still run into the freezing bug. My laptop is NEW out of the box, and after i unistalled firefox I had installed google chrome to see if the broswer wa the problem and sadly it wa your browser causing the mishap. I then unistalled google chrome and installed firefox back and and the same problem happened, and it ha happened ever since the stupid update from firefox 3.1 version to the new 5.

And NO i will not do anything a in fix my file on my NEW laptop when ALL browser are working but FIREFOX. It's sad that i have to switch to google chrome or IE 9 now, I have been using firefox for many years, and now this is happening , I believe Firefox should fix the problem before moving on to developing another browser version, or else firefox will eventually die, no one want a browser that doe NOT work!
