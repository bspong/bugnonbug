Forced to move back to Firebird 0.7 a save dialogue doesn't work correctly.
In Yahoo mail, when downloading an attachment, click to download file (after
scanning) and the save a dialogue appears.

The 'functionality' pull-down menu option don't have any option other than the
one currently selected and the save button doesn't appear or function correctly.

The same thing occured during the installation routine - the change default
install directory is not displayed correctly under Windows NT - work fine under
Windows 2000.

A similar corruption is displayed for the bookmark tool where the ok button is
displayed a a thin horizontal line - the pulldown option don't work correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install on window NT
Actual Results:
1. Custom install directory dialogue doesn't work - different directory input
window isn't displayed.
2. Add to Bookmark dialogue doesn't work properly - pulldown doesn't have
any other options, 'add bookmark' button is only a thin horizontal
button. Selecting another directory doesn't work.
3. Save a dialogue doesn't work properly - pulldown doesn't have any other
options, 'OK' button not displayed.


Expected Results:
The dialogue should work the same a those displayed in Windows 2000 for
Mozilla Firefox 0.8
