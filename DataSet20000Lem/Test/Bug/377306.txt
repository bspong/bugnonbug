When trying to Move bookmarks, they don't show up a being moved until Organize Bookmarks... is closed and then re-opened. Even then, the Move process doe not always work.

Same with clicking X for delete. The deletion don't show up until Organize Bookmarks... is closed and then re-opened.

I have 20 bookmark which I moved to a sub-folder, yet they are still hanging out under the "Root" top level. In other words, they were apparently copied rather than Moved even though I used the Move icon.

I can't delete them from the "Root" top level, either. Why? Because they don't show up in Organize Bookmarks... a being in the "Root" top level although they certainly are there in the Bookmarks pull down itself.

Cut and Paste of a bookmark also doe not work, even though Cut and Paste are option under Edit within Organize Bookmarks...

Never had these problem under FF 1.5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create multiple bookmark in top level
2.create subfolder
3.highlight in blue the string of consecutive bookmark you want to move or delete
4.if deleting, click X. Nothing happens. (It would be preferable to show the result right then and there without having to Close and reopen)
5.if moving, click Move. Nothing happens. (It would be preferable to show the result right then and there without having to Close and reopen)
6. close and reopen Organize Bookmarks...
7. if you're lucky, the BM will have been Deleted or Moved. More likely, it will still be in it original place.
Actual Results:
same problem

Expected Results:
see above 1-7. It would be preferable to show the result right then and there without having to Close and reopen. Also, Moving and Deleting should actually occur a desired.
