Without warning Firefox ha over-written all of my saved Safari (OSX 10.3.9) file
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/312.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/312.5
Build Identifier: Firefox

Firefox ha overwritten all of my saved Safari files. when I have tried to open one of these, the file is either incomplete, i.e. link do not work, link are missing, key info is missing and often the file opened look "choppy". It look like it ha been cut up and not put together properly. I can't use the file now and some of them are very important. Can I still keep Firefox for a browser and NOT have it over write my Safari files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on file icon
2.file open but is not completely useable
3. over written file is incomplete; information ha been omitted

Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
same a I indicated above; the file seem corrupted by Firefox

Firefox should have saved the file created in Firefox and not overwrite my saved Safari files. Please tell me what to do to use my Safari file in the form they were saved. I am not a tech wizard, which I'm sure you can see, but I like Firefox a lot. I just would like to access my saved file in the form and format they were created in. If you can help me I would be very appreciative. Thank You much.
