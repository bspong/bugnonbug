Greasemonkey and PDF OS X plugin halt Firefox execution since 3.6.12
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12

This morning Firefox failed to start. I suspect that Firefox updated automatically to 3.6.12 last night, before shutdown.

Starting from CLI made no difference and there were no error messages.
Starting from CLI in '-safe-mode' worked and allowed disabling of all addons/plugins.
Starting from CLI in '-migration' mode resulted in a crash - report sent through crash manager.

Once plugins/addons were disabled, Firefox started normally. I then re-enabled addons until I wa able to find those responsible for the failed startup.

The two plugins which cause Firefox to fail to start are:

1. Greasemonkey 0.8.20100408.6
2. Firefox PDF Plugin for Mac OS X 1.1.3

It appears that the 3.6.12 change have caused these plugins to fail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable/install Greasemonkey and/or PDF Plugin
2. Restart Firefox (3.6.12)
3. Firefox will quit without any notification
Actual Results:
Firefox icon bounce on Dock, application exits.

If started from CLI, application just quits without any stdout/stderr messages.

Expected Results:
Start and work??? :)
