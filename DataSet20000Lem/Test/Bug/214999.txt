When I veiw the cooky (Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies > View Cookies),
and I select a cookie it display information (such a name, content, domain,
etc.). However, a policy doesn't show up on any of the cookies. It just say
"Policy:" I can see the policy elsewhere, but if I look at the same cookie here
it doesn't say anything!

This seems to have used to work with an older version, now I'm using the latest
nightly build.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies and select "Enable Cookies" and
also select "From the originating web site only"
2.Go to a bunch of website that you know put cooky that have a policy into
your computer.
3.Now click on Tools > Options > Privacy > Cookies >
4.Select a cookie. Look at the information about it, and look at the place where
it say "Policy:"

Actual Results:
Nothing appeared next to where it said "Policy:", even on cooky that do have a
policy.

Expected Results:
On cooky that have a policy it should display "Policy: [Policy of cookie here]"
