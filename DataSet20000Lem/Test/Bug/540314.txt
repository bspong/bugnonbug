Actual Results:
As above. Page froze.

Expected Results:
I should be able to enter a new URL, click a button or do anything else on an active page.

As above. I did not have any problem whatsoever with previous version. This started happening when I wa automatically upgraded to mozilla 5.0. The other day a pop-up appeared saying that mozilla installed update and system would shut down. I had no choice to postpone the shut down. It just did in the middle of what I wa doing. Since that happened, I've had problem with this new version 5.0 ever since. I am running window xp o/s on an HP elitebook 8530p. I have 4gb ram. I work with several browser window open and Photoshop oftentimes and it ha never been a problem until now. Thanks in advance for your help.
