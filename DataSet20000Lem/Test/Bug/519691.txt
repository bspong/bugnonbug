"Print" button is greyed out when Firefox 3 is run from a machine acting a CUPS client, eg ha no running CUPS deamon but us a /etc/cups/client.conf file instead. This is the case especially when the CUPS server is running CentOS 5. Other application than Firefox 3 are not affected. Other distribution than CentOS might not be affected by the bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Stop the CUPS daemon on the machine you run Firefox on.
2. Create a /etc/cups/client.conf file. Add the directive "ServerName myprintserver" in this file. The value myprintserver is the host name or the IP-address of the CUPS server of your network.
3. Open a page in Firefox and choose "File" -> "Print".
Actual Results:
The list of printer appears a expected. When mouse focus is placed on a printer the print button is grayed out and no printing can be performed. This is the case when CUPS is running on CentOS 5. If there are other host running CUPS on some other distribution and CUPS daemon is stopped on the CentOS server, printing worked.

Expected Results:
Print button to be not greyed out and that pressing "print" would be possible.

This bug doe not not appear in other client applications. Thunderbird (v.2) and Konqueror (v3), which where other test applications, were able to print normally a expected under the same setup(s). This bug is also present on network that have several CUPS server running. In one case where two servers/host are both Ubuntu Linux machine the print button is not greyed out, but pressing "Print" return an error. In case where the primary print server is CentOS 5 the "Print" button is always grayed out - but only in Firefox 3.x, not other client applications. This bug prevents many LTSP (Linux Terminal Services Project) user from printing from Firefox.
