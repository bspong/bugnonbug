Some web-page doesn't load at all and firefox keep on showing the progress animation. I always have to clear my browsing history to make these web-pages work again.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I generally go on the following web-pages
1. www.jang.com.pk/jang
2. mail.google.com
3. www.bbc.co.uk

Since yesterday (4th of August) I am facing a problem that whenever I try to open the 1st and 2nd web-page, they don't appear. Firefox keeping on probing for these web-pages by showing the progress animation but they don't appear. As soon a I clean my history, everything work fine. It never happened to me before. I have a Linux machine a well and it work fine on it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the page www.jang.com.pk/jang or mail.google.com
2. close the tab or the browser
3. Restart the browser (if closed) and re-open these web-pages.
4. These page will not appear and firefox keep on probing them.
5. Clear the browing history and these page will appear.
Actual Results:
These page will not appear and firefox keep on probing them.

Expected Results:
These page should appear without any irrelevant steps.

I don't know if it a security issue or something else but it better be fixed.
