This bug is stopping some of the dynamic ad delivered by doubleclick to our website from being displayed when our site is viewed in Firefox.

I have two document forming a concise test case that I will upload with this bug report. The test case document is displayed a expected in Chrome (Windows, Linux) and Internet Explorer (Windows).
