If the word ".bind" is found in a link path, targeting a frame or a new window ("target=_blank") is out of order

Mysterious: a link with target=_blank (or target=<framename>) doe not open the
link in a new window (or in the specified frame), when there is the word ".bind"
in the linked path.
I uploaded a test case for you in URL above
(http://pmhg.net/bugs/firefox-link-bug.htm): there are 2 links, both with
"target=_blank".
Click on "Susanne Deibele" (href-path = "susanne.deibele/index.htm" =>
everything is fine (link will be opened in a new window).
Click on "Robert Binder" (href-path = "robert.binder/index.htm"), and the link
will be opened in the same window, not in a new one).
If you rename the folder "robert.binder" to e.g. "robert.cinder" or only to
"binder" (and rename the relating href-path in the link), then the click on
"Robert Binder" will succeed.
I tried various combination - I'm nearly sure, that it is the word ".bind"
anywhere in the path (also in the name of the linked html-site), that is the
wretch. Firefox seems to interpret ".bind" in any kind of a manner....

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open URL above (http://pmhg.net/bugs/firefox-link-bug.htm)
2.Download this html-file and the two subfolders "robert.binder" and
"susanne.deibele" on your local environment for better reproducing the "rename
phenomenon"
3.Open your local copy of "firefox-link-bug.htm" and click on "Robert Binder"
(link won't be opened in a new window, even though specified with "target=_blank")
4.Compare with a click on "Susanne Deibele" - this one open in a new window.
5.Compare the html code of the two link => they are equivalent
6.Rename the subfolder "robert.binder" e.g. to "robertbinder" (and rename
equivalently the link specified in the html <a href=..>, then click again ==>
now the link open in a new window a expected.
Actual Results:
Click on a link with ".bind" in it path force the link to be opened in the
same window (even though specified with "target=....."

Expected Results:
Should open in a new window (or targeted frame)

MS Internet-Explorer doe not have this problem.
