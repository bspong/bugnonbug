When scrolling up and down with a fixed background image in place, script based element like Google ad for example will lag behind and go outside of their nexted table. on www.mypawbook.com you will notice on the right side of the front page there is a shoutbox. if you scroll up and down, the shoutbox will lag behind and go outside of it nexted table and overlap other table temporarily.

i even edited my config for firefox to speed scrolling using the mousewheel config edit and it webpage with fixed background now scroll up and down really fast with no slow down but the script based element have always lagged behind temporaily and for a web designer this really bug me.
