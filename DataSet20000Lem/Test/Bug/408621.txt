I make theme for people with visual disabilities.

Three of my theme use 28-pixel scrollbars and 32-pixel icon for menu items. There is not enough room in the dropdown Autocomplete Richlist Results richlistitems for the wide scrollbar and the 32px icons. The star icon do not appear. They vanish behind the scrollbar.

Because of the way the code is written, using the splitter to widen the urlbar doe not provide more room for the star icon. It simply widens the autocomplete title (.ac-title).

We themers need a way to adjust the way the space is apportioned withing the richlistitem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a theme that us 32px menu icon and 28px scrollbars (e.g. -- SpehereGnome Jumbo).
2. Click on the urlbar autocomplete dropdown button.
Actual Results:
In the dropdown results, for bookmarked site the star is hidden.

Expected Results:
The star should be visible.

I have used a variety of margin settings, all of which produce unsatisfactory results. For example, using a large negative left margin with the ellipsis can pull the star into view, but only by overlapping the right end of the autocomplete title. The result is ugly. An example (using SphereGnome_Big) can be seen here:

The relevant code seems to be here:

(note that the comment on line 1256 is actually referring to bug #399664.)

As more people buy high-res displays, more will be using theme that provide icon that are more visible. So some user may not simply be those with visual disabilities.
