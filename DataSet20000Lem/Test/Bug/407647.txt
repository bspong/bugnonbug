Firefox often freezes, especially with email because of Linkscanner
User-Agent: Opera/9.24 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.11

Firefox often freezes, especially with emails, with message:
"We're experiencing technical difficulty that may prevent your chat from being sent" and often
"Error!
Could not connect to remote server

You tried to access the address https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/post_bug.cgi, which is currently unavailable. Please make sure that the Web address (URL) is correctly spelled and punctuated, then try reloading the page."
However, on going to other sites, e.g. www.websudoku.com, I have no problems.

I then open Opera or IE, and entering the email (gmail or hotmail) continue without problems. Although i prefer the layout and operation of Firefox over Opera or IE, I am considering using them a my referred browser

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open an internet email
3. Without warning, I get the message of "techincal difficulties"
Actual Results:
The repoducibility above is not quite accurate- I would say, "happens OFTEN, but not always"

Expected Results:
the same- often freeze

I use XP home, am an expereinced used, teach others the use of the computer, though am not a developer.
