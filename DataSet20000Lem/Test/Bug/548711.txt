Firefox asks for installation of WMP11 while I run on W7 64 bit with WMP12 installed.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; nl; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; nl; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

Important for this bug is that I am running Windows 7 64bit (-ultimate but i don't think it matters).

When visiting some site for example:
http://www.skyradio.nl/player_lovesongs.php
http://player.omroep.nl/?aflID=10682167

Firefox 3.6 is asking for installing missing plugins, Windows Media Player 11, while Windows 7 is already installed with WMP 12!! But Firefox won't play the content, and is asking for installation of WMP11 which cannot be done because WMP12 is already installed.
this way, I cannot play the content on the site!

In the second example, (http://player.omroep.nl/?aflID=10682167
) a workaround can be to let the content be played with Microsoft Silverlight. however, not all site will give you this option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a site with content that should be played in WMP (for example http://www.skyradio.nl/player_lovesongs.php)
2.In the top Firefox asks for installing missing plugins (WMP11 while WMP12 is already installed)
3. Firefox refuse to install the plugins and to play the content.
Actual Results:
Content could not be played, that is why I checked with Internet Explorer and then everything work just fine. (i hate it when that happens)
