I have been using Firefox for a while and I liked it very much.
Not long ago Firefox start to stop responding for a while when browsing but I
paid no attention. Then it start read HDD so suddenly when browsing and hang
at the same time.
But this day I clicked a link whick triggered an OnClick event which run a line
of javascript code which return with the result of a comfirm(). (Forgive me of
my verbosity. ) Then after a long long wait, a box appeared telling me Firefox
ha made an access violation
(later I found out,'twas caused by doing mov dword ptr[eax],esi
when eax = 00000000).

At this point I reproduced this bug with Dr.Watson running(for 3 times), and
found out if given sufficient memory and swap file(virtual memory), it will
still pop out the dialog. I also accidentaly found out this happens too when
Firefox prompt you if to save a password or not.

However these test have made my computer run out of virtual memory(2 MMORPGs
installed on a 7.29G partition), so I rebooted and entered DOS to delete the
swap file. I also copied firefox to another directory (as I suspected this
problem ha to do with XPCOM.dll so I want to get it's CRC hash in order to know
if the file is corrupted).

After doing these step I cannot reproduce the problem any more...(If not I
would have to report this a a BLOCKER, a this block me from entering password
to bugzilla.)

And just a I'm filling this report the OS prompt me that Firefox crush
*again*... but it is still responding and functional and not closed, and the
problem wa found in MFC42.dll. Maybe that's corrupted file(as I got numerous
error with this file)?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Execute a script with a confirm function or try to make the dialog asking if
to save password appear.

Actual Results:
Firefox allocates memory at an amazing speed then pop up the dialog; or in the
end run out of memory and try to access memory with an uninit'ed pointer.

Expected Results:
Pop up the dialog without too much delay.

Or at least say that the pointer is invaild(but how do you know that...)
