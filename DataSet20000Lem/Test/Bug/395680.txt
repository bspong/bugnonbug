Hello

I am trying to protect email address on a web page from spammers. I found a javascript snippet from Syronex Anti Spam Solutions (http://www.syronex.com/antispam/) and it ha worked well in the past. Since I have upgraded Firefox to the newest version I cannot access the email from my links. Is there a reason for this or is there another method I could used instead of javascript in firefox?




When I place the cursor over the email link on the web page the following message appears in the bottom status bar "javascript:void(0)". Does this message mean that javascript is not working? I have it enabled in firefox.

The code I am using is below:

<script type='text/javascript'><!--
var v2="ZV4JECTJIXM3D8P";var v7=unescape("n%3FZ%2C*%03%3F/%275%2CAj%5B1");var v5=v2.length;var v1="";for(var v4=0;v4<v5;v4++){v1+=String.fromCharCode(v2.charCodeAt(v4)^v7.charCodeAt(v4));}document.write('<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="window.location=\'mail\u0074o\u003a'+v1+'?subject=Information%20Please'+'\'">'+'<b>Email us</b><\/a>');
//--></script><noscript><a href='http://w2.syronex.com/jmr/safemailto/#noscript'><b>email us</b> (using spam protection)</a></noscript>

Thanks for any assistance you can provide.
