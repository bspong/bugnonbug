Issue with the "Use same proxy for all protocols" check box in the connection
preferences. Even though box is set before upgrade, setting do not take for
all protocols. Found a workaround which the user should not have to perform.

WORKAROUND:

1. Unchecked "use same proxy for all protocols"

2. Filled in the same text for each individual protocol, pointing to correct
proxy server and port

3. Browser work fine now

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
USE CASE:

1. Upgraded from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2. Prior installation had "use same proxy for all
protocols" checked in the Preferences.

2. The box wa checked and only the HTTP PROXY line wa filled in.

3. Was able to connect to HTTP sites, however "Connection refused" error when
attempting to connect to HTTPS sites.

4. The correct HTTPS proxy wa set (but greyed out, due to "use same proxy..."
check box)

5. Further examined prefs.js file. The HTTPS, FTP, other protocol were set to
"localhost:8080" which did not correspond to what the Preferences indicated.

Actual Results:
Used only the configured proxy server for the HTTP protocol, even though use the
same for all protocol wa checked.

Expected Results:
It should have used the same proxy server for all protocols. No user
intervention should have been necessary after the SW upgrade.

See workaround.

I set this a major because it may impact people upgrading Firefox.
