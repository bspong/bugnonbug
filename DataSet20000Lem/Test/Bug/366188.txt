When Firefox is not the front application (with focus), clicking in the content area of a Firefox window sometimes doe not bring Firefox to the front and give it focus. Instead, it occasionally sends Firefox to the *back*, behind all other open windows. This seems to be triggered by first sending the front application's window to the dock.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch terminal and leave at least one window open and up (not in the dock).
2. Launch Firefox and load any web page (e.g. CNN.com). Ensure that the Firefox window is in front of the Terminal window (this is not necessary to reproduce the problem, but it make it easier to see what's happening).
3. Launch TextEdit.
4. Send the TextEdit window to the Dock by clicking the yellow button in the menubar.
5. Click inside of the content area of the Firefox window.
Actual Results:
1. TextEdit remains the active application, with focus.
2. The terminal window come up in front of the Firefox window.

Expected Results:
1. Firefox becomes the active application and come to the front, in front of all other open windows.

This seems like it could be an OS/WindowServer issue, but Firefox is the only application that I've ever seen exhibit this behavior.

This is 100% reproducable for me if I first minimize/dock an application and then click in the Firefox content area. If I *don't* minimize/dock the active application, the problem doe not happen. If I click the titlebar instead of the content area, the problem doe not happen (regardless of whether I've minimized an app or not).

I think this started with Firefox 2, but I'm not positive. I've definitely been noticing it a lot more lately.
