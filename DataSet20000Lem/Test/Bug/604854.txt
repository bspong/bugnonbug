Hotmail: "delete, move to, mark as" not working on selected item

Action link - New, Delete, Junk, Sweep, Mark as, Move to - do not execute their action on selected emails.






This same result occurs when using any of the "actions" in the list of action (New, Delete, Junk, Sweep, etc...)






Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open hotmail with username and password
2. click on selection box next to an email
3. click "Move to" (which appears along with New, Delete, Junk, Sweep, etc) above list of emails) to produce a pulldown list
4. choose "Junk" in pulldown list
Actual Results:

The actual result is that nothing happens.

This actual result is consistant with all the "action links" (New, Delete, Junk, Sweep, etc...)

Expected Results:
Upon clicking on "Junk" (as in step 4 above) the selected email should be moved to the Junk mail folder.


When moving the mouse over any one of the "action links", the word "Javascript:;" appears in the lower left hand corner of the browser frame.

This problem just began on about Wednesday, Oct 13, 2002. Before that date, Hotmail wa working quite well on my Firefox browser.

No change have been made to my machine. My guess would be that (perhaps?) Microsoft changed something in the hotmail javascript code, perhaps using some code that run fine on Internet Exploder, but is not supported by Firefox?
