When logging out from a JBoss served web-app, the app attempt to expire the session cookie. This request is received by Firefox, but apparently ignored a the same cookie persists with expiry = end of session.

Here you will see the server request to set the cookie, and the next packet sent back to the server refers to the same cookie (in IE there is no packet sent back, and so it work okay):

The cookie ha path="/" and Send For = "Any type of connection".

I believe that the problem is that the packet sent back to the server with the expired cookie detail cause the server to resurrect the cookie and send out a new one with expiry "end of session". So I need to know why Firefox can send back an expired cookie, or why it is not being expired correctly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Unfortunately this app is running behind a vpn so I cannot show you how to reproduce!! I guess I am just hoping that someone with half a clue run into the same problem which CAN be reproduced.
