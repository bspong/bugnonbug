Whenever I try to download a gadget for Windows Sidebar from the Microsoft page http://gallery.microsoft.com/vista/SideBar.aspx, everything work normally until a small window pop up asking if i want to install the gadget. When I click "install", the window disappears and nothing happens. When I check the list of installed gadgets, the gadget i tried to download doe not show up. When I try to download gadget using IE 8, after I click install, more window pop up and I am able to add the gadget to the sidebar.

More window should have come up asking whether I want to open or save something. When I click open, another window should come up asking if I want to install the gadget. When I click yes, the gadget appears in my sidebar and list of installed gadgets.
