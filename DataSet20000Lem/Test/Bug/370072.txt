Using AJAX a script that fill a div-layer when you're typing in a textbox, firefox will crash if php return errors. So if you type in for example "overweight [overweight noun]" and your php-script isn't adapted to use "[" (for example in regular expressions), php will send error back to firefox. And if you don't stop to type ff will crash nearly. FF return to normal status after a few seconds, but if you use the window-close command (under the pop-up div-layer), ff will crash completely. Somebody could now use malicious code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the textbox showed on the example website
2. use "[" and write a few letter more for example "overweight [overweight noun]"
3. klick the close link under the pop-up div-layer a the browser return to normal status
Actual Results:
The browser crash completely

Expected Results:
The browser shouldn't crash so far. IE6 doesn't have this problem, it only dislike my css...
