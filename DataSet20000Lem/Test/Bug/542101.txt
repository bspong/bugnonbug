Firefox doesn't always start when firefox.exe is run
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox lately hasn't been starting up. I start up the program and wait, nothing happens for over 10 minutes, I try opening it again, doesn't do anything, I then open the task manager and end task firefox and try running it again, and it sometimes will work, but usually I have to do this a few time until it runs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla Firefox
2.wait
3.wait some more
4.Firefox window never appears
Actual Results:
Firefox Doesn't open

Expected Results:
The Firefox browser window should appear.

I do have several addons and I believe they could contribute to it not starting up, though idk how likely that is.
