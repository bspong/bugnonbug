After having Firefox open for a few hour it will stop loading page and animating GIF's.
For example: If you click a link to go to another page, the page will only appear if you continue to move your mouse. Once you stop moving your mouse, it pause. Even if the page is half way through loading or if a GIF still ha a few more frame to go.
This also effect page that auto-refresh.
This happens on all the computer I use.
You can still close it. But, if you check the task manager in XP, firefox.exe is still running. Once you terminate that and start Firefox again, it back to normal.
Hope that make sense. Good luck
