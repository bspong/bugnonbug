The problem is also reproducible on

Firefox 1.5.010 Gecko/20070510 on Fedora 6
Firefox 2.0.03 Gecko/20070309 on Windows XP

She symptom are that when a page is written using the javascript code in the attached file and the reload button is used to reload the page , the same is not displayed correctly: no cs is loaded and no image are diplayed

I have installed the firebug extension and it detects no erro (I think also because no j ha been loaded)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce the link:

1) unzip the file attached

2) open in firefox the ricerca.htm file in sismica/main/

3) try the search form

4) regardless you have obtained result or not, hit the reload current page button or the F5 key

Teh content is written by either one of two javascript function in the
sismica/js/searchFunction.js file.

The content of the result page in case of result exist is written by the javascript function function formatResults(passedArray, text, urlTest)

The content of the result page in case of result NOT exist is written by the javascript function function function noMatch(text)



Actual Results:
no image showed and no cs loaded

Expected Results:
correct display of the page
