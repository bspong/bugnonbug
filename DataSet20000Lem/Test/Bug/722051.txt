Sessionstore.js being truncated after restart and a few tab not restored

Steps to reproduce:

Restarted FF after a closure of FF (Crash, reboot, close etc).
I have FF set to restore session (if it can, it rarely doe without "Oops").
I have many window and tab open (but I have enough RAM to spare).


Actual results:

The sessionstore.js file is smaller than it wa (truncated) so only some of my window and tab are restored (most of them are).
I know this a I take regular backup of the .js and .bak file (as I have had various problem with bookmarks/session info over time) and I compare the size from different date (the number of window and tab change infrequently on a day to day basis).
The most recent file wa ~4MB and the backup file from the last session is ~8/9MB.

It seems FF *sometimes* truncates the file *somehow*. I have not tried to reproduce a it seems to happen depending on when/how FF terminates, and when the session is at the same or simialr state (i.e. I have restored a backup or .bak file and at some point the file is truncated again (I am currently using a store from 23/1/2012))

I have recently had to restart my computer many time and hence this happened a few times. I also have FF crash A LOT when it consumes too much memory (the crash tool sends you guy an error report) and thus I have seen this problem many time in the last few days.


Expected results:

As per design - the sessionstore.js should contain the tab and window from the last save of the session, and I did not close the windows/tabs that are missing at any point prior to the crash/close/restart.
