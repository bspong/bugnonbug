A lot of site have broken certificate (e.g. the cert is registered for "domain.com" rather than "www.domain.com"; expired; etc.). The new "add an exception" dialog take numerous additional click to display content on these sites. However in most case I have seen, when this dialog appears the site content certification turn out to not be that important for most user (it's just some bulletin board, not a banking site). In fact high-security site are much le likely to have a certificate problem, because they care about their cert more.

It would be great if Mozilla could have an option to just turn off certification if there is a problem with the cert. Maybe this sound like a very bad idea from a security point of view :) , but user that don't care about certification on most site can "opt-in" to manually check that cert have been verified a valid on site they care about, e.g. banking sites, rather than having the browser force a cert check on lot more site where they don't care about. (In that sense this would be a power user feature.)
