Each time that my browser is restarted (which generally take place after a nightly update), Minefield hangs, and accepts no input for about 30 seconds. The hanging may occur almost immediately after the browser opens, or may take a minute or two to start. During the time that the hang occurs, I experience very heavy hard disk activity. I can both hear the hard disk, and I can see the disk activity in Activity Monitor. Once the disk activity stops, the browser stop hanging and the problem doe not occur again until I restart. This ha been going on at least since January.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart Minefield (may require an update to the latest build)
2. Try to use the browser
3. Within 30 second to a minute, the browser start heavily accessing the disk, and the browser hangs. A spinning pinwheel is visible when this occurs, indicating that the OS think the browser ha hung.
4) Disk activity and the spinning pinwheel go away about 30 second later, and the browser function normally.
Actual Results:
Browser hang for 30 second every time it restarts.

Expected Results:
Browser should not hang.
