I have been using a Slackware based distro... downloaded an alpha build of Firefox 3... that is Minefield... I have a dual display setup using an onboard Nvidia GeForce AGP card (32 MB) and a PCI ATI Rage Mobility Card (8 MB)... the Nvidia card us the "nv" driver... I noticed that when I clicked Help -> About Minefield... the graphic image on the About box wa shown when the window wa opened on the monitor connected to the PCI ATI card... and there wa no image there when the browser window wa opened on the monitor connected to the Nvidia card... the rest of the text and everything else work fine... except this image that vanishes on the Nvidia display... every other application work perfect... other version of Firefox do not have this problem... Has anyone else observed anything like this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "Help"
2. Click "About Minefield"

Actual Results:
The graphic on the about box appeared on one display... and when the same browser wa opened on another display of the dual display setup... the graphic vanished...

Expected Results:
The graphic on the about box should be displayed on either display without a problem...
