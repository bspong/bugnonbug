* Summary:
Windows XP, Firefox 1.5, Plug-in for Hosting Active X controls(npmozax.dll) version 1.0.0.4

When Windows Media player is loaded through the ActiveX plug-in, scripted control (through document.MediaPlayer.controls) will often--but not always--fail.

If such a control is implemented and failing, nothing happens when the control is used, and the Javascript console report simply: "document.Player.controls ha no properties"

* Test case:

An example of the plug-in failing to work can be found here:

http://www.accuradio.com/testffax/noframes.html

Note that this example will fail most of the time, but not all of the time. There seems to be no pattern: it did not always work the first time, it did not always fail the 5th time, etc. In our experiment on different machine on different days, the success rate wa around 50% at best, 5% at worst.

* Steps to reproduce error

- Load the wm activex control into a web page using the <object> tag
- Attach a javascript start, stop, next, etc. control
- Try it
- Reload your test page several time and test to observe the control alternately failing and working

* More notes:

Windows Media Player version: 9

Properties are still gettable: document.Player.currentMedia.getItemInfo(), for example, work (demonstrated in example above)

Events are still thrown: currentItemChange() work (demonstrated in example above)

Loaded extensions:
- Dom Inspector 1.8
- Talkback 1.5
- User Agent Switcher 0.6.8
- Fasterfox 1.0.3

This ha been tested on machine with NONE of these extension loaded (save Talkback), and the result are the same.

Firefox 1.0.7 and appropriate plug-in, no problem.
IE, naturally, no problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the wm activex control into a web page using the <object> tag
2. Attach a javascript start, stop, next, etc. control
3. Try it
4. Reload your test page several time and test to observe the control alternately failing and working
