When access the 'response' page of a Chinese forum, firefox hang with some backtrace and memory dump to the console.

It is under zh_cn.gbk locale and scim at input method (maybe not relavent).


This happened since the last few weeks.

I also keep getting the following warning lately, don't know if related:
