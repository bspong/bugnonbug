Whenever we start FF (Since version 3.x i think) some of the Tabs hang with the little spinner showing only. Refresh doe little or nothing. Network activity is nill. It take too much time to load all the Tabs whether ~10 or ~50 tabs, it doe not care which Tabs, it appears random which Tabs and how many, usually ~10%-15% of them won't load on StartUp.

I cannot figure out why no one ha reported this issue since it ha been happening since version 3. Our user run Tabbed Browsing and use the Global password feature. If it is extension related we have not noticed.

It is like it run out of resources, we have over 3GB RAM per system, and it happens on all installs for every user we have - so that's about 40 differing configs. It appears to effect only a small portion of the Tabs, but it is really annoying a it take literally several minute to finally load those Tabs so normal browsing can start.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start up in Tabbed Browsing.
2.Have about 15-60 Tabs.
3.Wait until all Tab spinner stop.

Actual Results:
4.Takes too much time.
5.Network activity stop for minutes.

Expected Results:
4.Takes le time.
5.Network activity never stop till ALL Tabs are loaded.

Since we see this every time we install FF3 on WinXP SP3 (maybe SP2 did this too, we forget...) we have a hard time understanding why this ha not been fixed. It is one of the reason we're looking into a different browser to use, but honestly every browser ha defect like this. We're investing FF3 atm so we're reporting this to see if it can be patched and allow u to enjoy FF3.
