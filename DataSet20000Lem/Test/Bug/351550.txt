When I highlight the text to change the color/font style/size - then go to the 'pulldown menu' to select my choice...the highlight dissappears..when I select a size (just to see if it will still size it for me) it put all html formating at the end of the post. I then have to cut and paste it to where I want it..or just manually post all html coding - very frustrating

once I've manually typed them in they work fine!...PLEASE HELP ME!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.you have to have an account to post there...so, you'll have to open up one..sorry about this. But, it's quite simple..at the top of the page you'll see log-in/ register/ log-out...click on the register and open an account. Then go the forum and try to post a message.
2.click on the post reply button and it will open a 'text box' go ahead and type in some text.
3.highlight the text, using curser, and then try to click on the button above the text box...you'll see that all html coding is placed after any text you've typed..so you get [color=#3366FF][/color][size=5][/size] I cannot get it to wrap around my text that I want changed.

Actual Results:
image & font tag will not wrap around my text.

Expected Results:
It should have placed the tag around my highlighted text.

I'm using the Silver skin theme. Yes, it occures in the default theme a well.
