Loading http://framboise78.free.fr/Paris.htm crash my browser with the following error:
The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadAlloc (insufficient resource for operation)'.
(Details: serial 25884 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X error are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

It happens in normal mode, and in safe mode. System ha huge amount of resource (>1GB RAM, mostly free. Other than Firefox, only a few xterms, emacs, and one <20MB application were running). ATI Radeon Mobility 9700 graphic card, with 128MB RAM, and proprietary ATI driver.

There is a number of similar bug in the bug database, some of which date back to older Firefox versions. I do not know if they are the same bug or not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://framboise78.free.fr/Paris.htm
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, with:
The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadAlloc (insufficient resource for operation)'.

Expected Results:
Pretty web page.

System is Debian GNU/Linux 3.1. Firefox is official build from Mozilla.org. System is a high-end machine, doing almost nothing at the time, so this wa not a simple resource shortage.

Given that Firefox crashes, it is an important bug, since many crash can be exploited a e.g. buffer overflows.
