Actual Results:
FireFox Crashed.

The Browser is Talking to a Apache Module, Which keep on the Request for a long
while, and release it when there is a event. If no event are being send. The
Server wait "X" Seconds, and answer the client -- which then sends out a
request again.

I don't think a exploit could be created from this (normal people don't have
their browser that long open on a site). But since it really crashed (i have now
seen this 3 times) I have marked the Security Flag
