I insert www.yahoo.com and it return the above URL and Address Not Found Page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

I entered Yahoo.com in order to provide you with the above example. The page that display says:
Address Not Found Error
www.msn.com could not be found. Please check the name and try again.
The address (URL) doe not correspond to a known site and could not be loaded. This could be due to a misspelling in the address or because the site doe not exist. If the address is known to be valid, or if the problem occurs for many sites, it may be an issue with your proxy service (if you use one) or the directory name service lookup. In such case you should consult your system documentation, administrator or Internet Service Provider (ISP) a appropriate for further assistance.

Any new URL you enter return the saem Address Not Found Page but doe not change the URL line. It will stay msn.com etc.

The internet is connected and working a MSN is on a hotkey and I can connect to it without going through Mozilla.

The ISP is working a this laptop is one of 5 computer we have on a wireless network in the house.

I have run adaware and Spybot. Both congratulate me for having a clean system. I can't run HiJackThis because I can't get to the internet to install it.

I've looked up other resolve such a regedit where you look in the run log for anything suspicious.

I did find New.net in the Add/Remove program file and removed it. There is one new.net that will not allow me to remove it. It say I am not authorized. I have no other browzer a I only have Mozilla and blew away IE year ago.

I've run out of ideas. Hope you can help!
