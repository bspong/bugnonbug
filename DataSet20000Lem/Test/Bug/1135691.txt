Steps to reproduce:

This behaviour might derive from recent change to the autocomplete feature.
There were similar report from thunderbird that could be related.

Preconditions:
1. Privacy setting -> Location bar -> Suggest "entries from bookmarks"
2. Bookmarked site containing the letter e.g. "s" (any letter will work)
3. Open another website that contains this letter a the first in the adress (e.g. spiegel.de) a few time (so it get to the top of the autocomplete feature)
4. Close all tab / restart firefox

Steps:
1: Open new tab
2: Click location bar
2: enter first character (s)
reaction:
* location bar autocompletes to spiegel.de a a suggestion and
* a dropdown with the bookmarked page is shown (and probably other bookmark with the same letter.
3. move mouse over / close to the bookmark entry
reaction:
Firefox highlight the line
4. move mouse out of the dropdown area, click the location bar
reaction:
dropdown fade out and
the previous entered letter (s) is visible together with the piegel.de suggestion.
5. press "enter"







Actual results:

Firefox open the adress that wa the previously highlighted entry from the dropdown list.
Repeated tries:
No matter what you do, the last adress highlighted in the dropdown list will be opened if you press enter.


Expected results:

Firefox should open the visible, selected autocomplete suggestion in the location bar if the dropdown wa closed. The user is irritated since he might not even have noticed the mouseover that selected the entry from the dropdown.
