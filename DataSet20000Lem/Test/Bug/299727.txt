Performance of Firefox over X11 remote display, and equivalently under VNC, is unbelievably/unusably slow
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux ppc; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041125 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux ppc; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041125 Firefox/1.0

If one start up Firefox on one machine, displaying remotely over X11 to another
machine, even over a 100Mb network, firefox is incredibly slow. I have a
feeling it ha to do with firefox being sloppy with it handling of ExposeNotify
event etc -- are y'all collapsing multiple expose event into a single repaint
request? Do you do partial-window repaints, or only the whole window at once?
I tried using xmsgtrace to see what X protocol message were being sent, but
there were several thousand, more than I can easily examine with the knowledge
of Firefox that I have.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From your main workstation, ssh to another machine with Firefox installed.
2. Using the ssh connection, or directly using DISPLAY=<workstation:0>, start
up a firefox on the remote machine with display on the local machine.
3. Select some text on the firefox home page.
4. Now move the mouse out of that window, and back in. Watch the time lag
between when the selected text becomes gray-selected to when it becomes
blue-selected.
5. Now move the mouse in and out of the window a few times, then click on a
link. Watch firefox catch up, over several seconds, until it finally get
around to following the link.
6. In general, just use a remote firefox over X11, and feel the pain....
Actual Results:
It took a very long time for all the repainting to occur. When using VNC with a
firefox within it display, one can actually see the little blip on the screen
a the window is being redrawn. Using this, it appears that the entire window
is repainted more than once, to boot.

Expected Results:
On a mouse-enter kind of event, no repainting should be necessary.

I do not know of any better X protocol tracer than xmsgtrace
(xmsgtrace.sourceforge.net), but there may be some. I can attach a trace if it
would be more useful than y'all generating your own on your own machine under
controlled circumstances.
