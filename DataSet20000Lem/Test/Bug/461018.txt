When I'm surfing around on the internet, I'll click a link or try and get to a webpage and the status load it, but nothing is displayed but white nothingness. I manually refresh and it doe the same thing. I have to refresh about 10 time every other webpage to get it to come up. There is no particular website but it doe do it a lot on facebook. And of course sometimes when refreshing, it ha to resend the information again so I have posted some comment on facebook about three times. Thank goodness it didn't do it on ebay.
