WindowShade X doesn't work on some windows.

WindowShade X is a Mac OS X add-on (specifically, a "haxie" by Unsanity; http://www.unsanity.com/). It allows window to be "minimized" in assorted ways.
I use it, by double-clicking the drag bar, to hide the rest of the window.

This worked reliably in Ff2, but in Ff3 I'm finding that some window do not close up a expected. The yellow button at the upper-left-hand corner of the window blink (showing a "minus sign, FWIW), but nothing else happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install WindowShade X and Firefox 3.0 on Mac OS X (10.5.2)
2. Open up some Firefox windows.
3. Try WindowShading them until you get one that fails.

I'm sorry I don't have a reliable way to cause the problem.



WindowShade X doe not modify either Mac OS X or the applications. Rather, it work by sending certain signal to the operating system. Given that I haven't changed either the OS or WSX, this problem must be related to the manner in which Firefox deal with the OS (eg Window Manager).
