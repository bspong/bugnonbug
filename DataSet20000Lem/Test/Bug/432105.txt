Digg.com "digg this" script cause momentary large memory spike (50+ MB) when called many time in a web page

There's a strange issue in this site: http://isohunt.com/, while it is loading (look at the task manager, Firefox.exe mem usage suddenly jump by 40-50 MB to over 140 MB and then suddenly drop back to normal, this mem spike cause a big swap impact (on my 256 MB RAM laptop). This is more apparent with a slower internet connection.

The problem seems to happen due to the Digg This button scripts: http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js
which is repeatedly called by script tag in the body of the page many times.

Problem happens in safe mode a well. And with a fresh new profile. IE7 doe not have this issue (but is spike the CPU for a while). Firefox 2 work correctly a well.

If I Adblock that script, (diggthis.js), the problem mostly go away.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Minefield on a fresh profile or in safe mode.
2. Open Task manager and look at the "firefox.exe" memory usage and VM size.
3. Go to http://isohunt.com/ on a slow internet connection and watch task manager.
Actual Results:
When the status bar say "Read digg.com ..." Firefox memory usage increase by 50-60 MB for some second and then drop back to normal.

Expected Results:
There is nothing on that page that would warrant this huge memory allocation, it should not behave like this.
