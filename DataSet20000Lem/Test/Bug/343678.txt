OCSP client requires presence of optional AlgorithmIdentifier.parameter field
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

OCSP request and response identify the certificate being validated using
hash of the certificate issuer's name and public key, plus the
certificate's serial number. To ensure interoperability, the identifier
includes an AlgorithmIdentifier structure specifying the hash algorithm used
to hash the issuer name and key.

The AlgorithmIdentifier structure ha an OPTIONAL field for algorithm
parameters. This field is not used when identifying standard hash algorithm
such a SHA-1. Unfortunately, an ambiguity in the standard allows for two
different encoding of this "empty" parameter field. In the first encoding,
the field is omitted entirely. In the second encoding, the field is
populated with the ASN.1 type NULL.

The two encoding have identical meaning and the difference in encoding ha
been a source of difficulty for many applications. RFC 3370, which defines
algorithm for use in the Cryptographic Message Syntax, state the following
in section 2.1, which describes SHA-1:

The correct encoding is to omit the parameter field; however,
implementation MUST also handle a SHA-1 AlgorithmIdentifier
parameter field which contains a NULL.

The AlgorithmIdentifier parameter field is OPTIONAL. If present,
the parameter field MUST contain a NULL. Implementations MUST
accept SHA-1 AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters.
Implementations MUST accept SHA-1 AlgorithmIdentifiers with NULL
parameters. Implementations SHOULD generate SHA-1
AlgorithmIdentifiers with absent parameters.

While this description is presented in the context of CMS, the
AlgorithmIdentifier structure is used throughout various PKIX RFCs and
I believe this guidance is sound for all us of
AlgorithmIdentifier, including OCSP.

The current Mozilla/Firefox OCSP client is incorrectly requiring that
the parameter field be encoded a NULL when it should accept
either encoding.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unfortunately, reproducing the problem requires hitting a server that doe not include the optional parameter. Many public server do include the NULL parameter.

When Firefox ha OCSP turned on and hit a server that leaf off the parameter, it report "unknown certificate" and refuse to proceed with the page. If the parameter is added to the response, everything work fine.

Contact me at the listed email address if you need u to set up a public test server to reproduce this.
