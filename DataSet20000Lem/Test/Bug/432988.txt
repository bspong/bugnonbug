I use Outlook Web Access for work using Web browser and have a large number of email and subfolders that are used to store work email per matter.

While basic outlook functionality is available when accessing Outlook Web Access via Firefox the complete set of folder navigation feature are not available with Firefox Outlook Web Access e.g. expandable tree folder and filing which are used to navigate and file email to specific sub folder

Details: Compare filing and accessing email that need to be filed or moved from the inbox in Outlook Web Access when using IE v Firefox.

In IE the browser replicates the outlook experience eg in IE it is possible to access email and subfolders directly from the expandable folder tree structure on the left handside of the screen. Emails can also be moved and filed from the inbox directly to a subfolder by dragging and dropping the email to the relevant subfolder or can be moved from subfolders to subfolders (with out requiring screen changes).

In firefox a folder list is not accessible or expandable meaning that to file an email or access a email subfolder it is necessary to drill down through multiple screen (3-4 screens) for access to each subfolder. This process must be reversed or restarted to access a different email subfolder. This slows down



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access Outlook Web Access vie IE and create multiple subfolders (3-4 levels)
2.Move and file email from inbox into different sub-folders and from subfolder to subfolder and expand and compress folderr tree
3.Try and do the same thing in Firefox - it is not possible
