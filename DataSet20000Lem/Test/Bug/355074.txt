search suggestion can be extremely inappropriate

Typing very innocent work in the search bar can result in being given suggestion most people wouldn't want kid to see. The most glaring example I know of wa found by Mozilla Champion Leonidas Jones; typing "mommy" in the seach bar while Google is selected result in the top suggestion "mommylovescock". With Yahoo, the second suggestion is "mommygotboobs".

The search sits make the suggestions, but it will look to the user a if Firefox itself make the suggestions. I'm filing the bug because (a) this could harm kid and (b) this could result in some very bad PR for the project.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select either Google or Yahoo in the search bar.
2. Type "mommy" in the search bar, but do not hit enter.
3. Wait for suggestion to load from the remote site, and have a look.

Actual Results:
Suggestions for popular but far from wholesome search will be displayed.


I don't know; one idea would be to disable the suggestion feature by default, going back to using saved search to make suggestions.
