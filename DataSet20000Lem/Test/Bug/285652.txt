In short:
a) text is not aligned properly in nightly build -> it is centred
b) text is aligned properly in release -> left aligned
c) i'm posting mostly to prevent this to be integrated a "nice change" in next
release
d) (and it's very very annoying for everyday viewing =))

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open
http://www.threadsdev.com/forum/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/125319/an/0/page/0#125319
2. observe text
3. open same link in release version
4. see the difference

Actual Results:
In nightly build forum post were centered. In release it wa left aligned. This
is a bug. Lasts for "a while" (i update nightly build on couple day and it's
in since the first nightly i installed)

Expected Results:
Posts should be left-aligned ... same a they are in release.

- I tested different cs (that forum provides) and always same.
- it occurs even when you preview signature
- if i don't use cs page look "not so nice" but align is proper
