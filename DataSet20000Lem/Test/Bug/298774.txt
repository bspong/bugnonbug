Microsoft IE open when read mail or new message button pressed in the tool menu a well a the toolbar button.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When ever i try to read mail through the button in the tool menu or on the tool
bar button in firefox, microsoft's internet explorer open to Yahoo mail inbox.
This happens although Mozilla Firefox is already set a the default browser.
Also when my keyboard shourtcut button for email used it also open IE. I opened
IE and then made a shourtcut to the Inbox webpage and made it open in Mozilla.
Then i programmed the button to open the shortcut instead of the default E-mail
app. That at least wa fixed the keyboard shortcut, but the email button in
mozilla still started IE which wa extramely ennoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Hit read mail button
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Microsoft's Internet Explorer open up Yahoo Mail

Expected Results:
Open Yahoo Mail in Mozilla Firefox

This problem is very ennoying especially since i have tried to fix it for a very
long time and that i cant uninstall IE due to the need for Windows Update. Maybe
mozilla can be integrated to work with windoes update.
