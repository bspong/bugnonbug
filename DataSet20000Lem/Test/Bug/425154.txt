When I do a right click on the toolbar I can customize the look of the toolbar. I prefer the view where only symbol are shown. When I restart the browser I always get the symbol and text view. When I open the customize dialog the Symbols only item is selected. So I have to reselect it to get it working again. I have to repeat this after every browser restart.

To be more specific. This setting still work for Firefox symbol such a Forward, Backward, Refresh and so on. It doe not work for any third party plugins, such a webdeveloper toolbar, Zend studio toolbar or adblock toolbar. So I don' know if it is a Firefox bug or a plugin bug. If you have any plugins where you think it should work, please let me know. I'll try them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on toolbars
2. Open customize dialog
3. Select Symbols only view
4. Restart the browser
Actual Results:
The selected symbol view is not working anymore (switching back to symbol and text)

Expected Results:
Still having the symbol view in place.
