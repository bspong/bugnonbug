Firefox not allowing photo to show up on facebook but i can see them when i open a browser that is not run by firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150806001005

Steps to reproduce:

for the past 3 week or so.. whenever im on faceboo via .. firefox.. the photo will not show up. i get a blank aquare the size the photo would be.. those are for the photo stored on facebook. now if it a linked to another site.. like flikr.. or a video.. it show up.. a well a profile photos.. but the regular photo and the cover photos. do not.


Actual results:

Tried to get the photo to show.. checked websites. did searches.. updated file on the computer.. etc.. and nothing still could not see them.. in a aha.. moment.. i disabled firefox and opened Facebook via my internet explorer.. and the photo showed.. like nothing happened.. and thus discoverd.. it wa not my computer.. it wa not the internet per se.. it wa firefox.


Expected results:

what should have happened is all my photo should have shown up.. and been up when i started up firefox.. when they did the update.. that should have fixed the problem. but it did not.. at this point.. i will be deleting Firefox and anything Mozilla .. from my computer by the end of the month if i still cannot see them.
