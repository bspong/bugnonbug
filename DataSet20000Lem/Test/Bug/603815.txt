Favicon retrieval reverberates when header tracked with HttpFox

I have a website domain and subdomain which use Favicon. Within the domain and subdomain, there is a single, different favicon for each.

I noticed, while trying to get the subdomain and .htaccess rewrite [not themselves a Fox problem], that the request for Favicon seem to reverberate, and I wonder if this is unintentional.

Each file, foo.html, on the site, whether in the domain or subdomain, ha a link rel to a favicon.ico, and for each the hunt is within the subdomain/domain where foo.html is stored.

I detected these domain and cache request using HttpFox [while checking the functionality of the .htaccess in each of the directories.

At one point, I had favicon link in file within the subdirectory/subdomain, back to the root. In these cases, the reverberation were increased, with hunt for favicon [cached or not] in both the root and the subdom/subdir. Interestingly, I think there wa a Fox hunt for favicon in the root, even though I explicitly requested a link to a local favicon, and vica versa, where I request a link to the root favicon, even though there is a previous reference/use of a favicon in the subdomain.

I would think that once an explicit declaration is made in the foo.html file, that Fox would quit looking for more favicons, either at the domain or cached.

Similarly, for explicit declaration following on from the case of prior favicon reference for a domain/subdomain.

Not a big issue, a the icon work, but it seems to drive up the amount of server traffic and cache retrievals, yes?

It almost behaves like there are independent thread asking for a favicon, coming from different sources, and none realizes the others is making the retrievals.

Or...

Am I missing something. I have since straightened out the site, creating subdomains, recasting the file name in the subdir, and crafting the .htaccess to redirect/rewrite a necessary. So the precise Gets and traffic aren't available, but I'll bet that a look at header traffic will show off what I describing, on site with domains/subdomains and favicons.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
see above, with variation depending on caching, etc.
