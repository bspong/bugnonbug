Click anywhere within the rendered page of any theage.com.au page (after signing
up with bugmenot.com if necessary), and an enormous popup window is created.

This is despite setting like browser.tabs.opentabfor.windowopen,
browser.block.target_new_window, etc being set to true.

Shouldn't all window created by javacript end up a new tab at least, if the
appropriate setting is set?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on popup blocking. For fun, also turn on the setting that open
window a new tab
1. Go to URL (register if necessary)
2. Clicky mousy on something that's not a HREF
3. Curse
Actual Results:
I cursed because the popup took a good deal of realestate from my screen. It
also pop up again if I close the popup, and click anywhere on the page again.
This affect me using focus-follows-mouse on Linux, and I imagine it suck even
worse for those using click-to-focus, because they have to click on the browser
somewhere to get it focused.

Expected Results:
At the very least, the popup should have been opened in another tab, since I
have all those tab setting set to true. The best outcome would be for it to
magically work out it is still a popup, and blocked it accordingly.
