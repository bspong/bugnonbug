Using firefox beta (13.0) gmail would freeze when loading rich text font in the compose email screen. Windows 7 32 bit.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120420145725

Steps to reproduce:

Hit "reply" in Gmail. I believe I've done this with the mouse and with the autokey. I believe that the first time I hit "reply" I don't have this problem, but then after hitting reply for a second email, it occurs.


Actual results:

The window for composing the reply appears, but no box to enter text. And a notice saying "loading rich text fonts..." Then it just hangs. Other tab in firefox work just fine; i.e., FF is not crashing. Windows also is fine. The problem doe not occur in Chrome.


Expected results:

The compose screen should load. If I close firefox 13.0 and open it, it work once and then the hanging issue occurs again.

I have gmelius a a plugin. I have uninstalled firefox 13.0 beta and installed FF 12 on one computer but can test it on two other computer that have firefox 13 installed if I hear from you soon. Otherwise will uninstall FF 13 and install 12 on those computer a well.

If you can give detailed instruction on how to collect debugging information (or a link to such information), I can try to do that for you. Thanks.
