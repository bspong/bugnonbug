Hello,

Today I've downloaded Firefox 3.0 from the world record url and installed here on my PC.
The first thing I do is uninstall previous versions, clean up my pc and then, install the new full version!

You guy did a great job in Firefox but when I added a RSS from http://www.baboo.com.br/rss/ and http://www.phpbb.com/feeds/rss/ , it's added to Favorites menu but not in the bar
I have to do the manual job, clicking there, holding and puting over bar to appear on the side of Latest News (Últimas Notícias)

I don't know if is it really a bug but when I wa using Firefox 2.0.0.14, the RSS wa added in the Favorites Menu and in the Bar below the Address bar

I hope I helped to better the browser =D
Sorry for my bad english, I'm a brazilian guy

Best Regards and Congratulations again !

Yours Sincerely

Rafael
