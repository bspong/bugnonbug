The extension HTML Validator based on Tidy hang with Firefox 1.5 B2 after
having enabled the BF Cache trigger.

(I am the extension author)

The extension home page is this if you want some info:
> http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/index.html


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the HTML validator 0.73 (with the issue) in Firefox 1.5 b2
windows: http://htmlvalidator.sourceforge.net/mozilla/tidy_firefox_win_073.xpi
linux: http://htmlvalidator.sourceforge.net/mozilla/tidy_firefox_linux_073.xpi
2. Restart Firefox, check the validation work by going to www.google.com for
example.
3. go here:
> http://remik.org/test.html
Press OK.
It hang in the BF cache pageShow trigger during reading of the HTML cache
of the browser. This is the bug.

Actual Results:
The problem is this:
- In Firefox 1.5 B2, the LOAD trigger is not fired when an user do a back or
forward in the browser. This is described here:
> http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching
- So, I followed this document and added the trigger "pageShow".
- It work in most case except when the page contains an onload trigger doing a
redirect, like this :

----------------------------------------------------------------------
<script type="text/javascript">
alert("click ok!");
document.location.href="http://mozilla.org";
</script>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In such case,
- in place that the LOAD trigger is fired when rendering the page
- the pageShow trigger is fired first
- then the program try to read the HTML from the cache of the page
to validate it, but Firefox hangs.

My problem is that I am not able to fix it.
1) If I disable the BF cache trigger (pageShow). It doe not hang anymore
but I am not able to detect the back and forward change in the browser.
The result is that the icon doe not change when the user do a back or
forward in the history

2) If I enable it, back and forward validation works. But it hang in the
case above. My concern is that I am unable to distinguish between a back
or forward and a potential hanging situation.


Expected Results:
Not hang. For ex, give an exception so that I can handle it.

Any idea or work-around to fix it is welcome.
And/or a fix in the Firefox code that cause the hanging.

Thanks by advance
