Firefox hang and will no longer respond on some site using java script.

This behavior is demonstrated on all six of my machine since the last two updates. I have updated java to no effect. My Win7 machine ha NOT been updated and work FINE. IE work FINE. This BUG ha ONLY manifested itself with these update and on every machine updated including the Vista machine.

I have narrowed it down to website with some java apps however this is my impression and certainly NOT imperial.

I am using a java based chat app on my forum, however i can no longer use Firefox since the last two updates. IE load the app and work well. Firefox load about 3/4ths of the app according to the status bar and then hang Firefox totally.

Some site use java for presentation, those site hang Firefox.

If this is not resolved i will be forced to abandon Firefox. I have gone through all your help file and find nothing helpful that resolve the issue. I mention this so you know i have taken many step before reporting this bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to forum and start the chat java chat app.
2. Go to website with java display.
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox hang - the cursor go in sleep mode except for a mouse over the X (close window button of Firefox) which then eventually shuts down Firefox and end in the Microsoft OS alert box that a program crashed and asks if i wish to send a report to MS or not.

Expected Results:
My expectation would be that the application load and run a they once did before the last two Firefox updates. In the case of the chat app, the application should have configured and ran the chat window.

In the case of the other sites, well depends, one of them is displaying a little animation which hang Firefox, run from a java script.

I have tried updating Java by the way - this did not help.
