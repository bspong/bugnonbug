I've restarted Firefox and my computer a few time to see if it would help but to no avail. All my bookmark have been deleted (and I can't make new ones, the bookmark this page button doe nothing), following a link or switching tab doesn't change the URL, the back and forward button don't work, and the loading animation at the tab almost never stop (only website that stopped the loading animation wa hotmail). I have no idea how this happened but I suspect the Java Platform, it ha lagged and crashed Firefox many time (but never done anything other than that). One time when I opened it again this problem just happened, and it hasn't gone away since.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the java platform through Addonchat (I don't quite think this caused the problem but it's worth noting)
2.Close firefox
3.Open firefox
Actual Results:
Bookmarks gone, loading animation never stops, back and forward button don't work, URL doesn't change for link or switching tabs.

Expected Results:
Just acted normally, with the URLs and bookmark and whatnot.
