I had to get a new copy of Inkscape after I got my new Mac. I had some trouble getting it to open SVG file earlier version had created. I looked around at X11, and later filed a trouble report with Inkscape's creators. One of the thing I did wa to use Firefox to open some of the SVG file that Inkscape could not open. After that point, whenever I opened Firefox the top bar would appear but I could not open a new window on screen. I tried reinstalling from the original DMG, which wa still on my hard drive. (I first deleted the old app.) The problem wa not fixed. I re-downloaded the stable version, which works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Restart computer.
2.Double-click on the app in the Applications folder.
3.Wait forever for a window to show up.
Actual Results:
The top line -- what you would get if you were to close all window -- appears on-screen. Nothing can be done to get a window to appear.

Expected Results:
Typing in a URL, or doing anything that normally would make a website show up in a window should bring up a visible window.

I can see the top line on-screen, but no window. I can see the Mozilla icon on the Mac's normal display bar for operating software at the bottom of the screen. Control-mouseclick give me a way to turn the Firefox app off.

I didn't write thing down when I wa trying to get Firefox to operate correctly.
