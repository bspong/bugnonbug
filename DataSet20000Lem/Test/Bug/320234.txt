well it's a bit a strange bug, not even sure if it's a bug... I use some control from www.telerik.com for my asp.net pages, one of them being a tabstrip. For example I have two tabs, one enabled, one disabled and under both tab different page with own textfields (with required field validators, javascript) and submit buttons. When I'm inside the first page (under tab 1) I set the focus on a textbox and I hit enter. Intended use is that the javascript for the required field validator should warn that the textbox value is empty and stop the submit (this happens ok when clicking on the submit button, and also in other browser when hitting enter in the textbox). In FF it seems to use the hidden button from the another tab when using enter inside a textbox. I hope this make sense.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Difficult to reproduce, a you probably need to see the html source to understand what is the problem. I use a tabstrip component from www.telerik.com and Required FieldValidators from www.peterblum.com (both have trial versions), with that you can reproduce it. Also, don't hesitate to contact me at dhmderuiter@hotmail.com, a I can give you source, more explanations, etc.
Actual Results:
Submits the wrong stuff, and therefore creates serverside errors.

Expected Results:
Fire javascript, but it ignores that and just submits the page.
