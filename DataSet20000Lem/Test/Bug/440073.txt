When opening a new window (i.e., the app is running, but there are no open windows), the default window size is maximized. It should remember the window size from the last opened window. Also, the zoom button no longer work properly. In Firefox 2, clicking the zoom button toggle between a user-selected window size, and a window size just narrower than the screen, which allows the user to still click on desktop icons. This is preferable to the Firefox 3 behaviour, which is to toggle between a user-selected window size and a maximized window size. Maximize should be avoided on Mac for two reasons: first, maximizing a browser creates a lot of webspace, because the vast majority of website are not designed for high resolution screens, leaving a lot of whitespace on either side of the content. Secondly, maximizing hide the desktop, preventing the user from interacting with desktop icons, and preventing function like drag and drop, which is integral to the Mac experience.
