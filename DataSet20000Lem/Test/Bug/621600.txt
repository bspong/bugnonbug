scrolling with trackpad right before switching tab seems to cause content within tab to continue zooming during and after switching tab

a video is worth a million word - http://screencast.com/t/0znZdAUxEn

if i switch tab using the "crtl + tab" kb shortcut right after using the trackpad to scroll up/down on a page, the zoom go all caddywhompus on me

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use trackpad to scroll up/down on a page
2. press "ctrl + t" on the kb (almost immediately after scrolling)
3. watch the screen go craaazzzy!
Actual Results:
the page zoom wa just outta control.

Expected Results:
pressing "ctrl + t" on the kb right after scrolling should have simple tabbed over to the right without affecting the zoom of either tab

i think this wa a result of a recent o x update. i could be wrong, but before installing the update i didn't have this problem. (note: i do not have the update # handy but it wa very recent)

lastly, i'm using FF 3.5.15 b/c the OpenBook add-on doesn't appear to be officially supported by 3.6.x.

thanks!
