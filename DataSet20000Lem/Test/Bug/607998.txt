hotmail cause regular hang since deployment of latest webmail interface
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101027 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.12

When hotmail webmail is open in a tab, I've got regular hangs, window becomes grey, Firefox totally unresponsive, when a flash video is played at that time, the sound keep being played, but that's the only noticable activity I get. Then it finally unfreezes after a while (a few second to about 30 second max).

In the meantime system monintor display firefox-bin with uninterruptible status, and alternating jbd2_log_wait_commit and blkdev_issue_flush. I have also seen sync_page being displayed while Firefox is uninterruptible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open hotmail account and use normally other tab for other website
2.wait until Firefox hang and turn grey
3.wait until Firefox come back to normal
Actual Results:
I continued browsing, problem happens again regularly.



I deactivated all plugins and addons, restarting Firefox everytime in beetween, I only stopped getting this bug when I finally closed the hotmail tab, which I never do normally, and get it again when I load hotmail up again. The problem seems to be related to the new interface they have deployed recently, I never had any problem like this with the previous versions. Problem wa present with all Firefox stable releases, and under Ubuntu 10.04 also.
