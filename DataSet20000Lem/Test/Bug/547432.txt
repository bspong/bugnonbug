Certain chart displayed using flash are getting stuck in the download mode and not displaying. This wa OK in older version, only become a prob with firefox 3.6. Tried changing back to the older version I had, but the problem remains.
This problem is happening with other charts, but the example above I can't get to work whatever I try, the others below I can get working by trying them again and again. Plenty more around this site are having probs. All work fine in IE of Chrome.
