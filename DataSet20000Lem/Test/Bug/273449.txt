When dragging and dropping a dynamically created image (php script), filename is wrong.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041109 Firefox/1.0 (MOOX M3)

If you try and save an image that wa generated by a .php file, with the proper
header to tell the browser the filename:

Pragma: cache
Content-type: image/jpeg
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="test.jpg"
Cache-control: private

... then the filename in the save a dialog box will indeed be "test.jpg".
However, if you drag this image and drop it in another window, it will think
that the name of the image is the name of the .php file, not the content of the
content-disposition header. I have created a page to show this, which I'll
outline in step to reproduce.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto http://jobe.ca/~jobe/rot/
2. click and drag the image to a Windows Explorer window

Actual Results:
See that the filename saved in window explorer is "img.php". However, if you
right click and save the file instead, it will try to save a test.jpg, so I
know the header is working.

Expected Results:
The file should have been saved a test.jpg, not img.php
