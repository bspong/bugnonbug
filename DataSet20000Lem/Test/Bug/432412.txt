Messed-up display during each page load containing flash applets.

For each page loaded containing flash, before the page appears fully and perfectly ok, there's a small time during loading (the loading icon is turning) when the display of the page is really a mess, just like if random data wa dumped in the video memory (please see attached screenshot). The content is mainly black, with some random pixel block in other colors.
This happen only inside the tab containing the loading stuff, and I checked that other tab where not affected.

The problem doesn't exist when non Flash appear in a page.

For information, this never happened with Firefox 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site containing flash, like http://fr.youtube.com/
2. During page load, you see briefly the display becoming black with random shapes, and come back to normal.
Actual Results:
After this, all come back to normal, the problem is that this black intermediate screen is horrendous and hurt my eye at each page load... this is really unpleasant, even if it's not a critical issue.
