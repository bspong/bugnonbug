Different dialog when closing multiple tab if other window is open

If I close a window with multiple tabs, it prompt me "Do you want Firefox to save your tabs..." with a "Save and Quit", a "Quit" and a "Cancel" button.

However, if I have another Firefox window open, it prompt me "You are about to close..." with a "Close tabs" and a "Cancel" button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF twice, second time with two tabs. Close the second instance
2. Open FF once, with two tabs. Close FF

Actual Results:
The dialog are different for the same action

Expected Results:
The dialog should be the same

First of all, this is a usability problem - many user will not realize why the dialog are different. For me, I cannot quickly close a window with multiple tab without looking at the screen to determine which button I should click on. The default are different, and would never want to save a session. However, I do like being able to get a warning if I try to close multiple tab - maybe I forgot there wa another tab open.

Please make it possible to disable the "Do you want Firefox to save your tabs..." type dialog, and still get a warning when closing multiple tabs. Or I would appreciate if someone could point me to the correct about:config entry to tweak.
