1) must force quit all the time to get out; 2)embedded link when viewing email don't work
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/417.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/417.8
Build Identifier: firefox 1.0.6


I have a G4 iBook (Macintosh) and I'm running Tiger (MacOS X.4). I use
Firefox a my web browser, and use it to connect to my yahoo account
(not a an email client). I'm running Firefox 1.0.6, which I have
downloaded twice but it ha not helped.

When I open an email that ha a hyperlink within in, the hyperlink
doesn't work. Likewise, when I'm composing an email with a link in it,
the link is not recognized and the recipient will not receive the data
a a link that is clickable.

The odd thing is that this did work before I installed the Fasterfox
and No Script extensions. I found at first that No Script caused my
regular web link to stop working, so I uninstalled it. That worked.
Today I uninstalled Fasterfox hoping that it would fix the link
problem, but to no avail.

Another problem is that I have to Force Quit to get out of Firefox.
When I choose Quit, it just sits there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox
2.open my email program
3.voila!

Actual Results:
Don't know if it is replicable, my friend don't have this problem, only me!

Expected Results:
I've even downloaded the newest version of Firefox (1.5) and the link still don't work. I also still have to force quit too.
