Remove Ctrl + Mousewheel shortcut for changing zoom level
In the last few week I heard many account of people who had accidentally changed their zoom level on some page and were unaware of the problem or mistook the problem for something entirely unrelated (e.g. "broken site" or "window is not maximized", to name a few).
There's also data from Facebook that about 15% of their user currently have a non-standard zoom level (https://plus.google.com/113127438179392830442/posts/gg8xiDMcS2t).

Given how undiscoverable Zoom is on our current UI, and from empirical evidence when talking to people, I think there's reason to believe that a big part of that 15% represents accidental change. And the mousewheel method seems to be the one more likely to be triggered by accident.

The wheel is also usually imprecise for choosing the desired level so I wonder if people who are intentionally changing zoom even us it. With that, I propose that we remove this shortcut. I'd like to hear what are the thought of people more directly involved with a11y in what they think is the most used method for changing zoom. We'll still have left:
- ctrl + / -
- the view menu
- toolbar button (that can be added, not on the default set)
- pinch to zoom
