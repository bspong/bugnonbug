In fx2, javascript=based bookmark such a bookmarklets could be distinguished from standard bookmark with a selector: .bookmark-item[statustext^=javascript], allowing for a distinct icon.

Although this method still work on the Bookmarks Toolbar overflow (under the chevron) and in menu originating from the Bookmarks dropdown menu, the javascript bookmark show up with a default icon on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Further, on a dropdown menu coming from a bookmark folder item that sits on the Bookmarks Toolbar, the object doe not appear at all, even though it doe exist and can be seen - complete with it distinct icon - in menu originating from the Bookmarks dropdown menu from the Menu Bar.

In the fx3 browser.xul, the whole block relating to this ha been removed, but the missing statusbar element doe not seem to have been replaced with corresponding code elsewhere.

If the issue of missing javascript bookmarklets deserves a separate bug, let me know.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a javascript bookmark (bookmarklet), or
Import a bookmarks.html file that contains bookamrklets
2. Install a theme that support distinct icon for javascript bookmark
(e.g.--SphereGnome or FormalGnome)
Actual Results:
No distinct bookmarklet icon when the bookmarklet is on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Bookmarklets do not show up at all in menu that come from bookmark folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Expected Results:
Distinct icon for the bookmarklets.
Bookmarklets should show up on all menus.

I have an developmental version of SphereGnome which work with fx 3.0a9 a of the 2007-09-22 build if someone need a theme to see the problem with.
