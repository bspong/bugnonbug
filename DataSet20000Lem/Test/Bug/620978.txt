3a. Menu doesn't work very fast when running these Tests.
3b. Scrolling is very poor and jumpy.
3c. Typing a comment (like here) is super extra slow.
...

and, this Test doe not run consistently on this version of Firefox. Sometimes it terminates silently and sometimes it cause the popup to occur repeatedly.



Running http://dromaeo.com/?all on Namoroka/3.6.13pre (20101203075014) I sometimes get this popup:

"
A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.
"


It occurs during the "Strings:" Test at the END of running http://dromaeo.com/?all which differs from trying to run just http://dromaeo.com/?dromaeo-object-string , then the JavaScript terminates silently and the Test doe not complete at all.


Please note that "Namoroka 4.0b9pre" can complete these Tests.

Thanks,
Rob


PS: I know _this_ version of FF is closed for all but important Bugs. This "Performance Bug" / "Termination Bug" occurs on most of the other version of FF (except for "Namoroka 4.0b9pre" at this moment) a well a this version.


Reproducible: Always
