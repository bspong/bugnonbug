"Unresponsive Script" error triggered by extension on start since 3.6.x

Since some version in the 3.6 series, extension seem to be applied the same timeout a other scripts, which mean you get the "Unresponsive Script" dialog when loading take too long. I'm not sure what version it appeared in, but this behavior wa not present in 3.5.


This new "feature" is really annoying for me because I always keep Firefox open, and it's restarted automaticllay by session saving when I turn my laptop on. On login, the HDD is really busy, which mean Firefox is slow to load, and so do extensions. Thus, they are triggering the timeout but it's mainly due to I/O blocking their loading, not them doing crazy things. When starting Firefox manually, i.e. not on login, no timeout is reached.

I really think extension should be trusted more than script from random web pages, because the user installed them manually. Something like 60 sec sound reasonable: if an extension hangs, user will understand this and be able to remove it - not like web scripts.

Bonus point would be to detect what extension hang for more than one minute, and suggest removing it, instead of telling user about a weird script path!


FWIW, I'm using Zotero and Lazarus, and both reach the timeout on start. My laptop is reasonably recent (2006).

Reproducible: Always
