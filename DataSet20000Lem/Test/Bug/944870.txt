Firefox Nightly: Can not close tab (Linux/Ubuntu)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/30.0.1599.114 Chrome/30.0.1599.114 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Browser Version:
Mozilla Firefox 28.0a1

Operating System:
Linux Xubuntu 13.04, XFCE window manager

In normal operation/usage of Firefox Nightly, Tabs do not close.
Steps to reproduce:

1. Open/Start Firefox Nightly, when using Linux
2. CTRL+T to open a new tab
3.1. Try closing the tab by clicking the 'X' in the new tab (Tab will not close)
3.2. Try closing the tab by typing CTRL+W (Tab will not close)
3.3. Try closing the tab with <right-click-on-tab-click-close> (Tab will not close)

4. Dragging the tab out of it current window-parent, so that it becomes an 'independent' tab and clicking close on the new window will successfully close the tab (and the window).

5. Closing Firefox entirely will successfully close ALL tabs.


Actual results:

When trying to close the tab with either the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+W), or clicking the 'X' on the Tab, or by right-clicking the tab and clicking 'Close Tab' in the context menu, the tab did not close.

In all three attempt described above, the tab did not close.


Expected results:

The tab should close.
