I have the tabbrowser preference extension 1.2.8.9
Also session saver .2 I have others but these are the one that could be related.
I have 100+ tab open. I then close a tab that is not viewable on the tab bar because it is far to the right of the first 20 or so viewable tabs.
After closing it I can no longer switch tab by selection one with the Mouse. The Mouse scroll wheel is unable to scroll and the up/down scroll button are unresponsive, however when I grab the scroll bar left mouse button and and drag the bar and I can scroll that way. Also control page up and down will still work to navigate through the tabs. When put in this state by closing a tab, Firefox becomes real sluggish. Restarting will get me back to "Normal"

1. Open 100 tab
2. Close one that ha the tab out of the first viewable 20.
