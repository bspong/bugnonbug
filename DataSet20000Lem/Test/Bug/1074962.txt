Crash Report wa created/-forced probably?- by updating extension for Apache Open Office Project?
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:34.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/34.0
Build ID: 20140930004006

Steps to reproduce:

After starting AGT-system, I update, do a checkup for all program to see if there are any needed updates. There wa one for the Apache Open Office Project. One of the extension could be updated. For updating the extension the program needed an internet-access-gate. It, the process, forced to start automatically 'Aurora'. While i/t background 'Aurora' also by me wa ordered to see if there wa the daily update, and so updating itself. The extension-update had my main focus.


Actual results:

- the extension for the Apache updated was/is installed correctly, a far a I can see now;
- Aurora was, is correctly updated too, however somewhere i/t process, the Crash Report is created;
- a third program, Nokia SW suite should also check itself, program at it own for updates, however this program give the feedback, that it hasn't access to the internet.


Expected results:

Simultaneously should these 3 program (Adobe; Apache; Nokia) be checking if there is any update for these program with access to the internet, while Aurora, the Aurora browser isn't/are.not/ yet started. Something like that, ...,

Probably thisisn't specifically, technically an 'Aurora'-crash, however I thought my background-information could help the community in finding solution for it, ... .

I hope my information will be help, but it isn't direct necessarily to contact me about it. Probably see also my other 'reports' and comment ??

If needed this (non-)bug could be closed after reading with more tech-knowhow, however thats more up to others, I think so, ...
