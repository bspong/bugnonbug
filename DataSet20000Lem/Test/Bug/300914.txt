Download the installer, and run. Toward the end of the installation, the
progress meter willl stop, and a popup informs you that "-214 en-US language
pack doe not exist". The only way to exit the installation is to click the X.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download the installer, and run
2. Choose normal install option
3. Install will give a -214 error with a variety of reason

Actual Results:
After the install failed with the -214, I clicked the X to close the install.

Expected Results:
Software should have installed without error

I have run across this problem many times, with different version of Firefox,
Thunderbird, and lately with the Deer Park Alpha 2. I have seen other -214
error -- quality feedback doe not exist, chrome doe not exist. The most sure
way to fix that I have seen is to backup any existing profile folder, uninstall
the application (if the install made it far enough to leave uninstall
information), and then remove all entry of Mozilla/Firefox/Chrome from the
registry. Restart the computer, and retry the install.

The most frustrating thing about this is that I can't seem to find any helpful
information about this in Bugzilla (two closed bug about nightly builds), on
the Mozilla forum or in Google. I've seen this error after fresh Firefox
installs on brand new Windows XP installs, and on upgrade from one version of
FF to the next.
