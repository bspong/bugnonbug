Blurred image and text after moving C:\Users\<user>\AppData
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

Hi,

I'm using SSD disk for my window system C:\ drive and for performance and SSD disk preservation I always move and link C:\Users\<user>\AppData to a different external HDD M:\Users\<user>\AppData.

I do this by linking AppData to a new HDD like so:

mklink /J "C:\Users\<user>\AppData" "M:\cache\users\<user>\AppData"

All window apps work great with the exception that by moving the AppData with Firefox 29.0.1 and IE 11 I get blurred image and text while scrolling down the sites.

If I hover the mouse over the text and image it then refreshes the images. But 99,9% of the time while scrolling down the image and text get blurred.



Actual results:

I've filled a bug report here:

http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=2837903&e=0

And the issue wa tracked to be related to AMD video cards.


Expected results:

And someone gave the following suggestion which work perfectly fine:

1. enter about:config in the address/URL bar
2. Right-click an empty space and use New -> Boolean
3. In the dialog box enter: layout.paint_rects_separately Press Enter
4. In the next box enter: true
5. Close/Restart browser

After this I have no more blurred image or text.

Everything is stable.

Thanks
