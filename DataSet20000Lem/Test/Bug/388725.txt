Firefox could not open any page of this site until I Deleted Private Data.

This wa not anywhere in the list of bug (yes, I did go through the entire thing). I'm not sure if it's a bug or what? PREVIOUS experience: last month (or whenever it came out & I wa notified) I downloaded a New version of Webshots (not an upgrade, a whole New one, they said). After that I could load Wachovia (bank)'s website, but not the BillPay page (I got an error page saying BillPay temporarily unavailable, please try again later). I could open this page with Internet Explorer. Wachovia's tech. support guy had me Delete Private Data in Firefox (Tools>Options), and it worked! So this month, when I could not open any page of Webshots site (Firefox would just open a blank white page), I tried the same thing since it wa the only thing I knew to try. It worked!! While I am happy I wa able to get back to Webshots using my favorite browser, I would like to know if somebody could explain it to me, how come Firefox keep needing me to Delete Private Data when I can't access a website? In past version of Firefox, I would periodically Clear the Cache and Delete the Cookies (and in even older versions, Delete Temporary Files) to keep thing running smoothly without slowdowns. But I believe it's only the latest version (or only recently) that I can't open certain web page sometimes. Can you help me to understand this better? And is there anything else I can do to resolve this tendency (other than Delete Private Data when I can't open a site)? Should I change the check-boxes from "Always ask me before deleting private data" to "Delete private data every time I close Firefox" ? Or something else I don't know about? Thank you very much!!!!!!!!!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. This is NOT the kind of thing I would know HOW to reproduce.?!?! All I can do is try to go to a website using Firefox. If it works, great. If the site doe not load, then I suppose you could say I have "reproduced" the error, but I had no control over whether the page would load or not, which is exactly why I am writing! (If I could "reproduce" i.e. CONTROL what happens, then I would make it so it would never happen anymore! :o}) AND if I knew what CAUSED the problem (right now I ONLY know ONE way to fix it, but have NO idea WHY it happens OR WHY this solution DOES fix it--I'm NOT a technician.) So maybe this part doe not apply to the event about which I am asking. (see above) THANKS.


Actual Results:
See above - there is NO way I know of that I can reproduce this error at will.

Expected Results:
There is NO way I can reproduce this (once again). However, regarding how to FIX this problem: the 3 time I have had a problem and Deleted Private Data in Options under Tools, it did resolve the problem, i.e. the site that would not load now would load normally. It's just that I don't know WHY this worked or WHAT is causing the problem in the first place. That's what I want to know.

It should not periodically become unable to load a web site or page. This only started happening recently, so I suspect maybe it is related to a new build of Firefox or some updates. Should I change the check-boxes from "Always ask me before deleting private data" to "Delete private data every time Firefox closes"? Or is there something else I should do to prevent this error from recurring? THANK YOU!
