Using Windows XP 64 bit and Deer Park Alpha 2:

When visiting a site that us Javascruipt, Deer Park Alpha 2 doe not display Javascript at all. It show a an arrow inside a circle, and you hit the arrow and nothing hapens. At the site noted, http://www.msicomputer.com./, this mean you are unable to access the rest of the site.

In Firefox, which is a 32 bit application, Javascript display properly if you hit the arrow inside the circle, and you can see the display and use any link that are provided.

It is necessary to use Firefox in site where Deer Park Alpha 2 doe not work.

One thing o note is that Firefox ha the Noscript extention installed, and it seems to leak over into Deer Park because the preference are kept in the same place. Is there a way to seperate the preference of the two browser so I can perform more accurate tests?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.msicomputer.com./
2.Click the arrow inside the bottom circle.
3.Watch a youb are presented with absolutely nothing!

Expected Results:
In Firefox 32 bit, you get graphic with links. I expected the same.
