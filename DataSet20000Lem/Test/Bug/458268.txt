When resizing the window of Firefox with some tab open the web page window start to move up and down about 5 pixel (about 4 time in a second).

It depends on how many tab you got. For example: if you got 5 tab open and start to downsize the window, the effect can occur really soon.
With just 2 tab open the effect occurs when the window is smaller then the width of the to tabs. Sometimes the vertical scroll bar disappears, too.

The only change I got to the original Firefox workspace is the following:
I turned of the bookmark-toolbar but I moved some RSS-Feeds up to the top bar where the main button are (File, Edit, View,....). But I dont think that this is cause the problem.

However everythin is fine with a maximized window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some tab (2 or more)
2. start downsizing the window until it star to shake...IT WILL!
3. (optional) Close the Bookmarks-Toolbar and put some links/RSS-Feeds up to the right side of the main tool bar (File, Edit, View)
Actual Results:
Starts moving up and down at special point. Actually when it started bouncing and you upsize the window again the effect can stay until a special point, which to me look random.
The vertical scrollbar dissapears at a random point....

Expected Results:
Not bouncing
