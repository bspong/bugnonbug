this ha been present since window Beta 6100 and seen in Retail. and ha been in each revision of firefox back to 3.0.0.

when you quit firefox from file-->exit or the standard red X in the window. firefox will indeed exit but under the Task manager on and off it will either exit or stay running and when it stay open.. it gradually eats up ram. i have yet to see how far/if it cause an BSOD/crash a i only have 2GB ram and it a Slow process.seems to happen more often when multiple tab are open for extended peroids then Firefox is closed. the Most i've seen it eat up wa 890MB after letting it go for a few hour

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox
2.open multipule tab and wait agood 3hrs or better with 7+ tab
3. close firefox from either Red x in upper right hand corner or File --> exit
4: open Task manager and goto Processes
5: notice and observe it slowly eating memory when it stay open despite firefox being closed
Actual Results:
begin to gradually leak Available ram when reproduced.

Expected Results:
Completely closed out and not leave the exe running

after 800MB and beyond cause instability in DirectX and OpenGL game running. Prime example is Second Life when 500+MB used Framerates begin to drop. in semi heavy area where you wouldnt normally lag. framerate drop below 5.

Occasionally for FFXI (directX based) Causes Connection problem but more often then not. And like SecondLife (OpenGL[Havok4] Based [i know thier sims use Havok 4 but client i think is still Havok1]) Causes Major FPS/Framerate lag.
