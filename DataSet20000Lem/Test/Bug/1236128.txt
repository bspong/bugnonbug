"Search HTML" in browser toolbox count element from other frame (<window>s)
(Based on bug 1228675 comment 3)

STR that work for 44- and 45:
1. Open firefox; make sure you have only 1 window opened; make sure remote debugging is enabled
2. Open N more window
3. In the last opened window open Browser Toolbox -> Inspector, scroll markup to the bottom
4. Type "#search-container" without quote in the search field, press Enter N+1 time

Result: Markup just scroll up by 1 page the tirst N time you press Enter.
When you press enter N+1th time, the correct node is selected in markup-view.
If you're using ff45+, then search field display "k of N+1" (found nodes)

Expectations: The correct node should be selected after the 1st press of Enter key
On ff45+ search field should display "1 of 1"

Notes:
I think it's "Devtools: Framework" bug, since I don't see this behavior in Inspector
when I inspect normal frame on a web page. Maybe I haven't tried hard enough.
Also, I still see that "scroll 1 page to the top when node can't be selected"-behavior. I thought
it wa fixed in bug 1184525, but it wasn't. Probably it's a good idea to fix that behavior once
and for all, because there still may be other case when the next found node can't be selected.
