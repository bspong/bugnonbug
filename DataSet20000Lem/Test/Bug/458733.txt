If you have a forever iframe (for doing Comet) the cursor pointer will be set a a normalCursor + a small sand clock, even if you put on the body style="cursor:default"

If you have a part of a page which will never be closed (as happen if you implement Comet) the cursor will be the normal cursor plus a small sand clock.
This is useful if you want to know if the page isn't still loading, but if you want to avoid this (because in Comet the page is going to be always loading) you can't redefine the cursor for the body element.

So, in my case the forever iframe will make the whole page have a loading cursor, when I actually make the change to have the default one

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a page with a body and some content (put some content on it). And in the body's style put: "cursor: default" (with this, you are expecting to see the normal cursor, not the loading one)
2. Inside of that body, add an iframe which source will never be completed-returned (Comet part)
3. move the cursor on the whole page, you will see the un-desired cursor, not the normal one

Actual Results:
You will see a cursor loading, instead of the normal one.

Expected Results:
If I set to the body the normal cursor, I'll want to have the normal one, not the waiting-progress instead.
