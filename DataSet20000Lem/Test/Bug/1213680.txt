Inspector should not default to "Pick an element from the page"
This is a UX issue. My father, a web developer, ha never used the Firefox developer tool because he say they're confusing and broken. I finally sat down with him this weekend and found out where he's having problems.

STR:
1. Have the developer tool undocked, so that they open in their own window. For the worst possible behavior, this window should overlap the main browser window so that it's hidden if the main browser window is on top.
2. Open the Inspector from the Web Developer menu, or type Ctrl-Shift-C.

Here's what happens: The inspector window briefly flash open and then disappears. When you move your mouse in the main window, the "Pick an element from page" mode is in force, but there's no hint of that besides the fact that everything is flashing in strange colors. The inspector window is completely hidden since it's behind the main window. My dad didn't know how to get out of this mode so he would always just quit Firefox.

This really seems like sub-optimal UX. I'm not sure how my dad's devtools got undocked in the first place, but it's easy enough to do.

Given that people can choose a specific element to inspect using the context menu, why is this behavior the default? Once you have the inspector open it's easy enough to click the "Pick an element" button yourself if you want to.
