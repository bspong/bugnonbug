when the option to restore tab and window from last time is enabled, you then browse to a bunch of websites, click on stuff, view enlarged picture etc.
then you close the browser,
when you reopen you expect to see the same tab that were open when you closed firefox, but sometimes firefox open a different set of tab (not necessarily including the one you had open when you closed firefox) that you have visited some time ago. it may also open up several additional window (most of these are enlargement that open new window - off of shoping site or galleries).

this can be quite irritating because a. you end up with a bunch of window you then have to close, b. you loose the tab you actually last had open.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
don't know exactly what cause it to happen, but it usually happens to me once a day or once every other day, and i use firefox a minimum of 4-5 hour most days.

1. open a bunch of tab and site that produce additional windows, e.g. any product on amazon.co.uk that ha a zoom (click the zoom to get the additional window).
2. close those tabs, navigate to some other page
3. close the session with firefox

4. open the session with firefox
5. bug may occur or browsing may be normal
6. close the session...
7. open ...
8. browsing may be normal or you may get all window popups and tab from when you were on amazon, (and not just one zoom window, but all the one you looked at)
Actual Results:
browsing may be normal or you may get all window popups and tab from when you were on amazon, (and not just one zoom window, but all the one you looked at)
