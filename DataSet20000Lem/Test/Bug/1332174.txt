Steps to reproduce:

Type a search term containing a forward slash into the location bar, e.g. "test/search" or "Apache/2.2.3 (Red Hat)" without quotes.

Search suggestion in location bar is disabled, a default.


Actual results:

The preview dropdown show "Search with <Default Provider>" a if it is going to send the typed text a a search query, but when I press enter, it redirects to my ISP's DNS error page, implying that the typed query wa incorrectly interpreted and sent a a DNS request instead of a search query.

What is also odd is that this behaviour seems inconsistent; "testdomain/search" wa correctly sent a a search when I tested it, but a keyboard mash followed by "/search" wa sent a a DNS request.


Expected results:

The typed entry should have been sent to the search engine a a query, not parsed a a domain to be resolved by DNS.

Also, the action listed in the preview dropdown when typing in the location bar should always match the action that is actually being performed when input is entered.
