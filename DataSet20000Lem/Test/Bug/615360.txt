Get attacked by any number of fake "security software" malware pages.

These trap the "close" event and open confirmation modal that never let you escape.

Try to close the window in any way, including from the Windows Task Manager.

Fail because Firefox is too stupid to realise that if you're going to let arbitrary code and script fire off modals, the user ha to be able to override them at least at the "close this window that exists only to infect my computer with malware" level.

(Seriously, guys? This ha been a problem for YEARS. It's not new. And it can't be something that never happens to the developers, because hijacked content can happen on any website out in the real world, right?)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find malware-pushing website anywhere
2. Try to close the stupid "close" dialog that push the malware.
3. Find it ignores close, try to download anyway, and FIREFOX WON'T LET YOU CLOSE.
4. Kill your session and watch firefox LOAD IT AGAIN WHEN YOU RESTART. (And yeah, I could lose all the REST of my session too. That's not a solution.)
Actual Results:
Completely rage-inducing incompetent failure.

Expected Results:
It should actually respond to "close this window" by CLOSING THE DAMNED WINDOW.

"But it's a modal and we have to respect modals" is not an acceptable excuse.
