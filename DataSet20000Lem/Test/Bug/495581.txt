Firefox 3.0.10 Run away memory usage and unable to fully shut down Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This problem is very similar to the one posted in bug 467939. I have noticed ever since Firefox 2 and every version since to current version 3.0.10 that Firefox continues to use up more and more memory. After about 1 hour or more of running Firefox ha used up all my available memory and when I try to shut it down to clear out the memory, Taskmanager show that it's still in memory. Only way to get rid of Firefox is to use taskmanager to remove it. One of my ZoneAlarm firewall configuration allows me to block java and javascripts from specific webpages. I noticed that when I did this, the problem with Firefox using up memory seemed to decrease significantly. I wa able to run Firefox all day then and never had to shut it down. As I said, this seems to be a problem that ha been there ever since FF2 came out and ha never been fixed despite my numerous report on the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just run Firefox normally for long period of time.
2. Any amount of time over 60 minute this problem will show up.
3. Seems to be tied into java or javascripts. If these are block, problem appears to stop.

Actual Results:
There is no step by step procedure that I've found that can cause this problem. The only thing that that I've done that appears to alleviate the problem is to use the java and javascript blocking feature in my ZoneAlarm Firewall product. I have noticed that this problem appears to occur at a faster rate when viewing streaming video like from YouTube.

Expected Results:
When I incorporate Java and Javascript blocking on suspect webpage (usually one that contain streaming videos) I get much le occurrence of this memory leak and shut down lock up. Of course those feature that use the Javascript or Java do not work. I have noticed that many banner type ad are blocked when I do this and I wonder if the Javascript they are using is causing this.

I am becoming more and more suspicious that some kind of Javascript that is being used in banner ad and streaming video is at the heart of this memory leakage and thus preventing FF from shutting down. Almost like FF is being hacked into via Javascript and being controlled externally. And a I said, I have been seeing this problem in every version that ha come out since version 2.
