"Save as..." and "Save link as..." do not work when running without WPS
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; U; Warp 4.5; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070731 Firefox/2.0.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; U; Warp 4.5; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070731 Firefox/2.0.0.6

Asking for either of these yield the following in the Error Console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIProperties.get]" nsresult: "0x80004005
(NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame ::
chrome://global/content/contentAreaUtils.js :: getTargetFile :: line 511"
data: no]


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Firefox 2.0.0.x (all, so far)
2.Run with PM but without WPS
3.Pick anything and select "Save as..." or any variant thereof
4.Check the Error console
Actual Results:
Nothing visible or audible, no crash, etc.

Error console shows:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIProperties.get]" nsresult: "0x80004005
(NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame ::
chrome://global/content/contentAreaUtils.js :: getTargetFile :: line 511"
data: no]


Expected Results:
Opened the "Save file as..." dialog.

Tried with my standard profile and a fresh (brand new) profile on each 2.0.0.x build. So far, exactly (or at least, almost exactly) the same Error console entry on each build for each different profile tested.

Tested with absolutely stock (as unzipped, correctly) builds, and with all combination of 0, 1, 2, or all 3 of: DOM Inspector 1.8.1.6, Flashblock 1.5.4.1, and Tab Mix Plus 0.3.6 on Firefox 2.0.0.6. (Appropriate earlier version on earlier 2.0.0.x builds.)

In all cases, Theme wa Firefox (default) 2.0.

Hardware is standard PC (AMD 2700+ on Abit K7, 2 GB RAM) running eCS 1.24 without WPS but with PM.

I don't know if about:buildconfig information is relevant, but since I can't "Save as..." it would be difficult to include.
