Build Identifier: Recent Minefield Build

A few week ago (I can't remember on which build this started happening), when Minefield updated itself, I started having this error. Once the update wa installed and it prompted me to restart, I clicked but it did not restart, just close. From there, clicking on the shortcut would produce this error:

---------------------------
firefox.exe - Application Error
---------------------------
The application wa unable to start correctly (0xc0000056). Click OK to close the application.
---------------------------
OK
---------------------------

Reinstalling doe fix the error, but every time it is updated this will occur again. Safe Mode ha no effect. I have tried doing full reinstalls including trying a new profile, doing a registry clean, and installing to a different directory, none of which helps. The portable version share this problem. There is no entry in the Event Log.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update Minefield.
2. Try to open it.
3.
Actual Results:
Produces error 0xc0000056.

Expected Results:
Opened updated Minefield.
