Memory leak in firefox on page with big number of image
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070809 Fedora/2.0.0.6-2.fc8 Firefox/2.0.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070809 Fedora/2.0.0.6-2.fc8 Firefox/2.0.0.6

Huge memory used by X server process when firefox open several page with 100+
image inside (I used locally created page with photo collection). Even after
firefox closed tab with this pages, X server still used ton of memory. Only
after full termination of firefox, X server free memory.

For example now X used 400Mb VIRT/167Mb RES of memory.

Opened 3 page in tab each with ~100 of 1024x768 images.

Got more memory used by X (862/535Mb):

2150 root 20 0 862m 535m 8916 S 2 26.7 127:15.07 X

Closed tab with that pages. The same result:

2150 root 20 0 865m 539m 8916 R 6 26.9 127:16.86 X

This is 100% memory leak.

The only way to avoid swapping is full restart of firefox.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Create 5 local html page with 100 image per page 1024x768 each.
2) Note memory used by X process.
3) Open all 5 page in firefox tabs.
4) Note memory used by X process.
5) Close firefix tabs.
6) Note memory used by X process.
7) Exit firefox.
8) Note memory used by X process.
Actual Results:
Overswap/system down when continuous using of firefox.

Expected Results:
Firefox must free memory resources.

Tested same page under Opera 9. No huge memory used when opened all page (i.e.
Opera used different way to allocate X server resources?). Also X server
memory's go lower after closing of Opera's tabs.

Some comments:

1) Not only X server memory problem. Firefox process leak too:

189 VIRT/63 RES before open page

328 VIRT/204 RES after open page and the same after closing tab with pages!


2) This is the browser cache keeping thing in memory so it is very quick if you
want to go back to the same page you once visited. If you don't want this, you
can disable the feature. There are several preferences. Load up about:config
and search for 'cache' and you can tweak to your liking.

3) This is bad idea to keep cache for closed tabs!!! Most of user never use "Undo
closed tab" feature. So actually this is memory leak which don't allow continuo
using of firefox when surfing big pages.

So best solution will be cleaning cache for closed tab. IMHO ;)

4) This bug is *much* deeper.

Have just disabled memory cache (browser.cache.memory.enable=false)

firefox-bin process no more eats huge memory, it's ok

But X process still have problem. I opened 20 page 100 image each, X grows to
~800Mb RES/1200Mb VIRT memory used even after I closed all tab in browser!

Maybe there is some tool to view X resource allocated by process?
Seems firefox just not free some resources.
