Spaces in file path prevent FF from displaying local HTML page.

I use MAMP (Local server environment) and set Firefox a primary browser.

When there is a space ' ' in the path to my working html document - FF display my 'home page' but not the page I'm trying to open.
e.g folder on my desktop called 'this folder' contains a file.htm that I'm developing using DW CS4.

If I change the folder name to 'this_folder' - it works.

IF I set SAFARI a my primary browser - it work a expected.


If I double-click on the 'file.htm' FF work if I change 'this folder' to 'this_folder.

I have been able to reproduce this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create an html file inside of a folder named 'something else'
2.double-click on the heml file - doesn't work
3.rename the folder to 'something_else' - work now.
Actual Results:
without renaming the folder - go to home page
rename the folder - work

Expected Results:
should display the html page from within the folder.

MAMP is an important development environment used by many web designers.
FF is an important browser.
They should play nice together.
I don't want to switch over to Safari.
