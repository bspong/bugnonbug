I am currently remaking my web site using XML and XSLT (don't worry, I will make HTML version for accessibility and search indexing). I decided to offer RSS and Atom feed to my web site and I also wanted to display the feed by transforming them using an XSLT stylesheet. However, with the recently added Feed View, I wa worried that it would override my stylesheet, and unfortunately it does. So instead of seeing my home page with link and all, I see that pretty useless (in that context) feed view. It's very annoying and not inviting. This behaviour doesn't show up on local file (file: protocol) and the XSLT stylesheet is used a expected.

By the way, is it possible for a web page to use JavaScript to subscribe to web feeds? Feed view provides link to subscribe to the displayed feed: can I use these function or do I get a security error?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://fragag.ifrance.com/xml/index.xml or directly to the feeds, http://fragag.ifrance.com/xml/rss.xml and http://fragag.ifrance.com/xml/atom.xml.
2. Note that the XSLT stylesheet should be used instead.
Actual Results:
Feed view is used instead of the XSLT stylesheet defined in the XML document.

Expected Results:
The feed should use the XSLT stylesheet defined in the XML document. Also, the page could be allowed to use the JavaScript function the feed view us to subscribe to feeds.
