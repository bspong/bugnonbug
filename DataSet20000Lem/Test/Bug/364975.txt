Only popup window but not tab of a re-restoreing of session got restored after a 2second power failure (=2nd restore session).
I had some tab opened and after a window shutdown (firefox wa open during shutdown) firefox asked me if I want to restore the session (I said yes :)). Sofar so good all tab were restored. I did not close any tab but opened new tabs. Inside of this tab I opened several popups. I had a power failure and I had to restart my computer. I started firefox again and restored the session. Everything wa restored (popups, tab from the first crash) but not the tab which I opened after the first restoring.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some tab in a browser
2. Produce somehow a crash of firefox (pull the plug?)
3. Restore the session
4. Open new tab -> Open popups in a window (via the context menu)
5. Pull the plug from your computer :)
6. Restart again
7. Open firefox and restore the session.
Popups and the tab from session of step 2 are restored but not the tab from step 4 :(



Expected Results:
Every tab should be restored a the popups
