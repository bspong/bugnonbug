Open bookmark in a new tab configurable

It would be nice if it would be possible to choose to open bookmark always in a new tab, perhaps in the about:config. For people used to open everything in a new tab, opening a bookmark result in loosing the actual tab which is really frustrating.

I know that there are x way to open bookmark in a new tab:
- middle mouse button (I have a laptop)
- ctrl-click (I have always to push two button and use two hand to open a bookmark?)
- context-menu (Thanks, right-click, find the open in new tab, left click, it's a good training for the touch pad, something easier?)
- tabmixplus (nice I have to install an add-on with 100 unneeded feature to just open bookmark in a new tab?)

I'm not alone, just google firefox open bookmark in a new tab and you will see that is a common request.
