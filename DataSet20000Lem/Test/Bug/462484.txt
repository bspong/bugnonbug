Devs,

I cannot expand my bookmark in the left pane of the organize bookmark tool anymore? The only place the actual bookmark are visible is on the right side of the window making it nearly IMPOSSIBLE to organize bookmark and totally IMPOSSIBLE to check for duplicate in different folder by expanding one of the left and one on the right like normal. This is a major MAJOR bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select Organize Bookmarks
2.Try and expand folder to display book in left half of window
3.Like trying to shovel water with a pitchfork
Actual Results:
Impossible to see any bookmark in left window pane, only folders. Impossible to expand all folder an bookmark in the right pane a well. Attempting to expand folder in the right cause the right view to change focus to only the folder you try to expand and the rest of the Bookmarks Menu tree disappears.

Expected Results:
Should be able to expand/collapse all folder and *bookmarks* in both the right and left window half so you can see the bookmark contained in multiple folder at the same time like you have been able to since the dawn of time (or at least since NCSA Mosaic)

It look like we are backing up. Organizing bookmark is nearly impossible with this bug. Just a bad a that damn save to pdf dialog where you can't select an old file to overwrite. Please fix both of these shortcomings. Thanks.
