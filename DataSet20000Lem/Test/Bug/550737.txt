In the attached screenshot, I'm using Mumble's overlay (top) (http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) and FRAPS (lower right); both program attach an overlay to program that acquire accelerated surface (generally, games). Mumble display a list of people in a channel, and FRAPS display your current framerate.

With those on, when I scroll up and down the page, I get "ghosted" portion of the overlay that aren't repainted, and it generally ruin the entire effect of the page. The D2D acceleration is nice, but it is completely unusable with this kind of conflict.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up Mumble (ensure Overlay is on) or FRAPS
2. Open Firefox 3.72a with D2D acceleration on
3. Scroll up and down a page
Actual Results:
I get "ghosted" portion of the overlay copied up and down the page, making it unreadable.

Expected Results:
Ideally, the overlay should not appear. If they must appear, they should not ghost up and down the page, instead remaining in a static location a they would with any other similarly accelerated software (Flash fullscreen mode, Sony Vegas' video preview, Windows Media Player).
