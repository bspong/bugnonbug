Unable to cause a certificate to be generated on a smart card in v31 of FF
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

Attempted to retrieve an ID certificate directly to a smart card.


Actual results:

I am trying to populate a Gemalto Cyberflex Access 64K v2c [TOP IM FIPS CY2]
with a software certificate generated using the One Time Password feature of a Redhat Enterprise CA. Nothing appears to happen after completing the retrieval form and clicking the Submit Request button on the User Identification Registration page.

This used to work just fine on previous release of Firefox. (back some time ago; possibly a far back a version 21). We haven't needed to perform these task for a while, but new request have come in. I indicate that the certificate should be loaded to the token inserted in the OmniKey 3121 card reader on my Windows 7 PC, but Firefox v31 just sits there. I wa able to get the ID certificate downloaded / installed directly on a smart card using v25 of Firefox, but that only is part of the issue. The process used in this case add email certificate separately from the ID certificate. This process normally asks where to 'download' the certificate(s) and then present the user with an authentication window. In this case, only the location dialog box is presented, the "Choose Token Dialog" window is displayed, the slot with the token is selected, and it look like the browser (v25) briefly present a "Please Wait..." dialog, but then nothing happens.

Choosing to retrieve the certificate(s) to the Software Security Device is possible, which allows u to export and inject the certificate separately, but is not the preferred method for retrieving the ID certificate. Any thoughts?

Normally at least a PIN window is presented. Has anyone else reported an issue like this? No hit came up in the search here on bugzilla, but there are better Any suggestion on option to enable or disable to get around this? We currently use Gemalto Cyberflex Access 64K v2c [TOP IM FIPS CY2] card stock (we have a bit left on hand and would like to avoid potential issue in meeting customer request going forward.



Expected results:

Normally we are able to generate a One Time PIN/Password, which represents a user request on the CA, and then assist with the 'retrieval' of the certificate to a token. If requested we also populate the smart card with email signing and encryption certificates. Just in case the conversation need further discussion that get into more detail, it might be preferred to keep it out of public search until the detail are resolved. This is why I checked the box. Thank you so much for your help.
