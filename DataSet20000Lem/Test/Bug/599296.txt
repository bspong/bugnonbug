XSL Transformation fails when attempting to write valid data.

XSL file are written on-the-fly during transformation, this cause valid data to be parsed wrong by the browser window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a XML file.
2. Create a XSL file that transforms the XML into XHTML 1.0 (DOCTYPE included with xsl:text (disable-output-escaping="no") element and CDATA).
3. Open the XSL file with Firefox.
Actual Results:
The DOCTYPE element is written to the file a text and the file is rendered wrong (for not being valid XHTML 1.0?).

Expected Results:
A well-formed XHTML 1.0 file describing your XML file transformed with XSLT.

There is no difference whatsoever between using disable-output-escaping "yes" and "no", whereas there should be (DOCTYPE should be written as-is because no entities/escaping can be used in it!).
What happens is the file is rendered wrong by Firefox for not being a valid XHTML file, a the plain-text DOCTYPE element wa written to the page instead.

Firefox should transform the file and then parse it once again a a whole.
