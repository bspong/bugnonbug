Fair enough, don't expose it in the UI, but make it easy for supporter to guide
clueless user to open this Manager when troubleshooting extension collision or
other weird behaviors. Command line option are too complicated for many users.
People have actually created VBS script that create shortcut that open the
Profile Manager. See http://planet.nana.co.il/ranyk/Files/CreatePMShortcut.vbs

Installing an extension to launch the Profile Manager would be an overkill. In
fact, instead of having to guide user to add the host to the extension
whitelist would, we might a well spend a few support iteration teaching those
user how to use the command line. This can be very time-consuming in some
cases. If you read Hebrew, check this level of cluelessness:

Two easier to use alternatives:

1. An option to restart Firefox into the Profile Manager by holding the Shift
key when exiting the browser (e.g. File -> Exit).
-and/or-
2. An option to launch Firefox into the Profile Manager by pressing and holding
the Shift key right after launching the browser. This could be useful when the
browser refuse to start.
