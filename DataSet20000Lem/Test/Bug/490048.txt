Twice today Firefox 3.0.9 ha jumped to 2GB memory utilization when refreshing the news feed on Facebook. Overall system performance is sluggish during this occurrence. The first time Firefox recovered after a few minute and returned to normal memory utilization (perhaps 200M overall), the second time (several hour later) it crashed but wa unsuccessful in sending the crash report.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Log into Facebook.com
3. Refresh news feed
Actual Results:
Issue ha occurred twice in perhaps 20 or 30 refreshes today.

Expected Results:
Maintained normal memory utilization and not crashed.

The issue appears to be new today. I recently filtered out the "LivingSocial" application from the Facebook news feed so that it no longer appears -- perhaps this filtering is resulting in some dodgy code coming from Facebook's end. I did not observe a module name when Firefox crashed.
