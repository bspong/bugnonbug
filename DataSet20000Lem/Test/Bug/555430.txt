When trying to open a page which hosted a java applet application, a popup page ha beed appeared saying "We're Sorry
Firefox had a problem and crashed. We'll try to restore your tab and window when it restarts.
To help u diagnose and fix the problem, you can send u a crash report."
And when i tried to see the event log, i did not find any entry about that process, so i use the IE with the same web site which be able to write to the eventLog and wrote "Faulting application iexplore.exe, version 7.0.6001.18385, time stamp 0x4b2b560f, faulting module jvm.dll, version 0.0.0.0, time stamp 0x4005b17d, exception code 0xc0000005, fault offset 0x0004ed44, process id 0x1440, application start time 0x01cacd8ddbfe5c22."
