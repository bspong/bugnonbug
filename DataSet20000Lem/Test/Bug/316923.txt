I tried to install Firefox RC3, and when I tried to access the internet it would not connect. I turned off my firewall (Norton Internet Security) and the probolem presisted. I closed the browserr and tried to re-install RC2 to report the propolem, but I discovered that firefox.exe wa still running, and refused to clse when I tried to end the process from the Task Manager. I restarted my computer, but that didn't help. I did a virus scan and a spyware scan (Ad-Aware) and that didn't help either. After restarting my computer I wa able to reinstall RC2, which work fine. This happened at home and on the network at school. Nobody else I've talked to ha this probolem. I tired using the update feture, and downloading the stand alone installer, but it resulted in the same probolem.
