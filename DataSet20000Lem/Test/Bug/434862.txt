My Yahoo! page ha a set of modules, each of which ha 3 button used to refresh the module, set the preference for the module, or delete the module. Additionally, the page is divided in a main (wide) column that go about 7/8 of the width of the page and a 2nd (narrow) column taking up the remaining 1/8. The button for the module in the wide column often appear at the right of the page (lined up vertically with the button for the narrow column). Usually, this seems to happen for all the module in the wide column. Occasionally some of the module lower in the page will have their button correctly placed. Additionally, the misplaced button do not perform their function (nor doe clicking where the button should be perform the function). Correctly placed button (in the narrow column or in the wide column when it doe have correctly placed buttons) do work.
