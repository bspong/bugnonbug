For some reason, I cannot download and install Firefox past 1.5 without it continuously crashing. I have tried to dl 2.0, 2.5. 3.0-3.6

ALl of these continue to crash whenever I install them. I have found nothing in any form of troubleshooting yet. I am running window on a laptop, and I am using WIndows 7 premium.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the mozilla fiefox dl (3.6) website
2. Download & Install Mozilla
3. Stat Mozilla Firefox 3.6
Actual Results:
I am not sure on any other steps, in case this isnt a problem for anyone else, I cannot say how to reproduce the problem.

Expected Results:
The "Crash Report" of Mozilla firefox continues to come up until I exit out of the attempt to retore the tabs, even when it hasnt opened yet.

I have tried to reinstall all these versions, and all of them continue to do the same thing. SOme of the application and website I use online are phasing out Firefox 1.5. The only thing I have not tried is to reinstall window 7.
