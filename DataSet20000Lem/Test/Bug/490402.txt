I got one of the late 2008 15 inch Macbook Pros (2.4 GHz, 2Gb, 250Gb, but that shouldn't be relevant) in January (three month ago) and immediately installed FF 3.1b2 so I could take advantage of the multitouch gesture that wa now available. The problem prompting this report ha persisted from then to even now (through 3.1b3 and 3.5b4 which I just downloaded today). It wa a new machine, new installation of the OS, a new profile with no extension provides no remedy, and the behavior ha remained exactly the same every time for the last three months.

The error console provides no output.

This is not bug 478600 or bug 469483, but these seem to suggest that there is a bigger fundamental issue. Also, following idea in comment on those report provides no remedy.
