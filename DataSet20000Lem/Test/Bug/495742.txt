The tab (on Windows Vista at least) do not all have the same height. The active tab is slightly higher than the inactive one (1 pixel row). Tabs that the mouse is being hovered over are also 1 pixel higher than inactive ones. The best way I would describe the new tab button is a a placeholder for a tab. So for that reason it should behave the same; on hovering the top should raise 1 pixel. It is inconsistent now, since the new tab button remains the same height when being moused over.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some tab
2. Verify that the tab's height is dependent on it activity/inactivity and on mouse hovering
3. Now hover over the new tab button and see that unlike it bigger counterpart it height doe not change. This look weird.


Expected Results:
When hovering over the new tab button it should raise by a pixel. Because once you click the button it becomes a tab with that higher height. It would be similar to the way the other tab work; if you hover it becomes a bit higher and if you click it stay that high. The only difference is that the new tab button widens into a real tab.
