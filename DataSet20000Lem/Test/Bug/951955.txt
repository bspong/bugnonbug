Unexpected memory consumption and CPU cycle associated with website "nola.com"

Steps to reproduce:

Visit the website NOLA.Com, and then open subsequent tab using URLs showing within that first page. Leave the tab up for some period, and watch the CPU usage and the Memory consumed using the Task Manager


Actual results:

The memory shoot way high, quickly to 500 MB or more. CPU use hovers at 3 to 5 percent. The CPU use could be explained, in part, by adverts, a might the memory.

However, sometimes, the number continue to climb, memory higher, and CPU use higher till the system lock up (with CPU up at 40 percent, for example).

In an attempt to get rid of the offensive, and odd, advertising schema, using Adblock and Ghostery to claim down on everything prof useless, or worse, quickly rising CPU and memory to 1GB without fail, leading to crash or necessitating manual shutdown of the Fox program. Sometimes, this crash, or the manual shutdown of Fox using task manager leaf 2 leaf of Adobe Flash, within the task manager, even though Fox is gone.

With full use of Adblock and Ghostery, I noticed a top blank line which wa not removed, and which appeared to behave oddly (as if reloading, and causing the balance of the content to shift up and back). Using Adblock remove element successfully remove the top black element, but doe not end the memory consumption running up.


Expected results:

Something other than the above, I suspect....

Note: I've noticed this problem before ver 25, going back a few versions.
Note: While the unrestrained memory consumption disappears with Adblock and Ghostery disabled, the memory doe climb way high, and the system CPU run high.
