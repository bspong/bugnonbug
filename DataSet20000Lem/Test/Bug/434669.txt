Was poking at the Bug 434590 comment #12, when I got this assert failure.
This happened twice today on Dietrich's try build https://build.mozilla.org/tryserver-builds/2008-05-13_17:44-dietrich@mozilla.com-bug433525-isContainersQueryCrash/
. This might also happen on RC1 if not for bug# 434590
This is not easily reproducible. This is a race which occurs when madly refreshing the open web page(s) while simultaneously deleting the "Today" folder

ASSERT: Item is not visible, no row to count
Stack Trace:
0:PTV__countVisibleRowsForItem([xpconnect wrapped nsINavHistoryResultNode])
1:PTV_itemInserted([xpconnect wrapped (nsISupports, nsINavHistoryResultNode, nsINavHistoryContainerResultNode, nsINavHistoryQueryResultNode)],[xpconnect wrapped nsINavHistoryResultNode],1)


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Assertion failure error message show up and the history are added a root node instead of being added a child node to "Today" folder

Expected Results:
No assertion message should be displayed and the history entry should be added to "Today" folder.
