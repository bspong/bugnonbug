User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7

Mozilla display page a a result of user actions, script
in already loaded pages, other process requesting it, etc.
Sometimes user are presented with unwanted page (it would
be fairer to state that user are plagued with that).
This displaying of unwanted page break security since it
result in making user do something that they do not want to
do, like, e.g. reading an adware.
This request for enhancement it to display in the history the
source of the request that make a page displayed (addon, plugin,
user action, another page, external process, etc.). I.e. any
information the brower ha regarding who asked it to display a
page. This help a lot user to spot malicious adware.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. no way, there is an adware somewhere hidden in my Firefox that make
it display some commercial page every 10-15 minutes. No antivirus and
anti-adware, and anti-spyware had been able to spot it.
Reinstalling Firefox make the problem disappear for few hour only.


Expected Results:
Displaying "show all history", I would like to see a chronological
list of page displayed (that doe not get reordered when clicking
on them, a it doe currently). Clicking on one entry I would like
to see who told Firefox to display the page.
