I use Firefox in Linux, inside KDE (version 3.5.2 at this moment). I configured the browser to open link in new tab and use the command "firefox <url>" to load new URLs into a new Firefox instante or a new tab in a running instance. Many time I open URLs using this method from xchat. The problem is that when I do it, the Firefox window becomes the front window in the desktop, hence displaying the URL I just wanted to open. However, the Firefox window doe not receive focus, and the active window is still the xchat one.

This happens also if I do the same from an xterm. For example, just now I opened a new xterm, typed "firefox www.google.com" in it and then Firefox became the front window but the focus wa still in the xterm window. This is very annoying for several reasons.

If you type something thinking firefox ha focus, it will go to the previous application, which is in the background. Worse than that, any key combination you press inside firefox will be received by the active application. This can be very dangerous and/or annoying. For example, many time I try to close the recently opened URL by hitting Ctrl+W. Instead of closing the Firefox tab, I would close the current chatting channel. If I type Ctrl+L to go to the location bar, the chat window will be cleared (all conversation is lost).

In this case it's annoying, but this is potentially dangerous because the user may do dangerous thing he or she doe not intend to do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new instance of Firefox.
2. Open an xterm.
3. Launch "firefox www.google.com" from inside the xterm.

The same, except that Firefox should become the active window.
