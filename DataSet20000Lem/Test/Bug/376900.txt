IFRAMEs in S5 slide show fail to load

I wasn't sure which component to file this under, so I selected General. In fact, I'm not even sure whether this is a bug or a feature. All I know is it's screwing up my presentations.

I'm using an IFRAME element in an S5 slide show. You've probably heard of S5, but just to recap, it's a nifty JavaScript that let you treat an HTML document a a slide show (like a PowerPoint presentation).[1] I love using IFRAME with this, because it let me put a live web page right in one of my slides. When I reach the slide, I can demonstrate exactly what I'm talking about, click links, whatever, and then continue.

Unfortunately, a of FireFox 2.0.0.1 and higher, this technique no longer works. The symptom are really weird. When I get to the slide containing the IFRAME, the page ha not loaded. The screen space is reserved, but it just show the underlying background. I KNOW that the source code for the linked page wa downloaded and rendered: I've got the HTML Validator extension,[2] and it check the source code for the IFRAME a well a the slide show.

The IFRAME work in IE 6 and in Safari. I downloaded multiple version of Firefox, and did some testing using the URL I gave above):

Firefox 1.5.0.11: IFRAME work
Firefox 2.0.0.0: IFRAME work
Firefox 2.0.0.1: IFRAME doe not work
Firefox 2.0.0.2: IFRAME doe not work
Firefox 2.0.0.3: IFRAME doe not work

It took age to do all that testing, since I completely uninstalled Firefox and wiped my profile for each version (thank goodness for sandbox machines).

If I disable JavaScript, then the IFRAME work perfectly in all versions. Unfortunately, disabling JavaScript also destroys it usefulness, because in the absence of JavaScript the file is not a slide show. It's just a rather boring-looking HTML page.

Furthermore, there's some really weird behavior regarding which slide the IFRAME is in. Sometimes, if it's in a slide which is even partially visible on the screen during the initial loading sequence, before the JavaScript runs, then the IFRAME load fine, and it content remain visible. Other times, the IFRAME will load, but then when I get to the slide with the IFRAME, it content are gone. This sometimes-there-sometimes-not behavior is really bizarre. I haven't been able to pin down what's causing it exactly; I can tell you that the time it worked properly (when the IFRAME wa initially visible) all occurred in 2.0.0.3. You can see a test case with an IFRAME that's close to the top here:

As I said at the beginning, I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a feature.

It might be a bug because it's really weird that the IFRAME would download the source code but not render it, and because it happens so erratically.

It might be a feature because phishers sometimes try to use hidden IFRAMEs in evil ways. Because the S5 script depend on altering the visibility of the slide elements, the IFRAMEs aren't always visible. So Mozilla may be suppressing the output of the IFRAME on the theory that it might have been part of a phishing scheme.

Could someone please tell me whether this is a bug or a feature? If it's a bug, it's really weird, but also obscure. If it's a feature, then it's having some unintended consequences. And either way, I'd like a work-around if anybody can think of one. I have a presentation coming up on Wednesday, and I need my IFRAMEs. Links won't do, because the whole point of the presentation is to demonstrate the use of IFRAME in a slide show!

I could use Internet Exploder, but I think I'd rather slit my wrists. I could use Safari, and that's actually an option since the classroom where I'm presenting is equipped with both Mac and PC. Or, I could sneak in early, remove Firefox 2, replace it with Firefox 1.5, and then swap Firefox 2 back in again after my presentation is over. Assuming that the user account on the presentation PC ha appropriate permission to install/remove software. Egad.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the supplied URL in Firefox 2.0.0.1 or higher
2. Observe that the IFRAME is just a blank box
3. Run in circles, scream and shout
