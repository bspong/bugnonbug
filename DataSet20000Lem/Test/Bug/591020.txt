Let's say there's a Flash application on the web page. You scroll down, and you try to click on a button in the Flash application. It will not register on where you try to click, but instead it will register where you click if the page wa scrolled to the top.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website with Flash (and button to click in Flash)
2. Scroll down (page must be able to scroll down)
3. Try to click a button and it will not aim properly to the button you try to click
Actual Results:
Failure to click on something I want (ex. Flash Button) unless I wa on top of the web page. (must be Flash)

Expected Results:
Be able to click Flash button in Flash application in a web page precisely instead of aiming at somewhere else of a large Flash application.

Ex.
Imagine a Flash-created Box, with a button on the bottom of the Flash Box.
You scroll down and you try to click the button on the near-bottom of the Flash Box.
The click register in the middle of the Flash Box instead of the button on the bottom of the Flash Box.
That is what I mean.
Please fix a it can affect people who use Flash. YouTube is not affected.
The more you have to scroll, the worse it gets, if the button is at the very bottom and you scrolled down quite a bit, you may not be able to click it unless you scroll to the very top.

I can produce a small video if you do not understand what I mean (which I am quite unclear about).
