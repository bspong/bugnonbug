Firebird browser crash if page contains Chinese (maybe other Asian too)
characters.

This is bad news, a quite often Google search result contain such characters.
For example, if, with the current page ranking, you search for 'Chinese English
Dictionary' or even 'Chimp Food'.

NB. I do not have Chinese character support installed (as far a I can tell -
it's not listed on 'add/remove programs' anyway).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page containing Chinese character e.g. 'http://www.ragingdragons.co.uk'.
2. Watch Firebird go down in flames.
3. Think about reverting to IE, then think again.

Actual Results:
The error that result is a follows:

MOZILLAFIREBIRD caused a general protection fault
