When you manage to open a tab, just when a popup dialog come Firefox just hangs. It occured when I wa logging into gmail. Just when I enter the data and send it. Normally a popup come with the question or you want to save the password in the password manager. Just before the popup come and after I hitted enter I opened a new tab with CTRL+T. The new tab wa opened with a grey background. I saw the the layout of the popup, but in the popup I saw only the text of gmail. (I guess it wasn't updated with correct information, so it take the text standing on that page). Then after a couple of second firefox crashed and closed.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
(I think you need to do everything very fast AND the computer need the have a bottleneck (or something) causing the space between the enter and showing the dialog. So it ha happened one time, but I'm sure it I'm right to say everyone can do it. You need to have only a little bit of ?luck?)
Actual Results:
Crash

Expected Results:
show the dialog and open the tab
