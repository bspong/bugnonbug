See comment from number 28 in bug 428843. This cause undesired side effect with an inaccurate message.

Following on from the above patch, Firefox now prompt to save 'tabs' on exit, even when none are open.

Apart from the message being inaccurate because no tab are open, this is an extremely frustrating annoyance.

When no tab are open, there should be no prompt. In the rare event that the user accidentally close the browser, they can always go to the most recent one in their history when they start.

As thing now stand, the user would either have to
1.) Put up with the prompt each and every time they close the browser.
2.) Disable the prompt and never get prompted, even if they have multiple tab open.
3.) disable the prompt but have the session restored every time, thus bypassing their homepage.

I feel the patch for 428843 should therefore be backed out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure preference browser.tabs.warnOnClose = true
2. Open the browser.
3. Close the browser
Actual Results:
You get an erroneous (and unnecessary) prompt.

Expected Results:
The browser should close without prompting.
