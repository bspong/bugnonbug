Using Gmail to compose a message, when you type some Chinese character in text box, if you use space to separate some, the cursor will be displayed across the last character. If only one space exists, the effect is not so obvious; but if there are five, the cursor will stay at the left side of the last Chinese char, just like you using <LEFT> to move the cursor. Please see attachment 1-5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a gmail to compose a message
2.type some chinese character
3.then type a space
4.type some chinese character again
5. repeat 3 and 4 again and again

Actual Results:
the cursor will stay at wrong place

Expected Results:
the cursor will stay at the end of the line

I think this may be caused by cs renderer.

Because in common textbox, this problem doe not exist.

And a the attachment 6 and 7 show, the link with cs may be rendered incorrectly, but without cs is correct.
