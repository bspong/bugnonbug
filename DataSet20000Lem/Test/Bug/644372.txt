K-Meleon take over all of my Firefox URL desktop shortcut
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I installed K-Meleon to check itout. It took over all of the Firefox desktop URL shortcuts. I uninstalled K-Meleon and every time I used a Firefox URL shortcut from my desktop it asked me to choose a program. I selected Firefox and choose to "always use this program for this type of file," but it kept asking me for the program I wanted to use. I reinstalled K-Meleon and I no longer am asked which program I want to open the URL shortcuts, but they all open with K-Meleon. I installed Firefox 4 and recreated my desktop URL shortcuts. I made sure that Firefox wa designated a my default browser. When I clicked on my newly created desktop URL shortcut -- just created with Firefox, the open with K-Meleon. How do I get all my Firefox-created desktop URL shortcut to be permnently re-associated with Firefox? HELP! Thanks.

Shortcuts were deleted and newly recreated with Firefox.
