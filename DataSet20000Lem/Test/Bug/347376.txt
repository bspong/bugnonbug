Certificate check dialog on command-line invocation take wrong or at least inconvenient browser window a parent

The 'inconvienience'-part is probably only applies on desktop system sporting virtual desktop to switch in between. Most notably Linux. Different system may be affected differently. I'm not currently using anything else for most of my time.

Consider two virtual desktop D1, and D2.
Consider running Firefox in D1 and some arbitrary other program, here a mail user agent, on D2.

We're currently watching D2.

Program on D2 expose a URL to click on. Let's mentally do so. Program call firefox binary to open the link.

Consider the link to be https://.., pointing at a TLS-secured site. Furthermore, consider the certificate consistency check to fail, resulting in an additonal, although entirely justified, dialog window to pop up, requesting the user to examine the situation and how to proceed in that matter.

The problem is that it appears to prefer popping up in D1, where your open browser window are situated. Not on D2, where yourself remains to spend quite a number of potential minute to wait for something acknowledging that URL-click activity to happen.

I'd suggest that the TLS support where the dialog window originates is suffering from some misconceptions.

By the way, I'm using a fairly standard GNOME desktop on a recent and frequently-upgraded Ubuntu Linux system, i.e. Metacity a window manager in case someone suspect this to make a difference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Run Linux/X11 with virtual desktops.

1. start firefox on you 'www'-desktop. don'
2. start something calling firefox (e.g. gnome evolution) on your 'email'-desktop. stay there.
3. open some mail containing a https://-link provoking a certificate check dialog
4. click it
5. wait until the cow come home for something to happen
6. switch back to you 'www'-desktop
7. discover the above dialog window you've been missing.
Actual Results:
dialog window doe not occur on the current desktop, but associate with a fairly unrelated browser window on a totally different desktop.

Expected Results:
dialog window for external openURL()-requests should not be associated with any existing browser window, but should appear right where you've been.
