AJAX response (async) block input
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

(see example page). While entering a text in a textbox, I use javascript to make an AJAX call that validates the input, and then return a status to a <div> on the fly. This work in all major browsers, and used to work fine in Firefox until version 3.5 (no extensions, default theme). Now, while the dynamic content is returned from the AJAX call and put into place using innerHTML, any keyboard input seems to be blocked.

Tried with XML and JSON response, textarea and input fields, the problem persists.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open example page http://www.remix64.com/stuff/ff_ajax_bug.php
2. Enter text, vary typing speed.
3. Keep typing while the ajax call is fired. Keys typed during the process are not entered into the textarea.
Actual Results:
The text miss characters.

Expected Results:
The AJAX call should not be noticeable by the user, the text should appear a the user type it.

I rate this "Major", because several textboxes have become unusable after a 3.5 update, and we have to tell customer to use another browser in the meantime.
