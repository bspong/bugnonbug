When I print this page with control P to a Kyocera Mita FS-1920 KX, the
print dialogue closes, the printer spooler report the print job is spooling
and firefox becomes unresponsive. No menu items, bookmark or tab selection will navigate to another page. The current page will scroll. Actions take a long time.

The print job doe not progress from "spooling - printing" state.

The browser window can be closed but firefox continues running not consuming CPU and ha to be killed through task manager before restarting.
