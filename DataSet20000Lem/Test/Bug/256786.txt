The URL above had a problem when a long link wa added (scroll down to Photo,
Review, and Purchase links) but I changed it to a small link. This is a
self-serve site, so if you add a movie that ha a long link, say for Review:

<div style="font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;overflow:hidden"><nobr>
<b>Review:</b> <a
href="http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/2004/06/062401.html"
target="_blank">http://www.suntimes.com/ebert/ebert_reviews/2004/06/062401.html</a>
</nobr></div>

Suppose this is changed to a longer link, like:

http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie?id=6184937&pageid=rs.ReviewsMovieArchive&pageregion=mainRegion&afl=imdb&rnd=1093073732040&has-player=unknown

Then I can't find a way to click on the link without everything on that line
shifting left. A casual user will probably not know how to get it back to
normal. It doe not go back to normal by pressing the browser "refresh" button.
I have to press control-F (Find) Review and that brings it back.

My bos ha an earlier version of Mozilla, and the overflow:hidden tag work
le on his, causing the whole table to be wider and add a horizontal scroll bar
due to the long link.

This work ok on IE 6. The link can break on line at "." or "/" in the URL, so
the link wraps.

There is something about this on www.experts-exchange.com called the "Long Link"
problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a long link that is enclosed in a div tag with attribute
style="overflow:hidden".
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The area in the div tag, in this case the line with the long link on it (and all
other text on that line which in this case precedes the link) shift to the left,
and disappear. The only way I know of to get it back is to search for the
preceding text with control-F. Clicking the browser "Refresh" button doesn't
get it back. Even if it did, I don't think the line or area in the div tag
should shift left.

Expected Results:
The area inside the div tag should stay in place and look the same a before you
clicked the link.
