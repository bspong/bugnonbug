In Linux (X Windows), you can copy text by selecting text with the mouse. Paste can be done by using middle click.

Say, I have a URL in the location bar, which I want to manually modify to something slightly different.

* The Location bar ha http://specials.rediff.com/cricket/2007/dec/27sld1.htm
* I want to modify it to http://specials.rediff.com/cricket/a/b/c by copy-pasting a/b/c from some other application.
* I delete the content in the location bar to make it http://specials.rediff.com/cricket/ - so that I can copy-paste the remaining stuff.
* Now, I go to another app and copy the content a/b/c
* When I click on firefox again, the location bar content are selected (orange background - in Ubuntu).
* This mean that the content of the location bar have been copied into the buffer.
* Now when I middle click at the end of the location bar, instead of pasting a/b/c, the previous content of the location bar are pasted.

* The location bar now show - httphttp://specials.rediff.com/cricket/://specials.rediff.com/cricket/

Another minor annoyance is, when you delete character from the end of the URL - say I have already gone to http://a.com/b/c/d
- Now I need to edit the URL to http://a.com/b/
- when you select "c/d" and hit "Delete", the remaining part of the URL get selected (and copied into the X copy-paste buffer). i.e http://a.com/b/ is copied.
- Any previous selected (copied) text is lost.
- On hitting middle click to paste, this remaining URL is pasted into the app.
