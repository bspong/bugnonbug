After installation of 3.0.15, Access of RSS feed with no information doe not work
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Zero Index Problem

When you access an RSS feed that ha no information (links), you get prompted for bookmarking the RSS link. It then store the link incorrectly so that when you go to access the link, it asks you to bookmark the link and you go round and round. All other RSS link work. It is only in the case where you go to a link that is a dead end link (zero index) that you see this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Happens on a classified area, so can't give you one you could use.
2. Find a RSS feed that ha nothing at the other end (links or information).
Actual Results:
The I.E. browser handle the exception without error and display an empty page with a header that say there is nothing there.

Expected Results:
Expect to see what the IE browser doe with a dead end link/RSS feed.

Remember, this only happens is a unique case of a RSS feed that go virtually nowhere and doe nothing. All other normal situation of RSS feed work fine in bookmarking and navigating the RSS path.

The exception handling need to be tightened up. This worked fine in 3.0.13.
