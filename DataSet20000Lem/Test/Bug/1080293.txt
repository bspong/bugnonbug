Steps to reproduce:

I have a website in Intranet which us iframes. All page inside iframes use jquery 1.11.1.


Actual results:

When page is loaded from the parent, I'm having console error such a "ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined" or "ReferenceError: $ is not defined". This is an intermittent issue and would seem to be related to the cacheing mechanism. (Succeeding page load produce error in any or all of the iframe sources). Loading the actual page inside the iframes doe not exhibit the errors. This result in Bootstrap framework, Datatables and other javascript plugins not working properly. I even tried using head.js to load jquery first but got "ReferenceError: head is not defined" instead.


Expected results:

There wa no problem loading the page (iframes) in FF31 and below. Now in FF32, When I disable cacheing (Never remember history) or "Disable Cache *" under Developer Tools, the page (with iframes) load without any problem.

Using Windows 7 SP1 64-bit.
