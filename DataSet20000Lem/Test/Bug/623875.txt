Running a dual screen setup with a Nvidia Quadro NVS 295. On one of the screen firefox will cause individual pxels, or line of pixel to flicker red, green etc. Some of the line will be upto 3" long on a 21" screen. Only happens on some page and the pixel vary from page to page. The same pixel will flicker (relative to the firefox window, not absolute on the screen) consistantly.

This only affect one screen, if I drag the window to the other screen it is displayed normally. If I drag it back again the same pixel will flicker. I can change tab to one that works, and if I change back to an affected tab the same pixel will flicker.

I suspect that this is linked to the QUadro NVS 295 a I have only seen this on two machine which happen to use this card. Updated driver to the latest version
