Session restore doesn't update correctly for load error page
STR:

0. Clean profile, current nightly.
1. Open http://www.dfsgsdgfsdvnserugfisdbxiawhguaghsdvnagh.com/ or some other page that doesn't resolve. (smashing your keyboard for a few second tends to work well, assuming sufficient entropy :-) )
2. Wait until you get your regular Firefox error page telling you "Server not found"
3. In the URL bar, infix the URL with e.g. www.mozilla.org (after the protocol, before the www.dfsgs....) and hit enter.
4. Wait until you see the beautiful Mozilla 404 page.
5. Close the browser
6. Reopen the browser
7. Click "restore previous session"

ER:
The beautiful Mozilla 404 page

AR:
the sadmaking error page


This also break on page that don't 404, like say, infixing "www.google.com/search?q=" between protocol and the garbage domain, so it's not specific to the next page being a 'pretty' 404 - note also that the mozilla domain actually insert a language code redirect into the typed URL, making it doubly weird that session restore doesn't pick up on the change...


I don't know if this is an issue with docshell / error page / session history listener generally, or session restore specifically, but filing in session restore for now a that's what it affects.
