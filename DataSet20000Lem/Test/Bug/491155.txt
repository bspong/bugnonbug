I have a table with style "border-collapse: collapse". For this table I have two different TR classes.
class A: slim bordered, gray backgrounded
class B: strong bordered, red backgrounded

When I load a html document in which one specific TR ha the strong-bordering class and the other one are slim-bordered then everything is fine. If I want to give the strong-bordering class to an other TR by javascript then this TR get the red background but will not get strong border.

Actually, now I have two TRs with the same cs rule but they look different.

If I hard-code the strong-border className to both of the TRs before loading the html, then everything is fine, i.e. both of them are red and strong-bordered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load the html file (attached soon), see the one specific row with red background and strong border
2. click the link
Actual Results:
Two row of the table have red background but only the original row ha strong border, the latter one ha not.

Expected Results:
I think if I attach a className dynamically then it should look the same a when I load it from statical html document. That is, I think both row should have strong border.

In Opera it work the same a in Firefox. (Suspicious...)
In MSIE7 it work a I expected (Even more suspicious... Maybe I am wrong?:))

If the table is not border-collapsed then everything work fine: by clicking the link both row will become strong-bordered.
