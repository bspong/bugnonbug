Hi,

obviously, when trying to load a CACert signed site, a for example https://svn.kvirc.de given above, but not limited to this site only, Firefox/Minefield will do nothing but show a blank site, name the Tab "(Untitled)" and remove the URL from the input bar.

I am aware that Firefox doe not come with the CACert Root CA included in Mac OS X, for whatever reason, so I installed accordingly to the instruction on cacert.org.

I have tried both with my normal profile and with a clean profile, just in case I messed up something on my own. Not the case - both profile (with the CACert Root CA included) won't load it.

I *know* there is bug ID #542449, but this seems not to be a duplicate, because there is no possibility to reload or actually enter this site, so a new/other issue.

Tested with both Stock Firefox 3.6 and Minefield (as soon above.)

This problem is not related to ALL HTTPS page though, obviously only to some of them, more over, I guess only to CACert signed pages, though I am not sure.

I can, for instance, enter a bug report on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org or enter https://banking.spk-uckermark.de (just an Online Banking interface, for the sake of it of course encrypted.)

So any idea on this?

It drive me kinda nuts, I've got to start up Safari every time I want to open https://svn.kvirc.de.

Oh - another interesting side node: opening https://cacert.org work fine and I see a "signed by: Root CA" message, so I'm kinda lost on this...

Best regards,


Mihai

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install CACert Root CA cert if not already done so (http://wiki.cacert.org/BrowserClients)
2. Go to https://svn.kvirc.de
3. Stare at the blank page for a few minute and close it.
Actual Results:
Seeing a blank page.

Expected Results:
Actually, not a blank page but a real web page.
