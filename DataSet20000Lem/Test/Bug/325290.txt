The example ha 4 small page that demonstrates the problem. The first page call the second one that ha a link to display the third page in iframe.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The example ha 4 small page that demonstrates the problem. The first page call the second one that ha a link to display the third page in iframe. When the third page submits to the forth page, it display a close link. After closing IFRAME, the history.go(-1) or back button becomes locked, and only a direct history.go(-2) works.


Expected Results:
The expected behaviour would be to
1. remove from the history the "Iframe" where it's closed OR
2. let the history,at least, work back. There are few user that know that the back button ha access to the history.

I Think this is a major bug. Everyday we have to use/develop new Ajax application and this kind of problem could not be tolerated.
Also it work on IE...
