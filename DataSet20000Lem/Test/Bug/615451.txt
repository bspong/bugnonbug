RE: www.Emsisoft.com, www.MusicLandCentral.com
When I add an item to my cart and go to checkout, many time an extra item get stuck and I CAN'T get rid of it no matter what I do!! I have to use IE8 or even IE7. I wrote a flipant letter to Emsisoft after they gave me a significant discount, no I feel like a complete JackAss -- I'll have to apologize and tell them I'm now using IE8 most of the time. Why bother with FireFox? It crashed very often, anyway.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to site to purchase something
2. add item, proceed to checkout
3. Try to checkout but get extra item and in NO WAY can I get by it except to use IE.
(where do I stick my screen-image capture attachment?)
Actual Results:
1. go to site to purchase something
2. add item, proceed to checkout
3. Try to checkout but get extra item and in NO WAY can I get by it except to use IE. (where do I stick my screen-image capture attachment?)

Expected Results:
quit. Use IE.

Checkout with only the item I want to purchase.
