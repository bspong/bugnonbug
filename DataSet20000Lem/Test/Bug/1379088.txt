Memory regression on 55 involving Private Tab addon
In the past couple of day I've seen two notable report of memory leaking and poor performance due to the Private Tab addon.

I tested on fresh profile in 55 and 54.
I simply opened this page and let it sit:

The memory begin to climb on both of them, but on 55 it is substantially more. It seems there is a leak associated with the addon, however this could indicate a change that will lead to greater memory usage in some situation in 55+.

The Private Tab addon last saw an update in May:

One reporter wa on reddit, here is their post

They indicated they were idling on their [Rakuten] "Viki" watchlist which sound like some sort of video streaming site - but indicated they were not watching videos. They're on 56 Nightly.

The other user wa reported on IRC (Freenode, so there's no log) and wa on 55. Indicated they though it started around b4. They associated it with video playback, however they provided me with the link I shared and I could reproduce without playing the video (though it may have just been buffering the whole time).
