I have used mozilla for most of secure connections, and had set option to clear all when closed window. Mozilla updated the today. And I noticed I had history. Reviewed clear all option and they were reset. So I reset them back to clear all, everything, checked all boxes. Not Working.

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have older version option set to clear all when window closes.
2. Get upgrade install, mozilla restarts....blah...
3. Visit web sites.
4. Close window.
5. Go back in and history is glaring you in face.
6. Review option you set on older version. You will see they were reset.
7. Reset them back to clear everything, and apply or save,
8. Close window.
9. Open window, and you will see all your history.
10. Try and clear history,
11. History won't clear.

Actual Results:
Nothing, nada, zilch.

Expected Results:
clear everything when I say clear everything on closing window.

Got to go to work. Bye
Curtis
