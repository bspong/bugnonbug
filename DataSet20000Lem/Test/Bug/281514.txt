I have developed a web app with JSP utilizing Tomcat. I believe I have come
accross a caching issue.

The main purpose of this site is to ask a series of question to the user.

Servlet A: Selects a question from a Vector contain all of the remaining
question and then forward via the RequestDispatcher to JSP B.
JSP B: Displays the question in a HTML Form with the action of the Form going to
Servlet B.
Servlet B: Verifies the completeness of the response. Writes to the dBase.
Removes the question from the Vector that contains all of the questions. Upon
completion it redirects back to Servlet A via response.redirect(XXX) which tell
the browser to request the site XXX and this is repeated until all of the
question have been answered.

The second time to Servlet A, I get the same question that I had the first time
and everything in Servlet B wa successful. When I refresh, I get the new question.

If I change the response.redirect() to forward via the RequestDispatcher
everything work fine but I don't believe I should have to do this.

This problem doesn't happen when I run Tomcat on my development machine and
browse localy with FireFox. It only happens when I test via another PC on our
intranet.

This problem doesn't happen with IE either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Servlet A: Selects a question from a Vector contain all of the remaining
question and then forward via the RequestDispatcher to JSP B.
JSP B: Displays the question in a HTML Form with the action of the Form going to
Servlet B.
Servlet B: Verifies the completeness of the response. Writes to the dBase.
Removes the question from the Vector that contains all of the questions. Upon
completion it redirects back to Servlet A via response.redirect(XXX) which tell
the browser to request the site XXX and this is repeated until all of the
question have been answered.

The second time to Servlet A, I get the same question that I had the first time
and everything in Servlet B wa successful. When I refresh, I get the new question.

Actual Results:
The second time to Servlet A, I get the same question that I had the first time
and everything in Servlet B wa successful. When I refresh, I get the new question.

Expected Results:
Reloaded Servlet A with would have giving the JSP B the correct data to display.

This problem doesn't happen when I run Tomcat on my development machine and
browse localy with FireFox. It only happens when I test via another PC on our
intranet.
