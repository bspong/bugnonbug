User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140214013806

Steps to reproduce:

Leaving Firefox open for a reasonable period of time (generally over an hour) with multiple tab open (from 5-20+). Issue occurs whether or not Firefox should actively be doing thing and whether or not and whether or not I'm currently in the Firefox window. Multiple window being open seems to make the problem worse.

Happens on ArchLinux with 4GB RAM, i3 CPU. Desktop environment doe not make a difference and running time varies. Limits are configured for PIDs and memory but don't appear to make a difference when within sane limits.


Actual results:

Firefox spawn a massive number of threads, causing the system to grind to a halt. It appears that the issue becomes a problem slowly and if caught fast enough Firefox can be terminated and restarted which fix the problem. If left alone, the system lock up completely and need to be forcibly rebooted.


Expected results:

Firefox should be able to be left up for any reasonable amount of time without spawning enough thread to grind the system to a halt.
