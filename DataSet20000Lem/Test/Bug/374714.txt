After clicking either the "+Add" button or the large "Click or Drag Image Here" picture icon, a new window open up to access my computer's picture folder(s). Dragging and dropping picture (mine are all .jpg) from this window doe not work. A "circle with a slanted diagonal line through it" appears where mouse pointer is. The only time dragging and dropping picture into the Kodak EasyShare Gallery Companion work is when I am dragging the picture from a window I opened up myself by double-clicking the specific picture folder.
