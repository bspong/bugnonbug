Reseting Sync password should not erase previous data
What feature should be changed? Please provide the URL of the feature if possible.
==================================================================================
Currently, previous Sync save are said to be erased upon updating Sync password

What problem would this solve?
===============================
Precious saved data could be retrieved later on, should one be able to recover it at some point.
Currently, I am reluctant to reset my password because I do not want my historical save to be erased, hence I am avoiding the feature altogether.
As a consequence of improving this feature by keeping old data, the feature would be more promoted, a well.

Who would use this?
===================
Everyone using Sync

What would user see?
=====================
After changing their Sync password, user would keep their access to historical saved data, even to download and keep them for their record for later rescue.


What would user do? What would happen a a result?
===================================================
Users would be able to update their Sync password without the fear of losing old data.
Old data would be accessible after password reset, without any other further dependencies.


Is there anything else we should know?
======================================
