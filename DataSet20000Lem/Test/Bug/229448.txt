Many web site give news and are updated frequently, such a newspaper site and
site such a MozillaZine. The user always want to see the most recent version.
The bookmark should incorporate a field that could be marked that every time
the user selects the bookmark, Mozilla get a non-cached version, that is a
version that is neither locally cached, nor proxy cached.

This compare to a ctrl-shift-R or a ctrl-F5 every time the page (bookmark) is
accessed.

It could be achieved by adding an option to the Schedule tab of the bookmark to
"Check for update <<every time>>" for instance. However, it is not clear if and
how the Schedule feature can be used to obtain this behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark MozillaZine web site.
2. Choose MozillaZine from bookmark.
Actual Results:
A locally cached or proxy cached version of the web page is shown.

Expected Results:
The non-cached version of the web page should be shown, a indicated by the user
in a to-be-added option in the bookmark properties.
