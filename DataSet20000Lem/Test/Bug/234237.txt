Download of this page cause firefox to hang indefinitely
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

The download starts, nothing happens, and then the spinning icon stops. From
then on, no downloads work at all. The menu on link doesn't appear. Things
like window resize and switching tab work ok. But no new page can be downloaded.

The browser also ignores command to exit. It can only be killed with "kill -9".

This seems to happen with random pages. Several page at slashdot have
triggered the bug, though most work.





Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the URL into a tab.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The tab blank out, the spinning icon spin for a while but no text appears in
the tab. Then the icon stop spinning. The browser is now unable to fetch any
web pages, in that or any other tab.

Expected Results:
Display the web page, of course.

This wa the first thing I tried after installing firefox 0.8. The reason for
this is that this page had just hung firebird 0.7, and I wa curious a to
whether it had been fixed in firefox. So I started firefox, went to the same
slashdot pages, and it hung in the same way a firebird.

Note that the browser can only be killed with "kill -9" (or "Force Quit" on the
Mac).
