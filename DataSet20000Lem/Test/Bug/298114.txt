The start menu shortcut created by the Firefox installer have a trailing
double-quote, whereas Windows system generally want either both leading and
trailing double-quotes (not required in newer versions), or none at all.
However, the link function fine and this is merely a question of aesthetics. :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Start, hover mouse over Programs, hover over 'Mozilla Firefox'.
2. Right-click on 'Mozilla Firefox' shortcut, and then click Properties.
Actual Results:
On the 'Shortcut' tab, in the 'Target' field, the content have a trailing
double-quote.

Example (on my system, have changed setup directory from c:\program
files\mozilla firefox\ to c:\program files\mozilla firefox 1.0.4\ due to
previous installation):

C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4\firefox.exe"

Expected Results:
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox 1.0.4\firefox.exe

Not even slightly important, but nice to have fixed.
