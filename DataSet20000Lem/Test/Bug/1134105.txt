User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0
Build ID: 20150122214805

Steps to reproduce:

Reproduce the bug a follows:

1. Install 32-bit version of Firefox on a 64-bit Linux platform locally relative to your $HOME directory, not installed by package installers (e.g., not yum, apt, etc.).
3. Create a new profile called "newprofile".
4. Invoke firefox -no-remote -P "newprofile"
5. See the prompt for default browser.
6. Put a checkbox beside Don't ask me again.
7. Click on Use Firefox a my default browser.
8. Exit Firefox.
9. Invoke firefox again with firefox -no-remote -P "newprofile"
10. See the dialog box show up again.

The workaround I found was:

1. Create a new profile called "newprofile".
2. Invoke firefox -no-remote -P "newprofile"
3. See the prompt for default browser
4. Put a checkbox beside Don't ask me again.
5. Click on Use Firefox a my default browser.
6. Go into about:config
7. Change the browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser configuration option from true to false.
8. Exit Firefox.
9. Invoke firefox again with firefox -no-remote -P "newprofile"
10. See that the dialog box is not shown a expected.
