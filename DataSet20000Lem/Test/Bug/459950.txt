Polish about:sessionrestore
Here are a few polish change to the about:sessionrestore page:

1) Use native checkbox widget in the restore column (might need to file a separate widget bug to get this working).

2) Instead of using a folder icon for each window, use a generic window icon, which you might need to copy over to toolkit

I'll need to get you window icon for OS X and Linux (basically take the Tango new window icon and remove the star)

3) Update the text of the window

Since there is a large question icon, the title should ask a question

Would You Like to Restore Your Session?

------------------------------------
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. You can restore the tab and window from your previous session, or start a new session if they are no longer needed.
------------------------------------
If Minefield close repeatedly:
* Try disabling any recently added extension in the Add-ons Manager.
* Try restoring your session without any Web page you suspect might be causing the problem.

4) remove the line "uncheck the tab that you don't want to restore" this should be apparent from the interface.
