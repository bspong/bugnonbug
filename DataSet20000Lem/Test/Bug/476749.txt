the 3ed column identified in cs a #column_3 ha a set cs height of 2667px when it should be 2825px or vice-versa
I'm not going to count nearly 3000 individual pixels.
number are proximate
bottom line the height on column_3 is not always interpreted the same it could also be the 1st column not matching the third
regardless the same number should always add up to be the same every time
sorry if that is a little difficult to understand i wa getting tong tied when you reproduce it you will see what i mean

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load the page a few time
2. scroll to be bottom
3. it should be about the height on the column on the left without getting cut off
Actual Results:
height of object varies by over 200px

Expected Results:
height of object should stay the same each time

i wa able to reproduce this with no addons via Firefox portable on my desktop so it is not addon related
it happens more often than it doe not happen
