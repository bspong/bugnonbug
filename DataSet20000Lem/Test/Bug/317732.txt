install current version of HTML Validator extension, enable validate in browser.
install http://downloads.mozdev.org/tamperdata/tamper_data-0.87.beta-fx.xpi

Tools->tamperdata
Browser will hang inside HTML Validator upon navigation.

Tamperdata is QI'ing the nsIHttpChannel to a Caching Channel, and retrieving the
cache token, then discarding it, inside an observer service call back. n.b. accessing the token doesn't seem to be a factor, merely doing the QI seems to
be sufficient.

HTML validator is creating a caching channel inside an onload event. The
browser hang when the caching channel is opened.

I believe there is a problem/delay with the way javascript is cleaning up the reference to the caching channel created by tamperdata, a inserting alert's,
or stepping through the HTML Validator using the javascript debugger seems to
make the problem disappear. Though the channel open should throw an exception
rather than deadlock.

Problem seen on Win 98, and Win 2000, using either 1.5RC3 or 1.07.

Also, in general, reading from the cache while the page is still loading seems
to cause deadlock a well, though I don't have a reproducable test case.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details, running above extension consistently reproduces the problem, though a it seems like a deadlock, it may be affected timing sensative.
Actual Results:
Browser hang

Expected Results:
Should not hang...
