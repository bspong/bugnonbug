The file "/tmp/.pip_p12tmp" is created when clicking "ok" after entering the pass-phrase when you import a SSL-Certificate (pkcs12).
If the passphrase wa wrong the file remains in place.
It is only removed when the correct passphrase is entered.
If the user just exit firefox or simply doesn't try it again (sucessfully) the file remains.
On multi-user system this file prevents other user from importing certificate since the file belongs to the user and ha permission set to -rw-------

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. import a SSL-Certificate (pkcs12) and enter wrong passphrase, then click "ok"
2. the file /tmp/.pip_p12tmp exists and belongs to the user that tried to import
the certificate
3. try, a a second user to import a SSL-Certificate.
Actual Results:
The second user won't be able to import a Certificate. The Error Message hint to a corrupted certificate-file or a wrong passphrase, which in this case is both is missleading.

Expected Results:
The file "/tmp/.pip_p12tmp" should have a "unique" name.
And/Or it should have been deleted right after checking if the passphrase wa right or wrong.


This wa also observed with different Versions of Firefox and Mozilla on Solaris 9 and Solaris 10.
