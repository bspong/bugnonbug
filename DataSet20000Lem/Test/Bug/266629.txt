Cannot upload file with ~ a first letter in file name
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041007 Firefox/0.10.1

On some webpage, I tried to upload a file called "~Firefox_Port_23.png" (without
the "). See the screenshot at
http://alexander.skwar.name/details.php?image_id=881 for this.
After I clicked on Ok in the file selector dialog, I'm getting an error message
that you can see in the screenshot at
http://alexander.skwar.name/details.php?image_id=882. The error message says:

File /u/vz6tmlFirefox_Port_23.png doesn't exist


Here, vz6tml is my username and /u/vz6tml is my $HOME. The image file is located
at "/u/vz6tml/Eigene_Dateien/Bilder/Screenshots", so the complete path would be
"/u/vz6tml/Eigene_Dateien/Bilder/Screenshots/~Firefox_Port_23.png".


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. cd $HOME
2. touch \~foo
3. Go to some web page which allows to upload a file and try to select this file

Actual Results:
Error message a seen on screenshot at
http://alexander.skwar.name/details.php?image_id=882

Expected Results:
No error message and file get uploaded just fine.

This bug only happens on Linux, a far a I can see - or rather, it doesn't
happen on Windows. It happens with both Firefox and Thunderbird. I assume (but
don't know), that it also happens with Seamonkey.

I think, that bug is somewhat related to bug 239192.

With Firefox, I saw that error message with: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686;
rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041007 Firefox/0.10.1. Build ha been done on Gentoo Linux.

With Thunderbird, I'm seeing the error message with:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041007
Thunderbird/0.8 Mnenhy/0.6.0.104
