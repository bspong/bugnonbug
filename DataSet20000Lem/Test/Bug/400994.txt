If I drag any image file from the the Mac desktop or folder and drop it into the Firefox browser window, the window doe not repaint to display the image. The browser's address bar DOES update with the local "file:///" path, and the tab is correctly labeled with the image's file name. Also the window's title displayed in the window border is updated with the image name and size info. The browser window it seems is never told to refresh or repaint. Clicking the "reload" button after the drag and drop cause the image to be correctly displayed. This ha happened through many version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Display any normal web page
2. Drag a GIF, JPEG, or PNG file from a finder window and drop on Firefox window.
3. Observe that location window and tab update, but image doesn't display until you click "Reload/refresh"
Actual Results:
Image not displayed, but Firefox "thinks" it is there. Shows if you click refresh.

Expected Results:
Image should display.
