Firefox fails to load local HTML page from standalone flash projector or swf file using getURL or similar

Flash attempt to launch an HTML file using the system's default browser
(Firefox) but Firefox doe a Google search basd on the root of the file's path
instead.

Within Flash, the "getURL()" Flash ActionScript command can be used to launch a
Web page using the computer's default browser. A flash project can be saved a a
standalone executable (a Projector) that can play the movie outside of a Web
browser. If the Flash Projector is being run from the same source a the file
you want to launch, you can use a relative path in the getURL() command to
launch a file (e.g., test.htm can be launched with getURL("test.htm","_blank")
if test.htm and the projector are in the same directory). Using this technique
start Firefox but instead of loading test.htm, part of the file's absolute path
is passed to Firefox and a Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" search is performed. Using
an absolute path with the getURL() command bypass the problem. (See the
"Actual Results" section.) Using Flash's text control to assign a hyperlink to
a text object ha the same result a using getURL() on a button.

This problem doe not apply to Flash movie that are playing in the Web browser,
only to flash movie being played outside the browser (i.e., throught a
projector executable). The problem happens in both Windows 2000 and Windows XP
with Firefox. It doe not happen (that is, it correctly launch the local page)
with IE and with the Mozilla Suite.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Flash movie and use the getURL() command to launch a local HTML
file. For example, getURL("test.htm","_blank");
2. Save the Flash movie a a Windows Projector.
3. Put the Flash Projector file in the same directory a the HTML file to be
launched (test.htm). Putting these file in a directory deeper than the root
directory will allow you to see the "I'm Feeling Lucky" Google search behavior.
4. Click on the link or button to launch the local HTML file.

Actual Results:
Firefox start up (assuming that it is the default browser), but instead of
launching test.htm, it open two tabs. The first tab is blank. The second tab
load a page based on a Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" search of the root directory
(but after the drive letter) where the local file is located. For example, if
the test.htm is on your desktop (C:\Documents and
Settings\Username\Desktop\test.htm), the the second tab contains the result of
the Google "I'm Feeling Lucky" search for "Documents and Settings."

Expected Results:
test.htm sould have been launched in Firefox.

Files are launched correctly in Mozilla Suite and Internet Explorer (Windows XP
and 2000).

Files are launched incorrectly in Firefox .8, .9, .9.1 (Windows XP and 2000).

This problem break the functionality of many Flash Projector-based multimedia CDs.
