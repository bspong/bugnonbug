When typing an web address in the address bar located on the Windows XP taskbar,
the default browser launch and display the website. After setting Firefox a
my default browser, my previous default browser (MyIE2 - www.myie2.com) still
launches. I have tried uninstalling MyIE2 and then reassigning Firefox a the
default, but Firefox only report that it is "already the default." And after
uninstalling MyIE2, the address bar on the Winxp taskbar simply doe nothing
when given a web address.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox. Set a default browser.
2. Activate the address toolbar on the Windows XP taskbar.
3. Type a web address into the address toolbar and press enter. The previous
default browser will launch.



Expected Results:
Firefox should launch when it is the default browser and a web address is
entered into the address toolbar on the Windows XP taskbar.

I am using Windows XP Professional (SP1).

I have installed and uninstalled MyIE2, also known a Maxthon. More
