New tab doe not open Chrome’s "New Tab" Page anymore, but throw error.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:17.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/17.0
Build ID: 20121128204232

Steps to reproduce:

Whenever I open a new tab at this Compter (Win7 Starter) this bub appears. To exclude problem with Pug-Ins, I started with disabled Plug-Ins, but the Error doe not disappear.


Actual results:

A white new Tab opens.
The Error console first throw the message:
No chrome package registered for chrome://unitedtb/content/newtab/newtab-page.xhtml
Then it throw the Error:
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIWebNavigation.loadURI]" nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml :: loadURIWithFlags :: line 156" data: no]
Source File: chrome://browser/content/tabbrowser.xml
Line: 1361


Expected results:

A new Tab should open with 9 small frame for the 9 most visited page or page which are "pinned" there. I pinned a few page there some version of Firefox ago.

To my knowledge this New-Tab page is now part of a normal Firefox installation and I can not remember fiddling arround with this functionality. The feature still work at my other computer with Windows 7 Professional. I can not tell why it doe not work (anymore) and have no idea how to fix it.
