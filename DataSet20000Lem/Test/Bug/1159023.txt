Images, Graphics, Become Corrupt upon load and require reload
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0

Steps to reproduce:

This bug seems quite intermittent. I have tried to reproduce it but it seems once a site ha been loaded, or an image, and you do a single refresh the issue vanishes, and usually will not allow you to reproduce it on the same URL.

For me, the bug like to show it head when a Large image or a page with hundred of image try to load the bug occurs.

Going directly to a large JPG seems to cause it to happen the most.

This happens with both E10S enabled and Disabled.

Windows 7 x64
Nightly 40.0a1 (2015-04-27) x64


Actual results:

When a Large image is loaded directly into the browser window, the image will download and show a it is being downloaded but once it get to the end of the load Firefox report that the image is corrupt and can not be displayed.

This also happens on some page where there are ton of images, the image will show the placeholder and they won't be there, but a soon a you refresh all the image are displayed without any issue.


Expected results:

The expected result is the large image should download, and render properly without crashing or becoming 'corrupt'. The smaller image should all display on the page a they load.
