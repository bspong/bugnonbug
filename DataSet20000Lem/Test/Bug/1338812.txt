Call TelemetryStopwatch only once per item (history / bookmark / logins) rather than for each resource
Gijs say it shouldn't be a problem for the data we're looking at, but it's probably still a good idea to clean this up.

<dao> Gijs: what kind of thing are migrationType and itemResources in https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/migration/MigrationUtils.jsm#297 ?
<Gijs> dao: itemResources are object that have a 'migrate()' function that get called to migrate that particular resource
<Gijs> dao: migrationType is the type of resource migration (bookmarks, passwords, etc.)
<Gijs> dao: so for instance, for edge we import 2 resource of type bookmark
<Gijs> (the normal bookmark and the reading list)
<dao> and we use a separate TelemetryStopwatch for both?
<Gijs> dao: there's also an "other data" type that I think we use several of when doing a Firefox reset/refresh
<Gijs> dao: look like it, yes.
<dao> Gijs: is that intentional? seems weird to me
<Gijs> dao: I don't think it wa considered when implementing the stopwatches. Regardless, I don't think it make a big difference here...
<Gijs> dao: there's only 1 item of each resource type for Chrome, so...
<Gijs> ditto for IE, though we have 2 separate way of importing password (depending on the Windows/IE version), I'm fairly sure we only ever use one at a time.
