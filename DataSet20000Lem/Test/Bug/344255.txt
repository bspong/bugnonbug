Bookmarks metadata (created/last accessed date) cannot be removed; privacy issue.

Currently, the bookmark system keep track of when a bookmark is created and when it wa last accessed. This information cannot be removed without manually editing the bookmarks.html file, and there appears to be no way of specifying that this information NOT be saved in the future.

This may potentially be a privacy issue for some people, whom don't realize that their browsing history may also be recorded in the bookmark metadata, in addition to the browser history records.

I propose that we have an option to turn off the saving of this information and an option to purge this data.
