The CSS doesn't load correctly.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.15) Gecko/20080623 Firefox/2.0.0.15
Build Identifier: Firefox 3

Whenever I explore certain site such a Myspace.com or Forums.facepunchstudios.com the CSS doesn't load correctly. Like some of the text start bunching up with other text and usually there will be border around word that wont load, so the word just bunch up in the corner.

The only way that I've found to fix it is to install Firefox 2.0.0.15 but the latest Firefox is the one with the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to one of the mentioned website in the detail
2. Wait for page to load
3. Watch a the page morphs into unreadable garbage
Actual Results:
Most, if not all of the text becomes unreadable garbage. Usually it bunch up in the corner and then the text start overlapping. Also the border and other page element disappear. This problem make Firefox 3 almost impossible to use. I'm guessing it's the CSS render.

Expected Results:
The text load the way it should, in it's own designated area, not overlapping other text, and the border load properly, giving the text a place to stay on the webpage.

The only additional information I can give is my system info:

Operating System: Windows XP SP3
CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo 6700
GPU: GeForce 8600 GTS
ISP: Comcast High Speed (I know they suck)

And that all the other Web Browsers I've used don't have this problem.

Opera 9
Apple Safari
IE 7
Netscape
