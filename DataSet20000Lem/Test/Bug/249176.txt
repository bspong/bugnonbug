User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040113
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

This problem occured in Firefox 0.9; downloaded and installed 0.9.1 with same
result. With Firefox Profile Manager, created two new user profile into a
different drive, different partition (that is, NOT the default C:\Documents and
Settings\<user name>\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles), imported
Mozilla 1.4 profiles, then attempted to delete the default profile at
C:\Documents... Deletion attempt cause Application Error. With or without
attempting to delete default profile, new profile imported but not working.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Firefox 0.9.1 to N:\MOZILLA\Firefox091
2. create default profile, which is written to C:\Documents and Settings\<user
name>\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles
3. exit Firefox
4. START > RUN > N:\MOZILLA\Firefox091\firefox.exe -p
5. Create Profile <profile name1> at N:\MOZILLA\Firefox091\PROFILES\<profile name1>
6. close Profile Manager
7. reboot
8. repeat step 4. through 7. for a different profile <profile name2>
9. Open Profile Manager
10. Delete Profile "default"
11. Application Error
12. Start Firefox from Profile Manager <profile name1>
13. Import Mozilla 1.4 profile for <profile name1>
14. Exit Firefox
15. Start Firefox from Profile Manager <profile name1> but profile data not
executed, default profile active instead
16. Start Firefox from Profile Manager <profile name2>
17. Import Mozilla 1.4 profile for <profile name2>
18. Exit Firefox
19. Start Firefox from Profile Manager <profile name2> but profile data not
executed, default profile active instead
Actual Results:
Several repetition to SKIP Steps 9., 10., and, therefore, 11. Application
Error, and preserve the "default" profile in C:\Documents... only eliminates the
Application Error problem; the imported profile data are not executed on
starting Firefox. Starting Firefox from the Profile Manager, or from START >
PROGRAMS, or Desktop shortcut, after either <profile name1> or <profile name2>
ha been set a the DEFAULT in Profile Manager, result in Firefox starting in
default mode and profile data not executed and bookmarks, cookie permissions,
password not available. The profile data ha been copied to defined directory
and are readable directly: for example, in Windows Explorer, double clicking
bookmarks.html open an HTML rendered page of bookmark for that profile. The
profile.ini file at C:\Documents... also appears fine and point to the proper
directories.


Expected Results:
When starting Firefox from the Profile Manager for <profile name1> the browser
should come up with <profile name1> bookmarks, cookie permissions, passwords, etc.
