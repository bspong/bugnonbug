Well, In the last day I've noticed problem loading image display on orkut. Mozilla Firefox (tested on other browser and had no problem) is having problem in loading the image display the profile of users. I've the version 3.6.2 of Firefox installed on my Windows 7 x86. I've been communicating that is not just me with this problem, user known firefox I also reported this same problem. We were unable to view some image display orkut. Appearing both in the contact list, a in the scrapbook, also list of statements. Sometimes picture are exchanged, some user appear with the image of others. Check it please!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the orkut home page;
2.check the image of your contact in: Contact List, Scrapbook list, and statement list.
3.You see that some image not appear, other is exchanged, with others user's image!
Actual Results:
Some user appear without image. Some user appear with others user image.

Expected Results:
Some algorithm is blocking to load some user image. I don´t now much about the source-code mozilla. But, It need to check, because this occurs after I get the last update (3.6 to 3.6.2)

This bug need a excepcional attention because the number of orkut user linked in mozilla firefox.
