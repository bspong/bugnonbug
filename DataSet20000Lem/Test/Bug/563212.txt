Sometimes FireFox will not startup. I have tried the icon in the lower left Task bar, and I have tried the application in the Program Files (x86). Then I tried to reinstall using FireFox Setup 3.6.3 from my download folder. When I try this last, a Mozilla dialogue box appears telling me: "FireFox must be closed to proceed with the installation. Please close FireFox to continue." FireFox ha been closed, and doe not appear in the Task Manager list. I have a screenprint showing all the dialogue box showing this. I shut my PC off. I restart the PC, then clicked the FireFox icon in the lower left Task Bar, and it opened this time. This is not the first time that this ha happened, but it is the first time I made a screenprint to document the situation. I like FireFox, and have used it daily for the past two years. Accordingly, I have made annual donation to help support your activities. Keep up the good work, and Thanks!

Reproducible: Sometimes



Expected Results:
FireFox should have started by clicking the icon in the Task Bar, or when the application itself is double-clicked.
