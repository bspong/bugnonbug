While trying to import data using the Import Wizard, and not selecting
'Bookmarks' for Netscape/Mozilla and Opera, or Favorites for I.E. disables the
next button. Even on reverting to previous display (using back button) doe not
enable the 'Next' button.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Import Wizard under File menu and select any one of the browser in the
listing.
2.Navigate using the Next button and under "Select which item to import" check
off 'Favorites' for I.E., Bookmarks for Netscape or Mozilla.
3.Now navigate back (using back button).

Actual Results:
On selecting a described above i.e. not selecting 'Favorites' for I.E. and
'Bookmarks' for Mozilla or Netscape, the 'Next' button is disabled.
Not only for this display dialog, but when reverting to the previous display(s),
the 'Next button continues to be disabled and the user cannot navigate further.

Refer Snapshots.

Expected Results:
If selecting the 'Favorites' or 'Bookmarks' is mandatory and not doing so
disables the 'Next' button, then on reverting to previous selection screen, the
'Next' button should be enabled.

Refer Snapshots.

Follow up test
---------------
1. Tried verifying the same behavior with different combination of the option
provided, however only checking of 'Favorites' or 'Bookmarks' cause this behavior.
2. Went ahead and imported the checked item and then re-imported the data from
the same browser(s). *Instead of prompting or updating/appending the existing
bookmarks, a new bookmark directory get created and so we have redundant
bookmark information from the respective browser(s).

Importance of the bug
---------------------
1. It seems that somehow navigation within the Import Wizard is entirely
dependent on what selection the user make from the choice listed. This is
obvious when the user finish selection and want to go ahead and import data.
However if the user wish to revert or change some previous selection
(profile, browser) then the navigation should not be dependent on the choice
selected.
This bug indicates 'feature interrrupting feature' and prevents ease of use
(since one ha to cancel and reopen the wizard everytime the big occurs).
