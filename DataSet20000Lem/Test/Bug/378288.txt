Below attachment cause CPU usage to max out and browser to 'freeze'. Preferences and chrome still work (sorta) but it is impossible to close the tab with this page in it or to rerender the main window any other way. In order to get the error to work with the example your browser must have a width of approximately 1024. Specifically when running at 1024x768 and with the browser stretched out to just fit on the screen the example always produce a crash. It will not crash if the browser width is say half of that but it will work if I halve the browser height.

I've cleaned up the following attachment a much a I could. The long text entry really are needed to produce the error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Resize FireFox till it take up full 1024x768 screen
2.Open the attached html file.
3.Crash (try to navigate away).
Actual Results:
Browser rendering freezes. Have to stop and restart.

Expected Results:
Browser shouldn't freeze.

No theme (FireFox default). Tried disabling suspicious extension (grease monkey, noflash, Google desktop) same result. Didn't try disabling Google toolbar but I don't think this is an extension problem.
