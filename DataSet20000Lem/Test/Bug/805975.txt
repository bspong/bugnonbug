Firefox 16.0.1 loses bookmark a soon a I open 'Show All Bookmarks'
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Build ID: 20121024073032

Steps to reproduce:

1. Have Firefox 16.0.1 running. All bookmark are shown in the bookmark toolbar and on the bookmark menu.
2. Select "Show All Bookmarks" (or press Ctrl-Shift-B).



Actual results:

All bookmark disappear, from the new window, the bookmark toolbar and the bookmark menu. This ha been reproduced many times.


Expected results:

Bookmarks being shown, so that I can backup them.

Additional thing I tried:

a) Restoring backups: The automatic backup system seems to have encountered the same problem, but never reported it! The folder 'bookmarkbackups' contains empty (482 Bytes) file since Oct 15, before that date those file have ~600 KiB.

b) Restoring places.sqlite* from my personal backups: The same thing happens. I first get all my bookmark back after launching Firefox, then they disappear a soon a I open 'Show All Bookmarks'.

c) Restoring them from Firefox Sync: Apparently Sync had the same problem, but didn't report it either (wtf!?), but instead uploaded the broken/empty state. According to 'view quota', my bookmark on Sync are essentially empty.

d) Repairing places.sqlite: I tried the "sqlite3 places.sqlite .dump | sqlite3 places_new.sqlite" trick, but when using this newly created database, Firefox renames it to "sqlite.corrupt" and creates a new one. (Note that it never before called the database corrupt, only *AFTER* I dumped and recreated it. I find that very weird, but I suspect that I recreated it incorrectly.)
