Fonts don't show up a I wrote them - Arial isn't Arial, etc...

I designed a few page with CSS font spec in them. But my browser's setting always override the page's code, even though I have clicked the box that is supposed to let it read page and use that info. I want page to display in the code they were written in, not my defaults, and not viewers' default especially when I've laid out page to look good using specific fonts. I'm not sure why thing are looking the way they are - serif font are coming up a sans serif, etc... and I downloaded a fresh version of Firefox yesterday, thinking maybe I had a corrupted version, but I don't think so. Thanks for being there, and for helping. Overall I love Firefox! :>)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go the the web page, and font are not what they should be.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
When I go to the web pages, the font called for are not the one I see. I can change what I see by changing my Options, but I don't want to have to do that. I clicked the button ON that say it will allow page to use their own fonts, but that isn't working.

Expected Results:
I want it to go back to the way it was, which wa that I could specify font and Firefox wouldn't change them to anything else.

The software should leave font alone. Website designer design them the way they do on purpose. We design something to look right, then these kind of bug mess it all up, causing thing to no longer line up. Thanks very much for looking into this.
