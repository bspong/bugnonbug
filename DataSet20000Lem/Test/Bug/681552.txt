Steps to reproduce:

Start Firefox (Nightly or Aurora).



Actual results:

The Browser (usually) will not open on top.

The Aurora or Nightly 'Add-on Compatability Startup Checker' (which run before the Browser starts) will always run on top, a doe the 'Update Restart Window' and the 'Update Notifier'; only the 'Browser proper' ha this issue.


Expected results:

When you start any Program (except Programs that run in the "Taskbar's Icon Area" (next to the Clock), or other Programs intended to not show a Window upon startup) the Program ought to open "on top" (of any other Window except one's which can force themselves "on top" (Winhlp is one example)).

Firefox will often (nearly always) not open "on top" and sometimes will 'open under' and then jump "on top" and go back under other Windows (like Notepad) while starting.

Once you either click within the Browser's Window (or on the Chrome) or select the Browser by clicking on it (in the Toolbar) then it correctly will go 'on top', minimize or maximize (and work correctly); it is only upon starting that this occurs.

If you right-click the Windows Taskbar and choose "Show the Desktop" before starting Firefox it can even 'open' minimized (that is not correct behavior).

Programs that are opened should open "on top" (in the same location and with the same Window size; which doe work) a when the Program wa closed (and not be a 'pop under Program').
