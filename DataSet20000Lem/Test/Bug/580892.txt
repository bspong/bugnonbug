Checking 'clear history when minefield closes' is not clearing cache on shutdown but on startup

In a new profile, checking the option to 'clear history when minefield closes' in the privacy pref pane, and ensuring 'cache' is selected in settings, it appears the cache is not cleared when minefield exits, but when it start up again.

Note history, cooky etc do get cleared on shutdown.

This would have privacy implication allowing someone's cache to be viewed after they existed minefield and walked away.

They mention bug 579334 and bug 580374 but I am not technical enough to really know what those bug are talking about.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. New profile, Firefox button, Options, Privacy, check 'clear history when minefield closes'. Check setting button to ensure 'cache' is selected (default)
2. Open your OS file manager & go to the cache location (On XP %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\<PROFILENAME>\Cache). Verify the cache file present.
3.Browse to some sites, e.g. google, images, map to generate some cache content.
4. Refresh your OS file manager and note the newly created cache files.
5. Close minefield. Verify the process ha exited in task manager.
6. Cache file are still present in the OS file manager.
7. Restart minefield and a it open watch the OS file manager, the cache file disappear!
Actual Results:
Cache is cleared on startup.

Expected Results:
Cache is cleared on shutdown.
