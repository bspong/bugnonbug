Flash-disabled warning-bar should attract le attention
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to a website which us invisible Flash content (i.e. a github repository)
2. A warning bar come on the top of the window (this only happens now a there is a known Flash security issue and Firefox block the newest version)



Actual results:

My attention go to this bar whereas I don't directly miss functionality on the page.

On page which have visible content (like videos) the bar on the top remains absent a the video already display this warning well enough.


Expected results:

The bar should attract le attention, because:

- It is often small functionality, which is not directly missed.
- The website should handle the feedback to the user in case they use invisible flash which doesn't load.
- Because the bar come every time again, I almost get the urge to enable it to get rid of it. (At least on page I trust, even though I don't know if the security issue is based on such trust.)

I think it would be better to have the bar at the bottom, in light grey. A like the bar you get when starting Firefox for the first time asking consent with data sharing.
Or maybe even just the red icon in the address bar is enough.
