SCRIPT tag outside of HTML tag section loaded only on refresh

The URL specified ha a <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> section that resides above the opening
<HTML> tag (something which I suspect is invalid). However, the problem arises
that when that URL is entered into the Address bar, that <SCRIPT> section
doesn't appear - but if you then refresh the page, it show up (and thus the
JavaScript popup is displayed, assuming that www.e-rewards.com is in your
Allowed list, or you have popup blocking disabled).

I suspect that the site is in error - but Firefox's behaviour should be
consistent, yes?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Paste http://www.e-rewards.com/pro2/7313/pbt_content.asp into the Address
bar, and hit return.
2. View the source code.
3. The <HTML> tag will be the first thing displayed.
4. Close the "view source" window and refresh the browser.
5. View the source code.
6. There will now be a <SCRIPT></SCRIPT> section before the <HTML> tag.



Expected Results:
Page source should be the same regardless of how the page wa loaded.
