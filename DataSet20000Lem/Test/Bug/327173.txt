User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/312.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/312.5

Any website that display Google ad crash Firefox. Other site to use for troubleshooting that caused my crash are:
http://www.google.com/adsense
http://dogbreederlocator.com/
http://contractmanufacturingusa.com/
http://www.electrobase.com/

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Type URL in address box (http://www.insightlargeprint.com).
3. Press 'enter' or 'return' key.

Actual Results:
1. Page begin to load.
2. Halfway through loading Firefox freezes.
3. Firefox window disappears.
4. Dialog box appears reading:
"The application firefox-bin ha unexpectedly quit.
The system and other application have not been affected.
Would you like to submit a bug report to Apple?"

Expected Results:
Loaded the website and not crashed.

I don't know whether it is in fact due to Google ads, but every page that ha Google ad is causing Firefox to crash, including page from google.com itself (ie: http://www.google.com/adsense).
