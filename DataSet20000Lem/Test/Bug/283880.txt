When surfing inside of frame firefox is inconsitant with the handling of the
back button. When I go to a new page inside of the frame then click the back
button, the frame stay in the same location, but I am shifted to the previous
page. The main thing that make this error so bizzare, is that it doe not hold
true for all pages.

I posted this a reproducable because it is consistant on the page that the
glitch occurs on.

3. hit the back button (on the browser window, but also work with right click)

The frame should have shifted back one page instead of the whole site
