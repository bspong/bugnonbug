User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20150929144111

Steps to reproduce:

First Steps:
1.- Install Firefox or Create a new empty profile
2.- Inmediately type about:support and see that H264 hardware decoding is true
3.- Let Cisco H264 and Adobe Primetime decoder to install
4.- Restart Firefox
5.- H264 hardware decoding is unavailable now.

Further Testing:
1.- If Cisco H264 is installed, type about:config
2.- Change media.hardware-video-decoding.failed to false
3.- Change media.gmp-provider.enabled to false
4.- Restart Firefox
5.- Play any HD/Full HD video @ 60 fps, Now Firefox us local hardware decoders, which even prevent Firefox to have bug with Adobe Flash Player Enabled/Installed. Videos play fast and steady.


Actual results:

The first step lead to Firefox thinking your VGA cannot handle H264 decoding (which in my case, it can do it completely)

The second remove the need of the plugin, leading to Firefox, using your local decoder (AMD, Windows...), improving speed, CPU usage (lower than with Cisco's) and removing bug with Flash (Not reverting to media.hardware-video-decoding.failed=true if Flash plugin loads, for example in Youtube)


Expected results:

Cisco musn't have changed the result in media.hardware-video-decoding.failed after instalation, also, it shoudn't conflict with flash plugins.

This bug seems partially fixed in Nightly 440a1, but for some reason, Cisco's plugin still reverts media.hardware-video-decoding.failed to true when it's installed, while Firefox clearly see your hardware a capable before this is downloaded and installed.

I attach some file that include info in about:support, and my DxDiag information (32-64 bit), for extra reference, VLC Player with DXVA 2.0 support play any video with this codec, even 60fps one in HD and Full HD, Windows Media Player doe a well.

My Specs:
OS: Windows 7 x64 SP1
RAM: 4 GB
VGA: ATI Radeon HD 3200 (Drivers: v8.970.100.1100)
