Not sure where this come from but File/Exit show ReferenceError: FireFoxClosing not defined.

1) When I change to a different mailbox in gmail.com, up to a 3 second wait occurs before it paints. Not before now.
2) Switching tab when a gmail load or activity on the Addons dropdown is occurring cause a lock delay until these finish.
3) On at least one occassion after loading and executing the restart it failed to do so, and came back with another AddOn window with the restart message which in turn failed to do so. File/Exit wa required to clear.

Not sure of these are all related; no time to debug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the extension I have
2. Run a find update button or a gmail change of mailbox button
3. try to switch tab (gmail/Inbox and gmail/Spam
Actual Results:
Severe delay in switching tab until the action started complete; more correctly delay to _finish_ such until the action complete: sometimes part of the way through and THEN a slowdown or pause. May be MS Windows menu/subcontext panel code causing the problem.

Expected Results:
Should move quickly and surely to the next tab; and quickly execute that code.

I would suggest that whatever action the mouse click on should probably have it thread pumped to the top of the heap in priority, whatever the actual "bug" is. More than that would be an enhancement (specifying prioritization among action to subsume resource (such a CPU time) next.
