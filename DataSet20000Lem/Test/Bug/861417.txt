Audio and then video stop (even in fully buffered videos) - both working in IE
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0

Steps to reproduce:

Checked all plugins, graphic and sound drivers. Purged cache. Ran virus scans. Removed dead entry in Registry. Downloaded Firefox 20 (was using 19 when the problem started). Restarted Firefox with plug-in disabled. Reset Firefox. Nothing helped.
Internet Explorer still work (as well a it ever did...); i.e. the audio and video DON'T stop...
The only download before this started happening wa the XP Pro Tuesday patch and the latest Adobe reader update (BOTH hour before).


Actual results:

On Wednesday evening (4/10) after several hour of viewing them, any video (regardless of player selected or site) started having the audio stop and a few second later the video will stop. Clicking on the video will restart it (the audio resume from the point where the video stopped).
This happens a close together a a few seconds, and a far apart a 20+ minutes. It happens a seldom a twice in 30 minutes, and a often a 10+ time in the same interval.
ANY interaction, either with other tab in Firefox or other program appears to immediately stop the video IF the audio ha already stopped, and ha absolutely no effect if it hasn't.
