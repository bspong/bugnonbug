When using (for example) tinymce, if I try to promote a list item (could be blank, could have text) to the next level (creating a nested list) by using the tab key, the focus leaf the editable region and go to the next keyboard-accessible control (e.g. link, input, etc) in the page containing the editable region.

In FF2 and earlier, one could create a nested list by pressing the tab key. Shift+tab would demote a nested list by one level.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go the tinymce full demo page: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/example_full.php?example=true
2. type some text, and press the control to convert to a list (ordered, unordered)
3. hit the return/enter key to begin a new list item
4. press the tab key.

Actual Results:
The focus left the editable region and went to the first link below the region (which is the "ol" in Path: ol >> li)

Expected Results:
The new list item should become the first item of a new nested list.
