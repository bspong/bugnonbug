On Windows Vista, with multiple Firefox window open, background window will frequently pop forward and steal focus for no reason.

Reactivating the proper focus window will often result in the inappropriate window again re-stealing focus, and clicking on the proper window to focus it will cause this cycle to repeat several time for a few seconds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
On Windows Vista...

1. Open an AJAX Application in a firefox window (i.e. Google Calendar)
2. Open another Firefox window to another site (i.e. slashdot)
3. browse in window #2....
Actual Results:
Background firefox window inappropriately pop forward. This doe not happen with the same website on IE7 on the same Vista installation. This doe not happen with the same website on Firefox on Windows XP.

Further, once it pop forward once, re-activating the correct window will often result in the wrong window popping forward repeatedly each time for several seconds.

Expected Results:
Background firefox window stay put, not popping forward.

While it seems to happen more frequently with AJAX apps, that is not necessary. It seems to happen with any site in the background window.

This bug make firefox virtually unusable on Windows Vista. The user must minimize all except one main window in order to avoid this focus popping problem.
