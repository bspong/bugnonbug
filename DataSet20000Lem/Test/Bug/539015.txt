When I press the "x" in the top right corner, Firefox close but the
firefox.exe process is still running and consuming CPU usage. When I decide to
go back onto Firefox, I have to kill the firefox.exe process manually through
command prompt before it open again. After doing this and Firefox open again,
it ALWAYS asks to restore my previous session and that Firefox ha updated to
3.5.7. This bug only occurs when Firefox ha been opened and closed once. I am
running Windows XP Professional SP3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Close Firefox browser by clicking "x"
2.Open Task Manager
3.Manually kill the firefox.exe process
4.RE-open The firefox browser
Actual Results:
it ALWAYS asks to restore my previous session and that Firefox ha updated to
3.5.7. This bug only occurs when Firefox ha been opened and closed once.

Expected Results:
Firefox should open with my homepage and not the above said and should not have to kill the process manually
