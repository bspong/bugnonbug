Repeating desktop screenshot fragment on page background on amd64

The page background on www.slskrecords.com ha been replaced by a fragment of what's on my screen. Kind of hard to describe, look at the screenshot. This only happens on the 64-bit build; the 32-bit Gentoo binary package (mozilla-firefox-bin) doe not exhibit this problem (different library versions?).

Some update of my screen are also reflected in Firefox; for instance when clicking on the terminal icon, it update once the terminal window pop up; the launch icon on the toolbar change to the "mouseover" state. But there are no update while the button is in the pressed state etc.

Rendering of this page is also very slow; it take over 1 second (no exaggeration) to switch to this tab on my Athlon 64 3000+, with unaccelerated "nv" drivers.

I have observed a similar effect on another page a well, but I cannot recall where.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.slskrecords.com/
2. Observe the described awkward effect.

Actual Results:
The background image ha been replaced with a screenshot fragment of my desktop.


Expected Results:
Displayed the correct background.

Cairo version 1.6.4, GTK+ version 2.12.5-r1, X.org 7.3 (X.org server version 1.4.0.90-r3)
Using nvidia's unaccelerated/open source "nv" drivers.

What else is relevant?
