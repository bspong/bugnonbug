keybord input fails with Java Applets on Linux

On page that have Java applet with text widgets, keyboard input is ignored.

This make it impossible to enter any data with the keyboard.

This also happens on http://www.avalon-rpg.com/connect/

After researching this problem on the web I found the following comment about it at: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/showthread.php?t=316807:

"First, for those who are replying about keyboard input into a webpage that happens to have an applet in it, you are completely missing the issue. The issue is keyboard input INSIDE the applet. It is a problem with Firefox (any version) and Java 1.5. If you remove the 1.5 version of Java and install 1.4, the problem go away. Firefox developer claim that this problem doesn't exist. Java developer claim that it doesn't exist. So, I seriously doubt that it will ever get fixed."

Is there a comment that can be made about what is going on? Is there something particular to Linux that make this happen? This problem not being solved for a year ha resulted in my abandoning Java Applets (kbd input doen't work) in favor of WebStart (kbd input work perfect), but it wasn't really what I wanted to do --- an applet really would have been better for my app.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me --- I would be happy to contrinute what I can to helping get this resolved.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the site http://www.groupboard.com/demo/

2. Scroll down to the shared whiteboard, you will find a chatbox at the bottom of the whiteboard.

3. Try to type your name and a message. It will fail.


Actual Results:
Although you can use the mouse to scribble and use the applet, you will not be able to type anything in.

Expected Results:
We should see what we type in the box that have focus.

It doesn't matter if you click to set focus. Same result.
