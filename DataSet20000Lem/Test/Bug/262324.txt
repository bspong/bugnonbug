Firefox always attempt DNS lookup on URLs when using PAC proxy configuration
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10

When I am on the road and I ssh into my work account, I usually use the port
forwarding provided by ssh to link the localhost:2128 to my company's internal
proxy server, squid.<company.com>:3128. Thus if I set my proxy to localhost:2128
I can access all the internal web resource provided by my company.

However, in order to use the company's proxy only for the internal web sites, I
have the following PAC file stored a ~/proxy.pac and configured it in Firefox.
This setup is exactly the same a I use for the Mozilla browser.

function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{
if (/\.company\.com$/.test(host) ||
/\.devel$/.test(host) ) {
return "PROXY localhost:2128; DIRECT";
} else {
return "DIRECT";
}
}

With the above setup and mozilla, I can type in the location bar
"http://intranet.company.com" and Mozilla will corerctly proxy through
localhost:2128 and successfully load the internal site.

Firefox will complain about the invalid host address, because it can not find
the intranet.company.com defined in the external DNS. In that regard, Firefox is
correct about the DNS aspect, but it is incorerct in assuming that asking a
proxy about it will not yield a loadable page.

It look like Firefox attempt to resolve in DNS all web address before
running them through the PAC process.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Firefox to manual proxy configuration on localhost:2128 - the
intranet.company.com page load successfully and Firefox doe not complain about
the missing DNS record.

2. Set Firefox to Automatic Proxy Configuration using the above file (by
pointing it to file://home/<user>/proxy.pac). Now when I type in
intranet.company.com in the location bar, Firefox give me an error about how it
could not locate the hosyname for the URL typed in.


Actual Results:
Mozilla process the URLs corerctgly through PAC.

Firefox doe not process the URLs corerctly through PAC.

Expected Results:
Firefox should run the URLs through the PAC process before attempting to look
them up in DNS.
