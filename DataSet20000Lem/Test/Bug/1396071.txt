browser_ext_devtools_inspectedWindow.js is going to frequently fail when Gecko 57 merges to Beta on 2017-09-20
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Frequently failing test on the next merge day.

I won't call this permafail since I'm pretty sure there were *some* green runs, but the failure rate is extremely high nonetheless (intermittently green more than the other way around).

I bisected this down to the range below:
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=a2723b650460&tochange=e4b8ea7baeb6

From there, bug 1395262 seems like the most obvious candidate within the range, but I haven't actually verified that. Regardless, can you please take a look, Tom? CCing Luca a well just in case he ha any ideas.
