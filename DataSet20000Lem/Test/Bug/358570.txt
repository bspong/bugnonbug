Using OpenSearch without <inputEncoding>, the query character are garbled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://ja.wikipedia.org/
2. Add the Search Engine Wikipedia provides.
3. Search Japanese words(e.x. &#26085;&#26412;&#35486;) using it.

Actual Results:
The query character are garbled. So I can't search correctly.
# Searching "&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;", open http://ja.wikip.org/w/index.php?title=%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:Search&search=%3F%3F%3F

Expected Results:
The query character aren't garbled. And I cant search correctly.
# Searching "&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;", open http://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E7%89%B9%E5%88%A5:Search&search=%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E

When the OpenSearch plugin doesn't contain <inputEncoding>, Firefox us intl.charset.default a encoding.
Thd default value of intl.charset.default is ISO-8859-1. So "&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;" is encoded %3F%3F%3F.

According to OpenSearch 1.1, however, the default value of <inputEncoding> is "UTF-8".
http://www.opensearch.org/Specifications/OpenSearch/1.1#The_.22InputEncoding.22_element
# "&#26085;&#26412;&#35486;" should be encoded %E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E.

So, Firefox should use UTF-8 encoding even if <inputEncoding> isn't contained by the OpenSearch plugin.

FYI, IE7 us UTF-8 encoding even if <inputEncoding> isn't contained by the OpenSearch plugin.
