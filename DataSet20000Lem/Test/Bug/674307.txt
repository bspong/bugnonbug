Facebook Login Approvals recognized device is resetting
If a user ha facebook set to require login approval

(description: Login Approvals
When an unrecognized computer or device try to access my account:
Require me to enter a security code sent to my phone)

it should hold that device until it is removed from the list. This feature ha been working for me on Aurora build since June 25th (when I first enabled it). However, in the last few day when I logout and log back in I have to re-approve the device and browser on at least a daily (if not more often) basis.

Steps to reproduce
1) Setup facebook acount to use login approval
Account -> Account Settings
Account Security -> change
Put a check in "Login Approvals"
When an unrecognized computer or device try to access my account:
Require me to enter a security code sent to my phone
Save the setting.
2) Log out and log back into Facebook, you should be prompted for a code to access your account.
3) This setting should stay a long a the device/browser combination is approved.

Actual result
1) Approval is resetting approx every 24 hour and the list in Facebook is an increasing list of approval

Impact
This could be perceived a a problem with Firefox and Facebook not doing security correctly and thus a mark against the browser. This is a recent regression in behavior a until this point this wa not a problem and the site could remember the browser/computer wa authorized even across daily updates.
