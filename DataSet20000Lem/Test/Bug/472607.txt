About a week ago QuickTime began to malfunction. I uninstalled the old version and downloaded the new v7.1. It still will not function. I get the message:

"QuickTime Unavailable"

The QuickTime Plug-in requires the
QuickTime System extension version 5 or later.

This message appears at 15 minute interval whether I am trying to access video
content or not.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.attempt to access any video content on any website - Huffington Post, Truthdig, NewScientist, TED, etc.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Pop-up occurs with the message quoted above. If I clear the pop-up it recurs every 15 minute whether I am trying to access any video content or not.

Expected Results:
I should be able to access video content at these and other sites.

I found a bug #430826 on your website but I can't understand whether the bug ha
been fixed or not or whether it even applies to my situation.

This happened suddenly out of the blue, about a week ago, and I am unable to play video content on any of the website I access.

I have a message posted at Apple-QuickTime about this problem but I have received no response.

Is this a Mozilla problem, an Apple-QuickTime problem, or something else.
