Myspace return a blank page and "done" status when advancing through page or logging in.

This began about two week ago. At first, I noticed that when I am logged into Myspace and wish to browse my high school's alumnus or another list of user spanning several pages, clicking "next" lead to a blank page. The browser report "done [loading]" at the bottom. This problem is constant and Firefox update have not addressed it. Recently, in addition to multiple page report not loading correctly, when I attempt to log in, I also receive a blank page. Revisiting Myspace.com report that I successfully signed on, but I cannot actually do anything, a when I click on "home," I get (surprise) a blank page.

Every now and then, I'm able to work around this by re-entering Myspace.com and clicking "home," but not always (or even usually).

I can open Myspace just fine in IE6, but I don't use IE6 for a reason, and I'd love to keep it that way. Thanks...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter URL "Myspace.com"
2. Enter user login info, click submit.
3. Receive blank page.

(AND/OR)

1. When logged into Myspace, click "search."
2. Enter search criterion returning multiple page of result and click "search."
3. Click next to view next batch of results. Blank page is returned.
Actual Results:
"Blank page" is the common theme.

Expected Results:
Firefox ha always been fine with opening page in Myspace. I've not had these "blank page" issue until recently.

In general, I noticed this bug after installing one of the newer update to Firefox 2.0. Not sure which one, but the problem wa slow to reach it current state. At first, it wa an "every now and then" issue. Now, it is predictable in nature.
