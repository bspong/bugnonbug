Unusable performance.
User-Agent: Opera/9.64 (Windows NT 5.0; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: downloaded from mozilla.com today

I've consistently tried each, or nearly each, new cut of v3.0, and every time I've had to revert to v2. The same system that run v2 or Opera 9 briskly (2GHz P4, 2GB, W2KSP4, mixed SATA/PATA/SCSI2UW) will take 20 second or more to figure out what to do about "http://127.0.0.1/test.php". I'm at a loss to know what's going on. No amount of FFv3 reinstalling helps. I recently had to reinstall the o/s from the metal up, so it's not a though the o/s is old and grotty with loose bit dropping off here and there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install and start v3. Vanilla install, just to a non-default location.
2. Try to use it.
3. Give up, revert to v2.0.0.11. (Sorry, this is really not me trying to be a smart-arse, this is a close to good information a I can give you. To describe V3's performance a "runs slowly" is almost laughably far off - it doesn't "run" at all. "Acts like it's completely bewildered about it role in life" would be more descriptive of how slow it is. I'm even posting this bug report using Opera because of how awful FFv3 is.



It's a rather vanilla, stripped-down install. I don't like plugins or other garnish, so I even tend to remove the one that come "for free" the first time they get in my way, but v3 doesn't run well enough for any plugins to get in my way: v3 get in my way before they get a look-in.

About the only non-default thing I did is to install to a chosen location on a different drive: I don't like Microsoft's "for your inconvenience, we'll put all your egg in one basket so that if anything breaks, everything breaks.".
