separate preference for Clear Private Data command from automatic clear on exit prefs
When the Clear Private Data feature wa introduced, user could choose to either invoke it on-demand using Tools > Clear Private Data or have data automatically cleared when the browser exited. The two invocation method share a single set of preferences, though.

We should decouple the two command from sharing a single set of preference about what type of data is removed, a the requirement for on-demand private data removal are unlikely to be the same a those for on-exit remove. The former is used when a user want fine-grained control over removing data, whereas the latter is used when a user want certain data to always be removed.

The on-demand function should show the dialog (see bug 453440 comment 12 for design) with a time-range for history, and:
- the state of checkboxes & dropdowns should be persisted for the next time the on-demand function is invoked,
- the default state of these checkboxes & drop down should no longer be tied to the "Settings" dialog in the Privacy prefpane

The automatic on-exit deletion of selected item should still be controlled by a preference in the Privacy prefpane, but the Settings dialog (sheet on OSX) should look like this:

| When I quit %productName;, it should automatically |
| clear all: |
| |
| History --------------------------------------------|
| |
| [x] Visited Pages [ ] Cookies |
| [x] Download List [ ] Form & Search Entries |
| [x] Web Cache |
| |
| Data -----------------------------------------------|
| [ ] Saved Passwords [ ] Offline Website Data |
| |
| ( Cancel ) (( OK )) |
'-----------------------------------------------------'
- the persistence of these selection will not be tied to those of the Clear Private Data command
