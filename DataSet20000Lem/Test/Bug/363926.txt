when using yahoo email, file can not be attached to email

firefox is fantastic ! However, i prefer to use Yahoo email but i find that the 'attach' button doesn't work in yahoo.
Here's a use case to try:
1. log into an online yahoo email account
2. click the "compose" button (it will go to a compose email screen)
3. click the "Attach Files" button (again a new screen with scope to add 5 files)
4. click one of the five "browse" button (a dialogue box appears so that you can select a file from your own machine)
5. pick a file from your own hard drive and press "open" on the dialogue box.
(the dialogue box dissappears and you're returned to the attach file screen)
6. Now click the "Attach Files".
(nothing happens - the activity icon at the top right hand corner of the browser doesn't 'swirl' around) It's a if the button click isn't recognised.

Thanks for your help.

Regards

Robert.
