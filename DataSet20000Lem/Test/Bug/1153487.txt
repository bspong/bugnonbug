Firefox 37 crash occasionally on exit
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
Build ID: 20150402191859

Steps to reproduce:

Run Firefox and get to a website.


Actual results:

I've had several crash while the following site wa left running:
xe.com (a currency exchange site I've used for years), with a right-click pop-up on a particular currency. I'd be working on another screen at the time and eventually notice the crash icon long after the fact.

Also had it crash silently once or twice simply after exiting any page. That is, FF closed and the crash window appeared in the background. (BUT could be a red herring -- perhaps this wa a crash screen from a previous run that I just noticed now while closing the current run.)

I've been waiting to find rhyme or reason before reporting, but it ha happened EVERY day since upgrading on 04-APR-2015, sometimes multiple times, unfortunately not predictably.

...Then last previous crash wa back in February.


Expected results:

Firefox should keep running when left on a page.
