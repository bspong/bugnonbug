I am using the browser through a proxy, hosted on my desktop machine (the one with the internet connection). When I then open a site and then navigate to another one, the new page is not opened. What happens, I think, is that for some reason the page request are sent to the old server (socket not closed or smth.) and since it doesn't host the respective page, it return an error result page.

However the issue doesn't always happen with all the sites.

The proxy server is AnalogX, which can be downloaded from the following URL:
http://www.analogx.com/contents/download/network/proxy.htm

My proxy setting can be seen here:
