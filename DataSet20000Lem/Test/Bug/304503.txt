Many sites, including Wired.com and Mail.com are presenting the user with
LiveStrong's shockwave web-ad.
Unfortunately this shockwave process regularly capture all Mouse and Keyboard
event making navigation impossible.
The only way to recover is to Force-Quit FireFox.
I have said reproducibility is always but it's more like 90%

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move your mouse over the shockwave component
2. Try to select a menu with the mouse. If successful repeat process.
3. If the menu is not shown then no further mouse or keyboard event will be
processed by FireFox.

Actual Results:
Shockwave Ad responds to mousedowns anywhere within the menu or any window
belonging to FireFox.
Nothing else happens. Windows are not even brought to the front.
Keyboard command are also ignored, although Command-Tab still work and it is
also possible to select another application from the Dock.
If you return to FireFox no window come to the front.
It seems a though the ShochWave Ad ha taken over complete control.

Expected Results:
Allow window to be closed etc.

I have reported this also to the webmaster shown at LiveStrong.org's site
webmaster@laf.org
and asked that he give some assistance.
