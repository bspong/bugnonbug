Security error popup dialog associated with the wrong window
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040706 Firefox/0.9.1

When Firefox (0.9.1, Fedora Core 2) is running, and a new Firefox window is
opened to an URL that result in a "Security Error" due to eg. SSL cert domain
name mismatch, the security error popup dialog is associated with the wrong
window (ie. the one that wa already open, not the new opened one which caused
the error popup).

IIRC this is a regression; it worked properly in Firefox 0.8.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1) Start firefox
2) Open a console window, maximise it so that it cover the already open Firefox
window
3) Type "firefox https://bugzilla.fedora.us/ &" (note: https) in the console

Actual Results:
A new firefox window open below the maximised terminal window. So far so good.
But when I switch the newly opened firefox window to the "top" so that it is
visible, nothing is there, just blank screen, waiting for an answer to the
security error popup box which is still below the maximised terminal window, and
at the center of the _old_ firefox window.

Expected Results:
The security error popup box should have been "associated" with the window that
caused it, ie. bringing the newly opened firefox window to the front from below
the maximised terminal window should have caused the popup to become visible too.
