If you are using Firefox 3.6.4 and uploading file to mobileme, you get an error message. I tried using Firefox 3.6.3 on another mac computer and it worked. I am able to upload to mobile me using Safari. I have reported the problem to Apple and they are sending the problem to their mobileme engineering team and Senior Advisor Team.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox browser
2.type in www.me.com and log onto mobileme account
3.In public folder, upload a file
Actual Results:
Using Firefox 3.6.4 log onto www.me.com to access a mobleme account. Log on and go to the public folder. Upload a file. You will get a message that you are unable to upload the file.

Expected Results:
Can’t use Firefox 3.6.4 with mobileme. I have to use Safari. Apple suggested downgrading the browser because we found that I wa able to upload using Firefox 3.6.3. It worked yesterday.

The software should have allowed me to log on to mobileme and upload a file. I am able to download, but not upload.
