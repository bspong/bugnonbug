When the browser crash and restarts with about:sessionrestore and you click the "restore tabs' button twice (because of system lag, accident, etc.) it reloads all tab twice. For me this ha always been creating two duplicate window full of 20 or so tabs. It seems very unlikely that this behavior would ever

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get about:sessionrestore screen
2. Click restore button twice
Actual Results:
All tab open up twice.

Expected Results:
All tab should open up once or give you a warning that you are about to open all of your tab twice (since step to reproduce would be overwhelmingly accidental).

This is between minor and trivial. It ha been a minor annoyance twice. In some sense it could be seen a a 'feature' given more option to the user but if this is the case I recommend a dialog box of some sort asking "are you sure you want to restore the same session twice?" just like we have for when you open all 40 tab in a folder on the bookmark toolbar.
