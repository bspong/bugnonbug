First ever post here.... All I can do is post symptoms...
Just returned from vacation at Vdara in Las Vegas. FF3 would allow me to login to their Wireless IP site with my name and Room number.
FF4 WOULD NOT ALLOW SUCCESSFUL IP from same site.

More Symptoms: You'd login using your name and room number...
You then would select either a Public, or Private IP, and a box named "CONTINUE" would be clicked... and that would complete the selection process and give you an IP for use for 24 hours... Then repeat the procedure...

FF3 WOULD WORK CORRECTLY
FF4 WOULD NOT.... It wound not give you the "CONTINUE" box to complete the procedure.... Didn't matter if you selected Public or Private IP....

WORK AROUND: Logged in via IE, then selected "CONTINUE".... Then I'd close IE, and re-open FF4, which worked fine, for 24 hours... Then the whole procedure repeated itself, with the same bug....

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter Name
2. Enter Room number
3. SELECT either Public or Private IP

And you don't see: "Continue" So it doesn't complete

Note that if you click where "Continue" should be.... Still doesn't work....
Only work around it login with IE (32 or 64) and then close it and re-open FF4, which work for 24 hours, until IP time out, then you have to do it all over again....
Actual Results:
FF4 should work a correctly a doe FF3

Expected Results:
FF3 Works... So Should FF4, but FF4 Does not work
