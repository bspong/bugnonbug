The page in question display a news and it us a JS way of displaying tooltips
to some key-words... like Internet Explorer in our case. When you go over that
word (underlined) the tooltip appears. Left to the word there is a flash.
Tooltip is displayed UNDER the flash. Also it seems that the vertical-banner on
the right and the flash in the center their top is re-displayed. And in the case
of the Flash part of the top of the flash is being redisplayed twice. I am not
sure what's the j provided by vibrantmedia.com, but I am sure it should screw
up the display of the page. In the worst case it should display the tooltip.
So... I guess it's a bug with FF.
More than that... and the strange part when I view the source code of the page
it is displayed allright. If I am selecting the text which contains the
underlined word (with tooltip) and select View Selection Source... the code
appears like this:
<a target="_blank" href="#" style="background-color: ; text-decoration:
underline;" class="iAs">Internet Explorer</a>
The tag wa added by intelliTxt JS script and it doe not appear on normal View
Source of the entire page. Maybe this is a subject of a second bug... or it is a
normal behaviour of the view source...
