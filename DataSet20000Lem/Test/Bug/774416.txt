Netflix queue reordering intermittently break Firefox completely
(I know that's a terrible bug summary, but I don't know how else to describe it—I can't pinpoint exactly what is happening or what is causing it, and it's not reliably reproduceable.)

On multiple occasions, I have been in the process of reordering my Netflix queue (which I keep in an app tab) when the entire browser cease to function. But it's not a hang (at least, not in the memory sense)—it's something else.

Netflix allows two different method of reordering the queue:

1. Dragging and dropping, which automatically update the queue.
2. Editing number and hitting a "Reorder Queue" button that us a traditional web form to reorder the queue.

I believe this bug crop up when using method 2, but it doesn't do it all the time. It may only happen when I do it multiple time in somewhat quick succession (though not actually all that quick). (Maybe there's a race condition somewhere?)

When the bug manifests, the tab icon remains the spinning loading icon, even though the page seems to have finished loading. (I don't recall there being any other indication that the page wa actually still loading.) Then, the browser becomes unresponsive to most input. I can't click on other tabs, I can't right-click, etc. But it's not a hang, because some thing do work—or, at least, sort of work. I believe I can get tab highlighted using keyboard shortcuts, but I still can't actually switch to them with ease.

Unfortunately, I'm reporting this from memory, because this ha only happened a few times. I think once it happened on another site (maybe CapitalOne?), but I recall being able to (at least partially) recover from it, though I don't remember how.

If there's any other information that I might be able to provide to help narrow this down, let me know. I'd hate for this to be marked INCOMPLETE or INVALID or WORKSFORME, because it creates a problem that can generally only be resolved by force-quitting, and it's certainly a confusing situation when it manifests.
