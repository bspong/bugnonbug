If you click the expand button for a blog entry (after expanding the blog
itself) - (which display an extra div, therefore making the blog container
bigger) - the icon to view the comment and add a comment for every blog entry
don't move down to align with their respective blog titles. They only do this on
mouseover, when the CSS is recalculated to change the opacity.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load up http://drbob.tomjepp.co.uk/ (yes, it is my webpage ;-P)
2. Expand the blog container (top-right)
3. Expand any blog entry
4. Watch in amazement a the background-image'd icon don't budge

Actual Results:
The background-image'd icon (the image is specified in the CSS) don't move to
stay in line with their respective blog entry titles.

Expected Results:
The background-image'd icon should move to stay in line with their respective
blog entry titles.

The icon image are specified in the CSS with the background-image attribute so
that themeability is easier. For more reference on this topic, see the titlebar
of mozilla.org, or csszengarden.com
