Firefox crash fairly frequently, but at seemingly random intervals. Gmail is almost always open in one of the tabs, but it is not always the active tab. The crash doe not seem to be triggered by any sort of action on my part, because it also happens when my computer ha been sitting idle. I have theme and several lab feature enabled on my gmail. The latest Firefox update did nothing to solve the problem, a it ha crashed twice in the half hour since I installed the updates. The crash reporter file a report, but I have never received an email with further information.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have gmail open in a tab
2. Surf normally and wait
3.
Actual Results:
Sometimes nothing happens, sometimes Firefox crash and the Crash Reporter appears.

Expected Results:
It should not have crashed.

I use the "ocean" theme in my gmail, and have the "superstars" and "forgotten attachment" lab enabled.
