In Firefox 2.0.0.1 running on Mac OS X 10.4.8 I'm getting text rendering errors. Simply by changing the base font seems to reveal the missing text. Safari doe not show this same problem. This might related to another issue I have where character seem to be overlapping each other, like the character pixel width is not correctly being calculated.

I have taken a few screen shot to show the difference:

- default Firefox font size:

- smaller font size:

- same page in Safari:

I checked the page in Firefox on WinXP and there is no problem in WinXP.

Thanks!
