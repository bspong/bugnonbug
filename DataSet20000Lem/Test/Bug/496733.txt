nsIProcess doe not execute process with the correct argument or it is somehow blocking the child execution.

nsIProcess FF 3.5 beta 4 fails to call a child process with the wrong or bad arguments.

nsIProcess doe it right on FF 3.0 series.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Cepstral David for Linux x86 from http://cepstral.com/downloads/

2. Add the following code to the JS file in the extension:

const File = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/file/local;1"]
.createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile);

const SwiftPath = "/opt/swift/bin/swift";

File.initWithPath(SwiftPath);

const SwiftProcess = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/process/util;1"]
.createInstance(Components.interfaces.nsIProcess);

SwiftProcess.init(File);

var args = new Array();
args[0] = "-n";
args[1] = "David";
args[2] = "-m";
args[3] = "text";
args[4] = "Test";

SwiftProcess.run(false, args, args.length);

3. The David voice should speak the text a on FF 3.0 series.
Actual Results:
The David voice should speak the text a on FF 3.0 series but with FF 3.5b4 for Linux x86 nothing happens. Possible mingling of arguments.

Could also be some other problem.

Expected Results:
The David voice should speak the text a on FF 3.0 series.

I am sure that this problem can be recreated by calling other child processes.
