Neither Escape nor any other action doesn't cancel edits made in Edit This Bookmark panel
I have a problem with Firefox 52. It doesn't happen in Firefox ESR 45.
My problem is: there's no way to undo change in bookmark, and this is a regression.
It just doesn't work. You can use this specific scenario to reproduce

1. Create bookmark with url "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1345479" and name "1234"
2. Open https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1345479
3. Press Ctrl+D, in "Edit this bookmark" panel type "5" in the end of the field "Name"
4. Press Escape

Result: Bookmark now ha the name "12345"
Expected: Escape should cancel all changes. Or there should be another way to cancel all change in bookmark panel

- Sometimes I want to send to a friend some text that consists of text in clipboard and some bookmark's name. That mean I open bookmark, press Ctrl+D, paste text from clipboard into bookmark panel and edit resulting text (a lot). After that I copy the resulting text to clipboard and press Escape to undo all change
- Sometimes I edit bookmark name and need to undo all change to start from the beginning.
- Sometimes after editing bookmark name I accidentally delete some tag and want to quickly restore it.
Now neither Escape nor any other action cancel my changes, it significantly slows down the browsing in each case.
Is this time loss an intentional change???
