[Affected versions]:
- latest Nightly 56.0a1
- Beta 55.0b5 (20170626165718)

[Affected platforms]:
- Windows 10 x64
- macOS 10.12.5
- Ubuntu 16.04 x64 LTS

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Go to: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/developer/css-grid/?utm_source=gridtooltip&utm_medium=devtools&utm_campaign=cssgrid_layout
3. Open Inspect Element (F12) and go to the Layout tab.
4. Check "div.content.grid-content".
5. Refresh the webpage. (I've noticed that sometimes it requires more than 1 refresh to reproduce this)

[Expected result]:
a) The CSS Grid checkbox stay enabled in Inspector after refresh or
b) The CSS Grid checkbox is disabled in the Inspector and Grids are not displayed anymore on the page. (after refresh)

[Actual result]:
- The CSS Grid appears enabled on the test page but "div.content.grid-content" checkbox is unchecked in Layout tab.

[Regression range]:
- If the right expected result is b) then it seems to be a regression, a I cannot reproduce it on 53.0a1 when this feature wa first implemented. In that case I will follow up with a regression range.

[Additional notes]:
- Please note that with other Overlay Grids, e.g.: div.content.grid-content, div.content.grid-content this issue is not reproducible
