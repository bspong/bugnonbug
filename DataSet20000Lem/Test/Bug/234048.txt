Find in this page, the message box that pop up stating 'the text you entered wa not found' block the Find box.

When opening the find dialog (Edit > Find in this page), if the text entered is
not found, the message box / popup appears in the way of the Find dialog. This
is annoying having to press OK every time if you have a large text document that
you want to search for various word / strings.

I think a better solution would be for the 'Find in this Page' dialog to expand
down, with a fieldset called 'messages', which would display 'The text you
entered wa not found'. Then you can choose to 'hide' the expanded section, or
you could just type something else in and try again. Once you start to type
again the message would disappear. This is hard to explain, I will try and
create an image of what I mean and attach it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.google.com
2. Go to 'Edit > Find in this Page'
3. In the 'Find What:' textbox enter a string of text that isn't on the google
front-page, such a 'hajhfahdjfajdhf jhjshdjfhue' and hit enter.

Actual Results:
A message box popped up informing me that 'The Text you entered wa not found'

Expected Results:
The 'Find in this page' dialog should expand downwards showing a 'messages'
fieldset, which can display various messages. The main 'Find in this Page'
dialog should have a <show / hide> button for the 'Messages' expand-out area.
