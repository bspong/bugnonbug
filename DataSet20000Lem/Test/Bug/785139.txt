Actual results:

After working fine for a year, in Firefox 13 in July-
There are now Image anomaly in the slideshows, a they play. It seems to be the result of the previous image not being fully removed, when the next image is presented. With the text, it becomes garbled. With the picts, it becomes a frame in a frame in a frame situation on certain image in the series.
It is something that build over the succession of images, and come and goes.

The problem continues in Firefox 14 & 15.
