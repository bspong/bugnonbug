Restyle Popped Out Chat Windows
The current SocialAPI chat window display conversation in tab and a status bar at the bottom. Both of these should be removed. The tabbed conversation are unnecessary and potentially create privacy concern because they do not allow a single conversation to be hidden or minimized without being closed entirely. Further, because of the size of an average chat window, only three or four tab are easily viewable before the window would need to be resized.

The status bar is also not necessary. Currently it show the domain which spawned the conversation and a progress bar. The domain is not needed because if a user ha installed a social network's sidebar, become engaged in a conversation, and is carrying on that conversation, there is little value in reminding them where it initially came from. The only time when this information could be relevant would be if a user had installed multiple sidebar from multiple social networks, had more than one enabled at once, and then began two conversation with the same person in two different network where that user had the same avatar. This scenario is likely to be rare, and not worth adding a domain for. The progress bar doesn't serve much purpose at all.

With a simple restyle, we can make the window simple and follow the style of the sidebar itself per operating system (OSX shown in attachment).
