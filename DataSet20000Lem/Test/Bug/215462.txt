I can't read the tiny font on the web pages... so I have to zoom in.

It would be nice to have an a set of option with regard to this issue.
(control plus and control minus behavior)
"ignore hard coded table size while enlarging text"
"crop text and follow table size" (what happens now)
"zoom the whole page" (ala opera)
"dragable cell boundaries" (ala composer... oh wait.. no composer in Firebird...)

<off topic>
The composer is the MOST interesting part of Mozilla, and is the most likely
location of innovation. I am thinking of wikis that one can just hit a button
on the browser, and start editing in WYSIWUG... and that is similar to the
draggable cell boundaries..


actually... it would be nice to have a zoom in feature that is like opera...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.hit control + on a webpage with hard coded size
2.
3.

Actual Results:
cant read half the text (text close to the margin wa cropped)

Expected Results:
at least make it scrollable so that all the text is usable...

other option in details.
