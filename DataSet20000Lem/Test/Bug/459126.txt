I did not test this with earlier Firefox releases. But it worked sometime before 3.0.3

I first encountered the problem, when I wa about to redesign my own myspace profile yesterday. I added a simple flash widget, which I made myself. Firefox 3.0.3 doe NOT display it at all. BUT with Internet Explorer 7 it work fine!

I have seen the same problem on other myspace profile page since then (And again: IE7 work fine in these case too!)

This is only one example:

Please try Firefox 3.0.3 and IE7 to see the big difference!

I did not see any official myspace flash widget that didn't work.
However, I did not search for these.

As for my own profile. I have tried to embed my flash widget by use of <object> tags, by use of <embed> tag and also by use of both encapsulated.

It is NOT my System that cause this bug, since I have asked several people, what they see on certain myspace profile site (using Firefox 3.0.3)
and it wasn't different from what I saw. The same bug appeared!

I know that myspace always cut down the code for object and add several parameters.

I THINK that myspace change the object code for selfmade flash in a way which isn't supported by Firefox 3.0.3

Best Regards!
