Ctrl+N doesn't open new window

Hitting Ctrl+N should open a new window, but it doe not open the window. It
doe however allocate more memory for it. Looking at task manager, firefox ha
15,588 K allocated, ctrl+n cause this to increment to 16,260, 16,808 17,232,
18,088, and so on... (it look consistent up through at least 44M). Minimizing
firefox drop this down to 1,540K. Then maximizing again put this number to
~9M. This cycle wa repeatable.

Then, I attempted to close the browser, and the mem usage jumped from ~10M up to
43,396K and the program remained in the process list. I attempted to open
firefox back up, but that failed (a second ff instance appeared in the process
list, but dissappeared a second or two later).

So I killed the ff process, and restarted it, and it is still exhibiting all of
the above described behavior.

And I've just restarted the machine, but it still exhibit the same behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Do Ctrl+N or File->New Window
3. Watch it not open a new window.

(as for how it got into this state.....I don't know)
Actual Results:
the program allocates more memory, but doe not open a new window

Expected Results:
Allocate the requisite memory, and then open a new window

I have All-in-One Gestures 0.12.4 (in case there are any known breakage issue
related to that) installed, and originally noticed the problem when it wasn't
responding to mouse gesture correctly (the bottom status bar display the
correct mouse gesture and intended result (as it usually does) but nothing happens.

And a a side-note, this is a machine at work, so I will need to get firefox
working again somewhat soon, but if there is further debug information I can
provide in the next couple day please let me know how and what I need to do.
