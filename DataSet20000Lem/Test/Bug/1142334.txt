[UX] Figure out hover/keyboard interaction in search dropdown
There are a number of different issue here:

- keyboard selection of a search engine, followed by mouse hover over a search engine, followed by enter
- keyboard selection of a search engine, followed by mouse hover over a suggestion, followed by enter
- keyboard selection of a suggestion, followed by mouse hover over a search engine, followed by enter
- keyboard selection of a suggestion, followed by mouse hover over a suggestion, followed by enter

and then for each of these, one could potentially add more keyboard navigation after the mouse hover, before hitting enter.

What we need to know is:

- what happens when you hit enter (which suggestion and which engine get used)
(- potentially: how doe the hover affect any keyboard selection after it's happened)
- how do we visualize this a the user hovers/further-keyboard-navigates


It's not obvious what the answer here are. For the location bar we only have one list of 'things', and while it show hover a 'selection', enter will use the keyboard-inputted (and completed into the input box) item. Only click activate the item indicated by the mouse.

We could try to do the same here, but you run into the fact that:
- the search engine is not visible / put in the search box like the URL/search is
- showing two item a selected is confusing
- having two list mean that manipulating both item with both form of input quickly get confusing.


The one thing we seem to agree on so far is that the current behaviour (hover always influence everything) is unintuitive and mess thing up esp. when unintentional mouse move happen.

Philipp, can you untangle this? :-)
