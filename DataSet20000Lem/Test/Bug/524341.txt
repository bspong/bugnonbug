When logging back in after ctl-alt-bksp, I had the restore dialog box and, not considering the alternative possibilities, I closed it. I wa under the impression this would halt firefox's start up.

Boy! Was I wrong!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Forcifully exit Firefox ("pkill" doe just fine)
2. Restart firefox (if you pkilled, "firefox" doe just fine)
3. When the dialog box come up, close it via the window manager
Actual Results:
Everything lost. Sadly, I didn't learn of the .bak until one session too late.

Expected Results:
I had thought that firefox would not fully start if the dialog is closed

Whether it's adding a response for this wm/dialog feedback or adding a "fuck off" button, I don't care, but please, give me something.

I'd also add that, being magical, I am aware of addons like Time Machine, but not everyone is plugin happy; furthermore, I believe that, for this more primitive type of functionality/feedback, a plugin/addon requirement should not be necessary.
