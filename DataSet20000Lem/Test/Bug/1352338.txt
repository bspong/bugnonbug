Start minimized
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20170329150204

Steps to reproduce:

Launch firefox, either:
1 - last closed FF wa minimized
2 - with a devilspie or devilspie2 script that should minimize the window (this wa attempted a a workaround for 1)

Version: 52.0.2 (64-bit) on linux (ubuntu 16.10, x86_64)


Actual results:

Firefox window get brought to front, on top of other windows, not minimized.

I tried (1) with "--safe-mode" to rule out plugins interference.


Expected results:

Firefox should have:
1 - started with a minimized window
2 - stayed minimized after the DS script ha it forcibly minimized

I see two (orthogonal) way to fix & allow user to get what they want:

1 - properly working window status save/restore
2 - add a "--minimized" CLI option to force the behaviour overriding saved state (also add "--maximized")

I'd do both, a user may close their session with FF maximized, but start a new session with automatic launching of FF, but want it minimized at that time...

This is especially annoying because the FF window often pop up over a terminal/shell window where I'm typing and grab the focus / input from it...
