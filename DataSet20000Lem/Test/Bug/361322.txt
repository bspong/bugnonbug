When printing web page the resultant print is broken up over 3 or 4 pages, or very small, no matter what print setting I use on my laser printer.

I can print normally from other window applications, inc explorer. I have only recently come across this issue inthe past few week after downloading the firefox upgrade.
I would like to drop back to the previous FF version which will probably resolve the issue.. How can I do that??

Steps to Reproduce:
1.file>print

whole webpage print covering whole page in one piece

sorry if this ha been covered.. I have read the webpage on bug reporting, and have looked up the bug list... I really have not got a clue what a sea monkey is... except those little thing that grow and breed and die in jam jar in kid bedrooms..
Thanks and please help.. I keep drifting back to explorer (yuk), a I regularly need prints.
