This only happens when the location bar is next to either the refresh button or
the new tab button AND ONLY happens dragging from the right to the left on the
right side of the button (r u confused?). Follow the steps. I hope this helps.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.right click in nav toolbar and select customize
2.move the refesh or new tab button to the left of the location bar (address bar)
3.Now grab the location bar and drag it left just enough to create a "drop" line
to the right of the button. What your really doing is placing the location bar
on top of itself.
4.let go of the location bar. If it doesn't do it the first time try a few times.
Actual Results:
The location bar disappears.

Expected Results:
These are the only two button that do this--refresh and new tab.

I have tried this on the Oct. 3, 2002 build and confirmed that the same thing
happens.

I hope my direction are good. If not let me know.
