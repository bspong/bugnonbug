extreme sluggishness of bookmark editor v Moz 1.4
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firebird 0.6.1

I have a pretty big bookmark file (660 kB), which I keep on a network
drive to ensure that it get backed up nightly. With Moz thru 1.4
final, editing this file wa not problematic, despite the relative
slowness of the network connection.

I just switched to Firebird 0.6.1, and am mostly happy. But, under
Firebird, not only is there a much greater delay between C-b and the
appearance of the bookmark tree than there is in Moz 1.4, but
individual operation (e.g. create a new folder, move bookmark
between folders) take _much_ longer than under Moz 1.4.

This is aggravated by the apparent removal of the ability to {select,
drag'n'drop} more than one bookmark at a time: S-click and C-click
both open the selected bookmark, so there appears to be no way to,
e.g., select several bookmark and move them all to a folder. Instead,
one must move one at a time, and each operation is _very_ slow.

It's so bad that I'm using IE to post this bug, rather than wait for
Firebird to finish editing!
