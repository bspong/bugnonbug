Citrix Receiver doe not work any longer in Firefox Aurora on Debian Testing AMD64
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20150706004011

Steps to reproduce:

Hello @ll,
not sure, if I should attach my info to one of the other Citrix Receiver related bugs, but a I found only one for MacOS or Win .... :(

I need to use Citrix Receiver during my traineeship to connect to our company's server to use my domain user there. As I am not using Citrix Receiver regularly, I am not sure, when it happen to stop working, but IIRC it wa nearly at the time, when Aurora switched to version 40 ...

Now my observations:

In the past, I wa able to go to https://xenapp.mycompany.tld and Receiver started my desktop automatically. But suddenly it wa only showing this loading symbol for a minute or two ... :( I then tried to reproduce it on Debian Testing AMD64 with Iceweasel 38.0.1-5 a well a Firefox 39.0 (binary download from get-firefox.com), where I can connect with Citrix Receiver (13.0, 13.1 a well a 13.2) without any problem ...

If you need any further information, feel free to ask :)


Actual results:

I only see a this loading symbol for a minute or two, but am not able to connect to our company's XenServer ... :(


Expected results:

It should load my user's environment from my company's server without any hassle.
