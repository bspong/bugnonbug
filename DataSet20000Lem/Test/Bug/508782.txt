Since the release of the 3.5.2 security update, the Google Friend Connect Social Bar no longer functions. I have verified on Vista 64 SP2 and XP SP2, both with the FF 3.5.2 security release installed (including FF 3.5.2 Portable). The Social Bar continues to load correctly in IE 6/7/8 & Chrome and via the IE Tab in FF 3.5.2. This effect multiple site that run the Social Bar (everyone I visited in FF 3.5.2).

I suspect it ha something to do with the Java scripting, but I've been unable to determine exactly where in the 3.5.2 release there is something that would effect the Social Bar. Since numerous site use the Google Friend Connect platform, having functionality disabled is a fairly large issue (which may be contingent upon Google to fix if it is a true security problem).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to a website with the Google Friend Connect Social Bar installed
2.
3.
Actual Results:
The bar display a a solid light blue bar across the top/bottom of the screen (depending on the website position of the bar).

Expected Results:
The expected result wa that the Social Bar would display the site information (membership, recent comments, login/out)

I'm using the default theme, and this appears to be add-on independent (tried with add-on installed & add-on disabled).
