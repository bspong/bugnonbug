Duplicate Software Update window show if the first isn't responded to

When a "large" Software Update window appears prompting an update to the next version, if that window isn't responded to in a while, additional Software Update window can continue to appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Wait for a large "Software Update" window to appear.
2. Don't do anything to dismiss it and continue waiting.
3. Eventually another "Software Update" window will appear with the same contents.
Actual Results:
Multiple Software Update window with identical information appear.

Expected Results:
Only one Software Update window show at a time, and additional one don't appear a long a the one window is still there.

I've had this happen to me on at least 3 occasions, but by it nature of having to wait, it's difficult to reproduce this at will. (Are there about:config setting that can reduce the time to wait so this can be reproduced easier?)
