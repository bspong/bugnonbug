There's a Volkswagen Passat Flash banner ad in the current rotation on Yahoo!
Mail. Every time this ad appears, the window or tab it's in stop responding to
mouse click in the web page area. The cusor never change to the hand/pointer
and right clicking anywhere only open the popup menu that open when not
rightclicking on a link or image. Right clicking the Flash ad doe not open the
Flash menu. The direct URL to the flash ad is
http://creativeby1.unicast.com/assets/A9/N44/M62/C1604/vw_passat_728x90.swf
Immediately above this in the Media tab on the Page Info dialog, there's an
"Object" listed with no info, everything is shown a Unknown, Not Specified,
(Not Cached). The dimension are listed a 728x90 but the Physical dimension
are both zero. When loaded in Firefox by itself, the ad behaves normally,
display the Netscape style hand/pointer when moused over but doe nothing
(doesn't go to the Volkswagen site) when clicked. I get over 200 e-mail a day,
which I go through in one session. This ad appears three to five time or more
in that many messages.

The only "fix" is to close that window or tab then go back to Yahoo! Mail, until
the same ad come around and stop Firefox again. Fortunately it effect is
restricted to the window it appears in.

I don't know if the same ad show up anywhere else. The only time I've
encountered this no-click-response problem is with that specific ad in Yahoo!
Mail in Firefox.

I cannot view and copy the page source or save the page. Yahoo! Mail ha some
protection against doing that, all I get is an HTML file or source that display
the "Message viewing error" page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a Yahoo! Mail Account.
2.Set your personal info to what should cause Yahoo! Mail to fill the banner ad
rotation with automotive related advertisements.
3.Subscribe to some mailing list so you get lot of e-mail.
4.Open e-mail until the Volkswagen Passat ad come along and stop the Firefox
window from responding to clicks.

Actual Results:
The Firefox window displaying this particular ad stop responding to mouse
click in the page display area when it appears while using the Yahoo! Mail web
interface. It's 100% reproducible, but dependent on the Yahoo server sending out
a certain flash file.

Expected Results:
Working like it doe when displaying any other banner ad. ;)
