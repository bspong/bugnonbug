Two or three-step confirmation for security related issue is extremly annoying
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:17.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/17.0
Build ID: 20121128204232

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox often us a 2 or even more step confirmation strategy for security related issues.

Two well known examples:
- The "Reported Attack Page!" warning:
It is not enough, that the user click on the small link "Ignore this warning" almost hidden in the right corner. After clicking the link, a toolbar appears, where the user again ha to click on ...., which open the page requested. However, to make sure the user is really suffering, yet an additional page is opened.

- The invalid security certificate warning:
Quite a lot of page I use, rely on self-signed certificates, which can not be validated by Firefox of course. However, *every* time I would like to load such a page, I have to open a dialog, click multiple button and yet the certificate even isn't stored a valid somewhere.


Actual results:

Annoying multi-step confirmation for security related warnings/dialogs


Expected results:

A multi-step warning should appear just a single time, with a preference to ignore the warning for any future encounter of the same issue on the same page.
