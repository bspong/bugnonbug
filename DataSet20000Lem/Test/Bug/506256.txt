I made an update yesterday including firefox, and after the the update I restart firefox a asked. When restarted, it worked up til this this morning, since where:
- I don't see my bookmarks, all them have desperate,
- All the icon ("next","previous","refresh", etc...... ) are deactivated; when a web page is opened, it's really opened but I don't see the address in the address bar,
- I can not access to my web server locally, since I'm not connected to internet or have activated "Travailler hors connexion" at the file menu, while I can access to it with another browser like Konqueror.
- My browser seems still searching the web site, since the page is already
opened.
- The address I access to are not kept in the address bar.
This is few detail I can give to you, hopefully you could help me troubleshooting and fix this bug on my sytem.
I didn't get to reinstall firefox cause I thought it could lead to the lost of my page bookmarked, which are very important for me.

Thank a lot for excusing my english language , and helping me

I'm waiting eventually for your proposition inside my mailbox.

Best regards!

Eugene.

I can specify any thing at this level, cause the bug instantly appeared ; I wa using my browser with the same configuration since this morning. I just know that I made update yesterday, including Firefox updates. But after updates, I restart the browser a recommended and continue using it, since this morning when the bug appeared, after I started my computer.
