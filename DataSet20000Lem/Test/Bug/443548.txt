When working in a form field (textarea), to mark text to be manipulated, one can
hold down the <Shift> key and tap a cursor key to mark to left or right
of the current cursor location.

One can also hold down <Shift+Ctrl>, and tap a cursor key to highlight
to the beginning of the next WORD left or right. The physical instance of <Ctrl> or <Shift> doesn't matter: either left or right or a mixture of both side work the same.

This work correctly if I use the dedicated cursor keys. However, it doe not work correctly if using the NumPad cursor diamond (the Number Pad numbers): instead, the action appears to be mapped to move focus to a different Tab entirely.

This work correctly in the Windows version of FF 2.0.0.15. AFAICT, it ha never worked correctly for any FF 2.x version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open nine or more tabs, with any site (I use Google).
2. Change the first tab to point to a site with a text entry box. For example, www.google.com ha a one-line Search field: that'll do.
3. Type some text. Any text that ha space and char will do. For example, "Mary had a little lamb"
4. With the cursor is positioned at the end of the text (rightmost), hold down <Ctrl+Shift>, tap <CurLeft> to confirm that text marking is working correctly using the dedicated cursor keys. Text will become highlighted with each tap of <CurLeft>.
5. Repeat, using <Ctrl+Shift>, <NumPad4>.
Actual Results:
Tab focus move to the fourth tab.

Expected Results:
Tab focus remains with the first tab, and text marking to the left occurs.

I have reproduced this aberrant behaviour back to FF 2.0.0.0 . FF 2.x for Windows work a expected. SeaMonkey 1.x work a expected.
