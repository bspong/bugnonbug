Add Bookmark dialog: "Create in" combo box should have special "Show All Folders" entry

In the Add Bookmark dialog box (Bookmarks | Add to Bookmarks), a special entry
should be added to the end of the "Create in" combo box, labelled "Show All
Folders". Clicking on this entry will close the drop-down list and expand the
dialog box so that the tree view displaying all available bookmark folder is
visible.

It would be inconvenient for the end user to have to search through the "Create
in" combo box and find that the desired folder is not in the list of
recently-used bookmark folders, and then have to click on the arrow button to
display the full list of available bookmark folders. Implementing this
enhancement will save time, not to mention needle mouse moving and clicking.

Also, this enhancement will eliminate the confusion over the combo box not
showing all available bookmark folders. At least one user in the Mozilla
Firebird user support forum ha expressed his confusion over this "glitch" (see
<http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=43631>), and I myself wa about
to report this a an actual bug.
