Use to holding down Ctrl key and using either +/= or -/_ to zoom in or zoop out one level. That doe not work any more, Experimenting showed that you must hold down one of the two upper key first, then press the Ctrl key quickly to zoom in or zoom out one level. Press two long and you go multiple level quickly. The Ctrl key is traditionlly first, and placed where convenient for that purpose.

Question why have a 2-key combinaton in the first place. The F11 key, for instance, is used to toggle the taskbar appearance, and that is only one key. Why not F9 to zoom in and F10 to zoom out? Easier to use that way. Want to allow F9 and F10 to remain a possible hot keys? Turn this option on and off by using the Scroll Lock key, it doesn't normally serve a purpose.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pick a web page of choice
2. Try Ctrl and +/= key to zoom in. Try Ctrl nd _/- key to zoom out.
3. Repeat step with prior version of FireFox. Not the same.
4. Note possible confustion over using shift key with Ctrl and +/= combo.
5. Single key method be better, especially for the physically challenged.
Actual Results:
You can still zoom in and zoom out, which provide useful tool in dealing with web pages. But you have complicated the process, and made it an issue of what order to press the key in and how long to hold the key combination down, and it could be made simpler instead.


Because the normal key order of zooming in and zooming out no longer work, this feature is going to appear to be completely broken or discarded. That mean one of the best feature that FireFox has, not shared by it competiitons, will no longer appear to be there to mark it a being above the crowd. Even if someone chance on finding that it sometimes works, they may not recognize that it is key order that suddenly play a crutial role in this, and just think it is an on again, off again aspect of FireFox now. That would not be a favorable impression.
