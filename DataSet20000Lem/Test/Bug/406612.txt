Finalize visual presentation of identity information (Larry)

Identity box 90%+Bold, DV display eTLD+1 with pref, string tweak

There have been several tweak floating around for Larry presentation, some minor and uncontentious, others le so, and yet there is no bug tracking these discussions. This bug tracks:

- Simplify some of the popup text. This mean eliminating or rewording the supplemental text in the SSL case, since it is wordy and confusing right now.

- Come to a decision on what to do about the url bar display on an SSL site. On non-SSL we just have the button, on EV we have "Company Name (Country)" but on SSL we had the full domain (which wa too much repetition) and then bug 402260 hid it completely, but several people (I CC'd those I could remember) are interested to know when it's coming back. We also need it to not look like another textbox.

- Address the issue with the winstripe theme (windows/linux) right now introduced by bug 395248. Dao made Larry much nicer looking in that bug, much more button-ish, instead of just being a textbox, but it had the side effect that instead of turning green a it doe on Mac, the Larry box always ha the same coloration, and just pick up a blue border highlight on EV. Whatever we do should be at least marginally consistent, within the constraint of each platform's look and feel.

I've attached a patch that doe a first pas at addressing some of these:

- Identity box text changed to 90%, Bold to set it off from normal text

- Identity popup on SSL site drop the supplemental line about "owner information may not have been verified" since it is confusing in contrast to the "Verified" language above and below.

- On EV sites, popup is more explicit about Location *and* owner being verified, and includes both in the body text to make it clear that this is a superset of DV verification.

- Identity box show eTLD+1 on SSL site by default. I recognize that this is not strictly what PKI promise (since a sub-sub-sub-domain could obtain a cert which doe not give them authority over the top level domain.) On the other hand, the domain name system, and user expectation a well, assumes that subdomains represent trust delegation, and this feel like a good compromise in term of telling user *something* about the confirmed identity of the site they are visiting, without gobbling up location-bar real-estate. The patch make this a tri-state pref ("browser.identity.ssl_domain_display"), with 0 hiding the domain entirely, 1 being eTLD+1, and 2 being full domain (the old Larry behaviour). In all cases, the info popup includes the full domain.

What's still missing is a solution to the cross-platform disparity in how EV is displayed, but I'd like to get Alex/Beltzner to chime in here from the UX side of things.

Nominating blocking because even if we do none of this, we need a final decision here before ship. I suppose maybe it could pas a just wanted-firefox3, if we think doing nothing is a reasonable approach.
