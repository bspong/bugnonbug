Gmail fails to load after a quick Signout

Whenever I log in to my Gmail account and see that I have no new mail, I usually just sign out. This process however usually occurs before everything is loaded on the page. When I do this "quick" sign out, I am always greeted with a message informing me:

"You have been signed out of this account.

This may have happened automatically because another user signed in from the same browser. To continue using this account, you will need to sign in again. This is done to protect your account and to ensure the privacy of your information"

After seeing this message, if I were to attempt to sign back into Gmail, it would be stuck at the loading screen. At this point, the only way to get into my inbox is by either clicking the "Load basic HTML" link, or restarting the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign in to a Gmail account.
2. On the loading screen, position the mouse cursor in the location where the "Sign out" link is and keep clicking in order to prevent the inbox from fully loading. (This is easier on a slower computer (I'm running a P4 2.4GHz machine with 1.5GB of RAM)) If done sucessfully, you will get a popup message with the message I posted before.
3. Try to sign in to Gmail. You should now be stuck on the loading screen.
Actual Results:
Gmail will not load. I am stuck at the loading screen.

Expected Results:
I should have been brought to my inbox.

I've also noticed that after performing the above "quick" sign out, on the same tab session, I encountered problem with my University's email which us JavaScript for the links. Links such a "javascript:main.logout()" become unusable.

In addition, I do get an error in the error console after clicking on the 'Ok' button for the popup message. See attached.
