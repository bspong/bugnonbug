Once logged into internet banking (top right corner of the page above), the icon and image do not refresh

In the page http://www.stgeorge.com.au/ there is an internet logon link. I go to
this link and log onto my account. All come up fine on the first page. But if I
try to do any banking the page refreshes BLANK. To correct this, I have to do a
right click (I use a microsoft PC mouse on my mac) and select from the dropdown
"refresh account list" in order to see the icon and images. Another way that is
a little le successful is to move the mouse around the page. If the mouse go
over where an icon or image ha disappeared, then it show up individually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. This is a little hard to give you an example, a it is in a private bank
account. And I am not going to give you those details. However, it doe
reproduce wherever there is a java enabled page, with moving or active icon
and picture
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Icons and image disappeared.

Expected Results:
Refreshed the page and shown the image and icons.

The default reproduces the same error with the default theme. The fault doe not
happen in Internet Explorer (unfortunately, a your program is superior in every
other way)
