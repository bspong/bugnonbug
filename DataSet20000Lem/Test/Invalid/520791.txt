Recently I wa going to download a winXP update. Since i manage all update manually (for safty sake). I hadn't felt a need to visit MS for a long time! When I tried to access the URL, any URL with microsoft in the address, I wa told "server not found" It seems that the same problem occurs with IE (not my Prim browser). On a much older machine same OS and FF browser access seems just fine although slow.
Since I do not visit MS anymore then I have to I can not tell when this occured but i hope you have an idea of what ha happened.
Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.using any URL with the word Microsoft in the domain name get the same reponse server not found. at the same time one system access the website OK the other receives the SNF error message
2.
3.



While I would rather be on Linux or OS X and have threatened myself to do for year there are still MS program that I would not be able to do without. Therefore i will always need access to a window OS a a quest OS. That way I would be able to continue using the MS based Progs. However at this time the Windows site access is required to upgrade some patch etc.. Unless you know of a site that access would be available, that doe not have 'Microsoft' in the URL domain name. Or if there really is a problem with Microsoft sites! Either way please let me know and I'll wait patiently. It is possible that this ha nothing to do with FF, but, you may have heard about it.
Thx Robert
