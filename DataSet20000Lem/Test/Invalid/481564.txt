Some users, like me, don't like download manager window appears every time downloading something, especially when firefox is configured not to store download history, what I get is a near-blank window!
Maybe I can devise that there should be a preference setting somewhere, some user can choose to have download manager behave a it now does, others like me may try to prevent download manager from popping a new window, instead we could have download manager some where on the status bar, a it now does.

Reproducible: Always
