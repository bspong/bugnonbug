When on a web-page that enables access to the enter key (in my case, using round-cube webmail, hitting enter open the email), you can not use enter to go to a new url using the location bar, a it just sends the request to the web-page (thereby, opening the email instead of going to the new location)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to webmail
2.enter new url
3.hit enter
Actual Results:
the javascript on the web-page intercepted the enter key click (and opened the email)

Expected Results:
to navigate to the new url

by pressing the go button, it works, but by pressing enter it go to a new url requiring you to type the url again.
