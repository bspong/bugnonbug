Sync setup dialog doesn't show an option to reset sync key

I tried to reset my Mozilla Sync key with the process described in this article:
https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox%20Sync%20is%20not%20working#w_ive-lost-my-sync-key-what-can-i-do

On the last step though there is no link to reset the key, only the warning that the key is incorrect.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On the menu bar, click on the Firefox menu, and select Preferences...
2. Click on the Sync tab.
3. Click Set up Firefox Sync and a new window will open.
4. Under I already have a Firefox Sync account, click Connect
5. Click I don't have the device with me
6. Enter your account email address and password
7. Enter some character in the Sync Key section (it doesn't matter what you enter)

Actual Results:
I see a notification that my Sync Key is wrong.
There is no new link "I have lost my Sync Key" though.

Expected Results:
You will see a notification that your Sync Key is wrong and a new link that appears - I have lost my Sync Key
