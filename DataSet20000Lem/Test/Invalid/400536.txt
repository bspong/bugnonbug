I went to my bookmark tab today and all of my bookmark are gone. I also checked organize bookmark just to be sure, and they really aren't there. On closer inspection, I realized that the bookmark that I put on the firefox toolbar were also gone. This is very important to me, not only because of the bookmark I have lost but also because of the bookmark that I may lose in the future. Please help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. Open the Bookmarks tab
3. Observe the missing bookmark
Actual Results:
I still had no bookmark

Expected Results:
It should have given me back my bookmark

There is one thing. Yesterday later on in the night I went to open FireFox, and the homepage informed me that I had successfully installed the latest version of FireFox. I didnt really look at any bookmark then, so I dont know if it wa the cause.
