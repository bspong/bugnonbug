incorrect address shown in the address bar
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/12.0.742.112 Safari/534.30

Steps to reproduce:

normal browsing - example open www.google.com enter a keyword to search. Opening the page it found.


Actual results:

the page open fine but incorrect (previous www.google.com) is shown in the address bar. When opening other link from the page they open the page but address bar still show the same old incorrect page. When pressing refresh it refresh the page content but no change in the address bar.


Expected results:

address bar should always show correct address. This wa working fine for me on version 3 but on version 4 and 5 this issue is present.
