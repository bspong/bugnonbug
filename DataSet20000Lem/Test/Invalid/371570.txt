As I read and browse news story and other websites, Firefox crash repeatedly. It doe not seem to matter which URL I'm in. More often than not, the program crash with Windows asking if I want to report an error or not. Either way, Firefox close and the session ends. It asks if I want to resume the session and whether I resume the session or not, the program continues to crash repeatedly. Definitely not an improvement over the previous version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. All I need to do is browse the news. When I begin to read a story, it crash not long after.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Windows display a message indicating a fatal error ha occurred and asks if I wish to send a report or not.

Expected Results:
Firefox close down and I must restart the program to try to browse again.

The software should work without displaying error message or shutting down. If I am browsing and reading, I do not want interruptions. So far, the program doe not distinguish between one URL or another when it display the error message and shuts down.
