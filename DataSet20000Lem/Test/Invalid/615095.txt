Javascript event change URL of the page unexpectedly

Page change unexpectedly when using web application with Javascript event handling/AJAX. An example: I'm on Mozilla frontpage. In the same tab, I open osm.org by entering the url manually. I search for a location, then do zooming/dragging/clicking on the map. After a while, randomly with some of those clicks, page is changed back to Mozilla frontpage.
That Mozilla frontpage is opened a a new page history item, i.e. after the page change, I can go back to the osm.org page by clicking BACK-button.

(If this would have been produced by some kind of Mouse gesture "back"-functionality, OSM.org would be available with "Forward"-button.)

This happens also on, for example, Bugzilla search form. When selecting item from the multiple selection list (Product, version, ...) by clicking, the page url will some time change to a url which wa earlier open in the browser.




Reproducible: Sometimes
