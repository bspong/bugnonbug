Recent version of Firefox won't print secure page to PDF
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

For years, I've been printing to PDF from secured Web page (e.g., bank statements, boarding passes) with Firefox. After some recent Firefox update, secured Web page stopped printing to PDF from Firefox, although (1) unsecured page print from Firefox to PDF, (2) secured page print from Firefox to my printer, and (3) secured page print to PDF from IE. I have several PDF print drivers, and all of them fail to print secured Web page from Firefox to PDF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a secured Web page with Firefox
2.Click Print and select a PDF print driver
3.Curse and stamp your foot


Expected Results:
Either nothing happens, or Windows signal a print error
