[meta] Use every icon produced for Firefox 3
This is a tracking bug for making sure that all of the icon that we have produced for each platform is actually landed and appearing in all of the correct location in the user interface.

A tremendous amount of work went into producing more than 480 icon across the 4 platforms, so we need to make absolutely sure that all of the icon produced for feature in Firefox 3 are actually being used in order to give the product a high level of polish.

I'll cc the various themeing team to bug that block this tracking bug based on the relevant platforms.

I would like to manage this list myself, but please nominate related bug in the comment below, or to faaborg@mozilla.com. My apology if I file any dupes, I'm working mainly off of the icon inventory and trying to get everything covered in bug quickly.
