Firebird's Close Tab widget also serf a a drop target for links. This is
especially important when several tab are open and no space is left for the
drop target (I will soon attach a screenshot that show this problem).

Rational:
1. Dropping link on the tab bar (to open new tabs) is one of four supported
way to open a link in a new tab.
2. During this drag&drop operation, the *only* functionality of the Close Tab
widget is to provide a drop target for new tabs. It can't be used for closing
tab while a link is being dragged.
3. Using a Close Tab icon |X| a a drop target is counter-intuitive. The icon
hint for closing an object, not for spawning one.

See the OS X Trash a a good example of a widget that change it icon to
reflect a different action during a drag. When the user drag a folder or a
file, it look (and acts) a a Trash bin; when the user drag a mounted disk/CD,
it look (and acts) a an eject button.
