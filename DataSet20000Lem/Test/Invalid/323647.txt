When filling out form on web pages, we used to be able to tab through ALL the field on a form and use the keyboard for completing fields.

Now it appears that the focus skip pulldown menu when tabbing through form requiring use of the mouse to "back up" to the missed field. This is a change in the expected behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tab through form containing pulldown menus.

Actual Results:
Focus "jumps past" pulldown menus.

Expected Results:
Focus should always go to the next field in a form.
