Drag file from Konqueror file manager doesn't open the file in Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110327 Firefox/4.2a1pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110327 Firefox/4.2a1pre

when I drag a file from my file manager (Konqueror 3.5.10 in KDE 3.5.11 (Trinity)) into Firefox 4 (4.2a1pre binary tarball from mozilla.org), the mouse cursor change to a cancel icon and I can't drop the file to open it in Firefox 4. I seems that Firefox 4 doesn't accept any file at all. This happens with both 32 Bit and 64 Bit version of Firefox, with a clean profile.

In Firefox 3.x it work a expected.

My system: Ubuntu 9.10 64 Bit with KDE 3.5.11 (Trinity) desktop

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag any file from Konqueror filemanager onto Firefox
2. Mouse cursor change to cancel icon
3. Try to drop the file
Actual Results:
The file isn't opened by Firefox

Expected Results:
Firefox should accept and open the file if it can handle the type (html, txt, xpi...)
