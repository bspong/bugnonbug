I have a onresize handler on my webbpage that is supposed to reload the page so that my appet can be resized to properly fit the page.
This ha worked fine in Firefox 2 and IE from version 5 and forward. However with version 3 RC1 (this is the only version 3 I have tested) the onresze handler get called on the initial load - which will send the web page into an infinite loop.

This is very unfortunate and I regard it a bug. OnResize should not be called at any time until the page is fully loaded.

This web site demonstrates the problem:

Klick on one of the thumbnail to start a bookviewer. With older Firefox or IE - no problem. Firefox 3 = infinite loop.

This behaviour break the functionality of my web applications, i.e the bookviewer and related products.

Note, to test this you need to have the Java plugin installed a this is a java applet web page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter the site http://test.devo.se/temp_bv
2. Klick on one of the thumbnail to start a bookviewer
Actual Results:
The onresize handler get called during the page loading, and since it reloads the page - the infinite loop is started.

Expected Results:
The onresize handler should not be called until the user explicitly resizes the window.
