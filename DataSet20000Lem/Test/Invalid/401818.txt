firefox stopped working after latest security update dated Oct 30th2007
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; YPC 3.2.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

I am surprise that how can firefox even release a security update which break the browser itself. This tell me the state of the company. I am using IE to file this issue. As soon a I updated my firefox with the Oct 30 th security update, my firefox doesnt connect to any site. On the other hand IE is working fine. Also in the Error console it show "Overflowing".........


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start the browser and it is not working
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Start the browser and it is not working

Expected Results:
Browser should be working

Problems which I used to face with IE, is now creeping up in firefox and folk responsible for releasing such a security update should be held accountable. Extremely disappointed.....
