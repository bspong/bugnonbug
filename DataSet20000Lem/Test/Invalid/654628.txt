So, I have been using the feed bookmark in the Bookmarks toolbar & have some suggestions. Major issue is that when the list of feed item in the drop down is longer than the page, it scrolls. This is great, but the last two option "Open ____" & "Open all in Tabs" get hidden at the bottom of the list. It would be great if they always stayed visible & the feed item scrolled between the bottom 2 item (which would always be visible, and the top.

The second thing I think would be helpful, is if the original icon could somehow be preserved & a Feed icon placed over top, or in the corner of the feed logo. I switched a lot of my bookmark over to feed bookmarks, but often just like going to the site, being able to find the icon quickly (by the favicon) & being to jump into the site quickly are a priority.

Third Suggestion. The feed only update so often. Its too slow for quickly changing content. Would it be possible to specify how often they are updated, or even better, if it ha not been updated when one us the drop down (by hovering over, or even clicking the feed (to produce the drop down) Perhaps it could produce and event to re-check the feed, to see new items. I know it might be a bit of a nightmare in term of what it doe to a feed already loaded, but I could certainly live with item moving around some if it wa going to provide me with up to date information.
