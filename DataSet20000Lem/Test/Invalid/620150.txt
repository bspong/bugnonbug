When submitting invalid form page jump to the first invalid input so that it is on the top of the window. However often there is label above the input or application menu with position:fixed and user may be confused what happened.
There should be some space left above the invalid input regardless the page behaviour (jumping or scrolling (bug 600154) to the invalid input)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open the URL, scroll down to find the submit button and click it
