If my download window is open (or even if another browser window is open) , and I click on the close button, it warns me about closing multiple tabs, rather than asking if I want to save the tabs. If I quit anyway, the tab are lost.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox, go to Options, go to "When Firefox starts:" and select "Open tab and window from last session"
2. Open multiple tab on the Firefox window.
3. Make a new window, and open multiple tab on that too.
4. Attempt to close one of the windows.

Actual Results:
I get warned about closing multiple tabs, and if I proceed to close the window, all tab are lost.

Expected Results:
It should have quit without questioning the multiple tabs, and when opened again, it should have brought back up the tab I had open at the time.
