Steps to reproduce:

I am trying to find a player that will work on all browser on Mac and Windows. Tried this one out on my website at test page: 'Wilde' http://www.derekwilliams.net/portfolio/theatre/index-test.asp to replace the DewPlayer which doesn't work on IE 64 bit.


Actual results:

the play button did not commence playback in either Windows 7 or Mac Lion 10.7.2, a it doe in Safari and IE on both Mac and Windows OS


Expected results:

It should have commenced playback
