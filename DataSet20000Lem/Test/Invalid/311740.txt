When starting up Firefox, it often fails to call up the (any) URL, even my home page which is that of my ISP. It sometimes take three attempt to raise the URL. The Firefox screen remains blank and no URL is displayed in the address window.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I've pretty much described the problem in the summary.
It doesn't seem to make any difference whether I've clicked on the URL from
within an email message or have called up Firefox from the desktop, both
method often fail to call up the URL. I never had this problem when I wa
using Win98SE, only since I upgraded to WinXP about a month or so ago.
I have tried removing Firefox from my PC and re-installing it but the problem
persists. At least I do manage to get connected to the URL after a couple of
tries. Sometimes all is well first try !!!!!


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Close Firefox
2. Restart Firefox
3.If selecting URL from within an email, close Firefox and try clicking on the
URL again.

Actual Results:
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.


Expected Results:
Connected me to my ISP's Home Page which is the one I use a my home page.
Or, in the case of a URL selected within an email, connected me to that
URL.
