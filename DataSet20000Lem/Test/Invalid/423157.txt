crash with old version of google gear [@ gears.dll@0xf00fb]
look like google gear is consistently crashing on firefox 3 beta 4.

It's only ranked #75, but if more people start using gear it could ramp fast.

incompatability problem with fx3?

not much to go on in any of the stack trace

could be a case of user overriding compat check a in bug 422018
