When I put any search into google, the link I am given sometimes redirect to strange sites; sometimes it redirects me to the ebay or myspace homepage, which are unrelated to what I am looking for; sometimes it give me a link to what claim to be a downloadable .exe file named a what I searched for (i.e. If I searched for "buy cheap cd's", the file will claim to be called "buy cheap cd's.exe"). More recently, it ha redirected to a warning that Firefox must be updated, and instantly start updating files.
Internet Explorer is not having this trouble, so I don't see how it could be my computer, and various anti-virus scan show nothing. Turning on the option to block redirections didn't stop it, and I tried a clean re-install of firefox, again nothing changed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.google.co.uk
2.search for something... I'm trying "rare cd's"
3.click on a link, and sometimes it redirects to an unrelated site.
4.it isn't just unknown sites, I have had it with well known site link too.
Actual Results:
A good few link worked okay, but then one redirected instantly to this screen; http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g212/03crichardson/untitled.jpg I obviously didn't try the link, I clicked Back, but this wouldn't work, I wa constantly bounced back to this screen. I had to use the arrow next to the back button to go back a few page to my original search.

Expected Results:
I would expect the link to load properly, and not redirect me to nasty, assumably virus-ridden sites.

Default theme, no add-on (with clean re-install)
