Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any page with links, for example https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
2. Ctrl+click "Get help" link

Actual Results:
Tab open in a background and link loses the outline


Expected Results:
Link shouldn't lose the outline after opening the new tab


After opening the link if you press enter the page from the link will open, also when you press tab next element will have focus - so it seems after clicking the link it still have focus but it's not outline.

If straight after step 2 from STR you will press tab and then repeat the STR the link will be focused
