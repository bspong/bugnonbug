Look at this page:
http://www.motogp.com/en/motogp/index.htm
With FF 1.5b1 you cannot see anything except for the header, the flash animation
and the "Ads by google" box.
With FF 1.0.7 the whole page is rendered properly and you can navigate in the
site .
Maybe there is an error the page source code and the new version of Gecko suffer
of this error.
The error seems in the CSS (or in the FireFox CSS interpretation)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open http://www.motogp.com


Actual Results:
The page is not rendered properly
