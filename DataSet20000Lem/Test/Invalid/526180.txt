I have had a problem with a couple of site since installing firefox 3.5.4. Currently I am unable to log in to my bank website (http://www.smile.co.uk). After I enter my logon detail I get an error page which say that cooky may have been disabled in my browser. I have certainly not done anything to disable them, in fact I don't even know how to. Currently I'm having to do my banking using a different browser. I have also seen a similar error when trying to log in to ebay.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.smile.co.uk
2. Enter log on detail
3.
Actual Results:
I got the timeout error page from smile

Expected Results:
Should take me to the next page which asks for my pin number
