I hate to say this but firefox is getting bloated.
While we are fighting the good fight we often lose track of whats important.
My definition of firefox is to be fast.
All I want is the ability to disable every new feature that anyone adds.
I remember firefox 1.0 being extremely fast.
Firefox 1.5 wa slower.
Firefox 2.0 wa even slower.
Thank You.
