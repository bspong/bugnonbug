Firefox crash on any version of firefox and flash I install
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.106 Safari/535.2

Steps to reproduce:

I wasn't sure, it wa working fine. I'm not sure if it because I updated Mcafee, flash, placed an add-on or what.


Actual results:

When I started using firefox again it keep on crashing and at time opening new firefox window and tab on it with funny character at times. So i went to mozilla and updated my old version into a new one, i also updated the flash. Still, it keep on crashing on whatever version i install both on firefox and flash. I also removed the add-ons.
