2. Detach one tab from a window and while dragging hit F11 to have the other window fullscreen (without releasing the tab)
3. Close Fullscreen mode with F11 and drop the tab to the destination window

Expected result:
In step 3 tab animation should be visible in the tab strip of the destination window

Actual result:
In step 3 the tab is behind the destination window

*Notes:
-> This bug is a regression from the behavior before the landing of the bug 455694 (implementation of the feature Tab Animation)
-> This is Windows only bug. The issue is not reproducible on Mac or Linux
-> This issue would depends on the fix suggested in bug 689575 (disable keyboard shortcut while tab animation is active)
-> Attaching a screen shot of the issue
