'Sort by name' produce unexpected behavior on tag container
Make sure you have tag and follow these instructions, do NOT go to the place library, it seems to work o.k there

1. Go to bookmark toolbar
2. Click on Smart Bookmarks
3. Click Recent Tags
4. Right click on a tag category
5. Click sort by name
6. A tag disappears
7. Other thing seem to happen, like sometimes it us the page title to display the name, other time it doesn't

Not sure this can be fixed till bug 419731 is though
