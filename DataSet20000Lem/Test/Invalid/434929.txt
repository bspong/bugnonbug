When a new window is opened from a link (either by shift-clicking, middle-clicking [when browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick = false], or selecting "Open link in new window" from the contextual menu) and another link is subsequently linked in that window, the history list is not properly populated with the first page. Only the first page is missing - all subsequent click show up in the history just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On any web page with links, open a new page from one of those link (e.g. shift-click or select "Open link in new window" from the contextual menu).
2. On the new page, click any link.
3. Note that the back button is disabled!
4. On subsequent clicks, the back button will enable but the history list will only contain those subsequent page - the very first page is missing.
Actual Results:
See #3 and #4, above.

Expected Results:
The back button should be enabled, and the history list populated, upon the very first click.

This doe not happen on manually opened new window (e.g. cntl-N or File->New Window), nor doe it happen when opening a new *tab* from a link (alt-click, middle-click [when browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick = true], or selecting "Open Link in New Tab" from the contextual menu). It only occurs when opening a new _window_ from a link.

I have verified this bug on Mac, Windows, and Linux on all Firefox version from 2.0.0.9 up to and including 2.0.0.14.
