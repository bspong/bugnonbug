I have tried several nightly build over the last couplke of days. They all have
the same problem. This problem only affect Dear Park alpha 1 and not Firefox 1.0.4

It is not possible to use the "Report Broken Website" from the help menu because
the "Website URL" section doe not allow typing and only pick up the site that
currently is displayed in the active window. Since the rpmseek.com website
crash Dearpark this function is useless.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to www.rpmseek.com from dear park alpha 1
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Dear park crash and exit (Therefore it is not possible to use the "report
broken website) feature.
