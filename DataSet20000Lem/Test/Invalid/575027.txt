There are a few thing missing in Minefield's main menu, which wa available in the old menu bar UI. Firstly, the new Minefield menu should contain the option to allow the user to check for updates; an "About Minefield" option should also be included, which allows the user to check which build of Minefield they have. The "Minefield" menu also contains a "New Window" option, but it should also have a "New tab", and "Enter Private Browsing" option to make it even more accessible to users. A "View Downloads" option should also be available in the Minefield menu. In the customization section of the Minefield menu, the user doe not have the option to remove the status bar, which is an option that the user might want to customize.

Reproducible: Always
