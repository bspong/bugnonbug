Backgrounds which are made fixed are not being rendered a fixed. The background is moving with the text, instead of not moving.

I created my website so that the background is fixed.
The text on my website is supposed to flow over a fixed background.
Firefox is not rendering my website the way they were created to be rendered.
Internet Explorer render my website correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Very very simple.
Go to http://www.saintlymic.com/
Now, scroll down and you will see that Firefox is not rendering my background a fixed, so that the text scroll over my fixed background.
Actual Results:
The background is not being rendered properly, and the text seems to move with the background.
I created my website to have a fixed background, but Firefox doe not render them correctly.

Expected Results:
I expect Firefox to render my web page correctly, just a Internet Explorer render my web page correctly.
I would like to see the text on my site to flow smoothly over my fixed background.

Is there a reason why Firefox ha been programmed to not allow text to flow over a fixed background?
If there is, then please explain to me why Firefox doe not render fixed background a fixed backgrounds.
Could it be because no one ha brought this to your attention before now?
Firefox is my favorite browser, and I use Firefox almost exclusively!
If it is possible, please fix this problem and allow website created with fixed background to render a fixed background in Firefox.
Thank you very much!
