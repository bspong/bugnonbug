The binding and CSS change implemented to fix bug #349079 break many existing theme (and possibly extension with toolbars.) I don't wish to sound too critical but the method used seems like an inelegant way to solve what appears to be an text alignment problem with the menu toolbarbuttons. I say "appears" since bug #349079 look like it wa hastily written and rush through the system.

Reproducible: Always
