pc randomly reboots, whether firefox run or not... stop when firefox uninstalled!
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Latest build on website

The pc wa randomly rebooting when firefox wa running, sometimes every 5-10
minutes, and also AT THE LOGON PROMPT! Nothing ever showed in the event log,
and no error came up. Just a sudden reboot. happened during use AND if left
alone.

I tried everything I could think of to troubleshoot and eventually someone non-
technical pinpointed it by uninstalling firefox. No more reboots.

Windows is xp sp1 + all latest updates. Think it wa an incompatability with
the build of image EDS use on their pc in work.

Thought it might be of some interest to you, I;ve never seen this before with
a browser. Firefox work perfectly on my home pc.

Reproducible: Always

1.use pc,

It's only happened this time on this build so obviously it's not wide-user
critical, but it may be of use to you.
