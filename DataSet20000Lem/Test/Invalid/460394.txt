when I try to download an application from facebook, the "Zwinky" it added a toolbar that i wa able to remove or close but it still have "My Web Search" on the tool section on the toolbars. It seems to me that like a trojan, it's annoying! It did not want to be deleted nor remove from the program files, the add/remove program and in the registry it spread all over the place with other files.
