I've been unable to download a file successfully with a filename of over 255 characters. The file name size I wa trying to assign to it wa 272 character long. This wa easily fixed by just cutting the text down to about 200 character max.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set a long filename of over 255 character
2. Try to download
Actual Results:
File asks to be saved, but will just vanish a if it never happened.

Expected Results:
Downloaded file with a shortened filename to support OS restriction on filename length limits. (Taking into consideration the file type ext a well)

Works in IE quite fine.
