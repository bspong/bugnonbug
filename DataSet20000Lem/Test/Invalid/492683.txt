I have 2 gig of memory. Firefox seems to take up almost all system memory. When I close Firefox, the memory is released. This ha only been happening since I upgraded to the newest version of Firefox. I have 33 tab open. It doe not happen immediately, but after a little time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox with 33 tab
2.Watch system memory over time
3.After some time, system memory go very low.
Actual Results:
memory go from 1,300,000k to 83,000k

Expected Results:
Should not occupy so much memory.

I really like Firefox. I use to use Internet Explorer. If this problem isn't fixed soon, I will have to switch back.
