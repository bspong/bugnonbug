WebConsole: Remove HUDService.lastFinishedRequestCallback
This is a followup bug for https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=573103#c52.

For testing the network logging code an `lastFinishedRequestCallback` property wa introduced on the HUDService object. This is used only for unit test and is ugly. Remove this and provide a nicer way for unit test to get the last finished httpActivity object.
