When returning to a previous site, my history will sometimes disappear but will return next time I look after I enter the full address by hand or by pulling up my bookmarks.

I go to the address bar and start to type, such a "moz". Normally, that return www.mozilla.com and some site like it I've been to.

But sometimes, there is absolutely nothing there to help me auto-complete and no history at all. The drop-down list will be empty.

If I go to my bookmarks, I can choose a site from there fine. If I do that, when i look once again at the address bar, all my history will have mysteriously returned!

This happens regularly throughout the day. I really hate it!
