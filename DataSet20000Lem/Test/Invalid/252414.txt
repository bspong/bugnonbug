delay page display when AAAA record not available.

The domain take age to resolve. I think this is because their DNS server doe
not respond properly to AAAA (IPv6) request and thus the request have to
timeout before Firefox display the page a retrieved via IPv4. For e.g.
www.yahoo.com, the AAAA request immediately return a negative response and thus
firefox can display the page with IPv4 almost immediately.

The problem is that many domain don't handle AAAA properly and thus quite a few
page take age to load in firefox, which first query IPv4 then IPv6 and only
then display the page.

Couldn't it be made to use IPv4 if available for now? IPv6 isn't really
production yet. Or maybe the timeout can be decreased from 25 second to
something like 4 or less.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fire up a packet sniffer for port 53 tcp/udp
2. Visit www.allmusic.com in firefox
Actual Results:
25 second load time.

Expected Results:
load immediately when the IPv4 A request returns.
