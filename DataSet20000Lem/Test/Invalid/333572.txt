Allow the Location bar to be implicit/complete the hidden navigation bar layout.

I would appreciate it if it wa posible to set the urlbar/box to automatically become active if I begin typing instead of having to first bring the url entry text field into focus. I already know that I want to go to a given web address before I have even brought the url entry field into focus and it is something I think that the web browser itself should be able to determine without me doing something that is almost entirely redundant like typing alt+D or ctrl+L when there are no other text field in focus in the webpage or in the browser such a the search bar and the find bar.

I have also noticed that currently it is not possible to to use the alt+enter shortcut to force a url to open in a new tab if one hide the navigation toolbar. It make no sense to force the user to use the mouse to select open in a new tab from a drop down box or to have them open the tab first when alt+enter already provides an appropriate way to handle this. It also doe not seem to be possible to set this and other keybindings by default from the GUI.

The status bar should also have the ability to only show itself when a page is loading without the need for an extension like autohide-statusbar. Leaving the status bar active at all time is not really desireable given that I can view more of a web page without scrolling with the bar hidden most of the time.

I also think that it would be a good idea to have ctrl+c automatically copy a url to the clipboard if no other text is selected; in conjunction with ctrl+v automatically summoning the urlbar with the pasted content of the clipboard already filled in, or simply filling in the urlbar with the copied text if no other text field is active. It would also be nice to have a paste and go feature out of the box. I am aware of hack and extension that do this but it would still be nice to not need an extension or hack for something like that.

Reproducible: Always
