This is happening in the new Places Organizer.. I'm not sure exactly how to tell about it, but in the new back/forward navigation, the "Showing..." text doesn't change, it'll just stay a last visited.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. navigate to a 'places' folder in the 'organizer'
2. navigate again
3. click 'back'

Actual Results:
When clicking back, the "Showing" title doesn't change.

Expected Results:
"Showing" title should change
