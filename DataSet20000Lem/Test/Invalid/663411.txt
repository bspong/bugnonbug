The olivesoftware active daily paper doesn't work on firefox 4.0.1 [caused by NSPluginWrapper]

When I upgraded from fedora 14 to fedora 15, I got firefox 4.0.1 instead of the old firefox 3.6.something on fedora 14. The online edition of the Palm Beach Post which us olivesoftware's Active Daily Paper, which us flash, is no longer viewable in firefox 4.0.1. The URL provided above is to demo on the olivesoftware site which also do not work. I subspect the new lazy frame code, but that's just a guess. Anyway, the left side of the screen is OK, but the right side where the newspaper content is supposed to appear never works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.see above
2.
3.

Actual Results:
just empty gray space on left side of screen which can be more interesting if you refresh the screen in various way (apparently turning into total garbage noise at times), but nothing it show ever look like newspaper content.

Expected Results:
Newspaper image on right side of screen.

The exact same 64 bit flash plugin that worked on firefox 3.6 also work in forefox 4.0.1 for every other flash page I try except the olivesoftware active daily paper pages.
