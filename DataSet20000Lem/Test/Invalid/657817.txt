Until FF 4.0 the Back Button worked fine. Now with FF 4.0+ Left Clicking the Back Button slowly, ie: depress mouse button for ~>2-300ms and a History List is displayed. Previously this didn't occur and the release of the mouse button resulted in Back Button execution. For a slow click, now 2 additional click are required to go Back. This seems to be BAD UI design.
1. Why dictate the click speed necessary for a user? When previously the click release wa what executed the Back function and the click time could be many seconds.
2. The History List is displayed by Right Clicking the Back Button, having the same function for a slow left click is redundant.

The previous design allows "pre-selection" the left mouse button can be depressed to pre-select the Back function and then when the user is ready the button can be released to go Back. ==Good Design!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Happens with FF 4.0
Happens with FF 4.0.1
Happens with a new profile.
2. FF previous to 4.0 wa fine ==> 6 years?
3.

Actual Results:
1. To go back to a previous web page left click slow (try depressing Left mouse button using various time 200-500ms), see History List, click again to get rid of list, click for the 3rd time to go Back. See how quickly mouse button must be clicked to go Back.
