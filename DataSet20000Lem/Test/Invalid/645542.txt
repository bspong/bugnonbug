This just started today, 3/27...

Whenever I exit from Firefox, the next time I go in on start up I am returned to the last page from my previous session. Yes, I have my option set to go to my homepage (I have had this setting in place for a few year now), yes I tried it again "just in case" and no, it's still not working. This is getting really annoying and I'm not the only one because if you google this issue, you find several other people who have reported it. Any plan to get this fixed any time soon?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. End Firefox
2. Start it up again
3. Get pissed off
Actual Results:
See step 3.

Expected Results:
That I would be sent to my specified home page on start up, like I have been for oh say the past 5 years...
