New window XP style menu in default theme are ugly in Win2k

The style of the application menu in the default theme ha been changed from the standard Win32 3D style in 1.0.7, to a more 'modern' window XP flat style in 1.5. On XP this look fine because of the various shadow/shading option provided by the OS. In Win2k there is no shadow under the menu and they do not stand out from the rest of the UI and window content. This look a bit rubbish and is potentially confusing.

Is it possible to use the appropriate style for the operating system? Or alternatively to provide the old version of the theme for download.

(I am sure that Windows-style menu are not used on the mac and unix versions...)
