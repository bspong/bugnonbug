Using Margin-left with javascript to emulate an iFrame may cause a repaint error

When I use overflow-y: hidden; in one div and then scroll that div with javascript the div to the left with a vertical (y axis) scrollbar 'scrapes' across the screen due to the margin-left of the other div being adjusted. I have attached screenshots to help clarify this bug. FF 1.07 did not have this issue and I don't believe that the RC build did, but I don't have them to confirm this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up page with this HTML/JavaScript in it
2.Scroll the pane on the right to the left or right and the div on the left doe not repaint correctly


Actual Results:
Repainting doe not take place correctly. Triggering a hover event with another snippet of script repaints the div correctly

Expected Results:
No 'scraping' of the scrollbar should take place and repainting should happen by default.

This code is very DOM intensive, but the repainting seems to be the issue, not the DOM scripting. Please contact me (randy.peterman@altn.com) for specific code a it is code for a private application that cannot be shared a of yet.
