when i open the java plug-in application, there is a list of browser to make it
the default java application. the list includes internet explorer, netscape 6,
and mozilla 1. when i select mozilla and/or netscape, i get an error message.
i am setup a administrator, so that should not be a problem. any help would
greatly appreciated.
