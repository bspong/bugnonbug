align big permission icon more to the group of title+select widget than to just the title in the Permissions Manager (about:permissions)
Created attachment 534057
quick mock up

I think it would look better if the big icon for each of the permission were aligned to the group of title and select widget rather than just to the title. The mock-up attached might not be ideal, but I think it look a bit better and help signal that the select widget and the title are one grouping.
