Sort out menu behavior for menuless window in cocoa build
Mac menubar, always painful.

Here's the current state for XP-menuless window in cocoa builds:

1. In window which are overlaid by macBrowserOvelay (e.g. the download manager), the menu work the same a in carbon builds.
2. In window which are not overlaid, we're failing back to the menubar of the hidden window, this is a significant improvement over the carbon-widget situation (the menu of the last-window-with-menus are shown, and do not work at all).
3. Since the "Close", "Minimize" and "Zoom" command are disabled in the hidden window (for obvious reasons), they're also disabled in menuless windows.

What i think we should do is:
1. Get rid of the various overlay which apply macBrowserOverlay to menuless window
2. Enable the Close, Minimize and Zoom commands.
3. Make them work against the active window using nsIWindowWatcher (Though zooming the hidden window is probably useful ;)).
4. Figure out whether we can disable them for the hidden window only, low priority for now.

CCing bsmedberg who wa IIRC planning to fix the behavior of menuless window in a different way (global overlay or such).
