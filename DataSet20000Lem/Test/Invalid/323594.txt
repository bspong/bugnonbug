Firefox's "config.trim_on_minimize" option (to make FF release unused RAM) work great---when you individually minimize all Firefox windows. But it doesn't work when you use Windows's "minimize all" shortcut (Windows key + M). It would be nice if it did, esp. considering FF's alarming RAM-consumption these days...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Windows Task Manager and note FF's RAM usage.
2.Press "minimize all" shortcut (Windows key + M)
3.Restore Task Manager and see FF's RAM usage unchanged.

Actual Results:
(as stated)

Expected Results:
Release lot of RAM. (For example, I just minimized FF's window separately and FF dropped from 85MB to 15MB.)
