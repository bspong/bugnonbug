bookmarks: drag and drop service doesn't keep track of action consistently
Turns out, we can't rely on the drag service to keep track of the action
specified (LINK/COPY/MOVE) and do sane thing with it. This is the underlying
cause of a bunch of bug -- we're expecting that a MOVE implies that we're to
remove the old element, which we can only do for bookmark in this case.

The solution here is to ignore LINK/COPY/MOVE unless the drag source is a
bookmark (because we set it correctly and it get through the OS munging
correctly), and assume everything else is a copy.
