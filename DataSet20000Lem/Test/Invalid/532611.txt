I tried to install "Adobe Reader", but when i click on Download link, Firefox froze, i got the Adobe installation pop-with with the error message. I can't use Firefox after that i have to kill the process.
I didn't had that problem with stable version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the page http://get.adobe.com/fr/reader/ (i didn't try the english version of the site)
2.Click on "Télécharger"
3.A pop-up "Adobe Download Manager" will appear with "Installation de Adobe Download Manager"
Actual Results:
Installation failed with a message :
getPlus+(R): Error
Installation is corrupt! (16249.202.235 - 42072312.80040154.FFFFFFFF.80040154)

Expected Results:
Adobe DLM installation finished successful and ask for reboot Firefox.
After the reboot the installation of Adobe software will begin with Adobe DLM.

I'm using Dark Fox theme. And when i used Firefox 3.5.5, i had no problem with Adobe DLM.
