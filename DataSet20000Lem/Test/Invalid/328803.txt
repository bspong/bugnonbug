In my preference I have it set to print background color and images, however on this particular site it fails to print the site a it apepars on the screen, in fact there is no color used at all, Aparenly the style and color and bground color of the table is applied in a CSS Style Sheet, and if I were to disbale the CSS Style Sheet then how it look on the screen, like blab that's how it prints.

Would it be possible so that when we printed website it applies the CSS Styles if we have out printer option set to print background color and images.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Print Prview or Print (with the Page Options (Print Background (color & iamges) Selected)
2. Go to the printer, and notice that the big expensive color laserjet printer failed to render any form of color
3.

Actual Results:
It print like CRAP, difficult to read beacuse the newatness and colorfulness of the style sheet is not applied while printing.

Expected Results:
It should print exactly how it look on my screen while i'm browsing the website.

P.S. Aparenly I wa only able to print this website via Adobe's Go Live, because attempting to print via IE and FrontPage both failed to produce the result of how it appears on the screen.
