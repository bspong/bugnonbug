Some link do not work (not recognized a anchors)
When reading the linked document I noticed that the cursor failed to change into hand shape when I moused over the 'Britney Spears' medical records' link. That is wa an actual link wa indicated by the light blue colour and subsequently made clear by viewing the source (the link text is: <a http="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23640143">Britney Spears' medical records</a>). Right-clicking over the link show the context menu for unlinked text, middle-mouse-clicking doe not work a expected (link wa not opened, instead I get autoscroll a for unlinked content). When clicking on the link the colour change to lighter blue - something is happening. Nothing useful though...
