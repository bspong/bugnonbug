Expected Results:
Copy to clipboard to work . It work in IE7. It asks me whether to allow access to my clipboard because of my security settings.

As far a I can say, a a rant, IE7 is not a bad a it is made out to be.There are people like browsehappy.com that say IE is unsafe, but so are all the other browsers. IE just get more publicity because it is made by Microsoft. Here is how IE7 is more usable for me than Firefox, though slower.

a) It doesnt force me to choose a file in file upload box. I can copy paste the path from window explorer.
b) Single click on address bar and then a text selection mouse move selects part of the text which is what I want, and Firefox think I am going to drag n drop the whole address somewhere else.
c) I dont like the default enabled setting of all downloads go to my downloads folder. I have changed the settings, but I dont like the software assuming where to download thing because in my single open browser session kept open all throught he day, several downloads need to go to several different folders.
d) IE 7 display ALT in image a tooltip. Firefox say wontfix because of standards. I dont care about standards. I want browser to be usable for me. I write art blog posts, and I view art material in site where the webmaster ha specified ALT tag but no TITLE tag for images. I need to know what the painting is about through a tooltip in addition to the image itself.
