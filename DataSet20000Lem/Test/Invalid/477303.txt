You advertise that Star Down Loader is compatible, but it is not. You downloaded it to my Firefox (which I love), but then gave the message "incompatible with this version of Firefox."

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Firefox incompatible with Star Down Loader.

Expected Results:
Compatibility.


I have used Star Down Loader for many years, a I believe it is the best, and by far the fastest (4 time normal download speed) download manager. I usually download large file from slower web sites, so speed is of great importance.

Evidently, you felt the same when you took step to make Star Down Loader compatible with earlier version of Firefox. I hope you have a fix for this problem.

Many thanks.
