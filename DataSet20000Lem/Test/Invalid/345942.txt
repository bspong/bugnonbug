I am browsing for an internal site of my office. To login to that, one window will pop-up and I need to provide my ID and Password. Then I will be forwarded to that site. But with Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.1 version, I am not getting this window to login and not able to access the site. Instead, I am getting one download window.

It is working well with 1.0.2 version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse for a site which will pop-up a window to login to the site.
2.Download window will appear instead of Login window.
3.Click on OK or Cancel is doing nothing.
Actual Results:
Click OK ----> Downloading something to desktop, nothing is found on desktop
Click Cancel ----> Doing nothing.

Expected Results:
This download window should not open. Only Login window should open.
