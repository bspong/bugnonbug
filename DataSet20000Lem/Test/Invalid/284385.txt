mailto link FORCE use of Outlook

There is no way to change the pop3 mail client when using Firefox. Since Firefox
ha no built-in mail, it force the use of MS Outlook, and WinXP doesn't allow
non-MS mail program to be "default". I use Agent for mail and news, and
therefore, when I click on a mailto link on a web page I get an error message
from Firefox telling me I need to configure Outlook, which I refuse to do.
Netscape allows me to use a built in mail client to send a message from a link.
Do I need to go back to Netscape a my default (only) browser?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on ANY mailto link
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Error message from Firefox telling me to configure Outlook

Expected Results:
It should have popped up a box to allow me to send an e-mail message, or spawned
Agent (or some other mail client)
