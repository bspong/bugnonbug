I searched for "getting away with murder lyrics" and the #1 result wa
http://www.dapslyrics.com/display.php?sid=7426.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Please have the latest mcafee or another virus scanner installed.
2. Visit http://www.dapslyrics.com/display.php?sid=7426
3.

Actual Results:
Mcafee notified me that a trojan wa detected and cleaned. I wa highly skeptic
that it wa firefox so I tested on a clean window xp vmware installation with
the latest firefox 1.0pr and 0.10.1 security patch and wa able to duplicate it.
I don't know if this actually exploited anything or not. It could be mcafee
just telling me an old javascript exploit wa in my cache. I thought about this
before reporting this possible bug and then I thought I might a well give
someone a head up.
