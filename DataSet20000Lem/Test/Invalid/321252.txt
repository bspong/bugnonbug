When many instances(4-5 windows) of Firefox are opened with 2 download process,the memeory usage is app. 80 mb on RAM and 80 MB on page..but on closing the browser and reducing the number to one window and no download also the memory on RAM still continues at peak 60 MB and 65 MB for the page...the problem is that the memory is not getting cleaned up in my case...
