There are some rare instance in which Firefox 2.0 for Mac will not render some url link on some pages. Two website that have exhibited this behaviour are theregister.co.uk and google.com. Looking at the HTML, it's impossible to identify under what condition this bug manifest itself, since there's no visible difference in the <a href> tags. I don't know how to attach a screenshot to this bug report. Please view the following URL in both Firefox and Safari:

http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=wmp+plugin+mac&btnG=Search

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=wmp+plugin+mac&btnG=Search (example URL)

Actual Results:
The URL link for the first two search result are completely missing, including the underlined link and the text of the link itself.

Expected Results:
Both link should be visible and enabled.
