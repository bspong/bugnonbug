When visiting a sport forum for which I am a member, when I click on a forum thread link, it go directly there. When I attempt to go back to the topic list with the back button, it appears nothing happens. After this happening several times, I look at the history summary under the back button and the entry I want to navigate back to being several entry down the list. The entry (current) page I navigated to will occupy the position in the list between. There will be anywhere from 2 - 5 entry in the history (back button) list.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Doesn't happen every time but a I went to reproduce the navigation bar disappeared and I can't get it back on that page
