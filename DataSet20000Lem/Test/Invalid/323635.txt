Closing last window of FireFox1.5 go undetected by HistoryKill, and so HistoryKill option called "Auto-Kill on Last Browser Window Close" dont work no more, boo hoo!

Previous version of FireFox triggered "Auto-Kill on Last Browser Window Close" in HK just fine. Also, closing the last Internet Explorer window still trigger Auto-Kill in HistoryKill.

I have tried HistoryKill 2002 and HistoryKill 2005. both bersions of HK performed auto-kill with earlier version of FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install firefox 1.5 on XP Pro SP2 installation that ha not had FireFox on it before, or contains no trace of a previous version of FF installation.

2.check that "Auto-Kill on Last Browser Window Close" is selected in HistoryKill Auto-Kill/Boss-Key tab

3.open FireFox

4.close FireFox

Actual Results:
Auto-Kill did not happen

Expected Results:
Auto-Kill should have initiated

closing Thunderbird or Internet Explorer still trigger historykill auto-kill.
