At beginning I found my firefox3(rc1 to last version) often crashed,but I could not find the way to reproduce it.
Now I have found this way:
open 6 http gmail tab and close them after "inbox" ok,
repeat several time then crash

To avoid addons's reason,I have create a blank new profile and try it,the result is also crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login gmail
2.open 5 or more http gmail tab
3.after they already go to the inbox ok
4.close them one by one
5.if not crash,do this again.for a maximum time of 3,it will crash.
Actual Results:
crash

Expected Results:
no crash
