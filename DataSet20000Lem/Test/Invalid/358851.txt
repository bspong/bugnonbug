User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier:

Attempted uninstall of Firefox 1.5.0.7 by Control Panel>Add/Remove Programs. System locked up, rebooted into safe mode and attempted again. Add/Remove program box became corrupted, but system did not crash. Was able to reboot safely and again, attempted in user profile to uninstall program with no luck.
After several attempts, both in safe mode and normal user mode, decided to reboot into safe mode and simply delete folder. Will append bug if any more issue come up.
Reason for uninstall wa to simply move Firefox to a new partition.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Add/Remove program
2.Attempt to remove Firefox
3.Rinse and repeat

Actual Results:
Add/Remove dialouge box become frozen and non-responsive.

Expected Results:
That Firefox would be removed from the system save for some small resident files.

I cannot say for certain if this is a Microsoft issue of a Firefox issue, but again, will append this bug report a more information on this matter is discovered.
