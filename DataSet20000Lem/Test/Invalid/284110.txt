Delayed/Weird caret blinking in any searchbar/addressbar
Steps to reproduce:
1) Tools->Options->Downloads->'View and Edit Actions'
2) Select an action then point and click in the search area
3) Caret delayed in appearing and at first blink rapidly then slows down

Weird blinking doesn't occur everytime so do step 1-3 a few time on different
actions. The delayed caret happens everytime.
