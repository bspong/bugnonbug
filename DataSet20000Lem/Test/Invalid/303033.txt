When searching for [Mi mamá], without brackets, using the toolbar search it
work correctly for Google but not for AltaVista. When the Google search
result come up Google show the same hit it come up with when I type the
query in a fresh Google page. However for AltaVista the result are different.
When I do it from the toolbar search function, I get the hit for [Mi mam].
That is, it ignores my accentuated "a". A similar difference occurs with the
query [“this ain’t your mama’s”]. Note that the quote and apostrophy used here
are not the keyboard " and '. Rather, they are the one generated by Microsoft
Word. So for this query Google come up with it normal result a if I copy
and pasted them into the Google page's query box, while AltaVista give me the
result that it would if I typed [?this ain?t your mama?s?]. That is, the
special character are replaced with question marks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the toolbar search box type [Mi mamá], without the bracket and with an
accent on the last "a".
2. With the focus still in the query box, press ENTER.


Actual Results:
AltaVista show the result for the search [Mi mam]

Expected Results:
AltaVista should have shown the result for the search [Mi mamá]. The Google
toolbar search doe it correctly.

I suspect many of the toolbar search widgamagits have similar problem with
non-ASCII characters.
