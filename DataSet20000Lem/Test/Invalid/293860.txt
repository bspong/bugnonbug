Javascript code in <![CDATA[ ]]> won't run

I tried to validate a page I coded using the W3C's validator, and it flagged a
an error the appearance of "<" in the inline script. (I normally avoid inline
scripts, but this one wa necessary; writing e-mail address chunk by chunk on
the client side protects the e-mail address from e-mail harvester used by
spammers.) I then found out that code with such character need to be marked
off a CDATA, so I put <![CDATA[ before the code, and ]]> after the code, and it
validated, but now the script won't run in Firefox, and the Javascript console
say it ha a syntax error which I can't find.

The script in question is the following:

<!-- The following script is a defense against web-crawling e-mail harvester
--><script type="text/javascript"> <![CDATA[ document.write('<a class="contact"
');document.write(nam+dom);document.write('">');document.write('info@');document.write('somedomain.com');document.write('</a>');
]]> </script>

(the variable nam and dom are defined in the script area in the head element)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Write an inline script that us document.write to insert a mailto:
2.surround the content of the script with CDATA identifiers: <![CDATA[ and ]]>
3.run the page: notice that the specified element doesn't show up.

Actual Results:
The place where the element wa supposed to be inserted by the inline script
show up blank.

Expected Results:
the inline script should have executed a it did when there were no CDATA
identifier wrapping the script; in my case, a mailto: should have been
inserted. The CDATA identifier were necessary because the script contained <
and other forbidden character that prevented it from validating a xhtml 1.0.

the javascript console identifies the code a having a syntax error when I
reloaded the page after I wrapped the script with the CDATA tag.
