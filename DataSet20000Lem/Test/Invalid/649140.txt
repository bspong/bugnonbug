First, no problem with the older FF.
When I try to download my monthly bank statement by clicking on the file name on the site either nothing happens or I get a "waiting for wellsfargo..." message and then nothing. I spoke with the Wellsfargo tech and he said there wa a problem with FF4 and some site (besides theirs)and PDF files. What is apparently happening is that FF4 is "converting" the link to a CGI" file called "session.cgi" rather than the actual name of say 20110408abcd.pdf."
A temporary work around is to right click on the file link and do a "save link as..." and before saving to rename the extension to "pdf." Something definitely is broken here. Possibly something to do with recognizing the site's security. With other simple site I can download their pdf file ok.

This need resolution ASAP.
