Crashes uploading attachment to Bugzilla
Browser keep crashing when I click the button to submit attachment to Bugzilla
bugs. Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031001
Firebird/0.7+

Talkbacks from previous crashes: TB24316161Z, TB24282408M

When I return to the bug, I find that the attachment did upload. But the
browser crash before seeing the 'successful upload' page.

Tried to reproduce in test Bugzilla environment at landfill.bugzilla.org and
could not.

Assigning bug to self so I can test uploading attachment here using a clean
profile/no extensions, and with Mozilla Seamonkey.
