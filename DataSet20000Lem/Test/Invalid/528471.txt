Install TrackerWatcher (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14454)

If you don't see the icon on the toolbar, go to customize toolbar and drag it between home and the URL bar.

Install Jetpack.

Notice that the icon disappears.

It's back in customize toolbar.

Jetpack shouldn't be screwing with other add-ons.
