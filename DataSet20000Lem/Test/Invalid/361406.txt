Firefox Crashes Randomly With No Specific Action. I could be in the middle of browsing a site, or typing in text field. It is never the same operation that cause the crash. There is no core file dump or error message printed in a dialog window or any of the log file (~/.xsession-errors, /var/log/messages, etc).

I have ignored the problem for so long with all the previous version of Firefox that were released for Fedora Core 5 and older. However, I am using the latest stable release for Fedora Core 6, and the same problem occurs. Plus, I did not report the problem before because Firefox is Free Open Source Software (OSS).

However, I am getting very frustrated with the consistent crashing. It make me feel like I am using Micro$oft Windows. That is one the main reason I avoid using M$ Windows, and do not recommend it to our clients.

I have close to 20 year of experience with Unix Platforms. These type of issue will not discourage me from using Linux, Mozilla and other OSS. However, with these type of problems, promoting Linux, Mozilla and other OSS to our client is very complicated. These type of problem should not be taken lightly.

I am the NOC Director of a Linux & OSS Solution Provider. Unlike many ISV, we do our best to make sure our Enterprise Business Management and other Web Based Applications run on Firefox. Please let u know what we can do to ensure that we can deliver our solution to work well with Firefox.

If there is certain utility the Mozilla Team recommends to trap errors, then please let me know.
