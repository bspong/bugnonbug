Add wildcards to cookie exception list to permit subdomains if all cooky are blocked

If all cooky are blocked, there is no way to allow cooky from a whole domain. For example, if all cooky are blocked and you put "yahoo.com" a allowed, then cooky will still not be set from mail.yahoo.com, games.yahoo.com, news.yahoo.com, login.yahoo.com, etc.

Recommendation: put in an option to have wildcards in the exception list, eg "*.yahoo.com" can be allowed. This would allow all subdomains from a trusted domain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear and block all cooky
2. Allow cooky from yahoo.com
3. Try to login in to mail.yahoo.com and you cant.




This would be a powerful addition. It should work for both allowing and denying wildcard subdomains to set cooky and could make looking at the cooky list much cleaner.
