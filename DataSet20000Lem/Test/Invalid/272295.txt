It appears Firefox -all versions- , just a Netscape, doe not support
Macromedia Flash transparency features.
The code badly interpreted is : " <param name=wmode value=transparent>". Instead
the transparent color is replaced by some ugly fluo orange color...yikes !

Open www.photos-aix.com in IE to see what it should normally look like.

Thanks for your great job ! Firefox rule !

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open http://www.photos-aix.com in firefox
2.see ugly messy orange color
3.open same url in IE to see the difference.
Actual Results:
The webpage is actually badly displayed. Flash Transparency is not supported !

Expected Results:
Background color should have been transparent and not orange.

This transparency bug ha been seen under Firefox, Mozilla and even Netscape
(every single version to my knowledge). It's far from being critical- just plain
ugly when displayed.
