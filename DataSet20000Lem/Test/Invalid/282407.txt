Currently the tab in the browser are pretty productive but the tab themselves
are very static. It is useful to ring up a lot of URLs in different tabs. But
after opening several tab the only way to view the information in them is to
click around a lot.

It will be good if the TABs can be organzied within the browser window just like
the window can be organized on the desktop. Some of the enhancement that will
be useful are:

o make tab rearrangeable with drag and drop(see bug 282404 )
o Make tab moveable between different browser window through drag and drop
o Allow for multi select of different tab and do a group action on them like:
Close or Open in New Window for them
o Allow a option like: Tile Tabs Horizontally, Tile Tabs Vertically, Cascade
Tabs, etc. So that after open the tab we can view the info in them in a single
window instead of clicking around.
