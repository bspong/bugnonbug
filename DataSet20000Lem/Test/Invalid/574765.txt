I have been playing around with this pre-beta FireFox, since this version work with YouTube's HTML5 (WebM) video mode. I have just been simply surfing and right now, the tab bar is not below the bookmarks; it is in fact now above the adress bar. What ha happened? Can I fix this with "Customize..."? Is there a setting or possibly my profile that ha been corrupted or have the wrong settings? When I try with FireFox 3.6.3, this issue doe not happen. Thanks.
