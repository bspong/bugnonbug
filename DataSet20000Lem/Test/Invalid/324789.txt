[trunk] Close button on tabs: new prefs don't seem to work
When there are more than 7 tab on the tabbar, the close cross on the inactive tab disappear. When I make a new pref called browser.tabs.minTabWidth and I set it to an integer value of 30, this make no difference. The cross still disappear when there are more than 7 tabs.

I tried also the other pref: when I set browser.tabs.disableBackgroundClose to true, the close cross on background tab don't disappear, even if I restart the browser.

Tried with 1.9a1_2006012517 build.
