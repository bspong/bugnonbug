[QAC generated] Keep getting "Object moved to here" page
Steps to Reproduce
---------------------------------------
1. use page requiring log-in, like gmail
2. enter username and pw,
3. continue to log in, get "Object moved to here" or "Object can be found here" where "here" is a link.

Continue to content following log-in.

Seems to mostly happen on http pages.
