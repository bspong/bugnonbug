Intermittently, every other time or so, upon launching firefox it fails to load
all tab before indicating -Nonresponding, unless I run SafeMode.

This problem started occurring last week, some time since 103 wa released and
only on my home PC, not on another XP or my work 2K PC. All three have the same
three tab home URLs, but not all had yahoo toolbar. I have had trouble getting
the toolbar to load on the safe mode version.

Safe mode allows me to run firefox.

Unrelated perhaps: My pc crashed this week and I wa unable to go beyond the
login screen/loading settings. Safe mode allowed me to deactive start up and
services. Upon reloading those option I could once again get into my login and
found that the firefox intermittent loading remains. I then stumbled upon the
safemode shortcut and found it is a solution.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Firefox 1.0.3
2.It hang and top panel indicates non-responding (also task manager say same)
3.Try quitting and then need task manager to quit it.



Expected Results:
this is intermittent so it doe behave correctly about every other time, but
rarely the first time it is launched.
