Installer doesn't honor "Reset Homepage Checked" or "Launch App Checked" in config.ini
I downloaded the latest build from the trunk (1.0+_2005032106), extracted file
from the installer and made just one change in config.ini under the "[Dialog
Install Successful]" section, setting the item "Reset Homepage Checked=TRUE" to
"Reset Homepage Checked=FALSE", then ran setup.exe. In the final "Install
complete" dialog box, the item "Use Firefox Start a my Home Page" wa still
checked off and I had to manually uncheck it.

This is also the case for "Launch App Checked=FALSE" under the same section; in
the final dialog box "Launch Firefox 1.0 now" is checked off and ha to be
manually unchecked.
