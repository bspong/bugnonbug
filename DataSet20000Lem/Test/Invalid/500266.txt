Many option from my last version of FireFox were not carried over on the upgrade to 3.5 RC. Such item a default applications, default download directory, "always do" option on downloads.

Also missing are many of my "remember" field on login/forms field (when pressing the down key, the list is missing or incomplete, having some but not other string available). Others have the wrong saved item

Not a major bug, but a rather annoying inconvenience.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Uninstall FireFox 3.5RC, and all other left over Mozilla/FireFox item
2.Install an earlier version of FireFox, configure option and form entries.
3. Upgrade to 3.5RC
Actual Results:
As stated above, option and configuration setting are incorrect on upgrade. Forms are missing saved data strings, or have incorrect strings.

Expected Results:
Options should have remained the same a the last version, string data should not have been deleted or jumbled.

Same problem on:
Vista x64 ultimate,
Vista x32 Ultimate
Vista x64 Home Premium
XP Pro X64
Linux (debian) install using window version with Wine.

Also of note, the jumbled saved string for field input may be a security issue a if I select one screen name from the saved list and it give a password used for that screen name on another site rather than the correct saved one (cant tell with the little dots, until it fails), I'm giving away password to the wrong people.
