On the website http://www.openehr.org on the front page the password-login box appears, and ha to be cancelled two times. On the page http://svn.openehr.org/specification/BRANCHES/Release-1.0-candidate/ it appears 7 times. on many more page on this site it appears.

Already discussied it with the site-maintainer, and he confirms that all page are not protected in anyway.

I tested this website in IE and in Opera, and they did not have a problem.
It is therefore a Firefox-specific problem.
