Pretty much every time I try to put anything into the google search the browser
crashes. Sometimes it will freeze and I'll have to kill it. And about 33% of
the time when I input character into a input form for example google.com's
search field it will crash or freeze.

Pecularity: if I put my curser in the field and space over 2-3 time it more
than likely won't crash.
