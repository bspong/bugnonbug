rename nightly 1.8.0 branch build to -firefox1.5.0.5 and other necessary change for the next release
Not sure what is involved, but it is time to update the nightly 1.8.0 tinderbox and get some 1.5.0.5 build together. I'll leave it up to Paul and/or Rob to do their thing. I'm guessing we need to:

1. tag the new release branch
2. rename file on ftp
3. create the candidate directory in prep for rc1
