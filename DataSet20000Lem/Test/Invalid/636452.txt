When I first started using the FF4 beta (maybe around 3 or 4), the gmail shortcut worked fine (eg. "C" for composing a new message or "R" for reply), but shortly after I started using beta, these shortcut broke during an upgrade.

1) I just tried deleting my setting in my .mozilla folder to see if that helped. It didn't. Also disabled all add-on with no change.

2) I still have keyboard shortcut in other google apps (eg. "U" will hide the sidebar in google reader)

I really want my keyboard control back for gmail! Thanks.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to gmail.com
2.Press "C" for compose new message
3.Nothing happens

Nothing.

I have disabled all plugins.
