DETAILS TAB: on this page, an image start to load, but then go black. Clicking on any of the 4 image icon yield a (correct size) black spacce. If I drag this, however, the image is displayed while I am dragging.
IMAGES TAB: Working along the image from the left, they are black until the 8th, which display correctly. Then the 5th, 6th & 7th doe also.8th and above always display. I see all the thumbnails.
MAP TAB: I see the icon for houses, the controls, but the actual map itself is blank. This map ha about 6 image and whatever one I drag show a I drag it.
I have Slamd64-12.2(64bit port of slack). These all work in 32 bit Slackware-12.0 on a different box, so it is either a javascript or a video thing. Fedora 10 also on the 64 bit box with a different java plugin and video driver also ha issue here.

I should mention everything is x86_64: The cpu is a Turion(amd64). Browser, flash plugin, java plugin.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
None needed - just go about your business.
1.Any page from www.myhome.ie ha some problem. The map always fails
2.http://www.youtube.com
3.
Actual Results:
Big image is black unless dragged off centre. Thumbnails OK.

Expected Results:
Larger image should display. On youtube, the 'videos being watched now' ha a large frame and that is black unless I drag it.

All javascript feature are enabled
The image is there. The black frame vary in size with images, and display once dragged, even with my bandwith throttled to near zero. I have a Windows nerd son doing exam :-(.
Java and DRI work, but there is an issue on Java, which is this. libmawt.so is needed. Java crash without it. I have
/usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/headless/libmawt.so - that crash firefox!
/usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/motif21/libmawt.so - apparently working
/usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/xawt/libmawt.so - apparently working

Despite having /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/ in /etc/ld.so.conf none of these are found. ldconfig run on reboot. I have a symlink in /usr/java/jre1.6.0_14/lib/amd64/ to ~/xawt/libmawt.so currently. All dependency are found (I made sure of that!).

The build is your general release. The original one talked me into retiring it.
Ctrl_Alt_F1 show 4 error (presumably from the browser)
Error: No running window found (twice)
None (twice)
