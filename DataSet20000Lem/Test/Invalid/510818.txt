Firefox 3.5 crashing, taking WinXP with it via Blue Screen of Death
Approximately since the June 30 release of 3.5, my WinXP with Service Pack 3 ha been crashing increasingly (no pattern), often overnight when only Thunderbird 2.0.0.22 and Firefox 3.5 are running. ZoneAlarm Security Suite is running, a is Folding@Home 5.03.

Crash will usually occur while browsing in Firefox (no pattern). May also occur when using (e-mail client) Thunderbird while Firefox is running a well.

Almost every crash ha appeared a the dreaded Blue Screen of Death with a restart--until today, when I first saw a fast message that Mozilla had closed, and then came the Blue Screen before I could note any rationale.

Windows always manages to send a crash report upon restart.

Creating a new Firefox profile doe not seem to solve the problem. Have not yet tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox.

Windows seems to think I need to update my driver and/or check my hardware. All that is new is Firefox 3.5.2 and the usual ongoing Windows XP updates. Hardware is all new a of December 2008.

Upon restarting Firefox, the "Well, this is embarrassing..." message appears. Overriding it always allows Firefox to start apparently normally.

This bug report is only vaguely similar to other recent crash bug I have seen, thus I have chosen to file it. Anecdotal report out on the web (blogs, etc.) seem to be reporting somewhat similar behavior.
