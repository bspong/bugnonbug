opening the before mentioned url cause firefox to gobble up all memory available (2GB)
the page contains 12 image with total size 6MB.
loading the same page in IE consumes about 120MB (safari about same)
the page is w3c checked and conformes to all standards.

note that the page us css-sprites, that is one single big image a background
for all the span on the page and only the background-position is changed.
firefox instead think that he ha to download this single background image
thousand times.
