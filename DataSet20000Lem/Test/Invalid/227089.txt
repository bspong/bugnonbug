You can download the HTML + CSS from here ...
http://www.nyxeh.com/itsdeadjim/nyxeh.zip for mucking about remotely.

The basic bug happens in the block...

<h1>test</h1>
<p>test</p>

I am using xhtml + cs for the layout, so h1 + p are getting overidden in the css.

The problem is in the h1 block. I have an image on the left, the text to the
right and I want it bottom justified with the image (it doe work). The problem
is it add the height of the image (the specified height of the page) to the
padding-top element pushing the p block down by however much the text is offset
by...

background-image: url('ss-a/img_star.png');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
height: 49px;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
padding-left: 55px;
padding-top: 30px;

So the height of the element will always be height + padding-top. This
certainly doe not look like standard behaviour, and it mean there is no
possible way (that I can think of) of elegantly achieving this effect on
Mozilla/Firebird.

If you look at http://www.nyxeh.com/itsdeadjim/ you will see what I mean. Try
adjusting padding-top to see the effect. If you add...

border-color: #000;
border-style: solid;
border-width: 1px;

to the h1 and #text p block it will put a black border on the element for more
visual identification of the effect.

Try the page in IE, much a I hate to say this, you should see how it meant to
work. (please feel free to hit me if it correct cs rendering, it just doesnt
seem logical to me.
