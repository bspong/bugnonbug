I wa using Firefox 3.0.5, and updated to 3.0.6 through updater in the Firefox after it notified me. After the process completes, it asked to restart FF, so I did it. Once restarted it said, updating failed and to get the update by downloading the latest setup. So I did that too.

In both ways, I can't view any web page or my Twitter addon doesn't connect. Which mean Firefox is not connecting to the internet at all.

Reproducible: Always

1.Update to 3.0.6 either through updater in FF or manually
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Doesn't connect to the internet. and show the error "Address Not Found"

Expected Results:
