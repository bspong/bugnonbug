Whenever I launch Firefox, an error message pop up.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

Whenever I Firefox launch (either by clicking on the icon or through a link to open a website in a new window), an error message pop up. If I click "OK" on the message, Firefox will then start, although nothing seems to be hampered once the application actually starts.

1. Launch Firefox
2.
3.

The program should launch without an error message.
