I installed a new add-on which I got off a Digg list of "Top 9 Firefox Add-Ons" or something. Whenever I try to start firefox it crashes. Reinstalling while keeping personal setting (like bookmarks) doe not fix the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox
2. ...
3. Dammit!
Actual Results:
I wasn't sure which install. I may have clicked the Firefox icon before I clicked the restart button in the Add-On dialogue or clicked it twice.

Expected Results:
Firefox crashes.

Should have started. Worked fine before the add-on. Reinstalling should have restored Firefox's functionality.
