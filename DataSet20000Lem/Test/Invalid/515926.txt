In the last two week I found out that a lot of page containing flash element get the content disappear when I switch tab and then switch back, or when opening a new firefox window.
This sometimes happens in youtube but not always, what make me think it may be a problem caused by add on the pages.

The problem only resolve when reloading the tab. But the problem is only visual, because if in the page wa some kind of sound or music played, it's still played when switching back to it, but nothing can be seen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page with flash element (maybe only happens with adds)
2. Open a new tab or window
3. Switch back to the first tab/window
Actual Results:
All the content in the page is disappeared, although sound can still be heard if there wa any.

Expected Results:
The page should still be visible.

It doesn't happen in youtube, nor with a web I made including a flash element I created.
