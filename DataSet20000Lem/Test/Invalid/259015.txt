1.0 versioning confusing to user - externally, version is publihsed a "1.0", internally and in dialogs, the version is "0.10"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040911 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040911 Firefox/0.10

20040911 build is publicly (Website, Logos, Descriptions, etc.) versioned a
"1.0PR" or "1.0"

Internally, Firefox is listed a "0.10" and this is the version that appears in
information about extension and themes.

This discrepancy will be confusing for users.
