Firefox seems to have a memory leak in it, or a cascading loop. When I open it, it's using 2-3% of my CPU load. At some point it simply freezes. When I open Process Explorer, it show that it's using more than 50%. My plugins are Xmarks, Firebug, FireFTP, NoScript, ImageZoom, Java Console, Web Developer, Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant. Security is AVG.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start
2. Wait one hour or so.
3. Freezes.
Actual Results:
Freezes. Will not close. Must be killed in Task Manager or Process Explorer.

Expected Results:
Not freeze.
