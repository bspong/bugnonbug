History show duplicate item until a search is performed, whether or not the search should filter any items. Duplicates reappear when "Show Places" is clicked again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Safari and browse to several page
2. Quit Safari
3. Launch Firefox and browse to several page
4. Import Safari profile data into Firefox
5. Show Places
6. Select History from Places sidebar
7. Click in History search box and press <Return>
8. Click Show Places again
Actual Results:
After step (6), 18 site appear in the History list, including several that appear to be duplicate (same name and URI, different timestamps). After step (7), only 14 site are listed. Step (8) return to the same view a step (6), including duplicates.

After step (6), today's date is highlighted in the calendar. After (7), the entire month is. It's counterintuitive that fewer result be shown for the month than for only today.

Expected Results:
Performing an empty search should not filter the results. Whether duplicate item are listed should be consistent throughout all view of the History.
