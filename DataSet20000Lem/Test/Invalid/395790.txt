Please go the upper right hand of the side under MEMBER AREA and login using this test login:

*****************
******

You can see once you login, the MEMBER AREA hyperlink "My Account" and "Logout" only work on the underline. The text itself is not clickable.

Firefox is the only browser (on both MAC and PC) to have this issue. It seems to work fine in IE6, IE7, Opera, and Safari for PC.

Can you confirm this and indicate suggestions?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login uner the MEMER AREA banner in upper right using bromano@acoem.org for the login and test@! for the password
2. Once logged in, attempt to click either the "My Account" or "Logout" hyperlink and you can see the link doesn't work unless you click directly on the underline.
Actual Results:
Links do not work

Expected Results:
Link should be clickable and do associated action

The browser should display the link around the text a both link are simple <a href="URL"> calls... something that shouldn't even be an issue by this release of the browser.
