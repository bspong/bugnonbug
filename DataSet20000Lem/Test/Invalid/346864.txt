alert(document.getElementById(someid).innerHTML) will give the element contents, but if there are single element like img, br, input etc. they will not be closed properly like e.g <br/> - instead <br> is returned.

This violates the XHTML 1.0 spec, and also mean that innerHTML can not be used a proper XML - even if the Doctype is set to XHTML 1.0 Strict which requires a valid document with closed single elements.

One application for proper XHTML from innerHTML is e.g from Adobe Flash ActionScript and ExternalInterface.call() . For now developer need to write a small parser to fix the mangled source before using the innerHTML result.

innerHTML is a central part of something like AHAH ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHAH ) and also enjoys significant speed advantage over traditional DOM methods.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. alert(document.getElementById(someid).innerHTML)
2. someid is an element containing an img-, br- or similar element.
3.

Actual Results:
For source of <div id="someid"><br/></div> and innerHTML on someid, "<br>" is returned.

Expected Results:
Especially when Doctype XHTML 1.0 Strict is used, result should be according to standard mode - and "<br/>" (with the closing '/') should be returned.

It seems a minor forget, but for XHTML 1.0 Strict it's arguably the correct way to return non-mangled source results.
