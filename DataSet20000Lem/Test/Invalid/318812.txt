Keyboarding/accessability improvement for calendar widget
On Windows and Linux (and Mac if the keyboard access option is enabled), the calendar widget should be keyboard accessible: focusable, left/right/up/down arrow should move the cursor, shift-left/right/up/down to create a selection, going left of the edge should wrap to the previous day, right of the edge should wrap to the next day, up or down should wrap to the previous/next month, page up and page down should wrap to the previous and next month, home and end should go to today.

Moving (arrow keys) with the control key pressed should move the cursor without changing the selection. Moving without control pressed should move the cursor and reset the selection. Ctrl-space should add/remove the date at the cursor to/ from the selection.
