This is a school-related website for collaborating with peer and teacher
online, which Firefox will not load. I get a message saying that "Access to the
port number given ha been siabled for security reasons".

Safari 2.0.1 on OS X Tiger 10.4.2 with latest security update will load the
page without any sort of issue!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the page from the link at http://www.parade.vic.edu.au/Online.htm, on
the left of the page.
2. Reload the page.
3. Reload the page again.
4. Load the page by typing the address manually in the address bar (address must
be copied from the status bar when the cursor is floating over the link from
http://www.parade.vic.edu.au/Online.htm/).

Actual Results:
Page didn't load, I got an error stating that "Access to the port number given
[had] been denied for security reasons."

Expected Results:
Load the Blackboard login page completely.
