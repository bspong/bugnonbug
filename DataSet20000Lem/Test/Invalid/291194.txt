Upgrade/Install fails. I have two unkillable firefox.exe process even AFTER reboot
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier:

I wa running firefox 1.0.2 just fine. Got the update pop-up in the task bar
and clicked it to update to 1.0.3. Here is what happened next:

1- Got the message that firefox wa running and that it should be closed to run
the install. Clicked on the box and the install seemed to proceed nomally.

2- tried running firefox and firefox just hung like it wa waiting for a page
to show up. Verified with IE and found that my default page wa available.
Tried several other page and and firefox wa unable to open any pages.

3- tried to uninsall firefox and wa given a message that it wa running so
uninstall could not proceed. I lokked in task manager and saw that this wa
true. There were two firefox processes. I tried to kill them; but, they would
not die. No messages, but they just kept on running after kill signal.

4- rebooted the system and the firefox process were STILL running after
bootup!

5- Went to c:\programfiles\mozilla firefox, and renamed firefox.exe to
firefox.exe.ben. Rebooted and firefox.exe wa STILL running!

6- Searched all file and folder for firefox.exe and wa not able to find the
executable. Rebooted again and the process is still running!

7- tried running install again and wa told that firefox had to be closed to
install. This time install failed. neither the installer, nor I could kill
the firefox.exe process that are running.

8- Ran a virus check [norton internet security 2004] and no virus were found.

9- please note, all window patch are up to date a of yesterday. Norton is
uptodate a of today. I'm running window XP sp2.

10- Shutting down the system take a long time now. I think it ha a hard
time killing the mozilla processes.

11- I can't reproduce this because i CAN'T uninsall the application to try
reinstalling it! This is a huge problem for me.
