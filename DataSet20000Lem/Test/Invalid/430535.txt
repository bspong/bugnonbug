When a htm-file is saved in unicode format and the corresponding cs is in ansi format, the cs doesn't get loaded. If both are in ansi it work and if both are in unicode it also works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create htm which includes a css:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
save the htm-file in unicode format.
2.Create a cs file "style.css", save it in ansi format
3.Open the htm in firefox
Actual Results:
No design element appear, the cs clearly doesn't get loaded.

Expected Results:
The cs file should load just like when it in unicode too.
