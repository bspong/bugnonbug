Firefox 2.0.0.3 crash on ajax version of yahoo.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070219 Firefox/2.0.0.2
Build Identifier:

I had to revert back to firefox 2.0.0.2 because version 2.0.0.3 wa unusable. My home page is the ajax version of mail.yahoo.com, and firefox 2.0.0.3 would crash consistenly on every load.
I don't know what is the cause of the crash. I barely had time to move the mouse around for le perhaps a couple of seconds, and firefox would crash - typically when I try to point the mouse to the inbox link on the left side of the page.
(This doesn't happen with version 2.0.0.2, and I don't remember this occurring with any previous versions).
