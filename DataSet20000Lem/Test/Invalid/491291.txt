I have lot of tab (more than 10) open.
I could not find close button on the inactive tabs.
Close button is there only on active tab.

When number of open tab reduced to le than 10, close button on inactive tab started appearing.

Wish to have close button on all open tab irrespective of whether they are inactive or active.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start new instance of firefox.
2. Open around 10 (or more) tab
Actual Results:
No close button for open inactive tabs.

Expected Results:
Each tab should have a close button
