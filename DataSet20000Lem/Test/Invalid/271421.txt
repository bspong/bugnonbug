JavaScript Event handler issue, onchange and onblur event on form field cannot stop the "default" event from firing.

We use onchange for data validation in forms. The idea is that the user can't
leave the field until the data is correct. As such, we do a return false in the
onChange handler for the form field, so the default action (change of focus to
the next item in a tab or click) is suppressed. This work in IE. (I realize
this doesn't say much)

I've tried to replicate the behavior in Firefox. When I do a return false in
onBlur or onChange, it appears to have no effect. Regardless of what I put in
the onChange handler (including an explicit this.focus()), once it completes the
focus move to the next element in the form. I've tried using stopPropagation
methods, preventDefault, and cancelBubble, but none have any effect. It seems
tab cannot be trapped with an onKeyDown event either. This is the first problem.

With an onChange return of false, the focus should not leave the original field.
When it does, the onChange is then reset, which mean even if I return to the
field, if I leave this time, the data is no longer different from when I focused
on the field, so the onChange handler won't even fire this time. This is the
second problem.

I'd like to think that a fix for first problem will also fix the second. This
type of behavior is critical for web based applications.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL I've supplied.
(https://mgmt.k12system.com/~mrwizard/firefox_js.html)
2. Focus on the validation field, and enter some data. (anything will do)
3. Hit tab, or click away.

Actual Results:
Notice you're now in the Something to Receive Focus field, and the focus2 event
ha fired.

Expected Results:
Focus should have remained in the validation field.

Appears to be related to Mozilla Classic bug of 243816, 53579, 65581... None of
which seem to have a resolution. I think the problem is in the "stacking" of
events, the focus should not change. The other problem I notice is that the
onBlur happens before the onChange, so we've already left the field. If I could
move the validation to the onBlur I would, but return false ha no effect there
either. (notice the return false in the onBlur of the validation field)
