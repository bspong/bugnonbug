I'll attach a test case which demostrates this problem succinctly but, to summarise, according to my understanding of the cs spec. a rule declared a !important should override a later rule, even if that rule is 'more specific'.

The cascade state that there is a "primary sort" and a "secondary sort", "!important" falling under the former, specificity, the latter. Although the spec isn't concrete, my reading is that all rule would be ordered according to the primary sort, then only equal rule would be ordered according to the secondary sort. Thus, "!important" should win out, and the latest version of Firefox ha pretty significant bug. FYI, IE 7 and Opera also suffer from this 'misreading' of the spec.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the attached test case.

Actual Results:
Note that the font is displayed in monospace.

Expected Results:
The font should be displayed in a sans-serif face.
