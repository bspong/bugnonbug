using fireinput extension cause huge memory leak in firefox running on Solaris 10
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.9) Gecko/20100315 Firefox/3.5.9
Build Identifier: Firefox/2.2.0.0.22/2.0.0.7/3.6.3 Extension: Fireinput 1.7.1.2.

I'm using firefox with the extension fireinput(http://fireinput.com) on a Solaris 10 system. After Installing the extension firefox is allocating 8 MB (!) of memory for every new browser-window I open and doesn't release this memory after closing the window. After opening many window firefox start swapping because it's running out of memory.

I could reproduce this behaviour for the following configurations:
Firefox 1.5 + Fireinput 1.4 - 1.7.1.2
Firefox 2.0.0.7 + Fireinput 1.4 - 1.7.1.2
Firefox 2.0.0.22 + Fireinput 1.4 - 1.7.1.2
Firefox 3.6.3 + Fireinput 1.8

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 1.5/2.0.22/3.6.3 on a Solaris 10 system
2.Install plugin fireinput 1.4 - 1.7.1.2(for Firefox version up to 2.0.0.22) or
fireinput 1.8 for firefox version 3.6.3
3.start firefox
3.Open several browser window and watch the firefox process via command "top"
Actual Results:
- firefox is allocating 8 MB (!) of memory for every new browser-window
- firefox won't release the memory when closing the window

Expected Results:
- firefox should allocate le than 8MB per window
- firefox should should at least release the allocated memory when closing a
window
