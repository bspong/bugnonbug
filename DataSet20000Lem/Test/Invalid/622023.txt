The Gmail button within the google toolbar is not responsive and doe not recall Gmail when firefox (version 3.6.12) is first started. Closing the firefox browser window and restarting the firefox window from the "file" menu, enables the gmail button within the google toolbar to work again.

Noticed this issue on both Mac OSX and Windows 7 platforms.
