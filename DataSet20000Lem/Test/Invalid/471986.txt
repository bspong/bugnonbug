Two of my bookmark have their url location disappear periodically on two different computers. They are http://www.ebates.com/ and http://www.pricegrabber.com/. [Note: This bug report is for informational purpose so hopefully an article will be created. I have determined the cause and the "solution". This similar disappearing location problem is reported by many people and ha responded with the probably cause and solution for all of these people.] I am not sure if the FireFox developer can resolve this.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. After turning on my computer in the morning and sometimes periodically throughout the day the two bookmark url location listed disappear.
2. Restore all bookmark from a backup file, (everything is there).
3. Later in the day they may disappear, (sometimes they don't).
Actual Results:
The two bookmark url location disappear, (and then the name can't be deleted).

Expected Results:
The two bookmark url location should stay.

I am running Windows XP Pro with all of the latest updates, McAfee Internet Security with all of the latest update and PC Tools Spyware Doctor with all of the latest updates. PC Tools Spyware Doctor is the cause of the disappearance and can be used to "resolve" the disappearing problem a well. Every morning at 9AM I have PC Tools Spyware Doctor set to run an Intelli-scan and I also have it set to run a Full scan on a weekly basis. After an update it also run a quick scan, which is the reason for the "sometimes periodically throughout the day" appearance of the problem. If I restore the bookmarks, (and all is fine), then run the Intelli-scan, the location for these two bookmark disappear every time. The "fix" is to add them a exclusion in the Cookie Guard under the IntelliGuard Protection of PC Tools Spyware Doctor. I am not sure if FireFox can fix the problem permanently, but by having it added to the knowledge base would solve the frustration of a lot of FireFox users.
