Hi,

Trying to get a stacktrace for a Firefox crash.
Using windbg and following mozilla instruction from "how to obtain a stack trace".

Start Winbdg
Open executeable (firefox)
enter the three line necessary to download the symbols.

The symbol appear to download but I get the following error messages:

0:000> sympath SRV*c:\symbols*http://symbols.mozilla.org/firefox
Couldn't resolve error at 'ympath SRV*c:\symbols*http://symbols.mozilla.org/firefox'
0:000> symfix+ c:\symbols
Couldn't resolve error at 'ymfix+ c:\symbols'
0:000> reload /f
^ Bad register error in 'reload /f'

I wa able to do this ok some month ago but now it doesn't work.
What am i doing wrong?

Thanks
