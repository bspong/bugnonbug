Well, this time Firefox managed to fsck up the main column of the blog site. The
side bar look ok, but the main content is unreadable. Also I should warn that
it sister site, http://clubedaputaria.blogspot.com, suffers the same bug. All
of them look OK in Internet Explorer and I remember visiting it with Firefox 0.8
milestone, everything looked fine. Oh, and both site may be not work safe,
especially the latter one.
