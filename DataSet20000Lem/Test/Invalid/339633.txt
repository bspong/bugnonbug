Websites (more than one) are indicatiing that I need to enable Javascript and allow cooky in my browser (FireFox 1.5). When I view Tools-->Options-->Content....the 'Enable Javascript' box is checked and when I view Tools-->Options-->Privacy...the 'Allow site to set Cookies' is also checked. I have unchecked these box and refreshed the web site to no avail.

So is there something else that need to be set? Any help or suggestion will be appreciates....mj
