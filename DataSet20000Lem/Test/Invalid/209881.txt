When I right click with the "Radial Contextual Menu" plugin installed, the menu
appears above the mouse instead of surrounding the mouse. The tooltips appear
in the correct location. A partial screenshot of the problem is at

In the picture the mouse (though it can't be seen) is in the center of the
tooltips. The menu continues to function correctly, so long a you aim for
where the item should be rather than where they appear on the screen. I will
try and attach both .pngs to the bug but I've never done that before... ;)
