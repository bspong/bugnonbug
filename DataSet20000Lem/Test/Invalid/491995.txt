Digital Persona Fingerprint Software doesn't work.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090423 Firefox/3.5b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

With Firefox 3.0.10 the Digital Persona Fingerprint Reader extension software (V1.0.1.1) worked normally.

With Firefox 3.5b4 it doesn't and says:
This screen is not a logon screen. To create a fingerprint logon, you must first use your browser to display the logon page for a Web site. Then click Continue.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any website with a logon page.
2. The icon for the Digital Persona software won't appear (trouble already).
3. Swipe the finger on the fingerprint reader anyway...
Actual Results:
The Digital Persona Fingerprint software says:

This screen is not a logon screen. To create a fingerprint logon, you must first use your browser to display the logon page for a Web site. Then click Continue.

Expected Results:
It should have worked normally, a in Firefox 3.0.10

The Digital Persona extension is marked compatible with Firefox 3.0 only. The software can be loaded into Firefox 3.5b4 by changing the maxversion. However, it doesn't work. Not sure if it's the Digital Persona software or Firefox that ha problems.

So far this is the only extension (of the several used) that doesn't work in Firefox 3.5b4.
