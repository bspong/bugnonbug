Opening just one site seems fine. Even if I attempt to open a new tab the screen along with the vertical scrollbar is pushed to the extreme left of the browser. Effectively, any web content is not visible and the rest of the browser's original screen is painted blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 2.0 in Mac OS X 10.4.8 running on Dual 2GHz PowerPC G5 machine
2.Start firefox
3.Open a new tab



Expected Results:
The new tab should have opened along with the original window in a separate tab and the tab would be selectable.

The tab and the webcontent get pushed to the extreme left (along) with the original vertical scroll bar, leaving the rest of the browser window blank. The tab are not visible or selectable.
