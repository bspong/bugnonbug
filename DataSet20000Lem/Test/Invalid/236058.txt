the browser instead copy 'http://www.tirerack.com/images/trans.gif' to the
clipboard instead, no matter where on the image the click is performed. Viewing

Properties see both, but the context menu doe not respect user expectation
that the URL to large image be copied.

not want to copy topmost image but may want bottom-most one instead

("Copy URL (trans.gif)" a one menu item and "Copy location
(co_xtreme_contact_1000.jpg)" a another) - OR - make it possible to drag and
drop image from Document Info window or allow context menu for image to appear
when right-clicking image in Document Info window
