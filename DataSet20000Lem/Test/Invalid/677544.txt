Recently, Firefox sync cannot connect/has encountered problems, firefox say all site are untrusted (including this one), and it keep giving me the secure connection failed error.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1
Build ID: 20110707182747

Steps to reproduce:

Nothing, maybe started Firefox Sync...


Actual results:

3-fold:
For no reason, sync started encountering problems,
Firefox started saying many site are untrusted including the Mozilla mainpage and Bugzilla,
and it started giving me Secure Connection failures.



Expected results:

Nothing at all, it should have been smooth browsing.
