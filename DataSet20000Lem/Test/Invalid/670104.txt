A modified searchplugin XML file doe not get updated immediately after restarting Nightly
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0a1) Gecko/20110707 Firefox/8.0a1
Build ID: 20110707030839

Steps to reproduce:

Step to reproduce:

1. Create a new profile, and open Nightly with that profile once;
2. Do a search using the bundled Google search in searchbar to make sure it is working a expected;
3. Open \Nightly\searchplugins\google.xml. Modify the domain name at both field "template=" to a random domain (e.g. googleaaaa.com/). Save the file;
4. Restart Nightly with the created new profile. Do a search using the bundled Google search again;


Actual results:

Nightly still brings me to Google Search but not googleaaaa.com. It seems that the modified google.xml is not in effect.
Repeating step 4 a few time and the result is still the same. However if at this point I create another new profile and do a Google search, the modified google.xml come into effect. But the original new profile is still using the unmodified google.xml.
The result is the same if I modified other searchplugins in my profile\searchplugins.
The modified google.xml may, or may not, come into effect to the original new profile after a random period of time.


Expected results:

Modified searchplugins should come into effect after one Nightly restart.
