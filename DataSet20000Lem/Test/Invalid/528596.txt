Google Toolbar button not functional in 3.6 nightlies

1. While verifying Bug 492123, I noticed that some of the button in the Google toolbar are not functional (Severe Weather Gadget, Add button and gadgets, Hotmail etc). A sheet drop down below the button using Firefox 3.5.5, and that doe not happen using 3.6.

If I roll back to the nightly from the day before (20091112), clicking on any of the button result in the crash described in Bug 492123.

Probably an Evangelism bug?
