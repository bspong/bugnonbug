When opening a page (either following a link or creating a new tab) Firefox us _lots_ of cpu time resulting in slow interactive response and/or interfering with other running applications.

I can see this on Linux and OS X, and hear complaint from people running Windows a well.

The problem is that Firefox can use so much resource that
- it appears slow (on athlon XP 1800+)
- it may interfer with application that try to do thing like video grabbing unless it priority is lowered
- it is even slower if the priority is lowered

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run Firefox
2. (optional) open several tab
3. load a page
Actual Results:
firefox temporarily (but for a noticeable time) us lot of cpu time

Expected Results:
much le cpu intensive operation, at least comparable to certain unnamed browser
