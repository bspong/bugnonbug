I have noticed a bug after the last update to Firefox/3.6.16 (and several update for few add-on - not sure which ones), the 'New Tab' option is not working anymore.

It is not working by using the shortcut 'Ctrl+T', nor by selecting it from menu File > New Tab, nor by pressing the '+' sign next to the open tabs.

I didn't received any crash reports, or error messages.

The 'new tab' will open only by holding the 'Ctrl' and clicking on any link, which will bring a new tab. The 'open in new window' option apparently it is working fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The new tab is now working:
1. Using the shortcut 'Ctrl+T'
2. Selecting it from menu File > New Tab
3. Pressing the '+' sign next to the open tab

It happens every time, regardless of the focus on the page, or the website's content opened in the browser.
Actual Results:
By making those steps, nothing happens, like the 'new tab' option is not available. The browser doesn't crash.

Expected Results:
Should open new tab.

I am using the default theme.
