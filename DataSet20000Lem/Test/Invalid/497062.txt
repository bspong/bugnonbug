Note: I did try searching if this problem is already reported and this https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=system+hang+3.0+clicking+a+link gave me Zaroo bugs.

I have been a Firefox user for over 3 year and this is the first time I do face a situation of Firefox that appears to hang the entire system based on a specific operation I do - clicking on a link. Maybe, I didn't bump across one such even if it existed.

Interestingly, this problem is intermittent and is unable to be reproduced a often a I would want to get this problem fixed a soon a possible. As we are aware that many others might face this problem but might not have reported it, I step forward to do the same.

I have faced the problem on many website and the link I provided is the one I feel would be helpful to you in finding and fixing the problem. I infer that based on my experience with this problem that I am reporting since it is likely reproducible with this one than others.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
As I said above, this isn't a easily reproducible a we would want it to be, I list the step that I can remember prior to finding this problem

1. Open different website on multiple tab (more than 10). ( Assuming you know which version of FF I am talking about )
2. Open www.testrepublic.com in one of the tabs.
3. If you have an account (or even if you dont) try clicking several link that are available and try having a coverage of thing you can do on the portal.
4. If you are registered, it give you flexibility to add a new post or reply to a post or thing like that which might result in the problem.
5. When you click on a link (and not right click and open on a new tab or window ) that appears to take some time to respond or need some time to load the page - that's when you can stop on performing the action or repeat the step for different links.
Actual Results:
My computer freezes, hang and fails to respond to any action.

I tried

Keyboard Shortcuts to put the system to sleep, hibernate.
Plug in a device, enable disable - Bluetooth, Wifi.
Leave the system for about 10 minute to see if it recovers.
Attempting to open task manager.
The internet connection type doesn't seem to make a difference.
None of the appears to help me in recovering.

I am forced to shut down the computer by pressing the power key and that take a lot of my time.

Expected Results:
Pretty obvious: I (or anyone else who might be facing this problem ) wouldn't want Firefox to cause a system hang and freeze and be able to smoothly navigate from different links.

* I have never seen this problem when I had only one tab opened.
* I have seen this when I have two window each running multiple tab opened and then I click on a link in the web page.
* I tried looking for any log file for the product in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox and didn't find any other than install log and uninstall log.
* I do not see this happening to me with IE ( the other browser that I run whenever I fear I would discover this problem and lose time in rebooting the computer)
* I usually do not reboot my computer often and put it to hibernate. I do reboot the computer at least once every 10 day or so.
* I run Windows Live Care Anti Virus.
* I do not run any significant plug in with FF.
* I do not clear the cache for a long time ( maybe 4 - 6 month ) However, this hasn't impacted this problem
* Some of the tab that are always open are Gmail and Google
* Here is my system config: IBM ThinkPad Laptop R60 :: Intel Core Duo 1.66 GHZ :: 1.g GB RAM:: 80 GB HDD:: Windows XP Professional 2002 :: Service Pack 3 :: Windows Live Care Anti Virus :: IST Time Zone :: Skype always running :: ThinkPad Client Security :: About a quarter million file on the hard disk

* I could provide you with a photograph of how the screen look like

* I am willing to provide support to help this problem get fixed.
