Firefox stop responding to user input and go for huge cpu usage while using the applet at http://bgplay.routeviews.org/bgplay/ (Start BGPlay).
The browser becomes unusable (no response at all) a soon a the applet get loaded, and steal big cpu percentages.
Closing the applet restores normal behavior.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://bgplay.routeviews.org/bgplay/
2. start the applet ("Start BGPlay" button)
3. close the applet

Actual Results:
Firefox hang after step 2. CPU usage peak and no user input seems to be processed by the application a long a the applet is running.
Performing step 3 apparently restores normal behavior of the browser.

Expected Results:
Browser is supposed to be usable while the applet run in background.
