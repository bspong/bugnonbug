* Thailand Protests Slideshow: Thailand Protests

BANGKOK (Reuters) – Flights were canceled at Thailand's main airport on Tuesday after anti-government protester stormed the building, leaving thousand of traveler stranded and threatening the country's tourism industry.

"The departure hall ha been closed," Sereerat Prasutanont, director of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport, the main gateway for 14.5 million visitor to Thailand each year, told TPBS TV. "Flights that are ready to depart can leave, but those that are not ready must cancel their flights," he said.

The move came after member of the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) broke through police line and roamed through the sprawling $4 billion terminal, southeast of Bangkok, a startled tourist looked on.

The airport invasion capped a dramatic day that also saw PAD protester firing on pro-government supporter on a major road leading to the old airport to the north of the city.

Footage aired by public broadcaster TPBS showed at least two PAD security guard firing half a dozen round from handguns. The PAD said they were attacked first with plank and stones.

At least 11 people were hurt, a city emergency service official said.

There were chaotic scene at Suvarnabhumi, a major regional air hub that handle 76 flight an hour and 125,000 passenger a day, after protester broke through line of riot police.

"There are lot of people with stick and baseball bats. They looked ready for a fight. We don't what's going on," Belgian tourist Ben Creemers told Reuters.

Outside the terminal, thousand of PAD member waved plastic hand-clappers, flag and portrait of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, while others slung razor wire across the four-lane access road.

"Our goal is to shut down Suvarnabhumi airport until Somchai quits," PAD spokesman Parnthep Pourpongpan said of the protest, aimed at Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat, who return on Wednesday from an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru.

He would not be landing at Suvarnabhumi, a spokesman said.

The airport siege, one of the PAD's most disruptive act in it six-month campaign, could undermine public support for a movement that appears to be going to ever greater extreme to provoke a violent government backlash.

"It is time to make a clear-cut choice between good and evil, between those who are loyal and traitors," PAD leader Somsak Kosaisuk told supporter at a rally earlier in the day.

PM STAYS PUT

Somchai ha rejected repeated PAD demand that he resign because of allegation he is a puppet of his brother-in-law, Thaksin Shinawatra, who wa ousted a leader in a 2006 coup.

Even though a nationwide strike failed to materialize, the airport unrest could deepen the economic impact of a crisis that ha stymied government decision-making and raised fear about the export-driven economy's ability to cope with a global slump.

The government forecast this week that the economy would grow just 4.5 percent this year, it slowest rate in seven years.

However, Thai share and the baht shrugged off the protests, with the main stock index up 1.5 percent a Asian bourse rose after the U.S. bailout of Citigroup.

Opinion poll show waning public support for the PAD, an unelected coalition of royalist businessmen, academic and activists.

Some analyst say it powerful backer in the Bangkok establishment, including Queen Sirikit, are getting cold foot about the damage the political strife is inflicting on the economy.

"The people who've been backing PAD in the background have got frightened that it's getting out of control. It's a threat to public order and even the structure of the state itself," historian and political analyst Chris Baker said.

Despite his tie to Thaksin, Somchai's bland, inoffensive personality ha proved a hard target, and police are determined to avoid a repeat of October 7, when two protester were killed and hundred injured in street battles, the worst unrest in 16 years.

Bloodshed could trigger another coup only two year after the army removed Thaksin, but army chief Anupong Paochinda reiterated on Tuesday that a putsch would do nothing to resolve the fundamental political rifts.

The PAD enjoys the backing of Bangkok's urban middle class and elite, while Thaksin and the government largely claim their support from the rural voter and urban poor who returned them in a December election.
