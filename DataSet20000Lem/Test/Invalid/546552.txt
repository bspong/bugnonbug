On the easteregg about:robots I first get the "Try Again" button.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to location: about:robots

Actual Results:
See above.

Expected Results:
I thought it should start with "do not press this button".

Maybe this is because i visited this already, month ago? Still I would expect to start all over when revisiting about:robots
