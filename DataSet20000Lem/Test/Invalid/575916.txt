Add Add-ons Manager menu entry to Firefox button menu
The Add-ons Manager is probably one of the most used menu entry which is not accessible from the Firefox button. And a long a bug 465090 is not fixed we also don't have a keyboard shortcut. That will force user to always disable the button in favor of the default menu bar.
