Noticed this problem a few month ago when using a different machine using. Vista. Am now on a Windows 7 64K machine and problem persists. Frequently when I come back from Hibernate mode Firefox say it is offline, won't go back to online. Close the browser. Then reload w/ icon, say firefox is already running, have to use task manager to close the process in order to use it again. Used firefox for year w/out this problem. As it is happening on 2 different machine and operating systems, I have to think it wa introduced sometime in the last 6 months.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use firefox
2.Hibernate or sleep machine
3.Use machine again - if firefox tab say loading and stay that way AND/OR say working offline, close window, restart firefox error say already running, must use task manager to close in order to open a new session.
Actual Results:
a above.

Expected Results:
should have closed firefox.exe w/out having to use task manager.

None
