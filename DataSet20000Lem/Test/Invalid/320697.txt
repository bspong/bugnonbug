Initially firefox 1.5 start with 24Megs (appox), but a tab are opened memory utilization keep on increasing (which is normal). But EVEN after CLOSING all tab the memory utilization doe not drop (may be drop by 2-3 megs).
Over the course of a day Firefox 1.5 is consuming around 178 meg of memory with only one tab.
Closing the browser doe not kill the process neither dy memory utilization reduce. May be I'm not that patient but after a minute or two I usually go in task manager and kill the process manually and then restart FF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run FF 1.5 --check the memory utilization in the task manger (I'll suggest keep it open with 'always on top')
2. Open a new tab (or a few new tabs), keep browsing a usual. Close the tab once done
3. Memory Utilization nearly stay the same a when all tab were open. Usually after a couple of hour it consumes more than 150 MB of RAM

Actual Results:
started with 24 megs, at the time filing this bug (as I opened a few tab ) now the memory utilization with only two tab is 56888K (actual utilization)

Expected Results:
Memory utilization should drop once tab are closed
