When you search for some word by the Find dialog it doesn't end the search. It
just go on searching for the word in a loop. I think the app should tell me
that I have reached the end of the page and now whether I want to search from
top. Also if there is only one instance of a word in a page, find will be
trapped there and just doesn't respond. It is right in it place a it is
resting on the only find instance. Some sort of message at this context would
help avoid confusion.
