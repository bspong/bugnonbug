On certain websites, Firefox 3 render some font bigger than Firefox 2 and also make text bold that other browser (IE7, Opera, Firefox 2) render a unemphasized. It look like this only happens with "default fonts" (ie. font with no or minimal CSS attribute applied) and I have only seen it happen with sans-serif font like Arial and Verdana (or open source alternative of those).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a website that cause Firefox to display the font in this way (ie. Libsyn.com)
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Some text is displayed too big and bold, which make the site look very ugly and in some case break the design of the affected sites.

Expected Results:
Text should be displayed a it is displayed when I visit the site in Firefox 2.
