It seems that Firefox doe not handle multiple channel in one RSS feed properly.
My feed system ha multiple channel that have their own individual feed URI, but I've also implemented an "all" URI which add all the channel into one RSS feed.

Now it seems Firefox assumes that there is exactly one channel per feed, ignoring the <title>s of subsequent <channel>s in one <rss version="2.0">.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a Live Bookmark for an URI that provides multiple RSS channel
2. Expand that bookmark

Actual Results:
The title of the first RSS channel is used to name the bookmark, subsequent channel <title>s are not shown

Expected Results:
Preferrably, a Live Bookmark with multiple channel should look like this
"Feed Name" --> "<title> of 1st channel" --> "<title> of item #1"
--> "<title> of item #2"
...
"Feed Name" --> "<title> of 2nd channel" --> "<title> of item #1"
--> "<title> of item #2"
...
