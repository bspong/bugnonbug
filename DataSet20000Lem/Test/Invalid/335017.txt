I try handle mms:// protocol but i have a problem with link that are in form in "action" method. This is the code wroted on the biggest polish portal:
<form style="margin: 0pt;" action="mms://stream.onet.pl/media.wsx?/film/200604/928c189dfc.wmv">
<input type="submit" class="btn_yellow" value="Tak"/>
</form>

I set in prefs.js options:
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.mms", "mplayer");
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.expose.mms", false);
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.external.mms", true);
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.warn-external.mms", false);
but movie dont want open so i try figure whats goin wrong.

I've made a script 'test.sh' which wrote adress to my home directory. Exacly code:
#!/bin/sh
echo "$@" > /home/users/kamil/test.txt

and i change option "network.protocol-handler.app.mms" in pref.js from mplayer to test.sh:
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.mms", "test.sh");

I test this set and script return to the file test.txt only a part of adress. I get "mms://stream.onet.pl/media.wsx?" but i should "mms://stream.onet.pl/media.wsx?/film/200604/928c189dfc.wmv". If i typed this adres directly to the adress bar script return to the file full, correct adress. Also if I set network.protocol-handler.app.mms to mplayer and i type adress mms://stream.onet.pl/media.wsx?/film/200604/928c189dfc.wmv directly to the adress bar mplayer play this movie. Only if adress is wroted in action method this doesn't work:(

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set in prefs.js options:
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.mms", "mplayer");
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.expose.mms", false);
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.external.mms", true);
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.warn-external.mms", false);

2. Make a page with form like this below (orginal code from the biggest, polish portal):
<form style="margin: 0pt;" action="mms://stream.onet.pl/media.wsx?/film/200604/928c189dfc.wmv">
<input type="submit" class="btn_yellow" value="Tak"/>
</form>
3. Open page in firefox and click on the button

Actual Results:
Mplayer try play adress "mms://stream.onet.pl/media.wsx?" beacouse firefox return only half of adress.

Expected Results:
Mplayer should play movie "mms://stream.onet.pl/media.wsx?/film/200604/928c189dfc.wmv" but he doesn't play it because firefox return only half adress and mplayer try play "mms://stream.onet.pl/media.wsx?".
