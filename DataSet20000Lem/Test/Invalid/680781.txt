Firefox 3.6.20 asked to load a self-signed java jar ignores CN etc and report a "UNKNOWN" asking the user to "always trust content from this publisher" and if this mean always trust UNKNOWN we need that to be changed to 'unknown from that website'.
Created attachment 554744
dialog raised by encountering self-signed jar

If a web site deploys a self-signed java jar, firefox 3.6.20 come up with
the attached diaglog. It doe not display any of the configured item like CN
from the code signage but asks the user:
The applications' digital signature cannot be verified. Do you want to run the application?"
Name (blank)
Publisher (UNKNOWN)
From: (website and port)
checkbox: always trust content from this publisher.
The problem is what doe it mean "always trust content from this publisher?" Needs to be clarified. And it should not enable any self-signed code from any website. It should enable only self-signed code from that website (and/or that
website and that port.) The latter would be fine.
