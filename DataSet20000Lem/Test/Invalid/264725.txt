Bad CSS rendering when repeating background
When i view this page on firefox 0.9.3 or 1.0PR on any o the cs that is supposed to fill up the top
table with the striped background doesn't work.

The code for both the table and the cs is attached below, along with a screenshot of how it should
look (safari) and how it look on firefox

The code is valid xhtml 1.1 and cs
