Several bookmark that I have recently saved bring up incorrect page when I re-select them at a later date. I think I have figured out the condition this occurs. See 'Reproducibility'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Save a bookmark, either with Cmd-D, or by dragging to the Bookmark toolbar.
2.While still in the current tab, with the bookmarked page, load a new webpage (from the address bar)
3.Quit and re-launch Firefox.
4. Launch a new tab and try and load the bookmark. Instead of being the intended saved URL, you will get the page subsequently loaded into the tab.
Actual Results:
The retrieved bookmark wa the page most recently viewed in the tab that wa bookmarked, not the intended saved bookmark.


I have Foxmarks installed, but this is happening before any Foxmarks sync ha taken place, so I don't think they're to blame.

I also have the TabsMixPlus extension installed, although I don't know how this might affect things.
