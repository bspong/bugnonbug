Rapid Release compatibility issue making user switch back to explorer

Steps to reproduce:

Rapid release is making user all around me switch back to internet explorer, or chrome.

The major release number changing all the time make them nervous; they feel a though there is something badly wrong with a product that ha a new major rev every few weeks.

Releasing a "stable" update that disables all HP printer is just plain dumb. Yes, HP software is lousy, but we all have to live with it.



Expected results:

Put it back, please. This new philosophy RE update is not helping anyone.
