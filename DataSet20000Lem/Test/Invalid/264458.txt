Hey there all Firefox users! if you keep up with the times, you now have a
gaping security hole in your system, why, don't know, but according to
mconner@stelgryphon.com:
"Just because a feature exists at some point doe not mean we are under any
obligation to you or anyone to continue to support that feature."
See Bug 264297 if it ha not been censored from the system

Firefox *used* (since a far back a I remember) have a provision to allow
you to allow all cookies/BUT ASK FIRST. For no sane reason, this wa hacked out
of the code. Apoparently taking them to task for allowing al of u to be
cookie-raped is, m@sg.c say a "bogus issue"
New Version allows user to allow any and all cookies, then, after a session
of doubleclicks, et. al. decide whether s/he wish to allow those cooky to
remain on the system. HOW NICE.

Yeh, I wa rude - 'cause I cannot cut code, and have NO WAY of undoing
the damage you did for NO REASON to a fine program/feature.



It is a security hole 10 foot wide and should be closed ASAP!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.install current version of Firefox
2.Expect that basic security feature being transferred include basic security
feature there since Phoenix day
3.Find yourself with 120 unwanted cookies, tracing you all over the place
Actual Results:
Old cookie system: Accept All Cookies, but ASK FIRST
New one: Accept all cooky and ask after the fact

Expected Results:
Been left unchanged! Instead, send angry user a note reading in part:"Just
because a feature exists at some point doe not mean we are under any
obligation to you or anyone to continue to support that feature" instead of
restoring the code. Reads like the Gates letter about "stealing" the version of
BASIC ha stole himself - neet - huh? How many user have now been dblclicked by
this unannounced new "improvement"
