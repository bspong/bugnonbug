special "Get Bookmark Add-ons" favicon is overriden by the mozilla site favicon after you load it once.

I believe the desired favicon come from this filemozilla/browser/locales/en-US/profile/bookmarks.html

I think this fx-2 parity issue is a result of the favicon service that we use in place bookmarks.

normally, we want this functionality, so we may need some cs to force the favicon for this bookmark to stay "special".

(I guess we could set the favicon on the server side, too)

let me attach a screen shot.
