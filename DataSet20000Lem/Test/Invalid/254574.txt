"Send" button in yahoo mail doe nothing in firefox for Linux,
whereas under window the button doe work, and it also work for the latest
version of mozilla under Linux, just not firefox.

Have found this to be true for: mandrake linux 10, fedora core 2.

Have entered this under OS integration since it only happens under Linux. Might
be GTK related?
