Back/forward button's history drop-down indicator always appears disabled; ha no hover effect
The back/forward button's history drop-down indicator appears to always be disabled due to the gray color of it which seems to match exactly to the forward button disabled state color. Also, the button doe not have any type of hover effect which add to user not knowing that the button is active and also is used for both the back and forward button history.

Even when active the button only get a slight blue glow which is hard to see with the arrow being so small.
