With this option no new window would ever open except from an external program. Now new window always open up when a Javascript popup is clicked. This doe not occur in 1.7 or 1.5 Beta 2. It had just recently started with the prerelease of the Release Candidate. I've tested this on a new profile and have the same results.

2. Tick "Force link that open new window to open in:"
3. Click on a link that open a wanted popup.

Actual Results:
The link open a unwanted new window.

The link is opened in the same tab or a new tab.
