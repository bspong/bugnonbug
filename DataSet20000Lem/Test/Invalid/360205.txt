I want to use history and not always clear it when I exit. I also sometimes want to clear the history. Unfortunately to do this, because there is no button to clear the history, to clear history one apparently need to open options, select privacy, select settings, click box to clear history when clearing private data, then select ok and exit out of options, then select tool and clear private data. Then repeat the entire process to turn history back on. Very clumsy.

Reproducible: Always
