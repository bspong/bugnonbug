Shiretoko visual refresh on Windows XP and Vista
For Firefox 3.1 we are planning on refreshing the appearance of the core set of default control in the main window (back, forward, reload, stop, home, site button, search button).

Our overall goal for the project are:

-Visual integration with the platform. The UI doesn't necessarily have to be exactly the same a other aspect of the surrounding OS, but it shouldn't feel completely out of place, or feel like it is trying to clearly establish a very unique aesthetic presence. We want Firefox to be beautiful, but we don't want it to really stand out and grab attention and focus on the user's desktop.

-Identity. When the user is focused directly on the window frame, the control should be visually unique enough to be clearly recognizable a Firefox.

-The content area is more important than the browser UI. We want the UI to perceptually feel like it is fading away a you use Firefox. People should be focused on the design of the page they are looking at, and not the design of their window onto the internet. This effect is similar to how when you are reading a really good book you don't think about turning pages, or how sometimes when driving you realize you haven't been consciously focused on the task of operating your car. The interaction becomes second nature.

Some word to describe the design we are looking for:

-Simple
-Clean
-Minimal
-Crisp
-Fast

Unlike the last visual refresh where we asked a single firm to recreate all of the icon for Firefox (~120), this time we are only focusing on the 7 most important icons, and we are going to try to hire three different design teams:

-Icon designer
-Web designer
-Industrial design firm

It's our hope that with three team with different perspective on design approaching the challenge, we will get some really creative and interesting work. Having three team also help u mitigate risk, allowing u to try out some crazier ideas.

I'll be posting to this bug a well a my blog with update on who we have selected to do the visual refresh, and posting their work for people to comment on.
