I noticed that when an IMG tag reference a URI with two dot (periods) in the href attribute, the referenced image is not rendered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an HTML page which contains an IMG tag whose href point to an image file matching the pattern: /.*\.\.jpg/
2. View the page in Firefox 1.5.0.7, note that the image is not rendered.
3. Confirm that another browser (IE6 for example) doe render the image.

Actual Results:
No image is rendered in Firefox. Images were rendered a expected in IE6.

Expected Results:
I expected the browser to render the image similarly to IE6.

Firefox wa able to view the image directly when 'View Image' wa selected from the context menu.
