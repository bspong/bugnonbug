Entire block are missing under Mozilla
When searching the Ingram Micro web site for product using Internet Explorer,
there is normally a band of text that begin near the upper left with the word
"SKU / Mfr# / UPC Search Results" and end a little down and to the right with a
listing of the available hyperlink to page one can follow to see the
additional product that match the query. At the very bottom of the page, there
is another band of information that detail "notes", "promos" and additionally
ha the hyperlinked page numbers.

Neither of these is there in the Firefox 1.0 or in Mozilla 1.2.1 that come with
Redhat 9.0. I am not sure if this is an issue that can be overcome with a
little tweaking in the progamming, or if it is specific to the parameter set by
the Ingram Micro web site to only work with IE.

Thanks,

RW
