On loading the page sun.com, firefox crashes. I originally loaded it in a tab,
then tried it by itself. I don't like submitting bug like this, but I tried to
save the page from IE and duplicate the problem, but the saved page didn't have
the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load sun.com
2. Crash.

Actual Results:
Firefox crashed

Expected Results:
Load the page without crashing

I wasn't using any strange theme or plugins. So, I'm not sure why this
happened. I am a web developer (alienpeach@gmail.com) so, if you need help
trying to figure this one out, just let me know what to do.
