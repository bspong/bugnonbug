For some reason, when first loading either https://bugzilla.novell.com/ or https://innerweb.novell.com/ Firefox 2.0 pause for several second (if not minutes) before it show anything.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart browser
2. Go to https://bugzilla.novell.com/
3. wait

Actual Results:
Page take a really long time to load

Expected Results:
It should just load up fast-like.

First off, I would like to apologize for filing this under "General". I have no idea what is actually going on.

I would try to report this to the server admins here, except that I do not see this problem with Firefox 1.5 or any other browser, so it must have been something that changed between 1.5 and 2.0. If you have any specific question you'd like me to ask them, I can certainly give that a try.

I tried to see which request wa hanging, but it wa difficult. The HttpLiveHeaders only show *completed* transaction (and only work in 1.5). It would be nice if Firefox had an "activity" window like Safari which would display pending connections, or something.

Thanks and good luck.
