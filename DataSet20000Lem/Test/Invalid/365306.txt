Help!!
I'm not sure what all this other stuff mean but my main problem is that when I turned on the computer and got onto the internet I found that Mozilla had been updated. Now my problem is that more than half of my bookmark have disappeared and when I try to make ninemsn.com.au my home page, nothing happens. I'm not sure what to do but I would really like to have my bookmark back!!
