Currently (Firefox 4 trunk), HTML field with required attribute are displayed with a red border halo (probably box-shadow). However, that is most of the time bad merged with the website style and can look bad.

A simpler style (or no browser-style at all) should be preferred instead of the shadow.

Reproducible: Always
