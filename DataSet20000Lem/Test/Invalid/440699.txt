After clicking on the Bookmarks menu on Google Toolbar, Firefox doesn't load any page when typed in address bar, selected from bookmark or refreshed.

Reproducible: Always

1. Click on the Bookmarks menu on Google Toolbar
2. Refresh any page, type a new address or select bookmark

Actual Results:
Page doe not load , is not being refreshed. The status bar say loading...

Page should be loaded

Using the Tamper Data, I have noticed that when clicking the Bookmarks menu, request is being done for each bookmark in order to download the favicon of the bookmark. When there is many bookmarks, the status of last one remains a pending... and the problem occurs.
