In Firefox 2, clearing the history wa simple - use the Clear Now button in Privacy options. Firefox 3 doesn't clear out the history. I have also tried this running FireFox 3 a Administrator with the same results: History is not cleared.

This also can be considered a security issue a well since clearing the history prevents people from seeing where you have been.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3 RC2
2. Visit multiple website
3. View history via arrow on right side of address bar
4. Clear history via Tools->Options->Privacy->"Clear Now" button
5. Click on arrow on right side of address bar
Actual Results:
History is not deleted a it should be. This history is persistent between invocation of Firefox 3.

Expected Results:
History is cleared. This functionality can be seen in Firefox 2.

A side issue to this is that "Always clear my private data when Firefox closes" in Privacy doesn't work either. As said before, this could be construed a a security issue a well.

I have no extension installed and I am using the default theme.
