Star button not on default toolbars
Since the Star and Feed button became customizable (by bug 322989 ?), they do not appear on the default toolbar setup of a new profile (nor on existing profile but that's le surprising) and must be added manually.

A related issue is that in the Customize Toolbars UI, the Star and Feed item have no icon (but they do appear when dragged to a toolbar).
