With the add-on installed and enabled the printer attribute are changed and the installed printer doesn't work correctly. When attempting to print from Firefox or IE (latest version) the command is accepted but no printing occurs. It also affect ADOBE ACROBAT which also will not print. Nor will ADOBE DISTILLER print.
With the Add-on uninstalled the printer and both browser work a anticipated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install the PDF Download add-on
2.Go to a web page
3.Attempt to print the page
Actual Results:
Printers failed to work when attempting to print, with an error message of insufficient disk space for FIREFOX, and "res://C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\SHDOCLC.DLL/preview.dlg" error message for IE

Expected Results:
It should have made no difference in printer operations, instead printer operation were erratic.

ALSO, When using the add-on and attempting to open a PDF file the a new window open for the PDF file but any attempt to scroll or move the cursor over the new window result in a blank page which necessitates reloading the page several times. This add-on doesn't seem to be necessary because ACROREAD32.EXE, if installed, can open any PDF type file from the browser.
