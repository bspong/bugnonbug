Problem with the numeric part of Apple numeric Keyboard
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; fr; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

Firefox 2.0.0.1 (206120417) crash systematically when typing numeric key on my Apple numeric keyboard KY64604J1W1WA on my MacPro under MacOs Server Edition version 10.4.8.
I observed that the Keyboard Icon type (in the menu bar) change automatically from the "French 123" to "French" type each time I type a numeric key in a Firefox windows.


I hope I help with this bug report. Best wish and thanks for your nice work.
