Firefox will not show a frame that ha 'ad' surrounded by number (i.e. 1ad1)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040615 Firefox/0.9

I first noticed this when a phpMyAdmin (on one of the site I handle) wouldn't
display the left frame. I thought it wa phpMyAdmin but couldn't find an
answer. So I decided to copy the source and see if changing thing will work.
I discovererd that the two culprite frame had an src of
"left.php?something&amp;hash=ad0209ontblah". By deleting each character and
reloading, the ad0 turned out to always cause the problem. So I created another
page just to test this hypothesis:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">
<html>
<head>
<title>phpMyAdmin 2.5.2-pl1 - www.ckiweb.com</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" >
</head>
<frameset cols="150, *">
<frame src="1ad1.php" >
<frame src="test2.php" >
</frameset>
</html>
I verified that it wa valid HTML (phpMyAdmin us XHTML and I had that
validated too). Running this page only show test2.php. 1ad1.php isn't even
called from the server (LiveHTTPHeaders told me that). I have also changed that
src to left.php?1ad1 and I get the same problem. The number can change and
extra character can be added around the number but 'ad' ha to be surrounded
by at least one number on each side. (I believe the error will occur with 'ad'
surrounded by anything but character i.e. ?ad&)

Another URL with XHTML and the 'ad' inside the GET is
http://students.cs.byu.edu/~tdr32/test.php

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. View Web Page.
Actual Results:
In test1.php, only the right frame load
In test2.php, the left-top frame won't load

Expected Results:
All the frame should load
