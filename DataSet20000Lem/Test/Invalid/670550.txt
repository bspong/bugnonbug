Closed tab can't be recovered (they don't show up in the menu too) [caused by TabMixPlus]
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0

Steps to reproduce:

I wa on the Aurora channel, and shortly after updated to 7.0.


Actual results:

Ctrl-Shift-T stopped working (it doesn't bring back closed tab any more). The menu "History -> Recent Closed Tabs" is empty.
