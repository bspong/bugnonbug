Please, for the love of God, fix your goddamn browser. I routinely see memory usage creep up to and beyond 800MB, even when I've closed down to only one or two tab open in a single window. Tonight, I've had to hard quit firefox more time than the I had to hard reboot my last PC running windows. I doubt I'll even get to the end of this post before it lock up again. Fix it. Fix it. Fix it.

Fucking FIX IT!

This is the last night I'm ever dealing w/Firefox shit again. Either it works, or it don't.

Right now, and for the last SEVERAL weeks, it don't.

Fix it.

Please.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I used to develop software.
2. Bugs like this were considered hard-stops.
3. Yet you guy release new version after new version, without fixing the fucking issue you have with memory and performance.
Actual Results:
I would have fired anyone on my dev team who allowed a program this shitty out of QA.

Expected Results:
A program that isn't a memory hog, and that doesn't crash more often than the last PC running Windows that I owned (about 5 year ago).

Pls forward to a manager.

Now you, pls forward to your manager.

Now you, pls forward to a VP, preferably one who give a thin slice of shit about customer experience and satisfaction.

Now you, asshole, FIX THE FUCKING PROBLEM !!!!!
