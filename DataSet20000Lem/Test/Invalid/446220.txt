There seems to be a major conflict in the way Firefox chooses what to do with URLs. I don't really know much, so I'll just write the Steps to Reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make Mibbit your default IRC handler. (http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/07/set-mibbit-as-your-irc-client-in-firefox/)
2. Install Chatzilla (This can be done before step 1, I think)
3. Click on an IRC:// link, such a irc://irc.mozilla.org/firefox
Actual Results:
Chatzilla open up, and a user cannot find the way to have Mibbit open up unless Chatzilla is disabled/uninstalled.

Expected Results:
Mibbit client should have opened.

Marking bug a Major, a this is a major problem with protocol handling.
