suppose the page is start.php which contains a script-X

"var dummy = eval ('some text')"

and suppose the page is called a follows

"GET /start.php"

The problem is that after the first "GET /start.php" request, a soon a the script-X is executed for the FIRST time, the browser resends the request "GET /start.php", even though the page is not reloaded or refreshed. NOTE that the content of the page aren't refreshed , the browser only sends a request.
( Live HTTP header wa used to see these request )
Also, even if the script-X is changed with another script-Y

"var dummy = eval('()');"

the behavior remains the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create any page "start.php" with a script having eval function like
<script type="text/javascript">
var dummy = eval ('');
</script>

2. Open the page in the browser. Simultaneously, monitor the http request being sent by the browser.

3.It'll be observed that "GET /start.php" is sent twice, even though the page is loaded only once. The first execution of any eval statement cause the page request to be sent again

Actual Results:
It'll be observed that "GET /start.php" is sent twice, even though the page is loaded only once. The first execution of any eval statement cause the page request to be sent again

Expected Results:
"GET /start.php"
should be sent only once.

I wa using the default theme.
