about:home - defaultSnippets remains hidden with some prefs set
Not sure this is a real bug, but worth to report it.

When I have pref.js with only these two prefs:

user_pref("browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID", "20110201211505");
user_pref("browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone", "rv:2.0b11pre");

then a newer build of firefox trunk doesn't unhide the two span here:

<div id="contentContainer">
<div id="snippetContainer">
<div id="defaultSnippets">
>> <span hidden="true">Thanks for choosing Firefox! To get the most out of your browser, learn more about the <a>latest features</a>.</span>

>> <span hidden="true">It's easy to customize your Firefox exactly the way you want it. <a>Choose from thousand of add-ons</a>.</span>
</div>
