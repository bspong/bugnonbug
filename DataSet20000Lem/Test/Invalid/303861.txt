Software Update icon on toolbar is not customizable
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

The Software Update icon cannot me moved to another place on the toolbar, or
removed from the toolbar altogether. The only way to remove it is to set
display: none on #softwareupdate-item in userChrome.css.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Customize dialog window.
2.Drag the Software Update icon into the window, or to another location on the
toolbar.


Actual Results:
The Software Update button remained in place.

Expected Results:
The Software Update icon should have moved to the window, or other location on
the toolbar.

I am submitting this bug a Major because being able to customizing the toolbars
is a major feature of Firefox, and it is broken by being unable to move or
remove the Software Update button.
