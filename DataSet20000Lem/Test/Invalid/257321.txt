firefox assumes file:/// link improperly in any dir or root dir.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

I attempted to link to a file in the root of the disk and it showed differently.
In MSIE, the status bar shows: file:///C:/index.html


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the file to any folder
2. Change the .bin extension to .html
2. Open the file in Firefox
3. Click the link OR hover over the link and look in the status bar.

Actual Results:
Nothing happens if you click the link.
The status bar shows: file:///index.html

Expected Results:
it should have assumed that the index.html is in the root dir (i.e.
file:///c:/index.html )
