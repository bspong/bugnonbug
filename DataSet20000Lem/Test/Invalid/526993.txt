Invalid extension ID cause extension checking to stop
I wa having a problem with 3.6 where my extension compatibility wasn't being checked.

What I found wa that I had a pointer in my extension directory that pointed to an install.rdf that didn't match.

I got the error:

Error: installLocation is null
Source File: file:///Applications/Firefox%203.6%20Beta%201.app/Contents/MacOS/components/nsExtensionManager.js
Line: 1866

in the console and checking wa aborted, so only three of my 40 extension showed up.

This failure case should be better handled.
