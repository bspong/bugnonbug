firefox always cache item to disk in favor over caching to the faster cache-device of "memory". It is common practice in any cache design to use the fast-cache device FIRST, and when it fills, use the slower cache -- you want to keep thing in fast cache when possible, when that cache is available.

See bug 105344. I quote Bradly Baetz, comment 3: "Remember that our cache currently will save all non-ssl
web page to the disk cache, not the mem cache - we don't cascade down."

I am reporting this a a bug a I have observed and complained about this behavior only to have it ignored a 'chance' -- but now I see it is by design that the slower disk cache is used instead.

I don't want the disk cached used -- I DISABLE it -- but still I don't get memory cache use. This is clearly not correct behavior. I don't know of any device that us a slower cache when a faster one is available. (CPU's disks, etc. all use the faster medium 1st). I delete my cache at the end of my browsing session, so it's of no benefit to store it on disk. As it is now, I get virtually no benefit from my memory cache. Current stats (typical, even after long sessions, though, when enabled, like now, disk cache will be larger):
Memory 44 item @ 800K out of 1024000K used.
Disk: 448 item @ 5120K out of 150000K used.

Insane! I have plenty of memory that I'd like FF to use when I browse -- it's slow enough a it is, and anything that go to disk in Win7 is really slowed down (probably isn't noticeable under linux, sigh)...




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. is present in code -- and documented in bug database.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
memory cache get used a small fraction of disk, when memory would be much
faster.

Expected Results:
use memory over disk enabling speedup -- especially on window where disk
activity is throttled.
