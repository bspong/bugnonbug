I have reproduced this problem in FC7 with both the latest Epiphany and Firefox (both with and without the webdeveloper extension), and on the latest Firefox on Windows. I have searched for bug report and not found this problem, so.....

I am not sure why this particular example is failing-- other file with multiple stylesheets work fine.

In the above example, two different CSS file are linked in the original simple HTML file. If the first stylesheet applies, the hyperlink text turn red. If the second one applies, the li element display a border. The text is red, but the border is not displayed. If the order of the stylesheets linked are reversed, the border display on the LI but the hyperlink text doe not change color.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the html and cs file above.
2. Reverse the order of the CSS files.
3. If you have webdeveloper installed (optional), disable and re-enable stylesheets to see what I wa expecting to see.
Actual Results:
Only first stylesheet applies properly, regardless which stylesheet it is.

Text of hyperlink is red, no border around list item.

Expected Results:
text of hyperlink is red. List item show red border.


Information from webdeveloper:

At first I thought this wa a webdeveloper bug because if, in webdeveloper, I disable CSS and then re-enable it, the page display a expected. Furthermore, if I edit the CSS and click the reload button on that pane, the cs applies properly *and* the second cs file appears a a tab in the edit cs pane.

DOM Inspector:

The DOM Inspector show the proper LINK element regardless of whether they are applying to the rendering of the output.

Error Console and XHTML Validation:
Document validates by it DTD
No error are displayed to the error console.
