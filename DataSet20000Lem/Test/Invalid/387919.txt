Cannot choose RSS feed reader with Roboform installed

I noticed that with the Google Toolbar 20070525W extension installed that any time I went to an RSS Feed page, the menu list of RSS feed reader wa not getting populated on the feed subscription page such that I could not choose a feed reader. I finally determined that for whatever reason the menupopup with the id of handlersMenuPopup (see chrome://browser/content/feeds/subscribe.xhtml) wa never being put into the page so the menu wa never being populated by the call to SubscribeHandler.init() (which call the FeedWriter.js file).

I originally blamed Google Toolbar, but I have since seen it with certain other extension combination installed (Del.icio.us bookmarks, FEBE and Google Notebook wa one combo) which lead me to believe it may be a Firefox bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Google Toolbar
2. Go to chrome://browser/content/feeds/subscribe.xhtml

Actual Results:
Only the last chosen feed reader is listed. There is no way to choose a different reader since the handlersMenuPopup menupopup element is not in the page.

Expected Results:
The handlersMenuPopup should be in the page which would then get populated by the _initSubscriptionUI in FeedWriter.js allowing the user to choose a different reader.

The easiest way to see this is by installing Google Toolbar.
