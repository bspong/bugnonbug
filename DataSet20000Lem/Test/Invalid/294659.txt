If I middle-click or ctrl-click on a bookmark it always open on the foregound,
independently from the setting "Select new tab opened from links" in the
Options window. The word "links" is key here. Apparently bookmark are
considered to be different than links, but it's not a very clear difference. It
seems inconsistent that I can choose to open new tab in the background for
link and not for bookmarks. This setting should be added to the Options window,
or create a unified "Select new tab opened from link and bookmarks".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Unset the "Select new tab opened from links" option in the Options windows.
2.Middle-click or ctrl-click on a bookmark.

Actual Results:
The bookmark open in the foreground. Middle-clicking or ctrl-clicking on link
open them in the background.

Expected Results:
More consistent configuration setting or behavior.
