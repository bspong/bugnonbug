Front Page photo gallery do not display properly in Firefox. I have a Front Page photo gallery on our website that display 5 thumbnail with arrow to advance or go back on either side & you are supposed to be able to click on a thumbnail to display the larger photo below. In Firefox, the gallery spread the thumbnail all the way across the screen and customer get highly irritated with us. If you open the gallery in IE or Slimbrowser, it display perfectly fine. I would love for our customer who use firefox to be able to access our photo page properly. Can you make any suggestions? Is there perhaps some html code I can insert into the page that will correct this error when someone open the photo page in firefox? Thanks, Alicia Taylor-Bender
