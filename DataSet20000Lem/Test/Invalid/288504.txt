I am using the 1.0.2 installer on ubuntu linux 4.10.
I'm running the shell script from a root terminal to install firefox into
/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox.
While I make installation choice I get the error reported in Bug 246701, then
the terminal print "*** loading the extension datasource" and then the main
installer window is replaced with a small window that say

"Firefox is finishing installing extensions. This could take a minute..."

How long is a minute meant to be? It's been about half an hour now... ;)

Reproducible: Always
