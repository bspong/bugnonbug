I extracted the following bug from a much larger style sheet and removed all styling that doesn't affect the bug:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View the attached file bug.html (my result are in screen shot bug.png).
2. Compare result for ok.html (screenshot in ok.png).
Actual Results:
The html file contain a list and two <hr/> row after the list:
<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
</ul>
<hr/><hr/>
Text

In bug.html, I added CSS styling:
ul { width: 100%; float: left; }

This cause the two row to disappear. The text after the row is still visible.

For comparison, the file ok.html without CSS coding show the row correctly.


Expected Results:
In both cases, the two horizontal rule should appear on the page.

I will attach the source file and screen shot immediately.
