Recently, i wa watching some episode of certain show in a website that us a Flash interface for open a video player in a popup window, i got big memory leak (like Firefox using up to 220MB of pagefile!). Also, in Linux FF, when you watch a lot of video (let's say, more than 15), popup blocker start to block window even for a whitelisted site, forcing me to restart Firefox to see more videos.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.angelfire.com/tv2/wbot/, then try to watch any episode (In Linux, you can't see almost any text. FF or Flash bug?. In that case, hit on the green buttons). You must allow popups for this site.
2. Open the videos. Ignore the "missing plugin", there are no plugin for FF to see VP6-packed NSV videos.
3. Watch FF memory usage. When you close a popup, see that memory used for it doe not get fully released. (As a side note, when you try to open another episode in a existing popup, you will get a blank page. When you click again, the video player appears. Is either that, or close the popup and let it again to pop)
4. Repeat until hog your system (Win), or until popup blocker start to fail (Linux)

Actual Results:
- Big pagefile/swap space usage, up to 220MB!
- Linux: popup blocker block popups on allowed site. Since these are launched by the Flash movie, these cannot be open using the popup blocker menu. However, it only fails for the "offending" site.

Expected Results:
- Normal memory usage, not big leak
- Popup blocker should not block anything after a while for allowed site.

Another bug that happens on that site is the following: On the bottom is a link for download the episodes. It's a "javascript:document.location..." link because the server that host the video don't allow external link to the files. However, if you hit there, you will get an error, because Firefox is sending the URL of the open document a a referrer. The solution is copy&paste the link in a new tab/window. Is this a feature or a bug?
