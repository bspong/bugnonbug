When a window is open and File->Open Location... is invoked (either via the menu or the keyboard) focus is given to the address bar.

When no window is open and this command is invoked, a new window open and show the "Open Web Location" dialog. It seems to me that open location should behave in this context in exactly the same way a the new window command.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all window
2. Invoke File->Open Location...
3.
