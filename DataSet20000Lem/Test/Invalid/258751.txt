usability feedback for consideration
suggestion regarding wording/default preference setting recieved from a
feedback alias

1. "Allow Web site to install software" isn't clear that it isn't
allowing _all_ sites. I would recommend "Allow some Web site to
install software" with the button "Advanced". At the moment the
"Exceptions" button look like it is saying that it is a black list
(when the pref is checked) or a white list (when it is not).

2. "All file downloaded to: [&] Desktop" should look like a link when
you hover over it, not like a button. The button style used is not the
same a other buttons, and it isn't clear it's taking you somewhere.

3. The JavaScript prefs should automatically *default* to disabling JS
movement of window and focussing windows, IMHO. No user actually
want window doing that. (Resizing, sure. Moving? Focussing? No.)

4. There is a pref that say "Move system caret with focus/selection
changes". I've seen the same pref in IE. I had no idea what it means.
It should probably be renamed to "Show system caret when
focus or selection change (F7)".

5. There is a pref "use autoscrolling". It is not clear what this does.
Better (on X, at least) would be a radio button:
(o) Use middle mouse button for panning
( ) Use middle mouse button for pasting URIs
Even better would be to remove the pref, always have it on on Windows,
and on X have the middle mouse button check the CLIPBOARD selection,
paste if there is one, and failing that, pan.

6. I have no idea what "Select new tab opened from links" means.

7. The "Bookmarks > Quick Searches > Open in tabs" menu item is a useless and
somewhat confusing feature.

8. Image resizing should not have a pref. It doesn't need one. It should
just remember the last state.

9. How to create and use a Web page in a sidebar is not clear at all. I
have seen several user attempt (of their own accord) to use this
feature (which they assume must exist) and have great difficulty.

10. If I want to add a keyword for a search, I don't want to have to give
a name a well, since I'll never be using the search a a bookmark.
Just use "Keyword search '%s'" a the name, where %s is the keyword.

11. Shouldn't keyword search be always in their own folder in bookmarks?
Or at least by default in a folder that only appears in the Manage
Bookmarks window or something?

12. The monospace font size should default to the same value a the
proportional font size.
