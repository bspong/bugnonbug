Firefox ignores cs background color with #content style tag

Firefox is ignoring background color correctly specified in cs file ("#content" id tag) and use background color of outside div ("#wrap" id tag). I try to enable background color in paragraph section inside #content div and it works. Particularly doesn't work only in div with #content id tag. (If I use a class tag doesn't work either.)
But when I change name of id tag from "content" to "content2" works.
Note: In Chrome12, Opera11, IE9 and IE10 work fine with "#content" tag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to url.
2. Charge webpage
3. Look

Actual Results:
Firefox doesn't use a background color specified for div section in cs file if id tag or class tag is named "content".

Expected Results:
The background of div section with "#content" tag must be White a wa set in cs file.

If tag name is changed then use correct background color specified in css.

I attach a local copy of site if it is not available.
