I suggest that Firefox would create a new approach to efficient advertising. The essence of the approach is in more precise targeting that is defined by the user. Now advertisement targeting is carried out in such way. A web-master defines a list of keywords. An ad-server show relevant ad. In this case a website is in an intermediate between the users` interest and advertisement conents.
I suggest that Firefox would provide a possibility for the user to define one`s interest by his own. A user should have a possibility to describe a set of keywords, that correspond to one`s interests. These keywords should be available for the queried page to propose relevant content and ads. A web-page should have a possibility to propose a user to extend and to detail the list of keywords with the supposed ones.
This suggestion can increase advertisement efficiency and overall use for the surfers.
