CSS Inheritance between html element doe not work a specified in the W3C Recommendation
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I have not found a lot of information on it but from what I have found at:
http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-CSS1-19990111#inheritance FireFox doe not
properly support inheritance. From what I have found the information
in "steps to reproduce" should result in font-sizes that are identical. I
base this on what I have read of the W3C Recommendation and how IE handle it.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an HTML File with the following code in it.
<table id="BodyPanel">
<tr><td>test</td></tr>
<tr><td><table><tr><td>test2</td></tr></table></td></tr></table>

2. Make the required CSS data for BodyPanel and set it's font-size to like
10px or something. The inner table will not inherit the BodyPanel's font-size.
Actual Results:
Different font size

Expected Results:
same font size
