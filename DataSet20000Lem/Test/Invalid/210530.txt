When filling in a form (including this bug report) I cannot use the left-arrow
key, either the one between the qwerty key and the numeric keypad, or the one
on the numeric keypad.

pressing the key crash the application, and the following message is left in
the window that started the app:

GLib-CRITICAL **: file gstrfuncs.c: line 186 (g_strconcat): assertion `string1
!= NULL' failed.
Pangolite:

The application is running on an Ultra 5 workstation with a "type 6" Sun
keyboard (it say type 6 on the underside)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any page that ha a form (including
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi)
2. put the focus in the form field
3. type some stuff, and then press the left arrow key (not backspace, not del)

Actual Results:
pressing the key crash the application, and the following message is left in
the window that started the app:

GLib-CRITICAL **: file gstrfuncs.c: line 186 (g_strconcat): assertion `string1
!= NULL' failed.

Expected Results:
it should have moved the cursor one character to the left instead of crashing

It took me about 6 try to enter this bug report -- I kept trying to use the
arrow key, which kept crashing the browser :(
I did a "vanilla" or default install -- download the file, untar it, start using
it. I am using the default theme, mostly the default configuration, with a few
preference set via the menu (no manual edits)
