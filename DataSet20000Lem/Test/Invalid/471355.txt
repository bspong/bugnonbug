www.google.com could not be found. Please check the name and try again.








The browser could not find the host server for the provided address.




* Did you make a mistake when typing the domain? (e.g. "ww.mozilla.org" instead of

"www.mozilla.org")


* Are you certain this domain address exists? Its registration may have expired.


* Are you unable to browse other sites? Check your network connection and DNS server settings.


* Is your computer or network protected by a firewall or proxy? Incorrect setting can interfere with Web browsing."
