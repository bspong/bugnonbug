Firefox 3.6.X/3.7.X hang on opening the page

First of all, doesn't happen on Firefox stable it seems (3.5.x official releases, 3.5.x nightlies not yet tested).

Browser hang when page is opened, tested with JIT on and off, with and without javascript and in and outside safe mode. Addons were of course taken offline with safe mode.

Happens on http://japan.cnet.com/news/ent/story/0,2000056022,20396479,00.htm , http://blog.livedoor.jp/htmk73/archives/2004276.html and on most of the currently online article of CNet Japan it seems.

Has been happening for quite a while now it seems. Several Windows environment seem to replicate this behaviour (both 3.6pres and 3.7pres), while a randomly tested linux environment with 3.6b5 and a win2k3 server with Gecko/20091103 Namoroka/3.6b2pre don't replicate it.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open one of the aforementioned link
2. Firefox doesn't respond, hangs. Doesn't crash.
Actual Results:
Firefox hangs, you'll have to kill it by hand.

Expected Results:
Page load normally, leaving you to browse onwards.

Using 64bit Windows 7, with 32bit 3.6 and 3.7 nightlies. Default theme etc., java and flash installed.
