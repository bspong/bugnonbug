possible laptop "mouse" problem - or problem with crashing randomly
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Since updating to Firefox 1.0.4 I have had a strange problem that I do not see
on your list of problems. At random intervals, when I try and select an option
on a webpage or attempt to scroll down the page using the far right hand side
arrows, Firefox will freeze. The window go blank, and then one of two thing
happens - either the browser crash completely and ha to be restarted (usually
ok with all it part intact) OR the browser stay functional but loses all of
the bookmarks, bookmark toolbar tabs, and sometimes the yahoo toolbar. This
problem ha increased in frequency over time since downloading the latest
version. I cannot seem to link the problem to any specific website, but the
site I visit most often are: www.fark.com, usgs earthquake activity, usgs
volcanic activity report, aish.com kotel wallcam, yahoo and yahoo messenger, and
u-connect university of kentucky and webuk. Unless there is some background
function the browser is doing of which I am unaware, the episode seem
completely random. It now happens at least once every time I go online.
Interestingly, the part about the bookmark disappearing ha only started in the
last week or so. Before that it wa just the white screen and then a crash when
attempting to scroll or select something using the laptop's "mouse buttons."

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox and check email at yahoo, or go go fark.com, or usgs.
2.attempt to scroll down screen using far right lower corner arrow, or click on
any option button on the page, using either a USB mouse or the laptop "mouse" keys.
3. if screen go blank, wait several seconds.
Actual Results:
One of three thing will happen: a) the screen will refresh and act normal; b)
the browser will give a message saying it need to close, or will lock up, and
everything will be fine when you re-open it; or c) when you re-open, all
bookmark and bookmark toolbar data will be lost; and rarely d) the yahoo
toolbar will disappear but reappear when you restart (so far this ha not
permanently disappeared and needed to be redownloaded. Only the bookmark
disappear permanently, so far). The problem appears in page that have not been
bookmarked and page that have - there seems to be no pattern whatsoever that
would indicate why the bookmark vanish.


Expected Results:
I am uncertain whether the problem is with the browser understanding the mouse
commands, or whether some hidden function of the background operation is being
attempted and is failing. I lack the technological expertise to determine
exactly what the problem is - but what the browser should have done is scroll
down the page, or go to the new page a selected, and leave the bookmark list
intact.

My computer is a gateway m305crv vc1.0, approximately 2 year old. It is running
window xp home edition, and internet is connected either by a home lan using
dsl, or wireless internet card add-on when at the university. The problem
appears in both internet environments, though it occurs much more frequently at
home. The lan ha been using the same hub that it wa before I updated firefox,
so I don't think that's the problem. I am also running norton antivirus,
pestpatrol, window firewall, and the wireless card software, all of which were
being used before the update. I am very happy to get to the end of this long
form with no problems!
