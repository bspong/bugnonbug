After starting Firefox it installed an update. I closed the browser. When I restarted it all the add-on (e.g. AddBlockPlus and FoxMarks) vanished from the add-on manager. The file of all add-on I can already find in the particular folder of Mozilla but I cannot find a function to change there path. There is no update listed in the chronic of update for this day.

Reproducible: Always




Theme: "Gray and Black" from MaDonna; installation of the update: 22nd of July 2010
