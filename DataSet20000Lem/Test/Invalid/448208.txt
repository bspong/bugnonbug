If you hover over a bookmark in the bookmark toolbar, you get a yellow tooltip describing the bookmark. This is good. Now press whatever key you have assigned to the show desktop command in expose (this is the one that slide all of your window out of the way so you can see the desktop.) Notice that the Firefox window slide one way, and the tooltip slide in a different direction! (It appears that the tooltip is a distinct window.) The tooltip actually remains visible because it is small enough that it can't move completely off the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover over bookmark on bookmark toolbar
2. Wait until tooltip show up
3. Press show desktop expose key
4. watch tooltip fly off in the wrong direction
Actual Results:
On my machine, the tooltip fly towards the menu bar, while firefox move off the right side. The tooltip wind up on top of the menu bar.

Expected Results:
Tooltip move with the browser window
