I receive a popup window every time I close firfox and sometimes while it is
open.It is SpecificPOPNetwork-Mozilla. I can check adlock after the popup window
appears to remove the ad but not the popup window. It appears that this is a
part of the Mozilla program and is embed to pay for the program. Is this
correct. If not how do I stop the popup? Marvin

Reproducible: Always

1.Load firefox
2.Browse
3.close firfox

Actual Results:
SpecificPOPNetwork mozilla appears.

Expected Results:
Eliminate the popup
