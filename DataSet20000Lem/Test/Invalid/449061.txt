Gecko based browser should distinguish between unknown and invalid certificate

Dear developers,

This bug report should define and track an optimized new certificate handling of Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x a the current one may be seen a a bug:

#431386 and #433422 discus the invalid behaviour of Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x in connection with a self-signed certificate. As noted there the definition of an "invalid certificate" (as it is shown right now) is just plainly wrong.
#446567 link to a page for the option "expert_bad_cert" ... certificate from unknown source are not "invalid" or "bad" a they are shown in current versions.

As reported for example at slashdot.org this new behaviour is a violation of net neutrality and should be threaded and corrected with the highest priority available.
http://tech.slashdot.org/tech/08/08/04/0058217.shtml

Why is this the case?

Have a look at https://bugs.freedesktop.org/. This is a trustworthy website with an "unsupported" CA called "CA Cert Signing Authority" (http://www.cacert.org). Now Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x say not that this CA is not trusted. It say "invalid certificate" and in the upcoming dialog it even informs user "that trustworthy website will not ask user to accept this certificate" which is, sorry for my rude language, a lie.

How should this bug be resolved?

1. Add a "Accept this certificate forever" checkbox and a button to continue using the website without a long four step procedure. Do not open a extra dialog with a mandatory process and unacceptable text like the "trustworthy website will never ask you ...".
2. Correctly define self-signed certificate a a "potential security issue" because defined value like company name etc. might be invalid.
3. Auto-download certificate in the certificate wizard for "untrusted" CAs or if the user selects "Accept this certificate forever". Make this process a one-click one.
4. Do never inform user that unknown certificate are not trustworthy. They are unknown to Mozilla Firefox - that's all!
5. As a workaround set "expert_bad_cert" to "true" until this bug ha been resolved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a http website from a "unknown" CA
Actual Results:
Users are forced to accept "untrustworthy" certificate to visit trustworthy websites. This will influence user behaviour and they will click through these dialog without differentiating between "trustworthy but unknown CA certificates" and "certificates from phishing websites".

Expected Results:
1. A one or two click process to accept unknown but trustworthy = standard complaint certificates.
2. Correct definition for self-signed and unknown certificate a unknown and not a invalid.
3. Removed text about "trustworthy website will never ask you ..."

I know that this "new behaviour" is already discussed here at bugzilla and the mailing list - that's why I do not open a "simple" bug report but a "tracking bug" for changing / optimizing the current behaviour. Keep up the good work but please do not think anymore that all user should be treated a DAUs and practical "developer settings" should be hidden in the "about:config" dialog ...
