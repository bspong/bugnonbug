In yahoo music I cant create a station. After entering all detail for create
station, the button create station doe not work. The browser doe not hang
though. It may be a java error. Or it could be that once the radio station is
created the output come in another smaller window which is getting blocked ( a
pop up) but I think this is unlikely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just go to yahoo.com->music->customise my station
2.Enter the detail
3.Press create my station

Actual Results:
Nothing!!!! That is the problem.

Expected Results:
It should have said station created and then allowed me to listen to it.
