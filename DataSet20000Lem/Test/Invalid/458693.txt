If i close firefox and attempt to open it again, window show a message "firefox is still running". Then I open window task manager and i try to close program using end proccess but it remains open. I only close the program if i restart my computer, which take so much time. Also, before this proplem happens, i have noticed that firefox wa uncapable to open any web page.
