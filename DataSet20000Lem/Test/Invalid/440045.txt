Firefox doe not zoom some of the flash out there like on my site http://jeenaparadies.net or
on http://last.fm (they have a flash medium player). I don't know what exactly the
problem is but in my example:

1. the flash us allowScale=false to crop exactly like the background image
2. the flash ha width="100%" and height="139"
3. there is no <embed> only <object>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add a object with flash (allowScale=false)
2. zoom the site with cmd +
3. you'll see that the flash will not be zoomed
Actual Results:
The flash will not be zoomed.

Expected Results:
The same a with Opera and IE7/8, the flash should zoom too, like all background images, etc.
