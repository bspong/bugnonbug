The government (California) us the image provided below on their web pages:

<img src="http://pub2k5dev.sconet.ca.gov/gifs/whiteSpacer.gif" alt="" width="126" height="2">

When you run a government web page containing the tag above, ALL *secure* page will ceased to work, paypal.com, AOL login, Yahoo login, etc., until you close your Firefox browser and reopen.

I've tested this bug on IE and AOL Explorer, neither have this problem.

Something with this GIF file cause problem for Firefox. While it might be the government fault, Firefox should overcome the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the URL provided.
2.Now, try to load ANY secure page (SSL) from a different web site.
3.Be disappointed. :)
Actual Results:
Browser say "Connected to (web site name)" and eventually time out.

Secure page (SSL) should load.

I've used Firefox 2 and greater with the same result.
