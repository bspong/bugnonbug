Everytime I close firebird and I have multiple tab open there is a dialog box
that asks whether to save the tab or close tabs. There is also a dialog box
asking to never ask again. Evertime i check the dialog box and close all tabs,
Firebird crashes. Note: I have tabbrowser extensions, but I don't think that is
the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mutiple tab
2.Close firebird using the X button or file/close
3.check the box for never ask again
4.click close all tab

Actual Results:
Firebird Crashes with a window dialog box

Expected Results:
Closed browser, not ask to save tab history again.
