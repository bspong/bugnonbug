Incredibly slow startup time

Firebird take 5 second to load on my pc on a fresh boot. Other browser come
up almost instantaneously. I have got a power machine: P4 2 mhz chip, 500 mg
ram, 500 mhz bus. I think I can get better hardware, but only marginally so.

I have another older box I also use. It is pack a PII 333mhz chip, & 191mb ram.
It is a dual boot with win98 second edition on one side and Knoppix/debian on
the other side.

There firebird take 13 second to load on a fresh boot while IE 5 come up
almost instantly and phoenix with quickstart ( on the window side ) come up in
about 1 second.

I guess at some point every machine, no matter how much of a killer it wa when
it came out, becomes "slow" by current standard and is not worth the time of
the developer in supporting it.

However, a lot of people are still on PIIs( and le ) and browser far older in
tech then firebird run better.

My PII is still incredibly useful and fast on my linux partition( using icewm ).
The only thing missing is a fast browser. If I had that I could have gone on
using the PII for several more years.

Just a thought. Please don't be offended. I have been very impressed with
firebird( and mozilla in general ). My ONLY issue ha been performance on startup.

It seems like it is not a priority so I am posting this bug/feature request here.

Firebird is a dazzingly modern, sleek browser. Please make it perform a well
a old clunkers like netscape 4.8 and IE 5
