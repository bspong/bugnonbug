When I first set browser.ctrlTab.previews to true, I almost filed a bug report because I saw no dialog, even with two tab open. Of course, I needed to have at least three tab open. I would like to be able to change the minimum number of tab that must be open before the preview pane displays. Personally, I would like it to default to 1. I find that user get confused when hotkeys change behavior based on the current context.

Reproducible: Always
