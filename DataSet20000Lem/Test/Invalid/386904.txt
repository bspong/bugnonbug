install:: for DIST_FILES and DIST_CHROME_FILES

-- Summary:

This patch implement DIST_FILES a well a DIST_CHROME_FILES install::
target.

-- Evaluation:

DIST_FILES is now used in browser/app/Makefile.in to install
application.ini; however, DIST_FILES is only implemented for
libs::, but not for libs::.

In consequence, make install'ed installs of firefox now break
with missing application.ini file.

When writing this fix, it became obvious that DIST_CHROME_FILES
install: target is missing too ... though it doesn't cause any
problem because it not really used.
