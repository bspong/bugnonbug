When I specify the font cs property a

font: normal 100px inherit;

Then the font property is totally ignored, not the normal or the font size is adheared to either. If I set the font family to an actual font then it act a you would expect and the whole rule is obeyed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Specify a font-family on the body say Verdana
2.On a child element, specify it font cs property as, font: bold 100px inherit;
3.Expect that the child element will be bold, 100px in size, and have the font Verdana.

Actual Results:
The font rule is ignored, it ha the font family from it parent, but it doe not apply any other rule of the font cs declaration.

Expected Results:
All the other property of the font declaration to be obeyed and the font family from it parent to be applied.

Works a described in the expected result in IE.
I went into firebug after I applied the font declaration with an inherit font family and none of the style appear there a applied. Its a if it just ignores the font declaration in this case.
