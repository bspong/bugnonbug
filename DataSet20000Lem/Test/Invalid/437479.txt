When I create a job with Altiris Deployment Solution to remotely execute the Installer with the /S switch, Firefox successfully installs on XP but not on Vista. It probably behaves this way with other remote installation software that most large company use. I've seen this problem with other software package and you can usually reproduce it by getting the Installer to run with a /S under the SYSTEM account.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run "Firefox Setup 3.0 RC 2.exe /S" a the SYSTEM account while logged in a a user.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox doe not install

Expected Results:
Firefox installs
