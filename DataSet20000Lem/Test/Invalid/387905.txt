I have noticed that with some site that I have and others, that the favicon area cause the page to appear to not finish loading. The icon in the top right continues to spin and the status bar show "Transferring data from...". It appears to only do it on the Mac OSX. I have tested the same page on Windows and do not get the same problem.

On any page where you visit the favicon itself, it will not stop spinning and show "Transferring data from..."
