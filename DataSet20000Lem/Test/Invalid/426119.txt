Having the most recent release of firefox and adobe flash, Firefox will still crash after about 15 minute of using live.yahoo.com. Works good for that first 15 minutes, but after that when I try to return to "Home" page live.yahoo.com, Firefox lock up. Happens everytime.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to live.yahoo.com
2. spend about 15 minutes, navigating to different "channels" regularly.
3. click "Home", near top, firefox locks.
