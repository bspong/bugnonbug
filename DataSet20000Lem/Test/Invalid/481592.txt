When the private browsing mode is started from a window le state after exiting the mode all session information are lost. That includes the "history | recently closed tabs" and the bfcache. Also only all tab are killed and only a blank tab is displayed!

Steps:
1. Close all window
2. Enter Private Browsing mode
3. Leave Private Browsing mode
4. Inspect the History menu

This is a critical regression which is caused by the checkin of bug 480874.
