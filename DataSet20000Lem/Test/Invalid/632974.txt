lap top would not load win 7 . the second time it happend window start up repair/recovery set it back to the last restore point.this eliminated the problem but also firefox 4 beta 10, Like it while i had it. Back to crome for now or i might try Firefox 3.6. I use Norton 360 and like the card and log ins.
Crome don't have Norton toolbar.Fox wa way quicker than IE. Cheers Steve
It may not be Firefox problem but i had made no other change and it ha not happened since the beta wa removed.

Reproducible: Sometimes
