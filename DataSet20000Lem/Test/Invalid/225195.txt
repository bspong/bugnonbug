I don't know if I'm just stupid, but I'm finding it impossible to reorder my
bookmarks. The name column is automatically highlighted when I open the bookmark
manager (OS X version), and dragging folder or bookmark around seemingly
place them in random spots.

The Personal toolbar is the worst - there's absolutely no way to override the
default behavoir of Firebird trying to order the bookmark for you. Very
frustrating.
