Steps to reproduce:

Firefox updated itself (security update from 30/08/2011)


Actual results:

impossible to navigate on any website, I had to restore to the previous version.
Navigation OK with another browser, so the problem is linked to the security update.
This happened 3 times. I checked out automatic update in the Firefox option to prevent this but the update load anyway each time I restart Firefox.


Expected results:

1. An update should not block all navigation
2. There should be a way to go back to an earlier version without having to restore my computer
3. There should be a way to prevent an unwanted update, even a security one
