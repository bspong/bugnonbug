To conserve paper, I print even page first reversed and then I take the even page and put them into the input tray to print odd page only (not reversed)on the other side. In this way I get double sided printing done. When the total page count is odd the system fails. When a reverse order of even page is requested, page 2 is duplicated. When odd page are to be printed, it print page all the odd page except the last one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select a PDF document with an odd number of page and print the even page in reverse order. The last page (page 2) will be duplicated.
2.Select a PDF document with a odd number of pages. Print the odd page only. The last page is not printed.
3.
Actual Results:
For example, when a reverse order of even page is requested for a 9 page PDF article, it result in printing page 8,6,4,2,2. (Page 2 is duplicated and is extra). Then when I ask for the odd page to be printed, it print page 1,3,5,7. The last page is missing (Page 9 is not printed).

Expected Results:
When even page in reverse order are printed, an extra last page (page 2) should not be printed.
When odd page only are printed, the last odd page should be printed.

In the above example, a 9 page PDF document, even reversed page printed should be printed a follows: 8,6,4,2. The odd page should be printed 1,3,5,7,9.
I'm using Adobe Reader version 8.1.0 and Foxfire 2.0.0.4. I've done double sided printing using two pass before with earlier version of Foxfire and Adobe Reader with no problem like this.
