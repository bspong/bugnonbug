I just wanted you guy to be aware that when I updated to the new patch. Microsoft essential said that I wa infected with a Trojan and when I ran a anti-malware program it said that the file wa from the ff-update.exe. It did not let me use firefox, internet explorer, and task manger a it wa saying that they were infected. After I wa able to remove it I installed a firewall but I am concerned that other people might have the same problem or this wa just a random event. But when I downloaded it your virus scan should have picked it up.

Reproducible: Didn't try




It target your web browser and task manger a far a I could tell.
