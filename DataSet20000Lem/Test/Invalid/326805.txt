Every time I open my firefox browser an alert box appears -Alert! Could not Load nsIFCompareService - Icancel it and another Alert box appears TypeError:this._farewatcherservice.init is not a function.

It disappears after I cancel each one 2 time in succession but reappears when moving to another page inside the browswer. It doe not do this on IE so I am turning to you - the browser of my choice to try to help me get rid of this annoying Alert sequence.

Finally, do I need to unistall Mozilla and/or Firefox to do this. How do I save my bookmark if I have to uninstall?

Thanks for your help , ed taylor
