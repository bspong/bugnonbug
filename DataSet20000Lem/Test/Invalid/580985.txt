Has been to my PC Shop. Came back with this fault. Shop suggests I may have a virus, but no help a to how to get rid of it It wasn't there when it went in for "clean up."
I can get rid of it by re-booting, but it could come back in 5 minute or tomorrow.
Here's the odd bit, which suggests it's in Mozilla. I go to IE, and it type normally. Go back to Firefox and the problem is still there.
Do I cancel Firefox and go back to using IE?
My intuition tell me the shop ha a virus on the PC it is using to download all my stuff onto, whilst it cleaned mine.I had to reload Firefox when the PC came back. Is this a likely explanation? The shop is being totally uncooperative, but I have to know how to get rid of this problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Keep typing in Firefox until it occurs again
2.Go into IE. It type normally
3.Go back to Firefox, it's jibberish again.
Actual Results:
Closed PC. Re-booted. Problem gone, until next time, which could be whilst typing same letter


Expected Results:
Obviously I hoped it would type normally in future,
but it keep coming back.

Tried doing a set up at a previous date. But the date only go back to immediately after the day it went into the shop, so couldn't solve it this way.
The shop had cleaned the earlier dates.Have tried a date since the shop episode, but that doesn't cure it.
I have the free version of AVG which scan daily.Just done a complete PC scan and no error reported. I use C-Cleaner about once a week.
I have downloaded a fresh version of the latest Firefox 3.6.6, but the problem still recurs
