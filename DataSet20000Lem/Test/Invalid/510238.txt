I have used firefox for a while and have repeatedly download pdfs from common site such a the above http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120.pdf

I am no longer able to open or download pdfs in firefox - can utilize safari and they open (and are download-able and save-able)

What happened to my wonderful firefox. I now think this is also happening with the postage purchase program at usps.com - I first thought they were not compatible with mac, which is not unusual - but now I think it is firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to website http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120.pdf
2. hit form and publication
3. try to open i.e. form 1120 or 1040 - a screen open but it is blank.

do the same in safari and it is fine. I have used firefox for a few year to obtain these document and it ha never failed before
Actual Results:
a screen open but it is blank and it say "done" in the bottom left corner

Expected Results:
usually a screen open a a pdf -if it is fill-in-able or a screen open and asks if you want to open file with adobe or save it to disk.

I have used http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1120.pdf

phoenix.gov - production manual

and usps.com

to open pdfs for at least two or three years. This doe not happen in safari (FYI I do not like using safari)

Thank you!!
