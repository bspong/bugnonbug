When I use the built-in installer for a new version, my cooky get corrupted and gmail refuse to show my inbox. I have to delete the cooky to get it to work (with all annoying consequences).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the installer to update FireFox/Minefield (I have gmail loaded)
2. Restart FireFox/Minefield
3. Try to load gmail at the URL given above
Actual Results:
A warning that gmail could not load, with a link to a Help page which tell me to remove the cache and the cookies. Removing the cooky make it work again.

Expected Results:
Gmail should be able to lopad, cooky should not be corrupted by the installer.
