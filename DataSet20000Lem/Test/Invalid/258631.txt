STR:

1. Download 0.8 build, create bookmarks, history, add extension and theme
2. Download and launch today's nightly build
3. Fresh profile is created, am unable to see/use the 0.8 profile that I created

Further investigation by Asa and myself indicates that 0.8 creates a Phoenix
directory on the Mac - it look a if when the nightly launch it is unable to
find the directory and use the profile I created for 0.8.
