When I tried to print the order confirmation from a1nutrition.com I got this weird 'Printing' screen (see attachment) with the red text in the bottom-left part.

After I closed this screen an I pressed 'Print' again I get the screen with the title 'Printer Error' having exclamation mark and 'Not available' on it.

Other tab print ok.

Never saw

Reproducible: Didn't try
