searchbar-engine-button only child inside a very anonymous box without attribute

The button element with class and anonid "searchbar-engine-button" is placed inside a box element without any other child or any attributes. I am assuming this is a bug, because the only difference I see is that it unnecessarily break backward-compatibility with add-on and unnecessarily complicates the DOM structure.
If this is not a bug and there is an advantage to this, then I apologize and please WONTFIX this.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
In older versions, searchbar-engine-button is simply placed inside searchbar-textbox.
