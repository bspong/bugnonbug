PHP file not accepted without MimeType, disabling WebDev tool preview in browser.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040416 Firefox/0.8.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040416 Firefox/0.8.0+

Summary: I understand that in handling file Firefox check the MIME type sent
by the server (which is to be expected, of course), and that if the MIME type is
not recognized, and it isn’t in some manner of pre-configured list of type to
render regardless (e.g. JPG, GIF, HTML), the program give you two choices: 1)
save to disc, 2) open with default application.

Problem: I use Macromedia Dreamweaver to develop Web page in various Internet
language including PHP. When I try to preview in Firefox, something that is
quite important for developer trying to make sure their site are fully
supported in Mozilla and company without extra stress, I am presented with the
dialogue box and given no option to view the file.

Solution: Given the nature of this issue I would like to propose that PHP (along
with other obvious Internet language like ASP perhaps if they are not included)
be added to the list of file type to render whenever Firefox encounter them
even without a proper MIME type. This would allow people who code their site
in various tool that have preview option to use Firefox (and perhaps Mozilla
too) in previewing these files.

Problems: I don’t see any myself. Some might wonder if this would ever lead to
problems, but I can’t imagine why. Can you really think of many case in which
a PHP file being sent to Firefox/Mozilla would be for anything other than the
program actually rendering them? I suspect this might also have something to do
with many download script on the Internet failing a well. I realize that
local PHP script will contain element Firefox won’t be able to render, but
given the circumstance under which this will take place I definitely think a
change should be made.

And if the later is involved (download script not working) it would be a change
that would improve usability for people who aren’t geeks—the sort that don’t
like to use browser that put them in cryptic unexpected situations. Also, if
denied, it would be very wonderful if some configuration or preference option
(even in about:config) could be added for geek like Web designer who would
like to see this functionality, making FireFox and company work a expected and
also making it easier to develop for these browsers.

Additional suggestion: The dialogue box presented in this situation should be
given a third option; “Open with FireFox,” just in case the person using the
browser want to do just that. This might help to ease problem for file type
that the user might not actually want to preview in Mozilla.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create PHP file in Dreamweaver
2. Attempt to preview in FireFox.

Actual Results:
Presented with a dialogue asking if I wish to 1) save to disc, or 2) open with
'default application' (which ironically is the very one I sent the preview from).

Expected Results:
FireFox should have rendered the file. If not that, the dialogue box should
certainly have offered an option to open with FireFox (and while this would be a
good feature to add, in my opinion, it doesn’t truly solve the concern above
given the annoyance of dealing with the extra step).
