[Mac] FF3-b5-rc2 installs on OS X 10.3 although OS unsupported. Working FF2 blown away.

According to the 2007-06-26 Status update, Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) support ha been removed from Firefox 3 (http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3/StatusMeetings/2007-06-26#Mac_OS_X_Update).

However, the installer allows one to install Firefox 3 beta 5 rc 2 on OS X 10.3 PPC without complaint (in my case, over a working Firefox 2 installation). Firefox 3 now refuse to start.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Firefox (ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/3.0b5-candidates/rc2/firefox-3.0b5.en-US.mac.dmg)
2. Mount disk image
3. Drag Firefox icon to Application folder icon
4. Indicate that it is ok to replace the existing Firefox installation (mine wa 2.0.0.13)
5. Observe that Firefox will not start
Actual Results:
Starting FF3 from either the dock or application folder, the Firefox icon bounce in the dock momentarily and then stops.

If one start FF3 from the command line, the following message is printed to stderr:

$ ./firefox-bin
dyld: ./firefox-bin Undefined symbols:
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/XUL undefined reference to _kCGColorSpaceGenericRGB expected to be defined in Carbon
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/XUL undefined reference to _kCGImageSourceShouldAllowFloat expected to be defined in Carbon
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/XUL undefined reference to _kCGImageSourceTypeIdentifierHint expected to be defined in Carbon
Trace/BPT trap


Expected Results:
In the best of all worlds, FF3 would support OS X 10.3 [See NOTE below].

Barring that, the installer should refuse to install FF3 on OS X 10.3. It should absolutely refuse to blow away a working FF2 installation on an unsupported platform.

Submitting a Critical since this installation behavior will wipe out a previously working Firefox installation without warning.

NOTE: This machine's main purpose in life is web browsing, so there ha been no driving need to upgrade the OS until now ($129 solely to get FF3 is a bit steep). The irony is that FF3's enhanced performance and memory usage should extend the life of old hardware. Regardless, it is still lovely software. Many thanks.
