Hovering over a url now display a small white box down the left hand side of the screen instead of in the status bar, and hovering over this box result in the url preview switching over to the right hand side. The question question is why is this necessary? So that user can gain that little bit extra more display space? Making thing fly all over the screen is confusing, and if a user really need to get at that small area that wouldve been hidden by the box, they can just scroll down anyway. The trade off of more space for confusion doe not seem justified in my opinion.

Regardless of this, it is very inconsisant to have the url preview display on the right hand side of the display if someone open a search field via ctrl+f or /. Why should the preview switch sides? It's not getting in the way of the search field in the event someone need to display a url. I see no good reason to have the url preview display on the right hand side in one scenario but on the left hand side any other time.

I think that the url preview should display on the left hand side only under all circumstance (or at least one I can conceive of). To do otherwise is to create confusion in the end user through inconsistency, which is exactly what user don't want from a product. I know I for once have found myself searching for the url preview box on numerous occasion due to this nonstandard implementation. Indeed, good software design involves consistency not just across the product itself, but across other software product like it. To be able to simply pick up a product and already know how to use it/what's going on is a good sign.

Reproducible: Always
