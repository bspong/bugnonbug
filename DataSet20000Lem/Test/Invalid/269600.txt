get rid of the unnecessary '&client=firefox....' for google search plugin
This is the other side of a coin to bug 269469. Using 'User-Agent' sent via
HTTP, google ha no problem recognizing Mozilla Firefox and other gecko-based
browser supporting UTF-8. However, in firefox 1.0, google search plugin add a
completely unnecessary (afaict) 'client=firefox....' at the end of the search
URL sent to google, which get in the way of google's ability to recognize
firefox a being able to handle UTF-8.

If 'client=firefox....' is really necessary, this bug should be invalid and we
have to work with google to fix their problem. If it's not, let's just drop
'&client=firefox....'.

See bug 269469 comment #0 a to how to reproduce (note that it's in UTF-8)
