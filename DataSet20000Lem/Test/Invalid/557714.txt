I have mozilla on my desk top; a week ago,I would click on the icon, and would immediately get to my internet provider. Now, if I do that, I get an instant error message "Connection wa interrupted".

If I use Internet Explorer to open up, I can then get to Mozilla Firefaox and proceed a usual. Hopefully, this will be fixed and I will njhot have to dump mozilla.

Thanks
