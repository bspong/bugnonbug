In Google Docs on Mac Firefox (haven't tested on other OSes) you cannot use the shortcut key that are on menu in Google Spreadsheet at least. It override with the Firefox one I think where I want the key to do what it say on the Google Spreadsheet menu. This stop thing like cut, copy, paste, find working when you use Cmd-X, C, V, F. The modifier show on the Google menu, they just don't work.

This doe work on Google Chrome fine.
