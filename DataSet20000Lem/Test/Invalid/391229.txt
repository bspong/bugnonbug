I have set my startup option a "show my window and tab from last time".





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
scenario A
1. open 20 tab
2. open DownThemAll manager [may work with any other extension process left running?]
3. Close Firefox but leave DTA manager open
4. restart firefox

or

scenario B
1. open 20 tab in 'main' firefox window
2. open a second firefox window with 1 or 2 tab
3. Close the main Firefox window
4. close the second firefox window
Actual Results:
scenario A: when firefox restarts it open to blank window, no tab are opened. All data from prior session is lost.

Scenario B: On restart, FF remembers only the secondary window data. All of the data from the 'main' window is lost

Expected Results:
I would expect/desire that FF not lose session data due to inadvertent closing order where the 'main' window [desired to be resumed, restored] is closed before secondary window or extension process are closed.

At a minimum, a warning notice that other windows, extension are active, and that all restore data of the window in focus will be lost on closing and not retored on restart.


alternatively, have a 2+ level session backup option and show all windows/tabs from prior session, with button/command to go to 'previous session'.
or
reopen:
[ ] window with 27 tab
[ ] window with 2 tab

Keep data from all FF window during a session, not just the tab on the last FF window or extension to be closed.

I am not sure of the optimal function.. but having some mean to restore a session under these circumstance is the object.
