With 1.5.0 you could reduce the width of the window until the address bar only displayed the icon and the scrollbar would remain visible. With 1.5.0.1 ha a fairly large minimum size (roughly 1.5 time the standard width of a single tab in the default theme) and this result in the scrollbar vanishing sooner.

Given that I've customised the menu bar to include the navigation bar, this happens at a fairly large width.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Display content that need a scrollbar
2) Reduce width of window
3) Watch scrollbar vanish
Actual Results:
Scrollbar vanishes

Expected Results:
I'd expect the location bar to keep shrinking, a it used to

Occurs with the default theme.
