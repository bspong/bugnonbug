Just installed FF 2.0 3 day ago and have a problem. When opening up I believe 9 or more tab the horizontal scroll bar now cover up the tab almost entirely. Depending on which browser skin you use,and I've tried 3 so far,it either almost completely cover the tab up or cover more than 3/4 of them up with the scroll bar. It doesn't help to move the scroll bar to the bottom either a the tab move with it and you get the same problem. Can anybody help me here? Thanks

Reproducible: Always
