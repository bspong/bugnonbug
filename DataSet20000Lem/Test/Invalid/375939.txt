Firefox, unlike in IE and Opera, will highlight all the text in the url / location bar field and the search bar field when click just once within either. The obvious problem with that is if you are merely trying to change one letter (and say look back down at your keyboard like so many people do, especially people new to computers) all of the text in either field end up being erased.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type two letter in the search or url field.
2. Click once in between the two letter to add a letter or attempt to edit one of the letters.
Actual Results:
Bother letter are erased.

Expected Results:
To be able to click once in the url or search field and add or edit a letter or letter without erasing all the letter of either field by attempting to do so.
