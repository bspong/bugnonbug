After running firefox 2 without problem on my ubuntu 7.04 laptop, I thought I'd give beta version 3 a go, but on most web page strange character are displayed (seemingly at random places) instead of English text, I have since upgraded to ubuntu 8.0.4 which included firefox 3.0.1 and I have the same problem. Opera and Konquerer on the same laptop run ok, a did firefox 2, firefox 3.0.1 on window on the same laptop doe not produce the same problem either.

Reproducible: Always




I have a screenshot, but no way to upload it?
