With Firefox 3 beta 2, setting browser.urlbar.richResults to false allowed to avoid rich result (which slow the browser too much for my liking). When I updated to beta 3, I discovered this is now being ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In about:config, set browser.urlbar.richResults to false.
2. Type something in your URL bar, see autocompletion and rich text results.
