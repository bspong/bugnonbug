Characters within private range don't appear unless you define them to use an installed font with CSS. Characters in the official range appear automatically a soon a a font that cover them is installed.

For example if a font for Cuneiform is installed (U+12000 to U+1236E) the character appear automatically. When a font for Tengwar (U+E000 to U+E07F) is installed they character remain unknown block symbols.
