I've used Opera for year since it is:
* VERY fast
* the most usable browser (even more than Firefox, IMHO)

I think you should imlement a tab bar like Opera. This mean:
* one should be able to put the bar where he wants; for example, I like to have
it in the bottom of the window (I remember it wa default in old version of Opera)
* tab title should be more readable (black text on white background, maybe);
it is better for all, but VERY IMPORTANT for disables
* Opera 8 ha a trash in the tab bar; it contains closed tab (very useful if
you close a tab by mistake!) - you can also empty trash

Will we see these feature on Firefox?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
uh... download Opera 8 and see how these feature are implemented :)
