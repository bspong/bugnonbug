The internet connection go via a router. With Firefox 1.5 no problems. I installed 2.0 and there wa no internet connection. I even could not connect to the router. I checked the setting ("Direct connection to internet") and everything seems ok.
I uninstalled 2.0 and re-installed 1.5. And the connection is ok.
The problem occurs on Windows 2000 service pack 4.
I followed the same procedure on Windows XP and Firefox 2.0 work fine on internet (via the same router).

Reproducible: Always

I re-installed Firefox 1.5, so everything is ok now. But we can not take advantage of the enhancement of 2.0
