Screenshot of button taken from latest trunk nightly

Not sure if this is expected on not, but running the latest nightly on Windows Vista Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:2.0b10pre) Gecko/20110119 Firefox/4.0b10pre, the Firefox button is much larger than it is on Windows 7.

See attached screenshot.
