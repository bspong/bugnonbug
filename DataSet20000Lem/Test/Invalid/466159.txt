I've been using the current version of Firefox for a while, now, and it ha been working perfectly. Today, I decided to install NoScript and after it wa up and running, I could no longer open new windows, only new tabs. I tried using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+N) and the Firefox menu (File - New Window), to no avail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install NoScript
2. Try and open a new Firefox window.
Actual Results:
No new window opens; the program doesn't even seem to recognize the command (no HD activity)

Expected Results:
...open a new window?

I don't use any themes. Firefox doesn't crash, so there is no crash ID, my computer ha default configuration.
