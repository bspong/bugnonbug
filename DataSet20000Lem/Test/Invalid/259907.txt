Window doe not repaint while not active or when restored
If you have a javascript that executes every x amount of time, it doe not
execute when Firefox is minimized. For example:

function testThis() {
var thisDate = new Date();
document.write(thisDate.getMinute());
}
setInterval("testThis()", 60000);

Run the page and minimize Firefox. You will see it get behind. You will notice
that it is behind by the number of minute it ha been minimized.
