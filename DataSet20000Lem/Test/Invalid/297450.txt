Firefox exit (does NOT crash- no errors, nothing in the app event log... it
just closes) upon clicking on a background tab to bring it to the foreground.

However, I noted that FF doe NOT exit like this if I right-click on the link
and select either "Open link in new tab" or "Open link in new window". Also
worth noting is that, if after a browser restart I perform either of these last
two operations, and -THEN- drag the link and then click on the resulting tab, FF
doe NOT exit. The only time it exit like this is if the only operation I
performed is what I described at the top.

This also happens on MANY other sites... this is the only time I wa able to
reproduce it each and every time. And it ha caused the loss of data, in that I
wa filling out foms when FF would crash, a well a research time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/11/181236&from=rss.
Find post titled "Looking up on the SOHO gallery".
2. Drag the link to open it in a new tab (link text is "January 20th"); it link
to
http://soho.nascom.nasa.gov/data/summary/gif/050220/seit_00195_fd_20050220_2200.gif.
The tab will open behind the active page.
3. Click on the tab (doesn't matter if the page ha loaded yet or not)
4. Once the page loads, Firefox just exit a if I had told it to. NO CRASH.
Alternatively, wait for the page to fuly load and -THEN- click the tab. A
split-second after the tab appears, FF exits.
Actual Results:
FF exits. NO CRASH.

Expected Results:
Not exit.
