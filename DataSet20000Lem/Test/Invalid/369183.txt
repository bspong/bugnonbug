After newly installing the Shockwave Flash 9.0 r31 plugin in firefox2,
the audio flash player at http://passit.no dosnt play any sound,
and no song text shows.
I tested it in firefox1 (ran directory from the firefox1 source dir),
and the sound and text worked greate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Remove all flash plugins on your system untill no flash page works.
2. Install the adobe flash plugin 9 into firefox2
3. Make sure you got the latest version of the flash plugin installed (about:plugin must say it version 31)
4. visit http://passit.no and find out if the flash sound/text work or not (the flash audio player is located at the right/top of the website).
5. To eliminate that something is wrong with passit.no you should try it firefox1, work greate for me there.
Actual Results:
No sound or text in the flash audio player at the right on the webpage

Expected Results:
The sound and text should work in the flash audio player
