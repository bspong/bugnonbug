Hi All,

I am facing build problem on HP-UX Itanium machine. Can anyone throw some light
on this or can show some documentation or step to build firefox source 1.0 on
HP-UX Itanium using the native cc and aCC compilers.
In case there are some prequisites then Please let me know. I have libIDL and
gLIB installed.

Awaiting your responses.

Thanks a lot in advance.

Best Regards,
Himanshu Singh
