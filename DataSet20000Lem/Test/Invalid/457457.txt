My Neopets Portal toolbar can not be used according to Firefox. I asked Neopets and they say it is Firefox's fault. When I update the error message say it ha to disable the toolbar so I figure new upgrade made it incompatible with the Neopets toolbar. I have never had this problem before now. This is a monthly service I am paying for so I would prefer to have it corrected instead of going back to Internet Explorer where this problem never occurred.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Update Firefox or attempt to activate toolbar

Actual Results:
Firefox say the toolbar is not compatible and will notify me when a solution is available.I finish installation without my toolbar because I have no choice. Then I get cranky and say many bad word ;)

Expected Results:
Loaded my Neopets toolbar
