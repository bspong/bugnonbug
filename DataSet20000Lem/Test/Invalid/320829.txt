file:/// act differently for document linked in html and document insert into the URL
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Note that security.checkloaduri is set to false in all of my test cases.

On our internal intranet we link to document from a mapped drive (on our fileserver). These link look something like:

<a href="file:///G|/HRC/Payroll Schedule/Payroll Schedule 2006.XLS">2006 Payroll Schedule</a>

If I click this link in Firefox 1.0.7, IE 6, or Flock 0.4.10 I get prompted to Open or Save the document (normal file compatibility). Thus, I can view the file. However, if I click the link in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5 or Firefox/1.6a (Deer Park Alpha) there is no activity.

However, if I cut and paste the link into the actual URL field and hit enter or select "Go" I am prompted to Open or Save the document. Likewise, I can copy the link and open the file through File | Open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set security.checkloaduri to false
2. Create an html document that ha a link to a file on a network path
3. Restart Firefox and open the document
4. Click on the document to see if it open
5. Right-click and copy the link
6. Paste into the URL field and hit enter

Actual Results:
Document doe not load/open when you click on the link.

Document open if you copy the link into the URL or copy the link into the File | Open menu.

Expected Results:
You should be prompted to "Open" or "Save" the linked document a long a checkloaduri.security is set to false.

I understand that checkloaduri is set to true to prevent cross-site scripting and DoS attacks, but if a user set checkloaduri to fale it should allow opening of mapped paths.

The web server is our intranet is running RH EL 3. The link are on our file server which is running Windows Server 2003 service pack 1.

Would it be beneficial to map the share that includes the file and then create a symbolic link that the web server will parse, however, this seems like too much overhead for a simple problem?

Bugs 143021 and 296708 are almost duplicate of this problem. However, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=185166&action=view
did create an attachment. Does this still pertain to firefox 1.5?
