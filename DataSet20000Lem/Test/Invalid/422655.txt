Firefox 3 never show the image for NewEgg.com promotion emails, whether opened in Gmail or whether viewed on the newegg.com site. These are plain JPG image so I don't think it's the same problem a I reported in bug 416243, where image are not shown if there is transparency in the image. I will attach a screenshot so you can see what it look like in a recent FF3 build. I will also attach the full webpage, saved and zipped up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unzip the attachment and open the html page in FF3.
