User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

Upon moving the mouse over one of the menu items, a submenu should be displayed
below - and it sort of is. If you right click on the space where the submenu
should be, you see right-click option like View Image (if you click View Image,
you are taken to the appropriate image) - but the submenu is not actually
*visible* to the user. If you move the mouse over a menu item (like Demo) and
then open up the DOM Inspector and navigate to HTML > Body > table (subMenu) >
tbody and click on tbody, an element is highlighted in red but the red outline
doe not disappear like it should - it just hang there. This glitch appears in
Firefox 1.0.3, the latest nightly builds, and Mozilla.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move the mouse over any menu item so that the background change to a light gray
2. Open up the DOM Inspector, making sure that the menu item is still in a
mouseover state
3. In the DOM Inspector, navigate to HTML > Body > table (subMenu) > tbody and
click on tbody
Actual Results:
Submenu is outlined in red, but the red outline doe not flash and disappear -
it stay outlined around submenu.

Expected Results:
The submenu should have been displayed (it look a though it's transparent,
which it shouldn't be) and the DOM Inspector should un-highlight the submenu.
