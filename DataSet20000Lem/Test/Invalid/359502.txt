Just installed the official release of Firefox 2.0
So far I cannot make it to connect to the Internet (I'm using fixed IP ADSL). For any page it simply timesout. Firefox 1.0.7 a well a IE and other UA's are working just fine a before.
I'm using Windows XP SP1 (not SP2) - it it may be a reason. Also if it may help anyhow I experienced the same with the first release of Netscape 8.0 while the current 8.1.2 work fine.

Reproducible: Always
