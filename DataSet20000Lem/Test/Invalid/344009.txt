Option Set Home Page: "Use this page" not easy to utilize
1. Open Options window
2. Put a tick in the box Use this page
3. Click between tab to find the page and URL that you want to use
4. Result: you can't. The Options window doe not allow you to focus the main window.

And this bug is not about: "should the Options window always be on top or not?" (I think it is an existing bug) but: "is the choice useful?"
Very few people know a full URL off the top of their head I think. :?
