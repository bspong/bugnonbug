I downloaded a .torrent, and it opened in uTorrent, like it is supposed to. At this point Firefox wa no longer the active window. I wa doing nothing at all with Firefox when the error happened. It closed Firefox. I had just (within 5 seconds) completed a download.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
I really don't know how to reproduce the error, I've downloaded .torrent's before, never seeing this error.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashed

Expected Results:
I didn't expect anything to be going on with Firefox at the time of the error

A few other people have received the same error, but none in the same situation that I found it. It seems like none of the report have been fixed or confirmed.
I am using the default theme.
