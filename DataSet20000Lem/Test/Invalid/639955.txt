Only since updating to Firefox 3.6.15 from 3.6.13 or .14 have I seen/had this issue.
The window is stalling/freezing a it load website and I have no use of link or menu for about 10-30 seconds. This ha happened for a number of website but not all that I have gone to since the update.
Examples include; www.cara.com, ca.yahoo.com and www.ctv.ca. I can not attribute this to my system a it ha never happened before and I have made no hardware or software change other than updating Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Tried multiple website and occurred on about 50% of the dozen site I tried.
2.Have also closed just Firefox and reopened with no change.
3.Have also rebooted with no change.
Actual Results:
Had no change with all troubleshooting. However it doe not happened for every link within one particular website.

Expected Results:
Hoped to stop on it own for whatever reason!!

Not quite a major issue, but it is very annoying since it only started happening after updating to this new version!
