I'm getting this a lot - leaving Firefox open in crash every day or two. The
most recent time it wa while typing into a text field on a form. Several of the
other time have also been while making entry on form.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox
2. Use for a day or two
3. Wait for crash

Actual Results:
Crash!


This is a Gentoo ebuild. The current theme is Plastifox Crystal, but it wa
happening with other theme too.

(With so many different segfault report in bugzilla, Firefox's versioning is a
bit exuberant. Rather that version 1 preview, this should be like version 0.35
alpha.)
