Since the latest Firefox release, the Googlemail plug-in isn't allowing me to log-in. I have 2 laptop which run XP Home and XP Pro. When the Firefox Googlemail icon is clicked, a connection is made but an error message box saying 'Failed to log in' appears in the upper left corner of the Firefox browser and then disappears and no connection is made via add-on icon.

I can log-in to Googlemail directly via Google or iGoogle. My username/password are correct otherwise I wouldn't be able to log-in via the direct method.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click Googlemail add-on icon to log into Googlemail account.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
No log-in. 'Failed to log-in' message appears in a text box in upper left corner of browser then disappears.

Expected Results:
To log-in to my Googlemail account via add-on.

Have removed Googlemail plug-in on both laptop and re-installed, but no log-in fault remains.
