I receive a pop up on my desk top everytime I browse Mozilla Firefox x 2

I try to browse on Mozialla Firefox and do just fine. However, everytime I open the browser I get a pop up right in the middle of my desktop usually 2 times, everytime. I clicked the bar at the top and wa able to find a way to enter my e-mail address (although I don't know why they would have it) and it should have stopped it. However, I am still getting the pop-up, BUT now it is blank. I cannot stop it from happening. I have to close it myself every time. The url on the bar say - http://adserving.cpxinteractive.com I thought it might have to do with Google, but they said I should contact my System Administrator and I don't even know who that is. I guess that's you.

It is now blank in the pop-up since I tried cancelling the service (or whatever it is)
