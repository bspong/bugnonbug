I found a few solution for embeding sound for button (for onClick and
onMouseOver events) for my webpage "called" cross browser solutions. But are
not really cross browser solutions. Only on Firefox those solution in doesn't
work. It work sound in Firefox but not for onClick and onMouseOver events.

I already have the Quicktime installed on my computer-so the sound work with
Firefox when I use the EMBED tag.

Maybe there is an javascript API like for sound cross browser compatibility with
Firefox and I don't know. I found something like that at
http://www.walterzorn.com/ an javascript API which enables javascript drag and
drop compatibility with Firefox. Maybe if there isn't something like that we
shoul build sunch an API for sound javascript cross browser compatibility.
Is there a solution to put sound to a button in a web page whithout using flash
and to work on Firefox? And I would like that solution will wok with all big
browser (even with Firefox).

Reproducible: Always
