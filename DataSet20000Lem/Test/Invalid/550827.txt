The other day I wa using firefox to search for blog relating to a TCG i play. while searching an embedded script shot straight through my security software (AVG) and locked down my computer. The virus wa a cocktail of trojans, adware, spyware, and toolkits, it wa perpetrated by a rogue antivirus software called "Security Tool". It lock down your system and creates many threat that allow it to recreate itself if not deleted properly(somewhat like a worm). It originated in the application files. It took me a week to get my computer back into working order, but the remnant of the virus have somehow infected the mozilla application data files. It seems to mostly infect the cookies, and while there is little evidence that "security tool" is still on my system and causing threats, I have no doubt that my nemesis still lurks in shadow of my registry files. I feel like I have to tell you that it seems someone is beginning to create malicious software that exploit firefox. Seeing a firefox ha an image of safety and reliability in comparison with internet explorer, I thought you'd like to know.

I think that it downloads or otherwise creates new threat whenever I open firefox. The cause maybe that I have firefox configured to open the last page I wa accessing when I last used firfox. Immediately my antivirus scanner report threat usually emanating in temp/cookies of firefox or my system files.
Recently I wa using firefox to view multiple page while having other application open, I then began to print something from MSWord and when I did firefox began to use 90+ cpu usage, which slowed down my computer to a stall until i close firefox. There is something on my computer that is hiding in the firefox application data and it is trying to attack my system.
Anyway this could be a serious issue for mozilla because I have not heard of virus maker trying to create exploit for firefox (although I am sure it ha been done), but this one is particularly insidious. Meanwhile I will be reinstalling firefox and hopefully that will fix the problem on my end.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.something in application data
2.whenever restart firefox it open page from history which spark virus
3.make me unhappy =(
Actual Results:
virus downloaded or otherwise created, originating in the mozilla application data in various subfolders

Expected Results:
not have virus

you guy are great i luv you, plz fix mozilla exploit so ppl dont switch to something else


also i would say this is critical simply because it cause major system instability, cpu lag that cause inoperability, and it like having a virus factory inside my mozilla program files.. this is why i think it is a major exploit in firefox. For the casual user they may not be able to deal with these problem and ultimately they will find the threat is originating in firefox files.
