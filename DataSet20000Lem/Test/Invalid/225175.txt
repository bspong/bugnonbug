[INSTALLER] Installer for non-windows operating system needed
Now that bug 214263 (windows installer) is fixed, we still installers for other
operating system like for example Linux, OS/2 or possibly Solaris.

I'm filing this bug, because the bug covering this (bug 182409) ha been morphed
to cover this issue and is essentially useless, because it only start at
comment 25 to talk about this issue.
