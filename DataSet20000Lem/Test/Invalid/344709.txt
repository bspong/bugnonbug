Shortcuts to open place popup should close place popup
Right now while you can open the place popup with either ctrl-h, or ctrl-b (well bug filed on that one anyways). The place popup doesn't close after reentering that command. Neither doe escape work to close the popup. As of right now the only way I've found to close the window is to click on the icon again.
