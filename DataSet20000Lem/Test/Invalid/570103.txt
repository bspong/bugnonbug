In MS Office Outlook Web Access, when you logoff, popup shows, that you successfully logged off. But when you try to use OWA again, you are still logged in. Only way to 100% logoff is to close all firefox windows, or in some cases, when process is still running with all firefox window closed, kill it with task manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to OWA
2. Logoff from OWA
3. Try to use OWA again without closing browser
Actual Results:
Still logged in after logoff.

Expected Results:
Logged off from mail server.

- Exchange server 2007

- Same problem occurs in Opera 10.53(not that i use it, downloaded it just to try this) and maybe other non IE browser also
