Make the Sage feed RSS reader a permanent part of Firefox.

Feed reading is an integral part of the internet and is used by many site (e.g., blog and news sites). Firefox's current feed reading capability are so limited a to make it not worth using for any real reading of feeds. Integrating the more capable Sage feed reader would bring an important and useful part of the web to million of user (similar to the recent integration of video capability).

The Sage feed reader add-on (as improved in Sage++) would be the ideal built-in feed reader for Firefox because it is very simple to use, it is tightly integrated into existing functionality (bookmarks), the UI is very similar to the Bookmarks Sidebar UI, and the code is highly developed.

In addition to the original Sage feed reader, there are two forked versions:

Sage: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/77/
Sage++: http://himag.blog26.fc2.com/blog-entry-234.html?lang=en
Sage-Too: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/addons/7263/

Feeds are an integral and useful part of the internet. This important functionality should not be relegated to add-ons. I hope you will consider this when deciding on the fate of this important bug. Please don't wontfix this bug without serious discussion among the developers.

Reproducible: Always
