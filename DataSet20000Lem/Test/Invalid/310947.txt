This also happened with version 1.0 also, that in general after entering a URL
site and clicking on a secondary URL within that site, sometimes but not always
the key board and mouse lock up and no futher action is possible. I have to
turn the power off to exit the situation. I am fortunate that my hard drive
doe not crash. This happened to me the first time I entered this site to file
a bug report just now. I have reviewed my security administration to see if
this wa being done maliciously by others, but did not find permission that
would allow this lock/up by others, a I am the only user and Administrator.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into valid network URL (successful)
2. Browse within the original selected URL
3. Sometimes but not always, when trying to select or click on another site or
URL within that site the mouse lock up a well a the key board. the
Mozilla circle in the upper right corner have also stopped moving.



Actual Results:
The only way that I can exit or change the page or view is to power down the PC.

Expected Results:
Should have said that the page could not be found and allowed for another entry.
or said that site wa busy and to try back later and allowed for another entry.
or said that the page or URL wa not valid and allowed for another entry.
or come back with somekind of system entry explaining the situation and allowed
for another entry.

There doe not seem to be a particular pattern that I can describe when getting
the locked up sysem. This happens in most application use HGTV houseplans
.com and many other site that this ha occured on a well a this very site.

My PC is Pentium 4 2.8 gig ASUS Mother Board (Raid) P4P800 2Gig random
access memory --seagate 120Gig hard drive OS is XP Pro. Service pac 1. High
speed cable modem is Motorola.

I have Norton System Works and Virus protection that might be involved, just do
not know. Lavasoft Adaware but I do Not think is involved. All Microsoft OS
update are installed with the exception of service pac2, and I have service pac
1. installed.
