nsBrowserContentListener never removed a parent content listener
Docshells hold a weak ref to the parent content listener. So the parent content
listener need to be explicitly nulled out before it go away (so before the
JSObject is destroyed). Not doing that is generally a good way to have
intermittent crashes.

Note: I can't find a reasonable component for this, so dumping in general...
