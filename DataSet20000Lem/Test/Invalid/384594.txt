I've had this problem with FF for a while, now. Many time when I left-click on a link, the browser is slow getting to the page. I've switched between FF and IE7 to see if it's a local, generic problem; IE7 responds quickly with a single click (I've also tried it with Opera, and it's fast a well). I've tried different internet security package (I'm currently using Kaspersky) and that doesn't make a difference. If I double-click on the link/button, I get to the target quickly - the speed I'd expect from FF. Although I can't accurately time it, my gut feel is that the problem is much le if I open the link in a new tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Left-click on any link.
