Firefox will not display, freeze everytime. I downloaded the newest version and still getting the same error 'waiting for click.freeze.com'. I removed all software of firefox and downloaded new software at least 4 time and still getting the same error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download latest verison of firefox
2. Click to open the browser
3.
Actual Results:
At the bottom of the page receiving the message 'waiting for click.freeze.com

Expected Results:
Firefox home page should display

The software should load the firefox browser page, instead I get the message and the page stop loading. I repeated removing firefox from my computer and downloading the latest firefox software, keep getting same error. I cannot click on any tab to try to navigate away from the home page to any other page due to this error.
