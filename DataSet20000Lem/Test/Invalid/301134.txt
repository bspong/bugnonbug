i know that double-clicking selects hole word up to certain symbols. but select
one word by double clicking, press shift, and select other word trough double
clicking. element will dissappear. they reappear with refresh.

Rest of the Firefox seems pretty good though :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a piece of text
2. Press Shift
3. Double click nearby

Actual Results:
The element will dissappear. If you just double click while Shift is pressed
without selecting anything the whole page go blank!

Expected Results:
The first selected text now should be selected along with the previous. It seems
intuitive to be so.

But now that I think of, this is mean multiple text selection. I don't think
there is a browser that support selecting piece of text. But still, no element
dissappearing, please. I thank you more than enough, since I use Firefox, hehe.
