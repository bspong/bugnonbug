Firefox crash when going to google video
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110323 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.16
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110323 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.16

This is a somewhat strange problem. When I do a search on (normal) google, and then click on the video tab above, firefox crashes. Or at least, I think it crashes. What happens is that my screen go black, and I end up at the login screen of ubuntu. No crashreports are generated unfortunately.

This happens not everytime, but whenever it happens I'm in firefox, clicking on something, which make me believe it is a firefox bug, and not a ubuntu one. I can reproduce about 90% of the time by going to google video.

Any idea how to start debugging on this? I know some (not too much though) thing about debugging and hacking firefox by now, but I don't know how to start on this...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. do a google search
2. click on the video tab (link in the bar on top of the google result page)

Actual Results:
crash, session of gnome / linux ends.

Expected Results:
no crash, video result visible
