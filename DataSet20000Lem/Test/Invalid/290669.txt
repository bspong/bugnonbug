Hello!

I use the Internet browser Mozilla Firefox 1.0.2 (ru-RU) (further FF) and I have
some
questions.

OS: Win98SE Russian

1. I use the dial-up connection. When FF start, the standard
Windows(R) connection window appears. That's all OK. But when I load
saved on HDD web-page, FF call standard Windows(R) connection window
again. I know, some web-pages can include java- and vb-scripts. But
they are turned off in FF settings. E.g. IE 5.xx, 6.xx never call
connection window when userload saved on HDD web-page. What is it -
FF bug or feature? Please, explain me.

2. Situation - I load saved web-page. FF start and in a few second I
can read selected web-page. When connection window appear, I close it
and FF tell me that web-resourse is not found. That's OK. But when I
click on any hyperlink in this page, FF tell me again that
web-resourse is not found. In IE 5.xx, 6.xx in such situation simply
connection window appears. I'm sure - it's FF bug.

3. FF work very bad with saved web-pages with cyrillic filenames. FF
try to load another page with latin filename and tell that it's not
found. Very strange situation. Please, correct FF treatment of saved
web-pages with cyrillic filenames.

4. About pictures. As you, web-pages include many pictures. To spare
web-traffic I disallow showing them. But when I load saved on HDD
web-page, FF show it with all pictures. Please, explain me, what
difference is between viewing saved and online web-pages in case of
blocking picture to show? As for me, it's bug of FF. IE 5.xx and 6.xx
don't show picture in offline and online mode if user block showing
the pictures. I think, it make sense to make checkbox 'Allow FF to
download picture from server'. Please, correct FF treatment of
picture in online\offline web-pages.

5. About saving web-pages. E.g. there is a hyperlink in web-page:
http: //server.com /index.html. If I try to save this page on HDD, FF
try to save it a index.html. In case of http: //server.com
/default.asp FF try to save it a default.asp. And saved page have
filename - with double extension: default.asp.html. Why so? IE 5.xx,
6.xx always try to save page with name, that is between tag
<title></title>. E.g. if web-page ha <title>Firefox</title>, but it
filename is index.html, IE will save page a 'Firefox' (more
self-descriptively, isn't it?) and FF - a 'index.html'. Although FF
sometimes save web-pages a IE.
I think - it's bug of FF saving the pages. Am I right?
