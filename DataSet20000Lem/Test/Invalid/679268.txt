Change Firefox version scheme to indicate build date to facilitate rapid release cycle
Mozilla Firefox a it is switching to the rapid release cycle will face the confusion of version number incrementing rapidly. Bug 679141 suggested removing reference of the version completely from the about window. I think that a compromise idea would be for the version field to be replaced by simply saying the build date and platform (32 bit, 64 bit, Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.) if using a final release. The nightly, beta, and aurora channel would also show this information along with some type of message that a tester would be able to determine which release target to file bug report against, a there could be the possibility of confusion if a tester wasn't aware of merging of channel on the roadmap.
