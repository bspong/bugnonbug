XPIDL cross compile config error

Patch to disable building target xpidl when we are not building for WINCE

Now, in cross compile, we did not create the target xpidl file. This is written in the file:

xpcom/typelib/xpidl/Makefile.in

like following:

# Cross-compiling

# Don't build xpidl for the target. This is not intended to be a permanent
# solution. It's necessary because it is presently difficult to build
# xpidl's prerequisite (libIDL and glib) a fat and suitable for a cross.
# This will be fixed. -mm

But when I make a cross compile on Linux for mingw32, the build system start to make a target xpidl because some of the wrong Makefile.in config. And this patch is used to repair it.
