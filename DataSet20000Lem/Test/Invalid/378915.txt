Whenever FF automatically update an add-on at FF startup, I lose one preference in my tabbed browsing. Under "Tabbed Browsing/User Interface/When loading new tabs, load the:" section of the option dialog, I always have "Browser Homepage" selected. When FF doe an add-on update, and it seems to be for any add-on, but today it happened specifically with firebug, that option is reset to "Blank Page." This ha been happening for several version back of FF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Tabbed prefs "Tabbed Browsing/User Interface/When loading new tabs, load the:" to "Browser Homepage"
2. Have FF automatically update an add-on a it start (I know it definitely ha happened with Firebug and the Web Developer Toolkit).
3. Try opening a new tab when FF finally loads.
Actual Results:
It doe not go to the browser homepage, but open a blank tab.

Expected Results:
It should open the Browser Homepage a previously chosen.
