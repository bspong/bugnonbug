If a browser window is opened with chatzilla (either the button or ctrl+1 or by
clicking a link in a chat) the window open with 'mozilla.org' a the homepage.
the preference for chatzilla do not seem connected with those for firebird. if
the chatzilla preference are changed to reflect a different homepage, then the
browser start up with that different homepage, but clicking the 'home' button
or useing 'alt+home' return to the 'mozilla.org' page. also, no bookmark work
in the new browser window. this only occurs with browser window created by
chatzilla. if another browser is already opened useing 'mozillafirebird.exe'
everything work fine, and link clicked on in chatzilla appear in the active tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firebird from 'mozillafirebird.exe'
2.start chatzilla
3.use chatzilla to open a browser window
4.navigate to different webpage
5.type 'alt+home'
6.click 'home' button
7.open bookmark menu and select bookmark

Actual Results:
wrong default homepage opens. after navigating away, attempt to return to
correct (by firebird pref) homepage return wrong page. the bookmark menu opens,
but selecting a bookmark doe nothing.

Expected Results:
the homepage specified in the firebird preference should be used a the
homepage, and the bookmark should work.

an easy workaround is to just leave a browser open and minimize it while not in use.
after searching the buglist, i think the problem is related to bug 205199 and
206752.
