When the SwitchProxy Tool 1.4.1 extension is activated on the new Firefox 3.5.5 release on Windows XP, and the user performs basic Firefox operation (navigating to a URL, opening a new tab, clicking a link, etc.), after a few minutes, several bad thing happen:

1. Scrollbars on new dialog and browser tab is located on the left side.
2. The Tools | Options menu is blank except for OK and CANCEL buttons.
3. Links can no longer be clicked (or network operation caused by clicking link hang forever).
4. Some user setting are reset (user see prompt to close all or one tab when closing the application, for example, even after checking the "don't show me this anymore" box.)
5. The location bar no longer show drop-down suggestion and bookmarks.

(These all look like resource corruption or exhaustion issue for a Win32 app.)
