in FF4 it seems a if the context menu in window created by extension are transparent.

since i'm sitting on Win7, already tried to turn off aero - but it's still the same.

tested extension so far:
* securityheroes maximum adblock free (in the 'disabled items' window)
* tamper data (the 'requests' window)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install the tamper-data extension
2. open the tamper-data ('request')window
3. open a webpage, the tamper-data window fill with data
4. right-click one of the upper entry

Actual Results:
the context-menu-background is transparent

Expected Results:
the context-menu-background is not transparent so that one can read what is written on the item

just upped a screenshot which show the problem:
