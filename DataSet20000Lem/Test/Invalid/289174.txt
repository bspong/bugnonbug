After OS autoupdate and v1.0.2 upgrade, menu and location bar don't work plus page is not displayed
User-Agent: Opera/8.0 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)
Build Identifier: v1.0.2

Hello, I guess Microsoft ha found a way to counter the Firefox raise. Anyway
the symptom are a explained and this happened when I came back from the
holiday and there were a couple of pending patch which I applied. It is worth
mentioning that while away I used Firefox 1.0.2 on WinXP (no SP) without any
problem. It's after I installed the update on my usual computer with SP2 that it
stopped displaying any page and menu and address were not working anymore. The
only thing I can use are the right click menu or the green upgrade button.
Nothing else works, not even keyboard commands. Worse, the problem persists even
if I uninstall completely and reinstall v1.0.2 or v1.0.1 (which are the only one
I can find now).
Any suggestion ?
Thanks
