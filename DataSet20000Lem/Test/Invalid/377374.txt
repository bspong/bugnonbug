'URL is not valid and cannot be loaded' alert message appears, and after clicking OK the URL is displayed.

I updated my firefox to the current version yesterday and this problem started to appear in an hour or so. If i right click on any of the link in the page https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/ and request the page to be displayed in a new window, this error message appears first and after I click on the OK button, the requested page appears.

I am unable to log into my yahoo e-mail inbox due to this problem. In this case the alert message is displayed again and again (after clicking OK) and in the end somehow, yahoo asks to enter password again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open yahoo login screen
2.enter password and click enter
3.the alert message appears

Alternatively asking the browser to display any link in a new window will result in this alert message
Actual Results:
Alert message appears and in most of the cases, after clicking OK, the requested URL is displayed. So far, the serious problem I came across is inability to log into my yahoo inbox.

Expected Results:
display the requested URL without any alert messages.

I see this problem with the theme like - metal lion ice 1.4.1, blue ice 1.2.4, baby blue 1.0.0, azerty I 3.0.1, Aluminium alloy 1.1.20070308.
