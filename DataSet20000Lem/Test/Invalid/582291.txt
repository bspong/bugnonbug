Dear lady and gentleman

I update the homepage of our company from my home office.
2 month before i got a new pc with the OS "WIN 7 Home Premium 64-bit"
I have installed all progs and so on.
I have installed also the firefox 3.6xxxx

Then i logged me in on the homepage of our company. It wa possible for me to create a link from a picture to a file.

When i create the link, a pop-up-window open and it wa possible for me to search the rigth file.

Now it is so, when the pop-up-window open it is clear and at the top of them is " {$lang_insert_link_title} "

I do not know exact when the problem begins.

On my old computer i had the same problem but with the OS "WIN XP"
On another computer with also OS "WIN XP" there wa no problem. I dont know why.

When i search on Google ( {$lang_insert_link_title} ) there are al many question about the same problem.

The problem is also with the IE.

please be so kind and help me and all other in the www.

thank you very much and best regard from TYROL
