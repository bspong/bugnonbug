ongoing issue with a "program" that load with FFox and I can't get rid of it no matter what

"bignetdaddy" continues to plauge everytime I open FFox, not IE just FFox. Tried spybot, malware remover, everything else I have had defender and on and on. It won't leave, done a general search by hand of each folder and can't find where what it is. HELP!!

Reproducible: Always
