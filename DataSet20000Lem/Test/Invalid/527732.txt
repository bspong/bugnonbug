I wa running my older theme on Minefield for the past few week with a boolean value of extensions.checkCompatibility;false. After this latest update 11/10/09 extensions.checkCompatibility is still there but it's usability is gone. It doesn't perform like it wa supposed to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create extensions.checkCompatibility;false in about:config
2.restart Minefield
3.Tools>Addons
Actual Results:
no message about the Compatibility checker being offline can't enable older addons.

Expected Results:
a message about the Compatibility checker being offline and the ability to enable older extension
