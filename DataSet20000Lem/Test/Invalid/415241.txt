In FireFox 3, the display when clicking the down arrow in the back/forward toolbar item vastly differs from that of the down arrow click in the Url bar.
- The back/forward show the page title only.
- The url bar show the favicon, page title, url and star'd status

I feel the back/forward display should be more like the new url bar display. Possibly a header node for a site (new domain) with the favicon and star'd status. Then for each sub page slightly indented the title and url.

Sorry I am terrible at screenshots so cannot really visually present this. I can try if you want.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the browser normally, browsing to at least 3 site and a few page within each site
2. Click the down arrow next to the forward button
3. Click the down arrow in the url bar
4. Compare the 2.
