If I am attempting to connect to a site which doe not respond rapidly (www.bmtmicro.com ha been most troublesome)

and if I continue to do some other applic while waiting, then when everyone decides the site is not responding, the error routine rip control of the system away from me (right in the midst of typing) and present me with a Firefix window and the error message.

If I had attempted to connect in a 'new tab' - than that tab is close and I am also returned to the previous tab.

All in all, a very frustrating interface problem.

Thank you

switch to another application - it doesn't matter what


Expected Results:
I would expect an error message within the firefox application, but don't expect to lose control of the software I am currently running.
