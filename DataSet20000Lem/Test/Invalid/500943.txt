I installed the RC3 of the new mozilla, everything seemed to work perfect till about half an hour ago when i wa watching a movie and my computer suddenly froze up, then this happened 3 more times, everytime after a minute of listening music or watching a movie and every single time i had mozilla running, after that, i reinstalled the 3,011 version and started watching the movie and the computer didn't freeze for 10 minute of watching the movie already, i listened to music with window medium player 11 and watched the movie with medium player clasic home cinema. I hope my bug report will help on solving this problem because i have no idea what might have caused that, but everything i wrote is exactly like it happened.
