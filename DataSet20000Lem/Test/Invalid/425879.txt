Opening a new tab via a command like

firefox -a firefox -remote "openurl(http://mozilla.org,new-tab)"

transfer a firefox window from some virtual workspace to the current virtual workspace if there wasn't one on the current before.
This behavior is differnt from firefox-2 (which just opened the tab without moving window between virtual workspaces) and quite annoying. Please provide at least an option to disable it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start GNOME with two or more virtual workspace
2. Open Firefox on workspace 1
3. Go to workspace 2
4. Open a terminal and run: firefox -a firefox -remote "openurl(http://mozilla.org,new-tab)"
Actual Results:
The firefox window got moved from workspace 1 to workspace 2.

Expected Results:
Firefox window stay on workspace 1.

Behavior observed on Ubuntu Hardy.
