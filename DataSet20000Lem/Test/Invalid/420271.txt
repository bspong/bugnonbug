When I type in a word into the location bar it doesn't always find the relevant history entries.

For instance, in the past 60 day (my history cutoff) I have visited the website "Helgessons kök", http://www.helgessons.se/. Now when I type "helgessons" (no quotes) into the location bar I get nothing, even though it should match both the URL and the page title.

When I do the same search in the History side-bar I *do* find the website. (Se attached screenshot.)

I have tested this in safe mode. Could this be because of the Swedish char in the page title? This previously happened to me with another Swedish page, "Leif på hörnet" (http://leifpahornet.se/).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page (with non-english char in title?)
2. Close tab, open a new tab.
3. Type a word from the page title into the location bar.
Actual Results:
The relevant history entry are not found.

Expected Results:
The relevant history entry should be found.

Even if this is linked to non-english character in the title, it doesn't happen all the time. For instance, now I am able to find http://leifpahornet.se/ from the location bar.

Very erratic and very annoying. :)
