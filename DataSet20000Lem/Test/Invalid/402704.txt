Mozilla doe not let me print in duplex mode.
I like tree when they are alive , not when they are dead. So I always try to print double sided. Mozilla just doe not let me do that.

Steps to reproduce Have a printer that doe duplex or double sided printing ( I reproduce here with an HP Color LaserJet CP3505).

1) Go to http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/base/content/browser.js
2) press Cmd-P
3) Select layout from the third drop down menu, the one that display "Copy & Pages"
4) See that the radio button to print dual sided is dimmed.
5) select all via cmd-a
6) paste into text edit
7) do 2 and 4
8) see the radio button is not dimmed.
