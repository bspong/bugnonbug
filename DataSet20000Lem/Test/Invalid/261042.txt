Wouldn't it be nice to have a list of extension for the addressbar?
Like ".org", ".com", ".be"

I have 2 example to illustrate this :

When I type "openoffice" and press CTRL+ENTER, Firefox always browse to
"openoffice.org" in stead of "openoffice.com"

When I type "stubru" and press CTRL+ENTER, Firefox always browse to
"stubru.com" in stead of "stubru.be"

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "stubru" in the addressbar
2. Press CTRL+ENTER
Actual Results:
Browses to "www.stubru.com"

Expected Results:
Browse to "www.stubru.be"
