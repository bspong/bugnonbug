browser won't go to any URL, whatsoever
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; Compaq; SV1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0.4

I've been using Firefox on my XP machine for the past couple of year without
incident, but recently, it open to a blank screen with the following message
box: "www.mozilla.org could not be found. Please check the name and try
again." It doesn't matter what URL I go to. The same message box come up
every time. Interestingly enough. This hasn't affected my other two browsers,
Netscape and IE. I've tried reinstalling the software, but to no avail. The
result are the same. You know there's a problem, when I have to fill out this
form in the IE browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the application.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The blank screen and the "not found" message box.

Expected Results:
Opened to your homepage.
