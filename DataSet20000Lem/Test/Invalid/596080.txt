testInputFocus failure on Windows
For some reason, this test is failing on window now. (Locally)

It is kind of strange:

// Tests to ensure that the input box is focused when the console opens. See
// bug 579412.
function testInputFocus() {
let hud = HUDService.getHeadsUpDisplay(hudId);
let inputNode = hud.querySelectorAll(".jsterm-input-node")[0];
is(inputNode.getAttribute("focused"), "true", "input node is focused");
}


Shouldn't we be testing for true and not "true" (string)?

I tried it this way and it still fails. Passes on my linux machine.

i may have to disable it if it show up on tinderbox - until we break out the tests.
