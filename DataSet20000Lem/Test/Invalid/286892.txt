Keyboard shortcut conflict with KDE (K Desktop Environment): Ctrl+Tab

There is a keyboard shortcut conflict between KDE and Mozilla Firefox when
typing Ctrl+Tab. In KDE, Ctrl+Tab walk through the desktop list while in
Mozilla Firefox Ctrl+Tab walk through tabs. When Mozilla Firefox is run under
KDE, the KDE action take precedence (desktops are changed, but Firefox tab are
not).

I have filed this bug with KDE eariler, but it seems unlikely that KDE
developer will change the Ctrl+Tab default action. (Please see
http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=101932)

A workarond is to use Ctrl+PageUp and Ctrl+PageDown to walk through Firefox tab
when using KDE. However, it is likely that Winodws/GNOME user who regularly use
Ctrl+Tab to walk through tab will be confused when the same command ha
different effect in KDE.

I'm not sure what is the best way around this is. Perhaps Firefox should
encourage the use of Ctrl+PageUp and Ctrl+PageDown in all it documentation
and/or eventually do away with Ctrl+Tab in order to ease the transition of
Windows Firefox user to KDE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox in KDE
2.Open up multiple tab
3.Try to use Ctrl+Tab to walk through the Firefox tab

Actual Results:
The user will walk through KDE desktops.

Expected Results:
The user should walk through Firefox tabs.
