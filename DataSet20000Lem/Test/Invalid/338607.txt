When firefox is set to use the helper application Azureus to handle .torrent files, after the file ha finished downloading it successfully open the Azureus program, but doe not correctly relay the file. In essence, the downloaded file is not passed correctly to azureus and therefore one must then manually open the file. When using other browser this is not a problem and work correctly, the problem only occurs when using Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download a .torrent file
2.Tell firefox to open the file with azureus
Actual Results:
Once downloaded Azureus will open, but the file is not passed correctly and the downloaded file will not open.


Expected Results:
The file should be correctly opened by Azureus.

This wa not a problem with pre 1.5 version of Firefox, and possibly with early 1.5 versions, but I can not remember.
