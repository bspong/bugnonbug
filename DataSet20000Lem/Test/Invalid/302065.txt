Tried uninstalling and reinstalling from new download. Downloaded and
installed the most recent build of Mozilla to make sure it wasn't a Mozilla
problem. Mozilla loaded without a problem.

Looked up problem in Bug report but it wa addressed several build ago not
with the most recent Firefox. If I made a wrong decision, I apologize.
