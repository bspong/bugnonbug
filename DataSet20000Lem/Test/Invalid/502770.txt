While using mozilla 3.01, I had the option to search for bookmark using the downward arrow on the navigation toolbar. Now upgrading to 3.5, I'm unable to search for my bookmark using the downward arrow. The only way I could search for my bookmark now is to type the first few letter of the website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clicking the downward arrow on the navigation toobar
2. No response
3. My bookmark are in the system
