From zizai:

''The suggestion for Mozilla Authority

We do not have to learn Mac and Vista's style really,beacuse Firefox 1.x itself's official theme is already a fairly good ''prototype'' (home icon except),this is also one-of-a-kind theme,we just have to develop this theme well,I believe before long we can also see other browser copy Firefox2.0 theme.

Finally

About beauty is subjective,and this article may induce many people's discontents,but please believe that I'm also a faithful user,just because I like it,hope it to be better(more beautiful),I have already appended three theme of intercept-pictures to article accessory,if you are interested,you can compare the pictures.''

Three theme of intercept-pictures:
