history not truncated when browser.history_expire_days pref is decreased in value
Ria's comment at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366075#c4 is probably how this should work:

When the pref is changed, we should immediately expire history to match it's new value.

this would require:

1. ability to override partial expiration w/ specific expiration age
2. performance change allowing bulk expiration on demand (async)
