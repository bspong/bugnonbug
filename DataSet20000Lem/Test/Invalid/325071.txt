Firefox ha been experiencing frequent crashes. None of these crash trigger Talkback. However, they do trigger Apple's built in crash reporter. I have been submitting the report to Apple.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Crash Firefox
3. Submit crash report to Apple

Actual Results:
Talkback is not called. Apple's crash reporter catch the crash.

Expected Results:
Talkback should notice the crash and submit a report.
