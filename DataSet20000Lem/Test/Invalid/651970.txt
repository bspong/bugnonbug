Download manager 'locked up' after closing the main browser window - using Download Statusbar

When I close the main browser window before a download ha finished, the "clear all" button in the Download Manager stop working. It doe work when the main window is open though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a file, better if it's somewhat large. It first happened when I went to download the correct localization from Aurora after realizing I had got the American one (it also happens in the one I'm using now anyway)
2. Close the main browser window before the download ends.

Actual Results:
The file get downloaded normally, you can open it, etc., but the "clear all" button doesn't work. It doesn't matter whether you have some other already downloaded file you should be able to delete or whether it's the only one you have. The button will change from white to the shaded, regular, clickable self, but it won't work.


I'm using the Download Statusbar add-on, although the bug happens on the regular native Download Manager.
