If the latest google toolbar is installed I get random freeze and "not responding" states. Does not crash if toolbar is not installed or in safe mode. I did an uninstall and reinstall in another directory and the problem is still there. It crash about once a day with my usage, which I would call moderate. Crashes when clicking on a link to another site. It ha crashed on this site trying to look up an error report, for example.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox and google toolbar
2.click on a link on a web page
3.do that all day and it will lock up eventually

Actual Results:
browser freeze and the only button that show any response is the "X" other than that you just have the hour glass cursor. The cursor doe work. When closing you get the typical not responding message and the send to microsoft dialog

Expected Results:
it should have gone to another web page

Everything wa a standard install. I set nothing manually except selecting a new directory on the second install. Nothing except Google Toolbar wa added to the browser. No setting were changed from the default. There were bookmark that it found from the old install.
