I defined a new profile for FF 3.6 (firefox -P, FF 3.5), then copied the content of the profile directory of my FF 3.5 installation to it. Then I ran FF 3.6 with that profile. Worked fine.

Then I closed and restarted FF 3.6. Now I got the error messages:
GetCharPref('id') failed
GetCharPref('version') failed

FF died immediately.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up a new profile, say 3.6, with FF 3.5.
2. Copy the 3.5-profile to the new directory.
3. Start FF 3.6 with -P 3.6.
4. Shutdown the browser.
5. Start FF 3.6 a in 3.)

Actual Results:
FF doe not start.

Expected Results:
FF should run with the copied profile.
