I have set the geo.enabled parameter to false in about config (this feature should be tunred off by default, whgen respecting user privacy)and still, whe, I browse to Google News http://news.google.fr/news?edchanged=1&ned=us, I can see my location on the right side.
When trying other sites, I have the same issue

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to about:config an set geo location to false
2. go to http://browserspy.dk/geolocation.php
3. See that you have been traced
Actual Results:
I haver been geolocalized, thanks to Firefox

Expected Results:
It should have preserved my privacy

I will need to use Opera or Chrome, for this matter
