Every time I quit Firefox and restart it the main window is shifted about 10 pixel from the left side of the screen. I typically have my window the size of my screen (minus the dock, which is on the right of the scrren, obviously). When I quit the window is located a far left and up a it can be and a wide and deep a the screen. When it restarts it is 10 pixel away from the left edge and narrower than it wa (to keep it from going under the dock). The hight and top do not seem to be modified in the same way.

This is completely annoying. This is my window, it's location and size should be mine to with with a I please. I don't want some program deciding where window on the computer should be located.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move your window to the top left of the screen leaving no gap to the left or the top.
2. Re-size the window to be a wide and deep a the screen allows.
3. Quit Firefox.
4. Re-open Firefox.
Actual Results:
The window is shifted about 10 pixel to the right and made narrower to stay within the size of the screen.

Expected Results:
The window should remain the size and position I choose to have it. It's my computer and I should be the one choosing the layout, not some jumped up computer program.
