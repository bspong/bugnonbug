Firefox forgets where I last saved a web page.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save a web page.
2. Crash explorer (or force firefox to close or crash it?)
3. Save a web page.
Actual Results:
Firefox open a dialog to save a web page to the desktop rather then the the last directory I had save a web page to.

Expected Results:
To save the web page to where I last saved a previous one to.

This might occur with other file type including compressed, audio, and image files, I don't know. I also suggest a feature in which there is a "save to" button rather then just "save" a is typical with dialog boxes, which ha a history of the last place you saved your stuff to and which you can even have preset save locations. At least make this for firefox 3 and please don't wait for a plugin to do it.
