The Sidebar History list is now sorted alphabetically. This arrangement would
be usable to some if every bookmark had a good, descriptive name. But too many
have name like these real name gathered from my Sidebar History list: "Login,"
"Welcome," "blank," "download.html," ".," "/shop/," "/?zi=1/x]8Sdn=," "-,"
"url," and "Type a Headline Here." A History list sorted by sequence visited
with most recent on top will be the most useful for the most users.
