Create a mechanism to notify observer when all panel are ready in the highlighter
This is a follow-up bug to bug 650794.

As more tool are being added to the Highlighter, we'll need a mechanism to notify interested observer when all panel are active and ready.

"not sure how we'll do that. The panel could be opening in any given order and will certainly be ready in a non-deterministic order. Maybe we could register a listener in IUI that wait for all of the panel ready notification to arrive and then fire a "ALLREADY!" notice to it observers."
