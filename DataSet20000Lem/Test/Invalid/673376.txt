Steps to reproduce:

I made an extension with an XPCOM binary component where I am required to pas a Window object a argument from JS to C++. The required file are attached a a ZIP archive. The extension work perfectly with Firefox 4,5 and 6.

Steps:
1. Create a dummy extension where myFunc() is somehow called by any event.
2. Compile IMyExtension.idl with xpidl to produce IMyExtension.h and IMyExtension.xpt.
3. Create a DLL with the file IMyExtension.h, MyExtension.h and MyExtension.cpp
4. Add the DLL a binary component and IMyExtension.xpt a interface in the chrome.manifest file of the dummy extension.
5. Attach the extension with Firefox.
6. Run Firefox and execute the event that call myFunc().


Actual results:

Exception wa thrown:

[Exception... "Cannot find interface information for parameter arg 1 [IMyExtension.Func1]" nsresult: "0x80570006 (NS_ERROR_XPC_CANT_GET_PARAM_IFACE_INFO)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://MyExtension/content/myextension.js :: myFunc :: line 11" data: no]


Expected results:

Message Box should have been displayed with message "Func1 wa called."
