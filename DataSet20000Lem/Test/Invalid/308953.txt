When I try to open up Mozilla Firefox, each time I click on my default profile,
I couldn't get in it because it said it is already in use. I must always make a
new profile each time I want to get into Mozilla, but I have all my Bookmarks
and save password etc. on my default profile. I am the only one on my computer
and I'm positive that I am the only one here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up Mozilla
2.Choose user profile appears
3.Problem happens here.

Actual Results:
Same a always, wouldn't let me into my own profile, I have to create a new one.

Expected Results:
Let me into my own profile.
