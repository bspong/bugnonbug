I entered a zone "https://portal.applicationengineers.com" in IE View to be
opened in IE. This page/site is password-protected. When go to that site (this
page or one of the other page on this site), you need to enter name and
password (or push escape) before you are redirected to IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.make sure you have "https://portal.applicationengineers.com" in IE View configured
2.go to the url
3.

Actual Results:
it asks password, you can enter or press escape, and then it move to IE

Expected Results:
It should have rerouted to IE before asking the password
