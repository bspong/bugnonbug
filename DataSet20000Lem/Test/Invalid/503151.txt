For week when browsing, my link keep getting hijacked.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0.11

Simply, I click on a link when searching, only to have the link I click hijacked. Today, I tried to go to:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemangioma, but I ended up at three different sites, click.com, something else, then http://www.bullz-eye.com/?amp;n=ab698423&amp;cb=1234567890. Will I have to go back to IE8 or Opera??? This ha been going on for at least 3 month with no fix from Foxfire!!!

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
click.com,
something else,
then http://www.bullz-eye.com/?amp;n=ab698423&amp;cb=1234567890

Expected Results:
