When attempting to download a file defined a "application/octet-stream" , There is no classic "What should firefox do with this file" dialog but only "save" option. For example,download a Zip file, if server send it a "application/zip" ,there will be the classic download action choosing dialog, however, if it's sent a "application/octet-stream" , I can't do anything else but saving it, for whatever file extensions,such a EXE, ZIP,RAR...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://entropymine.com/jason/testbed/mime/
2. Click on "application/octet-stream" (A/B/C)


Actual Results:
A dialog with only the "Save" option.

Expected Results:
A "What should firefox do with this file" dialog related to the specific file extension.

I've tested Firefox 2.0 Beta 1 and didn't encounter this.
Also I have tried to edit the MIME type of Firefox but still didn't work.
