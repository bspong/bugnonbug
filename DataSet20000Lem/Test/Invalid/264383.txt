Html code is displayed instead of web page

I'v recently installed a new Apache web server and I've found that some
webpages, not all, are displayed a text/plain instead of text/html. So I get
code instead of a web page. The one thing that is odd in this, is that the
problem is complety random but normaly occurs when rapidly refreshing a page
several times.
If you right click the page and go to View Page Info you can see that content
type is text/plain.

This problem only go away when saying to apache that it should use
DefaultContenType text/html (default is text/plain). After this the problem
never come back...

By the way this problem doesn't appear in IE ....

I've to check also if this isn't an Apache bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. rapidly refresh a page until you get html code instead of html parsed

Actual Results:
I get html code

Expected Results:
Parse the page normaly
