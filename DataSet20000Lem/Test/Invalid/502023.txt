When scrolling large web page up or down (for example, in a blog topic with a lot of comments) with the keyboard (arrows up / down or pgup / pgdown) screen update very slowly (one update per second) but the average speed of scrolling is normal (like redrawing the screen occurs in the memory without displaying the screen).
But when scrolling a page using the mouse wheel like no, update the screen fast enough.

Reproducible: Always
