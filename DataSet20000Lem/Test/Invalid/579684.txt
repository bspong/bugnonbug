This ha just happened with the last nightly build, but I think it's a major issue.

When I enter a URL in the Address Bar and press Enter, nothing happens. Firefox just ignores the command and doe not even try to load a page. Clicking the blue triangle doe nothing either.

Essentially, the Address Bar is dead.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter URL in Address Bar. Any URL will work.
2. Press Enter or Return.
3. Nothing happens.

1. Enter URL in Address Bar. Any URL will work.
2. Click blue triangle.
3. Nothing happens.
Actual Results:
Nothing actually happens after clicking Enter/Return or the blue arrow.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have loaded the page based on the URL entered.

I am using the default theme and this worked until I just installed the latest nightly build.
