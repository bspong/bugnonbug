When you visit the site http://www.nclax.com, there's a menu at the top of the page that cause a dynamic drop down menu to appear when the mouse hovers over it. Each item on the menu is a link to another page a most can discern. The link work normally when left clicking, but when you middle click on one of the link to open it in another tab, the link doe not open. Now the dynamic menu appears to be mostly based on javascript, so I'm assuming that this is a browser issue and is fixable. Let me know if I'm totally off.

On a side note, some other site with dynamic menu built with flash also have similar behavior. Although that may be out of the hand of the developer a it probably pertains to the flash plugin.

Alright, that wa my two cents. Sorry if it sound noobish, I'm not a knowledgeable with coding a alot of you guy are.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.nclax.com.

3. Move the mouse down over one of the links.
4. Middle click one of the link to attempt to open it in another window.

Expected Results:
The link should open in another tab, or at the very least, open.
