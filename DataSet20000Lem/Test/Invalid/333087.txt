I often leave my computer on all day, and after a few hour of being open, Firefox will be using a much a 150MB of my system RAM, with about 5 tab open. I leave my computer on standby and dont close Firefox for a much a 3 or 4 day sometimes. By this time, I recieve a "Virtual Memory Too Low" error from Windows. Closing firefox fix the problem. A side affect of using so much RAM is that the computer ha to resort to storing temp. file on the hard drive, which is unacceptably slow. Please fix this problem!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Don't shut off computer or Firefox for extended period of time
3. Watch your computer slow to a crawl

Actual Results:
My computer slowed down. Alot. And Firefox wa using an ungodly amount of RAM. Right now, after 3 hours, it is using 90MB, which is just too much.

Expected Results:
It should... not use so much?
