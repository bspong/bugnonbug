With HTTPS, the Subject Common Name get ignored if subjectAltName extension is present.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.8) Gecko/20061118 ((Linux)) Galeon/2.0.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.1

[Tested with Firefox 1.5.0.9 and 2.0.0.1]

If the server's SSL certificate contains the subjectAltName extension,
the regular Common Name (CN) listed in the subject field get ignored
and a wrong security warning is displayed.
(see attached screenshot).

Adding the CN to the subjectAltName field "solves" the issue, but
according to RFC 3280 this should not be necessary.

Excerpt from RFC 3280:

4.2.1.7 Subject Alternative Name

The subject alternative name extension allows *additional* identity
to be bound to the subject of the certificate.

Only if the subjectAltName extension is marked a a "critical" extension
*and* the Subject field is empty, the subject field itself can be
ignored by the application.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a server SSL certificate that contains "node.example.com" a it Common Name, and contains a subjectAltName with a DNS attribute for "othernode.example.com".

2. Accessing the Web site with the name "node.example.com" result in a wrong security warning (similar to the screenshot I've attached)

Actual Results:
Firefox show a security warning that the name of the Web site doe
not match the name in the certificate, even though the CN is correctly
set in the Subject field of the certificate.

Expected Results:
The Subject Common Name (if set) must always be checked/used by Firefox
even if the subjectAltName extension field is present.
