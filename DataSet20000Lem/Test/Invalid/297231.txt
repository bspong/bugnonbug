Firefox is too picky in file handling
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: All version of Mozilla Firefox ever to have been released.

There is a certain method that you may or may not want to support in maximizing
one's benifit of a free webhosting service by removing it's ad from your
webpage. The trick: rename all webpage to the file extension of .jpg instead
of .htm (of course with the exception of your index.htm that need to load
automatically). This trick work wonder in every browser except for Mozilla
Firefox.

Given the moral questionability of the practice, I'm not urging you to fix the
issue, but just letting you know about it. Fixing this issue would surely
encourage several of my friend to use the browser a much a I do.

Here's the problem. When any other browser encounter the file, they ignore
the extension and find a text header inside the file (I think header is the
right word, I'm no computer engineer), and translate it accordingly. The page
load seemlessly. In firefox, it read the extension and expects an image to
result, and when it get text, it just ignores the output and post an error
message saying that the image contains errors.

This is annoying when I try to view one of my friend home page just to be
reminded once I get to it that I have to switch to Internet Explorer.

Steps to reproduce:
Visit http://schnitzendoble.tripod.com/ in any other major browser. Watch it
load the home page, then click "Offshore Work," and watch it load. Now do the
same in Mozilla firefox. The frame just don't load.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://schnitzendoble.tripod.com/ in any other major browser.
2.Watch it load the home page, then click "Offshore Work," and watch that load.
3.Now do the same in Mozilla firefox, and see it not load.

Actual Results:
The frame called to load offshore.jpg load the error message "The
image 'http://schnitzendoble.tripod.com/files/offshore.jpg' cannot be
displayed, because it contains errors."

Expected Results:
The frame called to load offshore.jpg should load it a a webpage. In other
words, Mozilla Firefox should have the flexibility to read a .jpg or .gif file
(or any other file type) a a .htm text file. And perhaps vica-versa.

This ha always been a problem with Firefox, even from version .1. I've been
waiting, hoping to see it fixed, and just recently thought to report the
problem. The problem exists on Windows 98 SE, 2000, and XP; on several
computer of very distinct hardware configurations; and on several different
webservers hosting several different webpage made by a number of different
people.
