Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit add-on manager either typing "about:addons" in adress bar or from tools->add-ons
2.I presently have silvermel theme installed. I can't give a complete list of add-on I have installed because the page is not working but some of them are: Adblock Plus; WOT; Compact Menu2; FoxyProxy Standard; Weave sync;Add-on compatibility reporter;Norton IPS; Orbit downloader Plug-in(Orbit 3.0.0.4); .NET framework assistant; JAVA quick starter; JAVA console
3.Try to do thing I mentioned in my details.
Actual Results:
Repeating:
1) I can't scroll in add-on page. There is no scrollbar in the page & mousewheel scroll/press don't work either.
2) Theme removal can't be undone. The undo button doe not work for themes.
3) Themes can't be applied. The button is greyed out even for the default theme.
4) Add-on picture don't show up.
5) Get add-on page is not working.
6) In Search page, the option to search within installed add-on & all add-on can't be toggled. The respective checkboxesare disabled.
7) Get add-on page is still not working.
8) Add-on compatibility reporter report drop-down box is not showing up on each add-on.
9) On left pane, count for every category show zero.
10) Add-ons rating star not showing up although the option is available.
11) No apparent function of the "Show more"/"Show Less" button.
12) Update check progress not showing.

Expected Results:
Not considering that this is a nightly build:
1)I should be able to scroll add-on page.
2)Theme removal should undo just fine a add-on
3)At least the default theme should be available to be applied.
4),5),6) & 7)maybe Get add-on page is still not ready. But even the placeholder are not properly appearing
8)Add-on compatibility reporter should work or an update should appear. According to Mozilla ad-on website, there is no newer version available. I don't know if this is the fault of UI or the add-on.
9) I am not sure what the number are for, but they should be comprehensible to the user.
10)Add-on rating should appear user should be able to give his/her rating (login needed? where?)
11)"Show more"/"Show less" button should toggle between detail & compact view
12) I am not even sure if update checking is working or not. But it should give some indications.


I am not complaining because Minefield is supposed to have bug of this kind & more severe, but I faced problem searching if these thing have already been tracked. They are so obvious! The bug list at this page ha the "All-time Top 100 (loaded initially) | Hot in the last two week " views, hardly helpful for finding nightly bugs. I searched manually here & in Builds forum & couldn't find any report of this add-on manager overhaul so I decided to report.
