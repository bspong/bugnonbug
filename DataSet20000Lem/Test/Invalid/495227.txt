When I compared the real test and the reference, I discovered a yellow line which wa displayed around the nose. Technically, this would mean that Firefox 3.5 Beta 4 (and probably the older versions) fails the Acid2 test a it requires pixel perfection. Actually, this also seems to make the nose have some pixel errors, check the edge in the attached file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://acid2.acidtests.org/#top
2. Compare to the reference.
3. Yellow line being there?
Actual Results:
There's a yellow line around the nose which shouldn't be there.

Expected Results:
The nose should just be plain black when not hovered.
