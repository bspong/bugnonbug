Allow to clear single item from the Clear Recent History dialog via per-item "Clear Now" button
... by adding "Clear ... Now" (or similar) button after all items. This nicely allows to drop these button from the reorganized pref window (as done in bug 340677) but still prevents unnecessary clicks, i.e. you don't have to uncheck all item if you e.g. only want to clear the cache.
