After enabling private browsing mode in Firefox 3.6 I noticed that previously saved user name and password could be auto completed by clicking on the login field on a website, new account information did not result in the prompt if I wanted to save the password information.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable private browsing
2. Go web site like http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/discussions
3. Create an account (making sure no existing password detail are stored)
4. Select login
5. Enter account information
6. No prompt to save password is given
Actual Results:
No prompt to remember password

Expected Results:
prompted to remember password
