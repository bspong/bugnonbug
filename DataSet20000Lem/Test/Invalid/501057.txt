It seems this bug ha been reported before (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=478600, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=469483) but the solution provided did not solve the issue for me. The problem is initiated when the three finger swipe left is used; Firefox hide a though command+h wa pressed.

I have confirmed that this is user specific since the other user on this computer doe not have the same issue.

At this point I wonder if it may be something related to the OS X user-specific configuration file rather than Firefox itself. Although all other three finger left gesture work correctly within the OS.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open browser
2. navigate to a new page
3. swipe left to go back and browser hide
Actual Results:
Browser hide a though command+h wa pressed

Expected Results:
navigate to the previous page

only plugin installed is Google Bookmark Button Reloaded 0.9.6. Disabling plugin doe not remedy the issue.
