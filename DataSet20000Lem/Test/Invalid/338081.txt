Normally in the address bar you can type in a keyword such a "downloads" and fire fox will take you right to downloads.com, well I know that my firefox ha spyware or something messing with it because it sends everything to quick search- quicksearch sux. How do I go about getting rid of this pest of a search engine, and getting back to the firefox I have grown to love.

Reproducible: Always
