Fullscreen glyph/icon not honoring text mode

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.3a1pre) Gecko/20090917 Minefield/3.7a1pre

Currently on trunk, when setting my toolbar icon to either 'text' or 'icons and text' there is no change to the glyph/icon in fullscreen mode.

This preference of customization should be honored for the new glyph/icon.

See screenshot for behavior on trunk.
