When in Full Screen mode I have access to the Navigation & Tab Bars (at the top of the screen).
But, I can not access anything in the Add-on Bar at the bottom of the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Add-on Bar is turned on, then go into Full Screen mode (F11/Firefox button->Full screen)...
2. Move cursor to bottom of the screen.
3. The Add-on Bar doe not display.
Actual Results:
Moving cursor to bottom of the screen, doe not display the Add-on Bar.
Like the Navigation & Tab Bars (at the top of the screen).

Expected Results:
Moving cursor to bottom of the screen would bring the Add-on Bar up so it can be used.
