What do I have to do to get my favorite URL's one or two click from one to the
other? How do I get the list of what I want where I want on your browser. I
don't want to read twenty page of made for engineer page telling how to do
it. Opera did the same thing to their browser and a soon a I saw what they did
it wa off my machine. Give me something I can really rock and roll with. I like
where you are going, but I want the drop down list I can click and go on. If I
can't get that you are gone.

What good is it if I can't use it? I can replace anything inside the case.
Usually, I can get the right BIO's and driver for whatever I replace. I have
even played with reformatting hard drive and loading new OS's. What is wrong
with the designer if the user hate using what they design? I can see lot of
thing I like and want to play with, but if I can't do what I want ,it's gone.
