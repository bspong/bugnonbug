Sessionstore file are huge and function is slow and it still doesn't work properly

Sessionstore is saving too much data, too frequently. The file could grow to more than 1MB in size in limited cases.

The speed hit when trying to open Firefox with only a few tab is more than noticeable. The impact on speed and performance when restoring many tab (for example, the case of student during exam season), is phenomenal. With many tab open, completely disabling the background restore is the only way to keep Firefox from bringing the whole system down. The objective of sessionstore is to save user from trying to remember what wa open before any crash or close. But with the speed hit, this is a self-defeating goal at certain thresholds.

When restoring a session on a wireless connection, page are often replaced by a gateway authentication request. This request most often change the domain in the address bar. Despite the change in domain, Firefox will *sometimes* fail to register that a different page ha been visited, thus *sometimes* losing the previous address of that tab. You can not go 'back' to it, because Firefox morphs the old address into the new address without generating a history increment. This is a timing problem, else the behavior would be 100% consistent (either 100% loss on gateway redirect or 100% success in updating the 'Back' button for each tab), per gateway of course. Different access point generate a redirect in different ways, and some should be easier to spot than others.

#It is worth noting that this last behavior ha gotten worse in the FireFox 3+ line. In FireFox 2, crashing the browser with [Ctrl-Alt-Del->End Process] while it wa still loading tabs, resulted in the next start safely recovering all page (Provided one had since authenticated or moved to an unrestricted connection). In FireFox 3, even this extreme and difficult (timewise) operation doe not prevent the loss of some page addresses. I assume that this load-lagging aggressiveness is a 'Feature' of the 3+ line.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Compare the size of sessionstore.js with the number of saved tabs.
2.Keep a log of your startup times, they generally keep getting longer. (And they get much longer, more sharply, a number of restored tab increases.)
3.Just try using this thing at coffee shop and libraries. You will rapidly come to value the use of a second browser to log in with.
Actual Results:
Huge files.

Slow performance and significant CPU load.

Corrupted tab history and lost pages.

Expected Results:
Well, file size is relative, but I'd expect some positive result from caching all that data (such a faster loading of cache-defined page elements). I've seen page load faster on browser that store le than 0.3K/tab in the sessionstore.

From other bug report being crossed out, and more search and reading today, some of FireFox's more baffling speed hit are finally being ironed out. What's still missing however, is the scaling of sessionstore, and the management of rich medium in tab that are not being viewed. Steps taken to rule out flash and gif files, expose that some other culprit (most likely sessionstore) is wasting many CPU cycle on upkeep of tab that are not changing. I expect to see NO impact on system performance when the browser is idle or being lightly used, and there is no rich medium present.

This is perhaps the least wireless-friendly and least history-friendly browser. I had hoped that year of continued development and the rise of "portable computers" and "communication without wires", would finally result in a program that could be used with such technology. If nothing else, an "Enable Hotspot Check" menu item for laptop user would have been nice.

The reputation of Firefox ha been slowly shifting. Among my customer are a growing number who are dissatisfied with it speed, with it corruption bugs, with it scalability, with it ability to remember data, etc.

Firefox 2 wa in many way a nearly ideal browser. Especially thing like session and the address bar. Not once wa I driven to the point of trying to report an issue, the program simply worked well enough. I directed customer to try it, and they were mostly grateful. Firefox 3 ha made me angry, it ha made them confused.

Firefox is no longer the primary browser on any of my PCs or virtual machines, not even under Linux. More than half of my customer have moved to other products. Please desist in offering reactionary "improvements" that are not well thought out and do not add to the user experience.
