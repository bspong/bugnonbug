Bookmark-Toolbar Icons wont load with newest Nightly versions, all OS
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:10.0a1) Gecko/20110929 Firefox/10.0a1
Build ID: 20110929030852

Steps to reproduce:

Upgrade to latest Nightly a of yesterday, 29.Sept.2011 with 4 diff OS's and all
had more or le problem getting the icon loaded in the Bookmark's Toolbar.
Win7, Srv2008R2, SBS2011, Ubuntu 11.04, while Win7 ha the biggest error, half of the icon wont load, regardless if I mouseover, click&load, restart, even upgrading again today to latest build didnt bring my icon back.
On Ubuntu it didnt load the "Getting Started" button on a clean fresh install.
WinSRV's and another Win7 didnt load the icon at start but where able to load icon per icon when clicking&loading the website. just 1 Icon wont load, MS-Downloads page that is. So for now I can say, upon installing most icon are gone, some installation will recover and reload the icons, some just wont.

Used various Add-Ons on those machines, Xmarks, LastPass, Adblock-Plus ( + AddOn ) but it also did that on clean installs w/o any gimmick added.
