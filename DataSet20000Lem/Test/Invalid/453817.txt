I like to keep all my button on the top row to save space and now there is plenty of space for the address bar and any additional button I may want to add but whenever I restart my Firefox the Bookmarks Toolbar Items all go down under the little side arrow to save space a if there isn't enough space, but there is plenty of space.

I can only reproduce it in one profile other profile don't have this problem

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Put all your button on the top row next to the Menus
2.Make the other toolbars invisible
3.restart Firefox
Actual Results:
Look at the screen shot


The work around is that I must right click the Menus and 'Customize' and than, close the Customize Toolbar window and it go back to normal, and happens all over again the next time I restart Firefox
