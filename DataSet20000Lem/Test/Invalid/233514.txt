Milestone build return "0" for BuildID during XPInstall
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

BuildID usually contains the date+hour of a build (e.g. 2004020808), but the
Mozilla Firefox 0.8 milestone return 0. Previous 0.7+ branch build returned a
correct BuildID. This will cause extension installers using old detection code
to automatically install to the application folder instead of giving an option
to install to the profile folder.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. "Install" http://www.cosmicat.com/x/build_id.xpi
Actual Results:
XPInstall alert display 0 for BuildID

Expected Results:
XPInstall alert should display the build date+hour for BuildID
