Bookmarks and folder get deleted randomly. Here is an e-mail I sent to my
collage who also use FireFox 1.0:

I have a lot of bookmarked sites, and they need to be organized in
folders. Well, after awhile, i noticed some of my bookmarked Maddox
page where gone, then more were gone. Last week I bookmarked 2 new
sites, and put them in their own folder, after 2 days, they were gone.
This pissed me off, so I thought while logging in to my computer, "I
should ask the group about this." I clicked on my bookmark and now
about 1/8th of what I used to have bookmarked is gone. The site that
remain arn't site that I frequent, this really piss me off, for now
I have to try and find all of those lost sites, some of which I loved
to view, such a the Auschwitz photography site. Has this happened to
anyone else? What can be done to prevent it?

Reproducible: Didn't try

Actual Results:
