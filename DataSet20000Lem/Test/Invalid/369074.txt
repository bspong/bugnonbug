I have installed the check4change plugin. But it is not working a expected.
I have selected the text to be monitored and enabled the check4changed. But
without any change in the text also, when the page refreshes (after the stipulated time that wa set for monitoring) wa over, mozilla pop up one
window notifying that a change ha been identified. But when I checked that page, I could not find any change.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select text in a web page. Choose check4change option for that web page.
2. Set the monitoring time to 60 sec through custom option.
3. Check all the option in monitoring category and check the box "bring to
front" in notification category.
Actual Results:
Whenever the stipulated time expires, irrespective of the change in the web
browser, one pop up window appears notifiying that a change ha been identified.

Expected Results:
Pop up window must and should appear only when a change is identified not after
every time interval.
