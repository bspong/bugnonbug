The blue navigation bar on top of this page containing the "Internet Access",
"Services", "Channels" and "About TIMENet" displayed a single (blue) line with
option underneath it for all 4 option (as seen in IE before I installed FF)

FF display the line with extra option on a separate line each.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to webmail.time.net.my
2. look at the top navigation bar.
3. move over the top 4 item and see what happens

Actual Results:
the line with navigation option are displayed on 4 different line

Expected Results:
display the navigation option on one line right under the main navigation line

I am not aware if this is IE specific webpage or a rendering problem in FF.
