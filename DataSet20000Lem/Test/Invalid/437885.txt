Drag & dropping the menu when customizing toolbars ha no effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the "Customize toolbar" window
2. Drag the menu (with file, edit, view etc.) and drop it at another place
Actual Results:
After dropping it, the menu hasn't moved at all

Expected Results:
The menu should have moved like it doe with every other toolbar item.

Note: This doesn't mean that the user wouldn't be able to move the menu. There is an indirect and very inconvenient walkaround: You can drag other item and drop them so that they are before the menu.
