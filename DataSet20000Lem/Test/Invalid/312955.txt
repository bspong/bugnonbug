Since about 3 or 4 day ago when I performed an update to my extension when I
went to re-open firefox it came up with a blank screen and wouldn't let me do
ANYTHING aside from closing the window. After MANY time of closing and
reopening, it finally came up. What I noticed wa that the "create new tab"
icon wa back in my tab bar when multiple tab were open. I went into the
option and it wa still unchecked for it to appear in my tab bar. I checked it
off / closed and reopend firefox and everything seemed ok. Went back into
option and once again unckecked for the new tab icon to appear in the tab bar,
hit OK and closed firefox. Upon trying to reopen firefox it started giving me
the same error once again with the blank screen... Once it came back up (and
wa working) I rechecked the option once again (for the icon TO appear), closed,
reopened, and now it work fine. I repeated these step MANY TIMES and it seems
to be the only thing that make it happen.

SIDENOTE: I did try completely uninstalling and reinstalling firefox along with
rebooting everytime and it had no effect on this issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
see details, I don't want to retype all that again
