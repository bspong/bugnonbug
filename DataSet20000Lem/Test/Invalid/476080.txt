I cannot add to, organize or delete my bookmarks. When I try adding new one they either don't work or they save the wrong address from something I visited previously. It show the little blue star in my address bar that say I've bookmarked the page, but when I click on "Bookmarks" in the title bar it's nowhere to be found.

Also when I "Show All History" it's always blank, but I have FF set up to keep 30 day of history and I never have a problem going back or using the recently closed tab option. But it won't show history.

The only bookmark that don't mess up (but I still can't organize them) are the one from before I upgraded recently.

Peace!
