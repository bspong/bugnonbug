Inside a div, I am placing 4 divs with the rule "float:left;". Inside these four divs there is a list in each one.
The parent div (the one that hold the four divs floating to the left) ha no height, even though it should be a tall a the tallest div inside it.

The specified url ( http://www.definethis.org/temp/bugzilla/listitems/test.html ) show what I mean and also show a version of the same code but using tables, which appears fine.

Both version appear fine in IE7 and the page validates with W3 validator.

The four list should appear nicely on the background of the parent div.
