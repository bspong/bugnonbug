Fire Fox will allow me to go to face book initially, but within a few minute it grey out and say "Not Responding" in the top left corner. Once this happens, I am unable to use my computer at all. The Window just stay there, and I get the "please Wait" signal on my mouse pointer. This can happen for up to an hour and a half at a time, during which time Not Even the Task Manger will come up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open face book
2.visit a friend profile
3.
