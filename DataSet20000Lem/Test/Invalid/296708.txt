loading an image off the local hard drive doesnt work.
work in IE6, almost work in Opera7.53
adviced it fails due to potential security risk; yet the URL the page came from
wa literally 127.0.0.1/



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. place a p.png file in C:/
2. look at http://www.fourspace.com.au/t5.html it validates with w3.org

Actual Results:
IE6 display the image, Opera get all detail and make placeholder but doe
not render the pixels; Firefox1.0.4 (appears to) ignores the whole html tag.

Expected Results:
displayed the image.

if it a "security" issue to load an image from the local hard drive; the fact
the URL wa obtained from 127.0.0.1 should turn off that security "feature".
