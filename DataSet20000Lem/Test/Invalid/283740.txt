the new preference window (prefwindow v) ha some ui glitches:
* header list for the 'tabs' entry ha too many icon making the tab wider than
the rest
* when setting some preferences, like the 'select new tab opened from links'
button ha the opposite affect (the button is checked and they are not selected
on click, when un-checked, they are selected) - this may be more wide sweeping -
it appears a though i get more pop-up with this build, even though i have it
set to block them
* the effect of changing between element is horrendously slow
* the pref window ha the close button disabled (command-w will close it though)
* are the tab within element supposed to look like the old seamonkey tabs?

see the attached screenshot for the look of the window (have tried with fresh
and older profiles, same effect)
