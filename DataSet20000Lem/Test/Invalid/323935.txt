When I start typing my username I don't get autocompleting choices. I also have the same problem on other sites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1. go to www.gmail.com
2. start typing in username
3. should give possibility if you already entered it before

Actual Results:
no suggestions, autocompletions

Expected Results:
a list of previous entered usernames

I see the following error in the javascript console².

Error: Node wa not found = NS_ERROR_DOM_NOT_FOUND_ERR
Source file: chrome://global/content/bindings/autocomplete.xml
Line: 621

For every keypressed an error is added to the console.
When I disable extension "Google Toolbar for Firefox 1.0.20051122" the problem is solved.

So maybe it is a google toolbar problem?
