After quitting Firefox 1.5 beta the auto-hide dock of Mac OS X freezes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Overwrite firefox.app (1.0.6) with the 1.5 version
2. Run firefox and visit any site.
3. Quit firefox (either through the menu or keyboard shortcut).
4. Move mouse cursor onto lower part of screen, where usually the auto-hide dock
show up.

Actual Results:
Dock freezes, the only way to make it show again is by right-clicking on the
lowest area of the screen, the dock show but when any of the dock icon are
hovered over by the mouse, it doe not show the usual magnification animation
nor the text title above the icon. Although clicking on the icon will still
launch that application.
