Although 1.5 wa reconized? but another confussing point is in my about Firefox info from the toolbar it show this Firefox version 1.5.0.1 "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1"
I found this page that talk about 1.8 http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=Firefox
