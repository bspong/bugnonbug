On the left side of the menu bar there is a small (a few pixel wide) something resembling a button. If doe not react on clicks, it can not be removed while customizing the tool bars. It just sits there and annoys me, a i do not know where it is coming from, and what it is good for.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just start Firefox

Actual Results:
The "button" appears on the left side of menu, partially covering the letter "F" in "File".

Expected Results:
The "button" not being there? ;-)

It is not theme-related, a i tried several themes, and personas. The button is always there.
