When the downthemall extension is the only open window the menubar is unresponsive, short key are also broken.

you have to close the dta-manager window to get functionality back. this suck if you are in the middle downloading a large unresumable file and want to continue browsing the web a dta will stop the download if you close the dta manager window!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open dta manager, close other firefox window
2. attempt to use the firefox menubar item
3. or short keys, i.e. cmd-n for a new window.
Actual Results:
either no menubar item are visible, or if they are blank menu pull-downs are displayed.

shortcut key do nothing. cmd-n will not open a new window.

Expected Results:
firefox menubar item should be displayed and be functional while dta manager is open. open new window should open a new browser window. cmd-n should open a new window, etc.
