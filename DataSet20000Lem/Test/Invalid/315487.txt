Firefox 1.5 rc 1 is slow on mac osx (tiger) - seems to eat more and more memory over time (as reported by memory cell) and get more and more sluggish. Often when it get really slow, it will hang, and have to be force quitted because it won't respond to quit.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.run firefox for a while (hour or so) visit a few page

3.
