Add visit in the background
Created attachment 316766

This start work on adding visits, when possible in the background instead of right away (or even delayed add but still on the main thread). It's not great, doesn't pas all the unit tests, and requires a storage patch that I don't intend to attach anywhere because it's a pretty big hack at best.
