I am using Centos 5.4 64 bit. Firefox 3.0.12 provided with centos is working fine but if I try to use the latest firefox-3.6.8 (the problem happened with most of the 3.6.x version), it crash when visiting some web page and in particular http://www.mozilla.com. It is not only firefox that crash but the whole X session, so you are loosing all your opened application and you have to login again. I tried to run firefox-3.6.8 using the -safe-mode option but the result is the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.goto http://www.mozilla.com

Actual Results:
The X session crash and you have to login and open a new X session.

Expected Results:
At least, crash only firefox but not the whole X session.
