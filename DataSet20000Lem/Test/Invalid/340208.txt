I tried adding a search plugin (via link rel=search tag) using OpenSearchDescription (Also tried MozSearch)

Although the plugin is detected and added to the search drop-down list, I get an error when selecting "Add My Search" from the menu.

I suspect that the problem is caused by the fact that the search plugin is hosted on localhost:21420 (It may be either the localhost or the non-standard port that cause the problem)

I have a local web server running on http://localhost:21420/ and the osd.xml file is being requested, detected properly, but not added.

The error message is a follows:

"Bon Echo could not download the search plugin from:
http://localhost:21420/lib/osd.xml"

I also get the same error when using a MozSearch plugin copied from mozdev:

http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Creating_MozSearch_plugins

I used the last example on that page, copied exactly so that I would not introduce any error in the code that might cause a problem. I can't see anything wrong here other than the fact that it is served locally and from a non-standard port number.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load a page with link rel='search' href='http://localhost:21420/osd.xml'
2. click the down-arrow next to search bar
3. select 'add (search plugin title)'
4. failure!
Actual Results:
Popup error:
"Bon Echo could not download the search plugin from:
http://localhost:21420/lib/osd.xml"

Expected Results:
Plugin added to search
