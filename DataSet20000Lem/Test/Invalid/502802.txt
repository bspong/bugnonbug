I had firefox (3.0) and google toolbars a firefox plugin installed on my computer. I set in the google toolbar setting, that use the google toolbar
a the standard serach toolbar and override the one of firefox

Yesterday, i have upgraded firefox to 3.5

In the elder version, i can drag a text, that selected on a webpage directly to the search bar. The text, which exists in the toolbar will be overwritten und a search for the new text will be automatically started. But after the upgrade, the text in the searchbar will not be overwritten but concated and i must press the enter-key to start a search.

I know, that firefox support the drag and overwrite of the text in the search bar, but it doe not function together with google tool bar.

Reproducible: Always
