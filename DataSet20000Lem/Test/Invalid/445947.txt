On Linux most applications, including mozilla, allow to navigate tab using Alt+<tab-number>, on Windows the only way to navigate tab seems to be Ctrl+Tab (very bad solution IMHO, especially if you open lot of tabs). Why don't choose a default behaviour and let the user change it. On Windows user could have a default behaviour the Ctrl+Tab key combination and select the Alt+<tab-number> if they're used to do so on Linux and viceversa. It would be nice to have also a visual tab browser in the style of Opera and IE7, with thumbnail of the tabs' content.

Reproducible: Always
