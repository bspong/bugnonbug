I just updated to today's nightly build from ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-mozilla-daily repos. Restarting Firefox change my default language. As in, after the restart the language of menu in Firefox remains English (US) a it always was. But Google.com, my homepage which open by default change to a random language. First time it happened I changed the default language back to English in the option Google provides on it page. But after restarting again, the language ha changed to some other random one.

2.visit google.com
Actual Results:

Expected Results:
