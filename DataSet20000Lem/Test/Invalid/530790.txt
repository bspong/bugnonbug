I have about 20 search engine installed and I have them organised in a paricular order. When I switch over to Fx 3.6. Beta 1 from Fx 3.5.5 the order of the search engine is all mixed up and some of them even disappear. If I change the order of them while in Fx 3.6 Beta 1, this is not saved when switching back to Fx 3.5.5 and they are mixed up a before. I have disabled all extension to make sure they are not causing this, and it still occurs. I have only tested this on Windows XP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a few search engine
2. Reorganise them to a particular order
3. Install Fx 3.6 Beta 1 and start up
4. Note that the order of the search engine ha changed
5. Close Fx 3.6 Beta 1 and return to Fx 3.5.5 and the search engine ordering remains mixed up.
6. This will always happen no matter how many time you reorganise them.
Actual Results:
Search engine order get changed.

Expected Results:
Should retain the order the search engine are set to across all version of Firefox.
