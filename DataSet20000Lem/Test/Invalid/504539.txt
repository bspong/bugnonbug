Stuck on old router page port

I change the the port my router wa using to port 80 from port 1080 and now every time I try to open my router Swiftfox try to load the page on port 1080 and I can't get it to change to port 80. Even if i add :80 after the IP address it change it to :1080. I have deleted all the line in the history that refer to the router IP, I do not want to clear all of my history in order to fix this. So how do I get it to go to port 80?

Reproducible: Always
