First, sorry for my english, I'm spanish.
Second, I do not know if there already is another report like this. Sorry.

When I visit a web page which ha a video on it, if the video format is for Internet Explorer by Micrososft, firefox crashes.

I have solved this by using IETab in some webs.

It hapens to me at www.gameprotv.com when I try to watch some of the videogames videoreviews like this one: http://www.gameprotv.com/index.php?s=stream&id=1442
I have updated my firefox to the lastest version.

Have a nice day.
