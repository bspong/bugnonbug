Firefox freeze when I go to this "URL", with no page output
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

I tried to touch the preference of the new Firefox, using the "about:config"
tip, and then the browser freezes, outputting no page. I have to close the
application from the W2k Task Manager

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type about:config in URL bar
2.Push Enter key or "Go" icon

Actual Results:
Firefox freeze

Expected Results:
To show a self-generated page, with all the configurable preference of the
browser (..it happened in previous version of the browser)
