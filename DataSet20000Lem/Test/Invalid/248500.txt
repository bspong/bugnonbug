Our company render webpage using XMLC/Barracuda MVC. Output file are in .jhtm
format. Latest Firefox (.9) will not attempt to render those page a web-pages,
but assumes a type BIN format and load the File Download dialog when accessing
in https. Sometimes will cause entire browser to hang (usually when accessing
over ssl) and we must xkill.

Oddly you can save an html file to disk, rename the extension, and then Open the
file and rendering will perform a expected.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a website with .jhtm extension
2. Hit the site in Firefox and witness attempted download
3. Cannot select "Open with"
4. Must "Save to Disk"

Actual Results:
Download Dialog appears saying:
welcome.jhtm
which is a: BIN file


Expected Results:
Page should render a any other typical HTML page.
