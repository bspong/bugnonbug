Having just installed Firefox 1.5 this morning, I tried to use the Toolbar Search feature, and after typing in an entry and hitting the ENTER key, nothing happened.
I've rebooted my computer and tried again with the same result. It worked fine on all previously installed version of Firefox, but it is not working in 1.5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type word or phrase in Toolbar Search field.
2.Press ENTER.
3.Wait for result, but nothing happens.

Actual Results:
Nothing happened.

Expected Results:
Expected Google, or Yahoo, or whichever engine I had selected to perform a search.

Although I wa using the "Formal Gnome" theme, I switched to the default theme, and met with the same result.
