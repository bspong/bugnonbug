Instance: History setting set to 0 day from prefs.

Now a you browse through the web you navigation bar ha it left arrow greened
and the dropdown list show the history. But the 'Go' menu item doe not show
any of these page there. So isn't there some inappropriateness? The question
is should the page be shown in the Go menu? As it is common practice even if
some one doesn't wish to keep history of web page visited,it should be kept /
shown a the session is active (until the browser shuts down).

If multiple tab are open the Go menu list should also change accordingly?
(displaying the appropriate list for each tab a the use switch to it)
Currenlty it is not so.

Please consider.

Reproducible: Always
