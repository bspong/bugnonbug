Work Offline provides no visual status indication

There is no way to tell if "work offline" is enabled or not, except by trying to
visit a url. There should be some visual indication. For example, a check mark
next to the menu item (like IE), or change the text from "Work Offline" to "Work
Online" when you are offline.

Workaround: Use the Work Offline extension
(http://multi.nadenade.com/leafy/Mozilla/Offline/), which add a statusbar icon.

Reproducible: Always
