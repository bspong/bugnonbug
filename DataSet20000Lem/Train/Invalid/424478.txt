I had over 25 tab open with different site and Firefox had memory image 770MB.
After I closed all tab memory usage didn't drop and resident size wa 540MB.

I loaded some other large process causing resident size of Firefox to go down below 100MB. But after I opened just one new tab with Google page resident size immediately went up to 470MB and and total memory image even grew to 780MB.

Conclusions:
1. Memory used by page isn't released when page are unloaded. Maybe memory is lost.
2. There are some very sparse structure that have high access coverage even when just one new tab is opened.

Firefox ha to free memory once it's not used any more.

Why would any object related to page stay in memory after I closed all tabs?
