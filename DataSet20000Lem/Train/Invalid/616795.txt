It's OK for new tab to appear at the end of tabbar when "+" is clicked, but when I open context menu of a existing tab and click "open new tab", I would expect the behaviour to be quite diffrent, that is, to open new tab right next to the tab from which it wa called. For people who use Firefox with +15 tab opened at any time, scrolling back and forth just to move their tab into desired order might be annoying, of someone care about the order, anyway.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open context menu of any tab.
1. Click "open new tab".
Actual Results:
New tab is opened at the very end of tabbar.

Expected Results:
New tab should open right next to the tab from which it wa called.
