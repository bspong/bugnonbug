After recent update of FireFox and of Gears and other extensions, Google Gears ha caesed to function and FF crash when i reinstall it.
I un-installed Gears and ALL other extensions, deleted prefs and Cache files, deleted FF, and re-installed new FF 2.0.0.12, installed Google Gears and clicked on restart. FF crash on the restart but will start at second attempt, Gears show in AddOns window and in Tools Menu but when I log in to Reader online the Reader doe not 'know' Gears is installed and the Gears offline function work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log in to Google Reader. Gears offline functionality missing: Blue (offline) or Green(online) button in upper right menu.
2.Click on 'offline' in upper right menu, Google asks if I want to download Gears wish allows offline reading - click on yes, new window open containing Gears download, click to install, installation complete, click on 'restart'.
3.Firefox crash on restart, generating Crash Report - Report say the gear extension is the issue, same issue every time (5). Crash Report in Actual Results. Again: Gears wa functioning until recent updates.
Actual Results:
After installing Gears extensions, FF crash on restart (see Crash Report below) and Gears extension doe not work thought it appears to be installed.

Expected Results:
After installing Gears extension, FF should restart, go to my Google Reader page (with 'offline' not Blue/offline or Green/online button in upper right menu), a window should open asking if Google Gears should function on/allow this page, I click yes, then the 'offline' disappears and the blue/green button appears. With Gears installed I should be able to log in to Reader, refresh the RSS feeds, click the Green button to cache the RSS feed and go 'offline' to read the feed without an internet connection.

I have reproduced this at least 5 times.
I don't use themes, this happens after all other extension have been completely removed and with all the same extension that have been used for months.
I have deleted all FF and mozilla file and caches, restarted, fixed permissions, logged in a a different user on my Mac, I installed an earlier FF 2.0.0.2 and deleted same after it crashed in exactly the same way, installed the newest ff2.0.0.12 from a freshly downloaded dmg and
the exact same thing happen.
I have searched Gears help and there isn't anything there. There is something seemingly similar in the Google Gears Discussions about a month ago but no one offered any suggestion and no Reader Guide responded.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I hope I have provided the correct information.
I appreciate that this is not a major issue for many FF user but it is extremely frustrating for me personally, but more importantly I have set up Gears on the computer at the community center where I volunteer and on a few client computers. The client use it to read RSS feed for the newspaper from their country of origin, to practice reading English, and to study current events. Gears allows people who do not have cable/broadband free access to a many RSS feed a they like without tying up their phone with dial-up service, and it work on older computers. These computer (virtually the same set up a the one listed here) are all having the same problem.
Thanks.
