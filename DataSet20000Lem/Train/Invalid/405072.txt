The Resizer toolbar item only work properly when placed alone between the Address and Search fields. In any case where it's next to a button, using it can wreak havoc on button width toolbar-wide; Icons get squished or padded, and aren't easily returned to default width.

If the Resizer's only purpose* is to resize the Search field, and indeed it make trouble when put anywhere else, then it should just be attached to the Search field. I propose borrowing the resizing code from the Searchbar Autosizer extension, if it author allows it. There's a step in it Configuration Assistant that let you freely resize the Search field, and it doesn't squish/stretch your toolbar button in the process.

*: Even if there are item besides the Search field that might benefit from resizability (ex. Flexible Spaces), they are the exceptions. IMO it's better to make them intrinsically resizable on a case-by-case basis, rather than having a standalone Resizer that's useless or harmful in most positions.

(I also think the Search field should only be resizable in Customize Toolbar mode, but that's a smaller, separate issue.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View -> Toolbars -> Customize...
2. Place the Resizer next to a toolbar button (or vice versa) on the toolbar.
3. Close the Customize window, and drag the Resizer around until it start squishing/stretching toolbar buttons.
Actual Results:
Various toolbar icon get squished or padded, and are difficult to return to default width.

Expected Results:
Toolbar button width should not be affected by the Resizer, which in turn should not be independent from the Search field.
