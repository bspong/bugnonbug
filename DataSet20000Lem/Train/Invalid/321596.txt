Hi,

when accessing
https://downloads.checkpoint.com/dc/login.htm
firefox 1.5 (and the previous versions) use SSL and display the URL with a yellow background, but show the lock symbol with a red bar (while e.g. konquerer show the lock symbol in the usual way).

If this is not a bug, then there is something wrong with the web page, which cause firefox to not accept it. Pretty good if firefox doe additional tests.
But I could not figure out why firefox is not accepting the site. If there is something wrong with the site, then firefox should give detail about, otherwise it is pointless.

When I check the security tag of the page info dialog, it say

"...The identity of this web site ha been verified by
Verisign, Inc...."

So what's wrong then? Why doe the browser show that there's something wrong, while the page info say it's signed properly?

The only hint I could see is that the page info say that the connection is "Partially encrypted: Parts of the page were not encrypted before being transmitted over the Internet."

What exactly doe this mean? Are there unencrypted graphic elements? Frames? Includes? Styles? And if so, is this the reason for the negative lock symbol? It is pretty difficult to figure out what firefox is complaining about.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get https://downloads.checkpoint.com/dc/login.htm
2. View the security symbol in the URL bar and the status line at the browser window bottom
3. Compare with the info on the security tab of the page info dialog.
