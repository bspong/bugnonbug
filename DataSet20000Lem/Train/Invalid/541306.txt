Hello,
Since yesterday I got showered with email reporting JavaScript error happening in our App. After investigation it pointed me to your new FF version 3.6.
Error message: "setting a property that ha only a getter" This error never ever bubbled up in our APP before on previous FF version (3.5 and less). I tested that.
What is going on?
Shouldn't this be just kind of warning message for the Error Console? Or am I missing anything. We didn't do any update on our app, so the problem is coming from FF update.

Reproducible: Always
