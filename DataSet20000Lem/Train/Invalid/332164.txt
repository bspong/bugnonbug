Better access to Advanced Search in Places

There is no way to immediately start Advanced Search. Only after the user type some word in the basic mode can he use advanced queries. If he doesn't want to use any string but only other constraint which I don't think is uncommon, there is no way to access Advanced Search directly. It is unfortunate and this use case should be handled better.

In addition to that, the (+) button on the far right isn't noticeable enough and it's not clear that it is related to searching a it isn't associated with search field.

Probably it would be best to discus idea on how to improve it on m.d.a.f
