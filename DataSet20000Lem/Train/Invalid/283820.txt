The Tools -> Options -> Downloads -> Download Actions -> View & Edit Actions
dialog show two entry in the list for the MP3 extension in my case. Both
entry can be assigned different action which is confusing.

This might be accountable to some application registering itself wrong, but it
would be nice if Firefox filter the list and remove one of the entries.

Reproducible: Sometimes
