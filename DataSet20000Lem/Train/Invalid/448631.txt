Note: This bug report differs from bug 425079

Tool bar customized so that back/forward, reload, home, and history are located to the right of "Help". At some point, I'm not sure when, the back/forward button duplicated itself placing one where I intended, beside help, and one in it's original location.

If I attempt to customize again, and drag the one located at the original position off the one beside help disappears. There seems to be no way to remove it from it original position.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Unsure of original condition to reproduce duplication. Can consistently reproduce the inability to remove it or move it to another location.
