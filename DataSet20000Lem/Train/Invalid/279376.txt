I wa entering a URL and accidentally hit some unknown key combination, perhaps
with alt or control and/or some function keys, and the menu bar disappeared, and
a window minimize/maximize/restore panel of button wa added to the toolbar.
(Screenshot http://penguin.med.cornell.edu/stuff/firefoxToolNoMenu.png) I
managed to access menu using 'Alt-F' but wa unable to find an item to switch
on/off menu bar under the Toolbars menu (though the Help screen suggested I
would find it there). Furthermore selecting 'Customize', I wa unable to remove
the minimize/maximize/restore panel, though I could remove other items, and
hitting 'Reset to Default' neither got rid of it nor restored the menu bar.

Perhaps whatever this highly dangerous key combination is could be removed and
made into a menu operation or a config-file operation for advanced users?
