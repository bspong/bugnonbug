I do not think this is so much an error in Firefox than an add bug that may be exploiting one, but in case there might be a way to block such bugs; I thought it wa worth mentioning. The bug is most noticeable on search engines. When you submit any query, than click any result, about 9 out of ten this happens:

* URL in address bar appears normal, page appears to be loading.
* Suddenly URL in address bar change and redirects you.
* Arrive at redirected page.

EXAMPLE OF REDIRECT URLs:
* http://riva.1317.get-search-results.com/jump1/?affiliate=riva&subid=1317&terms=peace&sid=Z187044523%40QzXwMDOyMDMz81MwQzMfhTMfdjMx8FM0YDOwADM5ITM&a=evin&mr=1&rc=0

Of course, whatever is doing it is probably listed in the task manager. Unfortunately, I am not computer literate enough to know which one it is. Here is a list of the process running when the bug is active:

atiedxx.exe, AutoDect.exe, cAudioFilterA..., CCC.exe, ccSvcHst.exe, csrss.exe, dwn.exe, explorer.exe, firefox.exe*32, InstStub.exe, mjsetup.exe, MobileConnec..., MOM.exe, plugin-contain..., sidebar.exe, SmoothView.exe, SynTPEnh.exe, SynTPHelper..., taskhost.exe, taskhost.exe, taskmgr.exe, TCrdMain.exe, Teco.exe, ToshibaServic..., TosNcCore.exe, TosReelTimeM..., TosSENotify.exe, TPCHWMsg.exe, TPwrMain.exe, TWebCamera..., winlogin.exe, wuaclt.exe


For whatever reason occasionally you will find one or two link it doesn't redirect from such as: http://www.bulldogbroadband.com/ http://www.monsterenergy.com/ http://www.coloniallife.com/ http://www.thestar.com/

(I don't know if there is anything special about such site or if it chooses them at random.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any search engine.(Assuming the bug is present on one computer)
2. Submit query.
3. Click on a result.
Actual Results:
I wa redirect to a completely, irrelevant site.

Expected Results:
Preferably, arrived me to the intended page.

This bug effect any browser and make navigation extremely difficult if not fruitless. The only method I have come up with to combat this is to stop loading the page while the correct URL is present, than click refresh. It is potentially threatening a it will redirect one download page to another; consequently, an unsuspecting user might download a completely different software than intended.
