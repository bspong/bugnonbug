Firefox installer should support automatic installs to specified directory
I use ./installer -ma -hideBanner -dd path to perform automatic installs on windows, but it appears to fail on linux due to missing option -hideBanner and -dd.

I need this in order to automate test centered around release time where only installers are available.
