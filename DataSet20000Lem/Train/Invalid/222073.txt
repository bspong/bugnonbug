It installs under user root, and work fine...

Won't install for non-priviledged user.

Able to install at least one other plugin.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login a non-root
2.Tools->Options->extentions
3.Attempt to install Flashblock

Actual Results:
Install failed. Error code: -239

Expected Results:
Less flashy

Would prefer an option to completely disable shockwave/flash required
notification. Maybe a checkbox on first popup of such notification, to never
ask me to install flash again.
