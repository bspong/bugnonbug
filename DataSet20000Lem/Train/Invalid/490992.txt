Popup blocking notification banner hide password storage banner
Firefox 3.0.9, Ubuntu 9.04

1. Log in to a Web site that try to open a popup window on the page following the login form. (One example of a site like this is <http://uk.westlaw.com/signon/default.wl?newdoor=true>. I don't have valid login detail to share for this site, however.)
2. Try to get Firefox to remember the password you entered.

What happens: The "Firefox prevented this site from opening a popup window." banner quickly replaces the "Do you want Firefox to remember this password?" banner, making it practically impossible to get Firefox to remember the pasword.

What should happen: The popup blocking notification should not replace the password question.

One way of fixing this would be to stack the two banners, one above the other.

(This problem wa discovered during Canonical user testing of Ubuntu.)
