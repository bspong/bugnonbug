Using two divs to simulate a window with title and content, in some case Firefox doe not render the bottom border of the first div.
On the website http://www.tgdb.net there's a "Latest News" list.
The way the two box should normally be shown is a seen at the news item "06/02 nVIDIA buy AGEIA Technologies", with one black line between the divs.
As seen on the page and on the image attached, the news item above show no image. I suspect it ha something to do with the font size, probably, but I'm not able to correct it by changing the fonts.
The CSS wa not changed for months, it worked fine, withouth problems, when I have coded the layout and I have just recently noticed this issue.
On IE6 it show fine.
Page validates with the W3 validator.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page or see image
2. Notice the lack of black border on some of the news item

Actual Results:
The black line between the divs is missing on some news items, not on all, even though the same code is used to generate them.

Expected Results:
The divs should all be the same a look.
