when you have installed and run mozilla firefox for the first time firefox asks
you if you want to set mozilla firefox a your standard webbrowser.
if you click yes you think that every webpage is opened by Firefox..
but it isn't that way.
when you open msn and click on the button mailbox(or whatever it is called i'm
not english so...:) )it still open your mailbox with IE.
but you have set firefox a your standard browser.
