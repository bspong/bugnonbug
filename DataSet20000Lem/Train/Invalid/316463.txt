Firefox crash basically everytime I pull up that myspace profile. I am assuming it's the javascipt that cause the hazing effect around the pictures, which load OK in ie, but not certain.
www.myspace.com/crazygirle

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox.
2.Browse to www.myspace.com/crazygirle
3.Navigate around the main page, reload a few times. Should be able to duplicate.

Actual Results:
something ha caused a crash in firefox.exe and window must close the program in a firefox popup. I don't want to reproduce it right now because then I'll have to type this over.

Expected Results:
Reopen firefox. A-OK , browse to that profile , crash



I have a number of the extension installed a well. Including fasterfox, imagezoom, colored tabs, gmail notifier, download statusbar, and stumbleupon. Please send me an email if you are unable to duplicate and would like me to try with certain extension disabled / uninstalled.
