Make nsINavHistoryResultViewObserver only for nsINavHistoryResultTreeViewer
The current generic result viewer interface ha addViewObserver and removeViewObserver which take a nsINavHistoryResultViewObserver interface. However, this observer interface is very much specific to tree views. This observer stuff should be moved to the nsINavHistoryResultTreeViewer interface.

This should require almost no code change since the tree viewer inmplements both of these interfaces.
