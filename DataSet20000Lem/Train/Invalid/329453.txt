The label of the place button (#places-bookmark) is not updated correctly (i.e. not always turned 'star off' when leaving a bookmarked page and not always turned 'star on' when browsing to a bookmarked page).

Note that detection of bookmarked page work nice, even if the label state "Star (Off)" (or "Star (On)") clicking the button give the dialog with the yellow background (or bookmark current page).

Casting a new tab update the button it.

You can see this using DOMi or by using 2 different image for the place button, one for the label "Star (On)" and the other for "Star (Off)", see http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2127791#2127791 for some stylish code.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use some cs tweak in tour userchrome.css to use 2 image for the star button
2. Browse to a bookmarked page
3. Look at the button image

or

1. Browse to a bookmarked page
2. Look at the button label with DOMi

Actual Results:
label isn't "Star (on)" or image is not the "Star (on)" one

Expected Results:
label should be "Star (on)" or image should be the "Star (on)" one
