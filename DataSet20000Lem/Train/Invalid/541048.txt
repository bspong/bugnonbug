Firefox 3.5.7 UserAgent ha the word "Gecko" missing
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; MS-RTC LM 8)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.5.7

Firefox 3.5.7 report UserAgent a following
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727

The word "Gecko" is missing from above UserAgent string and hence Firefox detection by looking for the word "Gecko" in UserAgent string fails for many implementations.

Can we please have the word "Gecko" restored in Firefox 3.5.7 UserAgent string?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "Help->About Mozilla Firefox"

Restore the word "Gecko" in Firefox 3.5.7 UserAgent string.

In the absence of the word "Gecko" in UserAgent string, many implementation incorrectly detect the Browser a IE 7 and subsequently throw Javascript errors.
