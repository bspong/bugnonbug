I am running Firefox 0.9.2 (even though the build identifier mention Firefox 0.8).

I customized the toolbars in my install by moving each element of the navigation
toolbar up to the right of the program menu (back, forward, refresh, stop and
home buttons). The address bar is then positioned to the right of the five
buttons. I am showing the icon only (no text), and using small icons. The
Navigation toolbar itself ha been hidden, a ha the bookmark toolbar.

When I click the drop-down arrow for both the forward and back buttons, the
bottom of the toolbar shift down slightly (one or two pixels). Both button
also shift slightly to the right when the drop-down menu appears. Closing the
menu cause the bottom of the toolbar to shift back up to it original position,
and the button shift back to the left.

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move each element of the navigation toolbar to the right of the program menus.
2. Hide the navigation toolbar.
3. Open the drop down menu on either the back or forward buttons.
