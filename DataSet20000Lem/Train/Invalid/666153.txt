Who is the idiot that ha developed software that detects where you are logging in from and set the language to that place??? Imagine one travel to China and log ind to google - what on earth is a guy to do with a chinese page??? In the old days, one could set the language for download of Firefox, Thunderbird and Filefox on the front page. I am not able to find how to set the download language for Firefox mobile to english - it will only do Swedish or Danish. Help!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Firefox mobile in foreign language country
2.See how it change the default to that contry's language
3.
