After updating to Firefox 3.6.3 this problem persists: trying to sign in to pandora.com (entering email, password into sign-in page fields) fails. No text character are generated in the data entry fields, and Windows generates an error tone for each key pressed. This started about 2 month ago, and subsequent update to Firefox have not fixed it. I have "allowed" popups for pandora.com, but this didn't fix it either. I can sign in just fine with Internet Explorer, but not Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. navigate to pandora.com
2. attempt to enter character into sign-in field (email, password)
3.
Actual Results:
cannot enter email and password into sign-in field at Pandora.com

Expected Results:
can't sign in to Pandora.com

Allow data entry into sign-in field at Pandora.com. No special theme ha been selected for Firefox, it's on "default."
