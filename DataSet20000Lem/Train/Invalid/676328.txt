Steps to reproduce:

I open a second and third tab and once the tab it loaded I click on them to try and view them.


Actual results:

The tab loaded but it wont let me view any other tab it just stay on a first tab.


Expected results:

Once the second and third have been made they should be able to be view when ever they are selected.
