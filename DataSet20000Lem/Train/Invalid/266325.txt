An iframe to a file doe ask if you want to download the file -- but only after downloading it to the temp folder already.

On this site, there is an iframe to an exe. Firefox downloads the exe to the
temp folder before asking if you want to actually download it, which could be a
security risk with certain file (viruses, etc). Do not goto the site unless you
have a good antivirus; it downloads a "Win32:Dialer-Y [Trj]" onto your system
via this exploit.

The file wa still downloaded with all extension off and the default theme set.
No extension caused this. Also note that I -DO- have firefox set to ask me where
to save every file.
