I often come across an issue with Google Reader in Firefox.Basically what happens is after using Google Reader in Firefox for a little bit, I will open a new tab and do some other browsing while Google Reader is still open in another tab. After awhile of scrolling/browsing in that new tab, I will go back to the tab with Google Reader loaded. Despite clicking multiple time inside the page to make sure that Firefox tab ha the focus, I cannot use the keyboard shortcut (j, k, m, etc.) to browse Google Reader.

The only way to regain this functionality is open up a new tab (not use an existing tab, this doe not fix it), browse to a web site with a search form (say google.com), and click in the text box. I can then return to the Google Reader tab and use the keyboard shortcuts. A refresh of the page doe not fix it. Closing the tab and then opening Google Reader in a new tab doe fix it temporary.

I have experienced this in both Windows and Mac using Firefox 2.0.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Google Reader and view a couple post using keyboard shortcut (j, k)
2. Open a new tab.
3. Scroll/browse in that new tab.
4. Go back to the Google Reader tab.
5. Attempt to browse through the list with the keyboard shortcut (j, k)
Actual Results:
Somewhat often you will notice that you cannot browse Google Reader with keyboard shortcut after this.

Expected Results:
Firefox will let me browse Google Reader using keyboard shortcut (j, k)

I cannot reproduce this every time, but for example just now while I wa typing this Bugzilla report, I switched to the Google Reader tab and could not navigate with the keyboard shortcuts.
