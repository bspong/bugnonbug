after upgrading to 3.0.6 the list of printer is wrong. It appears to be using an old list (I have no idea from where it is getting that list).
Same result when restarted in safe mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open print dialog
2.look for printer I normally print to
3.
Actual Results:
printer is not there

Expected Results:
printer should be there. It is my default printer and come up in all other apps

it is a network printer being shared on an old win2000 machine, but other shared printer on that machine do show up.
