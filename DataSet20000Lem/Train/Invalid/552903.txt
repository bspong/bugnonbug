Iceweasel take long time to load webpage when tcp-sessions number is restricted
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.18) Gecko/2010021719 Iceweasel/3.0.6 (Debian-3.0.6-3)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.18) Gecko/2010021719 Iceweasel/3.0.6 (Debian-3.0.6-3)

I use Debian Lenny. My internet connection ha a limit of 10 open tcp-sessions simultaneously.
For about a week I have a problem using Iceweasel (see picture). When I open a webpage IW stucks for several minute after opening some of image on it, and I can't open any other webpage in other windows/tabs at that time.
"ss -t -a" or "lsof | grep TCP" command show a bunch of "ESTAB" tcp-sessions but no data flow.
Konqueror work fine opening the same pages.
tested in IW 3.0.6 (lenny) and IW 3.5.7 (lenny-backports).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. restrict your internet connection to 10 open tcp-sessions (like some satellite internet provider do).
2. open any website with lot of picture (e.g. images.google)
3. open it in any other browser (e.g. konqueror)
Actual Results:
IW stucks opening the webpage while other browser don't.

Expected Results:
maybe IW should close tcp-session right after the file (e.g. image or css-sheet) wa downloaded.

I also use addons adblock, flashblock, noscript, downloadhelper, and umht. But that bug work even without any addons.
