bookmark small ui fixups
There's a few bug floating around on related things, so I'm combining them
here. Note that I'm just bringing up **small** fix here; if you want a
rewritten bookmark manager, make your own bug. :) There's already a few bug
filed on this stuff, but they're small, and easily dropped on the floor.

- remove New Folder/Bookmark/Separator from context menu in the Bookmarks menu.
Leave it in the tree view (manager, sidebar), and the personal toolbar folder.
Selecting one of these cause the menu to close up (can't do anything about
that), so you have to open the menu again to get to your new item.

- remove New Folder/Bookmark/Separator from context menu of bookmark -- i.e.
they'd only appear if you right-clicked an actual folder, and the new item would
go into that folder.

- remove the ability to rename the top-level Bookmarks folder (you can't rename
the menu, so why rename the folder?)

- make "Add Bookmark" dialog always default to the top-level Bookmarks folder,
with the recently-used folder listed below it and a separator. Even then, it's
not really clear that it's a list of recently-used folders; it look more like a
jumble of 5 randomly chosen folders. (bug 232089)

- instead of the above, never make the personal toolbar folder "recently used".
Right now, if you drag a site to the toolbar, and then later hit C-d to add a
bookmark, your most recent site default to the personal toolbar.

- get rid of the sidebar in the bookmark manager. it's a cool idea, but i'm
not sure I can fix the issue with it in time for 1.0:
* it ha issue in that it always show +/- expanders even when there's no
sub-folders, because there are other child but they get filtered out
* double-clicking to open one is weird, need to do it twice;
* other strangeness (bug 252858);
* most importantly, it ha no relationship whatsoever to the actual bookmark
manager pane: this type of two-pane view, you'd expect the right side to contain
the content of whatever's selected in the left sidebar, or to have action on
the left have an effect on the right, but nothing like that happens.

- if not get rid of it entirely, at least hide it by default and have a menu
option to show/hide.


any objection to these, or any suggestion to add?
