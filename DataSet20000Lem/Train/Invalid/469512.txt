My ATN web accelerator / ispbooster / slipcore 6.0.2 (the standard accelerator that many isp's offer to speed up browsing for dial up connections) doe not seem to work with Firefox at all, it just sits there & doesn't accelerate at all, but it work fine with Internet Explorer, though I'd rather be able to use with Firefox. I have the latest version of Firefox 3+. Accelerator icon doesn't change to indicate working & always say enabled saving 0.00. The incompatibility seems to also cause random internet disconnect & reconnect issues. Please help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have ATN accelerator installed on computer, then connect to Internet
2.Open Firefox browser
3.Bring up page or search & hover mouse over accelerator icon -it say either trying to connect or enabled saving 0.00.
Actual Results:
same a above

Expected Results:
Accelerator icon should change to show working & when hovering mouse over icon should say enabled with number behind it to show how much saving in efficiency.
