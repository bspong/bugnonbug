Not any particular website or timing that I can tell - but happens frequently. Have many tab open or a few a 5 or 6. Computer lock up ( nor keyboard or mouse response). have had outlook and/or Excel window open also but only occurs when using Firefox and only with 4. Started early to mid last week, power reset only cure, have walked away for up to 20 minute and still frozen when return. Last Friday loaded 3.6 and no problems. Sunday loaded 4 again and within about 1/2 hour system froze; back on 3.6 now since 4 is unusable.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Just happens randomly a few a 10-20 minute after starting FF4 or a long a several hours. Computer just lock up (no keyboard or mouse) and I have to "pull the plug".
