We have written a web application where it is possible to edit an image to
contain different input element later. For that purpose we upload the image to
the web server and display it a an image map to give the user the possibility
to add input element (checkboxes, buttons, etc.), we then reload the page and
place the input element with CSS positioning (absolute) over the picture (image
map), but in Mozilla this isn't possible (the browser show the input element
under the image map).
