In Firefox 1.5, Bookmarks Manager show the content of the Bookmarks toolbar a a folder named "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder". Expanding this folder allows user to manage the link that appear on the bookmark toolbar.

In Places, there is no analogous virtual folder for managing the link that appear in the Places toolbar. Since the toolbar itself is not keyboard-navigable, the only way to add an item to the Places toolbar is with drag-and-drop, and the only way to remove an item is to use the mouse to right-click and select "Delete".
