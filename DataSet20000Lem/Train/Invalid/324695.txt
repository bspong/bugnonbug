Firefox Browser Hijack using cert8.db

I installed a fresh Windows with Firefox 1.5. I installed an antivirus and a firewall software but not Spybot and other security software before browsing the web.

Shortly afterwards I sometimes got browser popups with publicity when opening the default home page. I installed all kind of Anti Spyware/Trojan Software but none could find the problem.

I wa finally able to localize the bug which lie in the file cert8.db. If I copy it to a new profile I will sometimes have popups when I open the default homepage. There seems to be a a limit how many time the popup will open though. The hijack will disable itself after a random amount of times(maybe 1-10) and only reappear after restarting Windows.

I didn't attach the cert8.db file, since I am not completly sure what kind of information is saved inside. Is there any private data at all? Am I able to see the contents?

I will send you the file, after you can provide me this information.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy cert8.db to the profile
2. Start Firefox several time until you see a popup
3. If nothing happens, reboot the PC

Actual Results:
A publicity popup open
