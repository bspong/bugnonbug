Cisco NetAcad (http://cisco.netacad.net) includes a gradbook feature, with link
to click on exam you have already taken to review the question (see the
answers). The link do not load properly in FF on OSX 10.3.6. This is hard to
fix because it requires a login and password to see the page the bug is on. The
link just are not there on any OS X browser (including Opera, Camino, Mozilla,
IE, or Safari), and also Firefox. But on the window side, IE, Opera and
Firefox all load the link just fine.

By loading the link I mean the browser doe not show that any link should even
be there at all.
