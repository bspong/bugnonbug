If you read the nu.nl news article it seems there is quite a big chance that
Mozilla Firebird crashes. It try to render the site and at some point the
browser just dissapears. I've seen this under normal Mozilla and also with
different site's like sourceforge. I have the java and flash plugins loaded and
the flash click to play extension installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL
2. If it doesn't crash there and then, read another article
3. Repeat until crash

Actual Results:
The Mozilla Firebird window dissapeared

Expected Results:
Render the page.
