When you open article from dailytech.com in a few tabs, mozilla becomes very slow in managing those tabs. Very slow scrolling, selecting or closing tab with those articles. I know it could be bad javascript used on the website, but still that shouldn't affect the browser performance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open www.dailytech.com
2. open 10 article in 10 tab
3. try to read the articles, scroll down articles, etc.


Expected Results:
article tab are hanging and responsiveness time is slow
