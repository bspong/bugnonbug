Firefox 4.0.1 doesn't work with HP Credential Manager

I use the HP ProtectTools Security Manager with HP Credential Manager (Fingerprint reader). This let me use my fingerprint to log in to site etc. Every time I visit a new site and record credentials, it record them and the next time I can login automatically or using just my fingerprint.
This work fine with FF2 and FF3 up to and including FF3.6.17 but break with FF4.0.1.

I am critically dependent on this Single Sign On software and have therefore had to regress to FF3.6.17

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Be using HP Credential Manager with FF3.6.17
2.Install FF4.0.1
3.It is broken (web page not recognised for automatic sign on etc.)
