MozDev.org projects/"extensions" don't work in Firebird

Firebird should (but doesn't) display the browser window always with the Yahoo
Toolbar for Mozilla beneath the [Firebird] Bookmarks toolbar. Furthermore, the
Extensions panel within Firebird's preference (Mozilla
Firebird->Preferences->Extensions) don't work and remain blank.

I did try a couple of other project or what Firebird call "extensions" found
at http://texturizer.net/firebird/extensions.html and yet each of those
respective project failed to work too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://companion.mozdev.org/installation.html
2. Click on the US install link
3. Hit ok to the install permission link that pop up
4. Quit Firebird
5. Relaunch Firebird
Actual Results:
Although Firebird indicates that the download worked, and upon
restarting/relaunching Firebird one realizes that the MozDev.org project failed
to work in Firebird (albeit it doe work in it parent Mozilla)

Expected Results:
Firebird should (but doesn't) display the browser window always with the Yahoo
Toolbar for Mozilla beneath the [Firebird] Bookmarks toolbar. The Extensions
panel within Firebird's preference (Mozilla Firebird->Preferences->Extensions)
should work by listing any "extensions"/MozDev.org project one ha choosen to
install in their copy of Firebird.
