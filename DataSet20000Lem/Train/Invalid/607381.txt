FireFox 4 beta accepts adding transition property style (and other CSS Transition styles) using the following syntax in JavaScript:
element.style.MozTransitionProperty
element.style.TransitionProperty
element.style.transitionProperty

But it doe not accept:
element.style.mozTransitionProperty

(With a lowercase “m”).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a transition style to an element in JavaScript using element.style.mozTransitionProperty, for instance. Also add a transition-duration.
2. Try to animate that element by changing the property set a the transition-property.
3. Notice the element doe not animate.
4. Try setting the style with the syntax: element.style.MozTransitionProperty (with a capitalized first character).
5. Try animating that property again.
6. Observe it working a expected.

Actual Results:
“MozTransitionProperty” works, but “mozTransitionProperty” doe not.

Expected Results:
both syntaxes: “MozTransitionProperty” and “mozTransitionProperty” should work.

For consistency’s sake, if “fontStyle” works, then “mozTransitionProperty” should work a well. This camelCase syntax is pretty widely accepted across many browsers, including FireFox in any other instance I’ve tested.

Furthermore, WebKit, which defined the standard for CSS Transitions, us the camelCase syntax for adding transition style to element through JavaScript (e.g. “webkitTransitionProperty”) along with the CamelCase (with capital first character) syntax (e.g. “WebkitTransitionProperty”). In the interest of building a better web, implementing new standard in your software should not be drastically different than existing implementation of those same same standards.
