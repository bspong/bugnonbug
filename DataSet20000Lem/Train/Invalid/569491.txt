This problem seems to a problem on one of my Macs with 10.6.3 running the Firefox 3.6.4 build 6 beta.

Most of the UI is unresponsive, address bar doesn’t function and ha a graphical bug, web page wont load from bookmark or bookmark bar, other window such a add-on manager and download manager fail to open.

I have attached link to a video. This is with a clean profile and in safe-mode. Reverting to Firefox 3.6.3, any of the previous 3.6.4 betas, or moz-central all work fine.

Reproducible: Always
