Whenever I take any action that is supposed to launch a dialog box (like a
security warning or the password manager prompt), two tiny window display, one
after the other, before the dialog box displays. The first window is titled
"window", ha a message of five number followed by a letter (the most common
set being 25024a), and the only option is to click "OK." The second window is
titled "url", ha a message of four number (the most common set being 2502),
and the only option is to click "OK." Once both window are cleared, the
expected dialog box pop up. I uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox, but the odd
behavior remains.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take any action that launch a dialog box
Actual Results:
The two tiny window appear in sequence.

Gone straight to the dialog box.
