FireFox report an Alert " the operation timed out when attempting to connect to www.radical.ca". The website work in IE.

This is a functioning website that load and behaves normally in IE but not in
FireFox. I doubt that Radical Entertainment would block the use of Mozilla on
their website.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type http://www.radical.ca in the navigation bar
2. Press Enter
3. Wait for above alert message - click ok and retry

Actual Results:
The same result a previously stated - this website won't load.

Expected Results:
Laoded the website and allowed full browsing of it contents.

I think if you can't get to a normally coded website that's a huge problem.
This is not the first website that I've found that get this alert message so I
will try to list the others. Initially I thought it wa the website but I
happened to check www.radcial.ca in IE and discovered the problem wa with FireFox.
