Webvizbench URL block Mouse on Browser's Chrome, can't drag
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:8.0a1) Gecko/20110709 Firefox/8.0a1
Build ID: 20110709030751

Steps to reproduce:

1. Visit http://webvizbench.com/
2. Get to the Page with [Run Benchmark] in upper-right Corner - by bypassing IE9 check popup.
3. Mouseover the top Chrome (where min/max/close Buttons are) then left-click and drag sideways.



Actual results:

Browser Window will NOT "drag" (move, via left-mouse-click and drag).

Going to lower-right Corner (and 'lengthy hover') to "Resize Window" is slow to activate and slow to resize.

Using "Tab Mix Plus" go to a different Tab (leave http://webvizbench.com/ open) and now try to drag, it work two or three time faster (very slow); the resize is now at a barely acceptable speed.

Go back to the http://webvizbench.com/ Tab and close it, now the Browser can drag and resize normally.

Having the http://webvizbench.com/ URL open on a Tab (even when not visible) suck so much juice out of the Browser that the 'normal Window Functions' (dragging / resizing) are grossly affected.



Expected results:

It is a though the WebPage make such a great demand on the Browser's time that there is nothing left in the time-slice to give to the Operating System; so it can check if we are dragging the Window.

No WebPage should be permitted to run JavaScript (or HTML5) with such a high priority that operation of the Browser or Operating System is compromised.

This is a DOS (Denial of Service).

Both JavaScript and HTML5 need to surrender a slice occasionally (and regularly) to permit both the Browser and the OS to operate SMOOTHLY (without jitter or freeze/un-freeze cycles).


PS: New Bug Report form ha no spot for the URL - I'll add it if I can on the next Page.
