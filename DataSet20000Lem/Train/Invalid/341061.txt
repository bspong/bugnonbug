With Firefox (and Netscape too), if you click on an email address in a webpage, and your email application is Outlook Express (and quite possibly othres too) AND the coded "subject line" (if part of the "mailto" coding) contains character that are not part of the English alphabet, such a "é" or "à", these character do not reproduced properly in the subject line. They are converted to "Ã©" and other such character combinations.

The problem is NOT with Outlook Express, because the problem doe NOT occur with Internet Explorer. In my opinion, the problem is in the way that Firefox pass the non-english characters, contained in the subject line, to the email application.
