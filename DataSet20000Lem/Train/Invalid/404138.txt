Nearly half of the time I try to select the "Bookmarks", the program crash and freezes, needing to be restarted. This is independent of the number of tab open or the site being accessed. This doe not happen EVERY time, but about one-half of the time. It seems especially likely when a page is loading in another tab.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tab
2. While a page is loading in one tab, switch to another
3. Try to load a new page from the "Bookmarks" in the menu - this almost always produce the "crash" symptom.
Actual Results:
The program stop responding. I "Force Quit" the program, and restart using "Restore Session" to re-load the tab I had opened.

Expected Results:
I would expect to be able to access and load a new page in a new tab while the other tab are loading. This seems to only be a problem when accessing page from the "Bookmarks" in the Menu. If I enter the web address in the browser, the page load successfully.
