Clicking a link in IRC open in the latest link, instead of a new window.
Clicking a link in IRC open in the latest link, instead of a new window. This
wa fixed in a previous version, but is now happening again. Even if you right
click the link and go to "open in new browser", it still open in the last
modified already open tab. Kind of annoying.

Thanks.
