updated 1.0.1 to Firefox 1.0.2 for Windows now no webpage will come up. It
look like it is trying to pickup any additional update but never find
anything then time out. Tried rebooting no progress. Uninstalled then clean
install still same problem. Uninstalled and went back to 1.0.1 and browser work
fine.

Reproducible: Always
