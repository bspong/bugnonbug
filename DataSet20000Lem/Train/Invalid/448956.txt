User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

Firefox plugin for version 3.0.1 application is not allowing for add-on to install onto Windowa XP platform while attempting to download McAfee Site Adisor. This one of multiple other unsuccessful attempt which is affecting other download application which are not compatible with Firefox add-ons. Firefox dialogue the desktop with error message, stating "Firefox could not install the file at http://downloadmacafee.com/products/sa/firefox/safe.xpi?cid=20209 because: Download error -202" [end]. Again, this last attempt, wa unable to install MacAfee site adviser add on, a per Firefox prompting dialog box.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Whenever Firefox prompt a dialog box to update your PC by installing an add on.
2. The step above is not reproducible by the user, a it is a spontaneous result each time Firefox notifies your PC an update is now available, and you opt to download same.
Actual Results:
An error message wa automatically generated stating the URL location and an error message numerically coded to describe the type of error encountered.

Expected Results:
The McAfee site adviser add on should have easily been made compatible with my Windows Xp, a it wa being flagged a such, 'ready to install'. A detector should have occurred before being asked to download an add on without a compatibility test.

At the very least a work around suggestion should have been referred to followup on what needed to be done, or not done, a to why Firefox could not install any particular add on. But, a coded message without a remedial indicator is no help to the user, and in these particular type of issue caused by the vendor is more of a disservice.
