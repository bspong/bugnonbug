Tabbing through Advanced Options doesn't scroll when needed
Reported by dveditz in bug 262840 comment 2.

1. Open Tools > Advanced > Options.
2. Expand enough section to make a scrollbar appear.
3. Press Tab many times.

Result: When focus go to a scrolled-off element, you can't see what's focused.

Expected: The option should scroll to bring the focused element into view.

This can happen with only one section expanded, so "don't expand more than one
section at a time" is not a viable workaround for keyboard-only users.
