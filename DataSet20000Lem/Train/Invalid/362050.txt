There seems to be an embedded iframe on the page which ha escaped javascript inside... potentially harmful?

This site seems hacked, the embedded iframes caused Javascript alert on my machine (forgot to run noscript)... I'm unsure if this actually caused security faults... I just wanted to put it out there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://lily-rose.net/ with javascript on.

Actual Results:
Weird javascript alerts, and a prompt to download a file. Freezing.
