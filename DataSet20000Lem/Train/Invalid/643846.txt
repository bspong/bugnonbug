Adobe flash player won't install; Norton toolbar is incompatible with firefox 4.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; chromeframe/10.0.648.151; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 4

The summary say it all. Since these are oft-used programs, these problem make null any decision to use firefox, unless you can help me simple remedy them.
Thanks.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
Adobe flash player to work, and norton toolbar to be displayed and work.
