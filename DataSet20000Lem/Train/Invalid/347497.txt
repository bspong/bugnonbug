This bug is about providing a consistent looking set of icon for Options (as well a the rest of FF, that actually look like a visual refresh and not visual chaos) that don't look circa 1990.

Reproducible: Always

1) Launch FF
2) Observe that the "refreshed" icon are washed out and don't fit well with recent version of Windows
3) Navigate to Tools-> Options and observe that the icon look circa 1990 and feel like they were pieced together from different sources/themes

Disappointment.

Expected Results:
A well thought out 2006 look and feel that fit with Windows
