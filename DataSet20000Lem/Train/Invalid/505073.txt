Obtained recent 3.5.1 Shiretoko update from ubuntu ppa universe. Now when I go to search box, Firefox is not loading my search results. The problem occurs whether I try pressing [Enter] or clicking the Search icon (on the right). It is also independent of any search engine selected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a Search engine.
2. Type a search query.
3. Press Enter or click Search icon.
Actual Results:
Notice that the search result tab doe not open a usual and no search result are loaded.

Expected Results:
Ordinary operation, a new tab will be opened with search result from the search engine.

It wa working at first. It broke some time after installing it, but I don't know when or why.

Workaround: Start a new tab, navigate to search by entering URL in address bar, enter search query on web page, search a usual.

Let me know if I should load any further information into the report.
