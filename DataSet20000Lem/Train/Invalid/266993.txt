Directly opening a swf file/location try to save the file instead of using the flash plugin
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

When opening an SWF file either through Open File or pointing firefox at the
URL, the save-or-open-with-this-program dialogue come up. Flash content play
fine when embeded in a webpage.

Flash is installed according to about:plugins, but in
Edit->Preferences->Downloads->Plugins, there's no entry for Shockwave flash.

I've installed flash manually through gentoo portage, and then uninstalled it
and used firefox's plugin installing system. Both time I can view flash when
embeded in a webpage, but can't point my browser at the content directly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. File->Open File...
2. Select a SWF file on your hard drive.

Actual Results:
The Save-or-open dialogue come up.

Expected Results:
The file should of been opened and handled by the installed flash plugin.
