I use to have ert.gr's r feed in my bookmarks. This bug appeared undered the previous version occasionally in xp, and now with 0.6 it happens always. It could be some malformed javascript, but the application shouldn't become unresponsive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://news.ert.gr/newsdetails.asp?id=332154 (or any relatively new article there) (it will change to an .asp normally).
Actual Results:
The tab start loading and then the whole application becomes unresponsive (you can close the application, but the process is still running).

Expected Results:
Well, to load the page.
