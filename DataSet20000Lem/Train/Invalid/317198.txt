When I open Safari the button label are in the OS system language.
When I change the OS system language, by rebooting, the label change.

Using Firefox, for example I need to download a different beta for each language. This is one hell of a lot of duplication, and downloading, for very little extra text.

This is a real issue, if like me you are creating a homepage in many languages, and want to check the result in each one.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open application
2.change OS system language
3.reboot
4.open application
Actual Results:
language of label on button remains in say "English"

Expected Results:
language should change to respond to change in system language
