Sorry for not using the Beta feedback button but it doesn't work. Also, I wa unable to load any web page by tying in the URL. The only way I wa able to get to web page wa to either go through a bookmark or through google. Ended up uninstalling the beta.

While I'm at it, are you ever going to fix the problem with Youtube? Embedded video will not play in Firefox and if you go to the Youtube site, video freeze up every 10 second or so.

Reproducible: Always
