Some bug I have noticed with Mozilla Firebird .6 for OSX
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

I have downloaded yesterday's nightly build of Mozilla Firebird for Mac OSX and
here's a list of the bug I have noticed usually:
-Whenever I press &#8984; & click on a link, it doesnt open a new tab
-When I have no window open in firebird, and I click on the firebird icon in
the dock, no new window opens, I have to either press &#8984;1, or &#8984;N.
-Scroll bar sometimes dont appear
-After using a different theme for the first time, Qute no longer work after that
-When I have no window open in Firebird but have Firebird open, if I click
"About Mozilla Firebird" in Help or in Mozilla Firebird menus, a new window
displaying the build info will show, but if I click on any bookmark links, whey
will not open

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla Firebird for Mac
2. Install a theme and use it for a bit and try to use the default theme, and
for everything else, just play around with it
3.



Expected Results:
-Tab should have opened
-When I click Firebird icon, new window should appear if there currently is no
window open
-Scroll bar should usually appear
-Qute should be able to go back to normal afterwards
-Bookmarks should be working normally
