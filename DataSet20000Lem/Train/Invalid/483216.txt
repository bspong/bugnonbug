I immediately noticed higher CPU utilization when I upgraded from Firefox 3.0.6 to 3.0.7. My CPU utilization is now at a constant 100% whenever Firefox is operational, even with one window, one tab with no script running. It is not eating up memory when left to run so I do think this is not a memory leak. It is at the top of the list for CPU time even when left minimized with single window & single tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start computer
2. run Firefox
3. observe CPU utilization at 100% and Firefox a top on CPU time list
Actual Results:
It tie up any other activity on the computer and you are waiting even for simple keystroke in email and word processor applications. One application should never negatively impact keystroke in a simple editor or email package.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have no impact on simple key stroke in an editor or email package.
