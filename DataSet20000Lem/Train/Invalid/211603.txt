The text box on the Google Mirror (http://www.alltooflat.com/geeky/elgoog/) is
demonstrating incorrect behaviour. I can't see anything special about the code,
so I'm guessing it will happen with all right-to-left text boxes.

Firstly, the box render text exactly a if it were a plain text box, merely
right-aligned. If I type the key 'hello' I would pretty much expect to
see 'olleh' in the box, with the cursor at the left end of the word. The cursor
stay at the right end of the box until I press the spacebar, when it
momentarily jump to the left end. The next word I type jump it back to the
right.

Secondly, pressing 'Home' on the keyboard (causing the cursor to jump to the
right, correctly) followed by the:
left arrow key: cause a freeze.
right arrow key: cause the cursor to jump to one character in from the left
side.
Similarly, 'End' followed by the:
left arrow key: cause a freeze.
right arrow key cause the cursor to jump to the right end of the box (as
if 'home' had been pressed. Ironically, due to the previous problem, continued
press of the right arrow key behave correctly).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Head over to http://www.alltooflat.com/geeky/elgoog/
2. Type several word into the box. Observe how the cursor jump about.
3. Hit 'Home' and press the right arrow key a few times. Hit 'End' and repeat.
4. Hit 'Home' or 'End' and press the left arrow key. (Note: this will crash
your browser).

Actual Results:
Browser freezes. (Ctrl-Alt-Del, kill process required).

Expected Results:
1) When typing words, the text should effectively be shown in reverse, and the
cursor should stay with the current text insertion point, at the left end of
the user's text.
2) When the 'Home' key is pressed followed by the Right arrow key, nothing
should happen. When the 'Home' key is pressed followed by the Left arrow key,
the cursor should move one character to the left.
3) When the 'End' key is pressed followed by the Right arrow key, the cursor
should move one character to the right. When the 'End' key is pressed followed
by the Left arrow key, nothing should happen.
