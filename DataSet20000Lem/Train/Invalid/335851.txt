Popup tab keep interrupting and resizing my browser. It is every 2 or 3 minutes. I have Mcafee Firewall and anti-virus and they can't find or stop the problem. So I don't know if it's a bug in the program or something on my computer.
The url is one of many. But they all have muon.html on it. I have never visited any of these sites. I've tried blocking the IP address with Mcafee but they keep changing.

another url: http://www.hug-ediscounts.com/muon.html

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up the browser. or it will just create a new window if no window is open.
2.
3.
