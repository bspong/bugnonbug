KDE implement two clipboard system for cut and paste.
-One similar to the window CTRL-C/CTRL-V.
-One traditional unix using page markup (copy)/middle click (paste)

In normal use both work fine, but when Firefox is closed the content of the CTRL-C buffer seems to go missing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mark some text in the browser, for example the URL
2. Insert it into the clipboard by pressing CTRL-C
3. Close browser
4. Try pasting the clipboard content somewhere, for example the location bar of a reopened Firefox browser
Actual Results:
Nothing happens.


Expected Results:
The content should be pasted...

The content of the other buffer (the markup/middle click one) work fine all the time.
