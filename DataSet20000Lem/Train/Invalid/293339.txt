Incorrect table column width
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

In the page at http://www.truecrypt.org/documentation.php (and other page a
well) the width of table column is incorrect. On this page this can be
observed by checking where the text line is wrapped. On this page, IE6 put a
line break after the word "binary and source code" but in Firefox the text
fit entirely (no line break is inserted), because the column is wider than in
IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just compare how the page look in IE6 and how it look in Firefox
2.
3.
