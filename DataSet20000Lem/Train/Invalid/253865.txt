I use RCN dialup, which includes SlipStream web accelerator. In IE, right mouse
click show "Show all Original Images" and "Show Original Image" on menu, which
undoes degraded quality of selected picture(s). These menu item are not
enabled in Firefox. Slipstream say it must be enabled in browser.
(Hope this is useful, not sure that I have judged category correctly..I am a
teacher and just a user. Thanks)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right click mouse button over a picture on any web page.
2. Menu appears with picture menu (e.g. "Save picture as..)
3.

Actual Results:
Added menu item do not appear in Firefox 0.9.2

Menu should include items: "Show all Original Images" and "Show Original Image"

I queried SlipStream on these, they felt that Firefox did not allow these
option to be enabled.
