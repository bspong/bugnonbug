After uninstallation trial version of Adobe CS4 product (I saw it after deleting Photoshop on one machine and after deleting Fireworks on another) the process msiexec.exe hang the system. I kill it in Task Manager. Then after running Firefox the process System hangs, it take 100% of processor resources. After restarting computer and running Firefox again the process System hang and take 100% of processor resource again. Other browser do not hang the System process. In other word it's a some kind of "integration bug".
It is solved by uninstallation (profile not deleted) and installation of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall Photoshop or Fireworks
2. Kill msiexec (if it's needed)
3. Run Firefox


Expected Results:
The process System take 100% of processor resource
