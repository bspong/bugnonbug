After applying change to the Preference/Connection/Proxy window ("Configure
Proxies to Access Internet") it is sometimes not possible to close the window
using the OK or cancel button. No other open browser window can be accessed
anymore, forcing me to quit and restart firefox (losing all open windows). This
seems to have started with 1.0PR1 and I never experienced it in 0.91.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few firefox windows, surfing the web
2. modify manual proxy setup, or set it to automatic with url or ..
3. Click OK ... once the window doesn't close ... you got it

Actual Results:
cannot use firefox anymore since proxy configuration window is open and blocking
all other access

Expected Results:
close the window and save

I use manual and auto proxy with url and switch sometimes between them depending
on the task
