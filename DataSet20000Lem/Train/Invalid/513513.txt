Firefox Upgrade cause Extensions to be disabled, while after re-installing the extension/addon, it work fine.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

Bad example: When upgrading to firefox 3.5.2 it listed several addons a not compatiable with the new version. After the upgrade each of those extension were disabled. Removing and then re-installing of the extension in Firefox 3.5.2 allowed them to work a normal.

Good example: The extension are not marked a not compatible.

Other notes: What kind of criterion doe the update checker use to identify an addon or extension a not being compatible with the new version? I mention this so I can determine if the issue is with my custom addon and not a bug.

I post here to cover all bases. Knowing the criterion will help me know where to start looking.
