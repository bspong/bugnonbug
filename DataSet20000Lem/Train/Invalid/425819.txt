While testing cookie settings, I discovered that disabling cooky can be circumvented by extensions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the Live PageRank Extension < https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2007 >, change the max version if need be, and install it.
1. Disable cooky by going to Tools>Options>Privacy and unchecking "Accept cooky from sites".
2. Erase all cooky by hitting "Show Cookies" and clicking on "Remove All Cookies".
3. Close out of the option window, visit any webpage, for example < http://mozilla.com >, and then check the cookie list in Tools>Options>Privacy>Show Cookies...
Actual Results:
There will be two cooky in the list, one from google.com, the other from toolbarqueries.google.com.

Expected Results:
There should be no cooky in the list because Cookies should be disabled.
