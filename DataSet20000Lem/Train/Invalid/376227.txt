URL of home page isn't displayed in the URL bar anymore

First, I have to say I think it's a good idea not to display the url of the home page in the URL bar anymore, but it's a security problem.
The user don't know, where they actually are and could be on a phising site.
If you have the website of your credit institut set a home page, I could rebuild the page, access the computer (e.g. in the office where nobody loggs of for getting a cup of coffee) and change the URL. Next time, the person loggs in and I would have their account data.
It's not only the problem when having the website of your credit institute set a home page. I don't think many of my mate would care, if they have a new home page, without changing something on their own.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
Actual Results:
home page is displayed, URL not

Expected Results:
I think that's the way it ha to work

It would be good to display the URL where you actually are. It doesn't have to be in the URL bar, but somewhere would be good.
