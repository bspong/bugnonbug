With "Select new tab opened from links" option unchecked middle-clicking a link will open a new non-focused tab but it will not have a parent tab set.
Closing the new one will bring the user to the rightmost tab instead of the previously selected one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uncheck "Select new tab opened from links" from Tools -> Options... -> Tabs
2. Middle-click a link (a new tab will open in background)
3. Switch to the new tab and then close it

Actual Results:
The rightmost tab is selected.

Expected Results:
The last select tab should be selected.

It look like the new tab will loose the "parent" even with "Select new tab opened from links" checked just moving around tabs.
