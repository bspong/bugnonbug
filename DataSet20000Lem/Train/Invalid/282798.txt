If in a web page an image should be displayed using a local absolute window
path (i.e.: <img src="F:\path-to-image\image.gif">), the image is not displayed.
Instead the title is shown, because image file seems not to be found. This
happens only with a full path. If path is specified relative (i.e.: <img
src="path\image.gif") the image image is shown properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. define an absolute image path a explained in the detail above
2. display the web page
3. image should ot be shown


Expected Results:
image should be displayed properly like with a relative path given
