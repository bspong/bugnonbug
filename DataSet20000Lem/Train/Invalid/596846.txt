When I Center Click on an item to open a new tab, I get my desktop with multiple small window based on the number of open programs. The Minefield window is a black rectangle.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Do a search or look at a list of item in Google Reader
2.Center click to open page in a new tab
3.
Actual Results:
All open window minimized and I get my desktop with multiple small window based on the number of open programs. The Minefield window is a black rectangle. If I mouse over a window it slightly enlarges. If I click on a window it restores to full screen.

Expected Results:
Minefield should stay open and the item I center clicked should have opened a new tab. I should continue to have the tab from which I made my selection a the focus.

I have screen shot but do not see how to attach. Will do so in a seperate post
