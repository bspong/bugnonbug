When I accidentally clicked on "Latest Headlines" with my mouse wheel, ALL of
them opened, in new tabs. But if I am looking at 2 site in 2 tabs, for
example, the first 2 headline will take over those tab clearing what I wa
looking at.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Hover over "Latest Headlines"
3.Click the mouse wheel (push it down)

Actual Results:
All the "Latest Headlines" loaded, and the first number depending on how many
tab I had open loaded into those tabs, clearing the page I wa originally
looking at. The other headline all loaded into new tabs, so I saw
approximately 30 new tab all downloading page at once, which slowed my
connection down a little bit and it wa irritating to have to close them all.

Expected Results:
The mouse wheel clicking should not have loaded all of the headlines. Only the
left and right mouse button should activate that menu.
