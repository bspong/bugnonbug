Obey the "icons/text-only/icons-and-text" setting
The find toolbar (at least in the default theme) doesn't obey my
"icons/text-only/icons-and-text" setting and show the icon AND text, always.

Something like 'right-click' on toolbar, popup with selection with:
Show icon, Show text and Show text and icon, would be nice to have.
