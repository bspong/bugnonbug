created some blank tab by mistake by clicking on the (+) button to the right of an opened page. the resulting tab cannot be deleted. tried loading content into the tabs, make no difference. so the entire browser is active and functional but none of the existing set of tab can be deleted, either from the (x) on the tab itself, or from the "delete" option on the context menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create new tab(s) by clicking on the new-tab (+) button
2. tab are born empty; loading content work
3. tab cannot be deleted



prior to this version update, the add/delete tab function worked a expected.
