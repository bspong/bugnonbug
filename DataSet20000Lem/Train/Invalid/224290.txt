Firebird 0.7 doesn't set HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE

HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE is often used for multi-language sites.

This seems to be hard-coded to english only in Firebird (and Camino).

In MacOS X, the list of language returned in the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE should be
taken from what's already set up in the International control panel under MacOS
X system preferences.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just check what a CGI-script return for the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE env variable.

Actual Results:
English only

Expected Results:
It should output a list of what language the user understands, and want site
to return webpage in that language.

This can be taken from the MacOS X language setting (set in the International
system preference panel).

The list should be weighted so that the preferred language get a higher weight
than the other languages.

There doesn't seem to be a workaround. Which mean many site will only provide
an english version of the site to firebird/camino user on MacOS X.
