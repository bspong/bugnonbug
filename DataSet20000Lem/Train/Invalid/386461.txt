The "Recently Closed Tabs" menu need a keyboard shortcut. The keyboard shortcut should open either the last closed tab, or open up the "Recently Closed Tabs" menu by itself. Opera doe the former, and us the keyboard shortcut CTRL + ALT + Z

Otherwise the Recently Closed Tabs menu is too hard to get to without a keyboard shortcut. Opera includes a Trash icon in the Tab Bar to get around that problem, but a keyboard shortcut would be fine with me.
