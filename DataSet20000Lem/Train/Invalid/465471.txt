I wasn't on line at the time but McAfee started a full system scan about half way through the scan McAfee security gave me an alert saying it ha found s security threat McAfee Quarantined Firefox 3.1 beta a being a security high
threat or a Unknown Trojan. so i tried to take Firefox out and a soon a i take Firefox 3.1 out of quarantine McAfee put it right back in there. so i tried to download Firefox 3.1 again but the site would not let me. it said that Firefox wa already installed on my computer. so i downloaded Firefox 3.0.4 it downloaded and installed it with no problems. I contacted McAfee they said they are looking in to it that i am not the only one this ha happened to. and they told me to shred Firefox 3.1 a many time a my version will let me to get it off my computer. so that is what I did 10 times. then i went back to the Mozilla web site and downloaded it again about 5 hour ago. so far there ha not been any problems.
