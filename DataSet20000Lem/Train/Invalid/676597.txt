The certificate error dialog

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu/11.04 Chromium/12.0.742.112 Chrome/12.0.742.112 Safari/534.30

Steps to reproduce:

My own web server offer content on both HTTP and HTTPS. The certificate is self-signed. I browse on the HTTP part of the server to a static HTML file which contains only a hyperlink to the HTTPS part.


Actual results:

Firefox display a dialog which show that the certificate is self-signed and not trusted even though I am not browsing on HTTPS. The result are the same when I launched Firefox in safe mode.


Expected results:

Firefox should not silently connect to HTTPS.
