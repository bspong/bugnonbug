firefox 1.0.2 try to save php file instead of running them
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

When using firefox (maybe only 1.0.2, not sure), the browser try to download
(save a dialog) php files, instead of displaying them a it should be.
This is 100% not a problem on the server, a it only began a few day ago, and
there wa nothing changed on the server. Moreover, it never happends with other
browsers.

When using some FLASH-banners, it happend almost EVERYTIME. After removing the
flash-banner that seems to be problematic, it only happends once in a while.


You can see a screenshoot here:

p.s.
if saving the file, the browser save the PHP-SOURCE file, with all the php code
in it.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just accessing php files. it's randomize, i think..
Actual Results:
The "save as" dialog apears, and it will show it forever for THE EXACT URL until
you clear the browser cache (and then, after some time, it will probbly happend
again).


Expected Results:
well... show the php file..
