It seems like you can't change a input field with javascript if the coursor is
standing in it, atleast I think that is what is causing it to malfunction. Well
demonstrated in the url attached. IE autocompletes the word while having coursor
in the input field but not firefox and I seen this bug on many many other form
out there so it not a bug with just this script.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try type "g" in the input field in the url attached
2. IE autocompletes to "george" but not firefox
Actual Results:
Nothing

Expected Results:
The field should say "george"
