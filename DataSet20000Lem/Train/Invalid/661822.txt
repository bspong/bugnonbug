Include checkboxes for "enable animation (gif apng and smil)" and "enable audio" in about:permissions when "all sites" is selected
For user that want easy access to permit or prohibit movement and noise in all webpage without needing to navigate all the about:config prefs, please put checkboxes in about:permissions for gif, aPNG and SMIL animation and the built-in <audio> tag. They would be ticked enabled by default of course. Not sure if the type of animation need to be mentioned if they're all going to be one checkbox.
