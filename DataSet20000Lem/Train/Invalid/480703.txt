1. I can open about 4 new tab using the rightclick option; any more are left "loading" (sometimes it is more than 4, sometimes less)
2. Firefox then close on request, but when I try to reopen I get an error saying that it is already open. I cant end the process through the Windows Task Manager and have to restart my computer. 10 time today...
3. There seem to be several different solution floating around, many of which are to do with add-on incompatability, especially AVG 8.0. I have just heard about a Javascript incompatability. I have tried reinstalling several times, but no luck.
Any advice... PLEASE

Reproducible: Always
