It appears that recently Firefox implemented some feature that prevents you from
being able to open a new Firefox window from a system shortcut.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox (using a system shortcut)
2. Click on the same system shortcut
Actual Results:
Firefox give an error, saying that it is already running but not responding.

Expected Results:
Firefox should launch another browser window under that same profile.

I am guessing that this wa done a a fix for some problem with Firefox. My
guess is that it wa done fairly recently (not sure what bug # it is). However,
the fix prevents a user from launching a new window using the system shortcut.
In addition, it present a warning that is in error and could confuse some
people and make them think something is wrong (Firefox is working fine).
