Sometimes firefox wouldn't open a link (my guess is a problem with javascript) like in this website when I clicked the "apply now" link. I've installed IE 8, Opera, Safari and Google Chrome browser apart from default Firefox but unfortunately only Firefox can't open this link.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try it a stated.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
No response once clicked.

Expected Results:
Opened a new page.

I had experienced this problem at other website in the past and only Firefox among all browser failed to function. Could be related to javascript, I guessed.
