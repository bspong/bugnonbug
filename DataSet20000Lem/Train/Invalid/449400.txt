when file to save is served by a cgi script, "unknown error" occurs and, "Try saving to a different location"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16

In situation where I have no control over the saving location for a file to download (eg. when it's served by a script, so I can't use the context menu), I get this error:

-------------------------------
Downloading /Users/mharless/Desktop/xxxx.rtf

Downloading /Users/mharless/Desktop/xxxx.rtf could not be saved, because an unknown error occurred.

Try saving to a different location.
----------------------------

Even when I change the default save location so it's no longer "Desktop," I still get the error that it can't save to the Desktop.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on URL above

Actual Results:
This error dialog:


-------------------------------
Downloading /Users/mharless/Desktop/xxxx.rtf

Downloading /Users/mharless/Desktop/xxxx.rtf could not be saved, because an unknown error occurred.

Try saving to a different location.
----------------------------

Expected Results:
Saved the file served by the CGI to my default location.
