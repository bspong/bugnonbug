When using the 'Save Page As' feature to save web page to disk, the saved page ha no reference to the original location or URL of the source page. Instead, the navigation bar at the top now refers only to the "local host" location on the computer, NOT to the original URL. This make future citation of the saved article impossible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save any page at any newspaper site.
2. Use the "save page as" command, or 'command-S'
3.

Actual Results:
Instead of the original URL being saved in the navigation bar at the top, all that appears there in the saved page is the saved document's 'address' on the hard drive.


The original URL should be permanently saved, so that in the future, when the saved document is opened for offline reading, the original URL appears in the Navigation Bar.
