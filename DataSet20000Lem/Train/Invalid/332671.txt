AdBlock+ memory/cpu usage leak

After installing AdBlock 6.1.2 I noticed a large spike in memory and cpu usage, to the point where I can no longer operate Firefox and have to restart the browser. Note: AdBlock 6.1.2 is the only extension installed, and this wa not an issue until I installed it.

Once it start "leaking" (as it will operate fine for the first twenty minute or so, then CPU usage will spike to 95-99 and memory usage go up to over 100,000-150,000), clicking on link yield no results; right clicking or going to menu show only shadow of the menu and no option appear; and the only way to navigate through tab is by ctrl+tab -- clicking on tab doe not change the view.

Reproducible: Sometimes
