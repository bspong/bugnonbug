As of a couple of week ago my build in Solaris and Linux fail when building
the negotiateauth extension. Superficially the problem is that neither
USE_GSSAPI or USE_SSPI is set by configure. However, I suspect it run deeper
than this.

Is there some option that need to be set?



Reproducible: Always
