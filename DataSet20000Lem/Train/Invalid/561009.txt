When I am on a site such a Ebay, I select a search category, then I select a product from the results, when the product is displayed the screen resolution drop to low resolution.

I believe this started after I loaded a Java update..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go on Site
2.Click o something
3.Select something.

Actual Results:
Resolution drops.

Expected Results:
Resolution to remain the same.

I found a bug report that had the same issue. #542407. I started to follow the steps, but then the person who entered the trouble didn't want to work with you and the ticket wa flagged a incomplete. Following the suggestion in the ticket:

(1) I have removed all version of Java and downloaded the special version of Java

(2) I created the Test Profile. When I went to Ebay I had no problems.
