I get "Document contains no data" whether I use a bookmark or type the URL in to open it.

I cannot get the site to open using Firefox although I can open it from AOL
while I have Firefox still open. The site is okay. It wa not a problem until I
downloaded 1.0.5 and then the 1.0.6 fix. I have gone back to the one I show now
and the problem remains. I dont want to completely uninstall Firefox because I
have amny bookmark I dont want to lose.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type "http://www.rv.net"
2.click "Go"
3.Instead of opening, a dialog box appears with "Document contains no data."



Expected Results:
I should have been brought to the RV Net page

I can go to AOL and either type the URL in or use AOL Favorite Places bookmark
to get there and it work every time. It ha not worked since I tried to upgrade
Firefox two week ago. It wa not a problem before then.
