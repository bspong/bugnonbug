toolbar button show hover effect when dragging a tab
STR#1 (tabs on top):
1. Mousedown on a tab.
2. Move mouse cursor on Firefox button.

Actual Result:
The firefox button show hover effect.

STR#2 (not tab on top and show bookmark toolbar):
1. Mousedown on a tab
2. Move mouse cursor on a folder in bookmark toolbar.

Actual Result:
The folder show hover effect, but the tab cannot be dropped in the folder.

I don't think the STR#1 case make user confuse. However, STR#2 isn't so.

It look like the tab can be treated a a bookmark item, but actually not so.

And I see the hover effect on other button too. E.g., the other kink of tab (e.g., when you drag a normal tab, app tabs) show hover effect. The add tab button, some added button by customizing in bookmark toolbar are too.
