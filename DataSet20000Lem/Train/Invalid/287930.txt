After loggin in to Sciencedirect.com, when I select to view a PDF file of a journal to which I have access, Firefox doe not properly bring up either Adobe Acrobat Professional (6.0) or Adobe Acrobat Reader (6.0)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

As summarized, when I choose to display the PDF of a journal article for which I
have legal access, when I click on PDF on the web site, neither Adobe Acrobat
Professional (6.0) or Adobe Acrobat Reader (6.0) will load. The screen stay
blank and "Done" appears in the lower left corner of Firefox. I tried
disabling ZoneAlaram and AdAware, so it is not a firewall issue. NO error
message is displayed. I am using XP Professional, with Service Pack 1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to web site www.sciencedirect.com
2. log in to the site (you need a user account, which should be free). However,
you might need someone in the academic community to do this so that they will
have access to journal through their personal or library subscription
3.Go to the journal. In this case, I wa trying to access Geochimica et
Cosmochimica Acta, vol. 69, issue 6, the article starting on p. 1413
4. Click on PDF(1048K)
5. Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat Reader (depending on configuration for which is the
brower plug-in) should come up and display the article. I prefer Acrobat
because you can save a copy of the PDF to the hard drive
6. The exact web link
is:http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&_imagekey=B6V66-4FSTRT9-4-1&_cdi=5806&_user=72580&_orig=browse&_coverDate=03%2F15%2F2005&_sk=999309993&view=c&wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkWb&md5=727ca79f09366b99aad8e240ad306cbd&ie=/sdarticle.pdf

Actual Results:
A blank screen shows, with "Done" in the lower left corner. Acrobat or Reader
doe not load.

Expected Results:
A sub-window should have opened with Acrobat or Acrobat Reader, or Acrobat
should have opened and the journal article should have been displayed within the
Acrobat window.
