When having multiple profile and version of Firefox (eg Firefox 3.0.1 release and Firefox nightly build), a well a having separate profile for each release, Firefox us the same directory when File|Open file... is clicked.

If the directory is C:\Program Files\Firefox on profile 1, it will be the same on profile 2, even if it is running on a different installation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile (using Run... firefox -P)
2. Open a file with the first profile, using File|Open file...
3. Run 2nd profile and attempt to open file.
4. File location is same a the first profile.
5. Even running separate version of Firefox ha these issue (i.e. Profile 1 with Firefox and Profile 2 with Minefield)


Expected Results:
For security reasons, shouldn't it be better for each profile to have a separate memory for each profile? It might be something like browser.open.dir, similar to the already implemented browser.download.dir.
Alternatively, could File|Open file... start at the same location (as in Internet Explorer, I believe My Documents is default) and not be affected by Saving a file - I know a few bug have been filed on that subject.
