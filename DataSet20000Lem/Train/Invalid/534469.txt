When visiting https://seymoursmith.com/estore with Fire Fox 3.0.10, 3.5.2, 3.5.3 using Windows (W2k & Vista) it doe not validate the certificate. Doing the same (versions) on Linux and Mac work a expected and make a proper validation. On the Windows build the "VeriSign Class 3 Extended Validation SSL SGC CA" is not present in the certificate authority.

Reproducible: Always

2.
3.
Actual Results:
This connection is Untrusted

Expected Results:
Should show the page secure and all with no complaint like on Linux and Mac OS X

I tried to completely uninstall FF and then reinstall it again but it is still missing some of the root CA's for Verisign.
