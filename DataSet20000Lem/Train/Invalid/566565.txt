yea I plug a flash drive in my laptop not knowing that it had infected file stored on it . It wa used for school project , I think a infected file may have somehow messed with my Firefox browser, and changed my setting for the link listed above , it doesn't come up anymore on laptop , but my avg can't detect a virus or infection of any-kind. And it work when I use internet explorer. So is there something you can do fix this or this caused by a infected file I wonder ? what you think Mozilla?
I already tried reinstalling Firefox, and that didn't work either
thanks
