Hello Mozilla!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 3.6 and 3.7.

As I wrote in my article Cross-Site Scripting attack via redirectors (http://websecurity.com.ua/3386/) there are many Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in different browsers, including Mozilla Firefox. I already wrote you about vulnerability in Firefox 3.0.x and 3.5.x and previous versions, and now I'd tell you about vulnerability in Firefox 3.6 a1 pre and 3.7 a1 pre. Which I found with help of Aung Khant from YEHG Team (which helped me with my research of vulnerable browsers).

In my article I wrote about five attack vectors:

Attack #1 - via refresh-header redirector to javascript: URI. This vulnerability wa mentioned in Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475636).

Attack #2 - via refresh-header redirector to data: URI. I wrote about this vulnerability in Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503789).

Attack #3 - via location-header redirector to data: URI. I wrote about this vulnerability in Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503789).

Attack #4 - via location-header redirector (which use answer "302 Object moved") to javascript: URI. I wrote about this vulnerability in Bugzilla (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513320).

Attack #5 - via location-header redirector (which us any 301 and 302 answers) to javascript: URI.

Here are result of testing, so you can fix these hole in official release of new version of your browser.

XSS:

Firefox 3.6 a1 pre - vulnerable to attack #1,2,3,4 and in #1,2,4 JS code executes in context of the site.

Firefox 3.7 a1 pre - vulnerable to attack #2,3,4 and in #4 JS code executes in context of the site.

Vulnerable version is Firefox 3.6 a1 pre and previous versions.

Vulnerable version is Firefox 3.7 a1 pre and previous versions.

Attend to security of all of yours web sites, web software, browser and to security-audit.
