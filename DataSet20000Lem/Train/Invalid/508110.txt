If you run for example a beta firefox 3.5.2 from ftp and it's a official release of 3.5.2 you will never know,i think this is a bug,i think it must tell you about a official release,or you will run a beta forever until you check the official website for release,or wait for a 3.5.3 i think..

Reproducible: Always
