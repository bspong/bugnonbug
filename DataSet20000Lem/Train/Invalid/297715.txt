Firefox Exports Bookmarks to Internet Explorer Incorrectly

When exporting firefox bookmark to Internet Explorer, "&" is turned into "&amp"
in all cases. Reason this is a problem for Firefox is even if you set it to be
your default folder, you still have IE Favorites in your start menu...so to
correct this, you delete all of your IE Favorites and import Firefox Bookmarks
back in...this allows you to open Firefox from your Start Menu Favorites.

Reproducible: Always
