I am using two different computer and in the last few week firefox ha been crashing and/or prompting the start new session or restore session prompt. Whenever you hit restore, an error result and you are forced to use new session.

This occurs frequently and seems to have no rhyme or reason. It ha only occurred in the last few weeks. Any help would be great.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Simply close firefox and attempt to reopen it. It occurs especially if the computer is turned off and/or restarted. Once either of these happens, any attempt to open firefox would result in the new session/restore session prompt.
