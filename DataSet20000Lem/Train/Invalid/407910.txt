clear site-specific preference when clearing browser history
When clearing browser history using the "clear private data" feature, we should also clear site-specific preference like the text zoom pref (but also any others that we or extension author add) so that such preference don't leak information about the site the user ha visited.

Note: the bug for clearing all site-specific setting is bug 380852. This bug is only about clearing site-specific preference that are set using the content preference service.
