potential problem with favicons and useDefaultIcon
no exploit for this yet, filing seperate bug per bz's suggestion.

http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/toolkit/content/widgets/tabbrowser.xml&rev=1.216&mark=496-517#496


in tabbrowser.xml |shouldLoadFavIcon| try to prevent active content in
favicons. this doe not work for |data:image/png;,VALIDPNG| (in this case the
uri is loaded a favicon because of the special ImageDocument check) - so at
least
data: uris are loaded a favicons. in case |javascript:| uris may return
|instanceof ImageDocument| this may lead to problem with favicons (according to bz this is possible).

probably other abuse may be possible in this case.

having in mind the problem with active favicons in the past, regardless
whether comment #86 is exploitable or not, the check for sane favicon better be
applied for the |image| case.
