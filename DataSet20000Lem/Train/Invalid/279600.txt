When I visit a site that ha flash anywhere in it (banner ads, etc.), my entire
machine freeze and I have to press and hold the power button to shut it down.
Ctrl-Alt-Del doe nothing. Entire machine hosed. This ha happened on any site
with Flash (nytimes.com, ivillage.com for instance). I've seen other bug report
about Flash issue but they never mention people's entire computer crashing. I
have tried uninstalling every version of Firefox that I had on my machine and
then installing the latest version, and then going to Macromedia and downloading
the latest Flash plugin. That worked for about 2 second and now I'm back to the
crashing problem. I don't even care about the Flash ads! If they didn't render,
that would be okay! I just want to use Firefox and right now I can't!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site that ha a Flash animation on it.
2. Watch entire computer freeze.
3. Force machine to shut off.

Actual Results:
Machine crashed.

Expected Results:
It can do whatever it want with the Flash animation a long a it doesn't
crash my entire machine.

I don't get any crash messages, so I can't report on them. If this is the same
a someone else's bug, my apologies, but a) half the bug report are written in
techie so I can't understand a word of what's actually being said, and b) I
didn't see any other example of people's entire machine crashing.
