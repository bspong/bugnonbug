Firefox 3.5.2 and also installed the latest night build of minefield, freeze the entire OS after visiting certain pages. The one listed from mlb.com is an example. It ha also happened on google image page. I'm pretty sure it ha something to do with certain j pages. I've used FF for nearly 3 year and have never had a problem like this until I updated to v3.5.2 - I've also disabled all add-ons. CTRL-ALT-DEL doe not work when this happens and I must restart the PC manually. I then always get a message stating 'This is embarassing.... with the page such a mlb.com which I need to restart a new session or it will just do it again. Hope this helps. I'm sure if this wa a widespread issue it would have been reported by now, but just in case I've reported what's happening to me.
