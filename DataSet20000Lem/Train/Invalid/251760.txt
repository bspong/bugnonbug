no keyboard shortcut for Search field
found using 2004-07-15-09-0.9 (branch) on Mac OS X 10.3.4. couldn't find an
existing bug on this, but dup a needed.

it seems there's no keyboard shortcut (at least on Mac) to change the search
engine choice in the Search field in the Navigation toolbar, or to select from
previously entered search strings. on Linux it look like you can use
Ctrl+Up/Down arrow to move through the search engines, and Alt+Up/Down to go
through previously entered strings.

to test:

1. make sure you have at least two search engine available in the Search field.

2. move focus to Search field (on Mac that's Cmd+K).

3. try either Cmd+Up/Down (to change engine) or Option+Up/Down (to change search
string).

results: nothing happens, no droplist appears for either changing the search
engine or search string.
