Comparing Firefox to Internet Explorer (IE) (and you want to do better than them!), Google Toolbar (GT) work fundamentally differently in a manner that is worse with Firefox. In IE one can use GT on multiple open tab (I often work with up to 20 tab open without any problem in IE). One can perform search on each tab without them affecting other search on other tabs. With Firefox, if I change the search term on one tab, it is applied across all tabs, even erasing complicated search I wa performing on other tabs, which is a very serious problem for me when performing research, which I do all the time. I need to be able to have my GT search remain stable on each tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create multiple tab
2. Perform a Google Toolbar search on one tab
3. It will appear on all the tab

or

1. Open one tab
2. Perform a Google Toolbar search on that tab
3. Open another tab and create another GT search
4. Check the other tab. Your search term will have been changed.
