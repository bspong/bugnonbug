Error handling multiple same form value array in PHP
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080203 SUSE/2.0.0.12-5.1 Firefox/2.0.0.12

When handling multiple "same" form value with PHP, Firefox doe not properly form the URL. For example, with the simple form script:

<html>
<head><title>Workflow System</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Register for an Account:</h1>
<form action="registration_action.php" method="GET">

Username: <input type="text" name="name" /><br />
Email: <input type="text" name="email" /><br />
Password: <input type="password" name="pword[]" /><br />
Password (again): <input type="password" name="pword[]" /><br />

<input type="submit" value="GO" />
</form>
</body>
</html>

Firefox form the following URL:

http://localhost/build/registration_action.php?name=Johhie&email=Joh%40home&pword=passw&pword%5B%5D=passw

Note the handling of "pword" above. It should be formed a follows for proper handling:

http://localhost/build/registration_action.php?name=Johhie&email=Joh%40home&pword%5B%5D=passw&pword%5B%5D=passw

I can't explain it? It work fine in konqueror. The example come from page 3 of IBM's Developer Works:

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/os-phptut1/section3.html

Even though I don't know much about array handling, I know enough to know that having two of the major browser not agreeing on how to handle a beginner example is not a good thing.

The action script that receives this data is:

<?php

define("PAGE_TITLE", "Workflow Registration");

?>


<html>
<title><?= PAGE_TITLE ?></title>
<body>
<p>You entered:</p>

<?php
$form_names = array_keys($_GET);
$form_values = array_values($_GET);

foreach ($_GET a $key=>$value) {
echo "<p>".$key." = " . $value . "</p>";
}

$passwords = $_GET["pword"];
echo "First password = ".$passwords[0];
echo "<br />";
echo "Second password = ".$passwords[1];

?>
</body>
</html>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the form script in the detail above
2. Enter data and press go
3. Compare the URL formed by Firefox to the URL formed by Konqueror

(one of them is wrong -- the action script doesn't work with the Firefox URL, work fine in Konqueror)
Actual Results:
The first multiple same array value is passed without the [] charachers %5B%5D messing up the URL

Expected Results:
Both instance of the multiple same array value should be passed with the [] charachers %5B%5D
