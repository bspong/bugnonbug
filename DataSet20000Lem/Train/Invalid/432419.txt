A large memory leak happens and cause my system run like a snail when restoring a 30 tabbed, (two page with embedded flash). The memory used by Minefield rise up to a higher level than before I terminated the Minefield application from the process tab in task manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many tabs, especially one with flash and window medium player.
2. Kill the process
3. Restore the session
Actual Results:
System slow, sometimes crash.


I think firefox should improve the session restore by "Warning Users" when the session store is very large.
It should provide an option to Continue or Purge all back and forward history and all input and all cooky saved in the session restore file and restore only the page opened (Full Reload).

This is Critical or Trivial. (It seems hard for me to choose which one is more appropriate).
It cause the software to crash and hang, but not lose data. I provided a suggestion and a nice workaround that firefox should do. Which one is it?
