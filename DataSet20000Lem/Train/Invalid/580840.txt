To reopen a closed tab with a middle click, you have to hit the "new tab" button in FF4.0b1, hitting the tab bar in general won't work (by the way that is something I'd almost file a a bug, too). The problem here is, that middle clicking that button will not only restore that last tab, but also open an empty new one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Tab
2. Close it
3. Mittdle click "+"-Button in tab bar
4. Watch
Actual Results:
One tab is restored, one unwanted new tab opened.

Expected Results:
Restored the last tab, but NOT opened a new one - That should only happen when you left click the "+"-button, and then the last closed tab shouldn't be restored, of course.
