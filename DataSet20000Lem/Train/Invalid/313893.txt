Using "data:" for "text/javascript" doe not seem to work; the content is displayed a plain text instead of being exectued. But "data:text/javascript," would be a nice alternative to the "javascript:" URI scheme, since the latter wa never officially registered with the IANA.

And at least the IETF draft (June 6, 2005) on Scripting Media Types [1] suggests in it Security Consideration section that "text/javascript" data ought to be executed:

The "data" resource identifier scheme [RFC2397] in combination with
the type defined in this document could be used to cause execution
of untrusted script through the inclusion of untrusted resource
identifier in otherwise trusted content. Security consideration of
[RFC2397] apply.

Of course supporting "data:text/javascript," ha security implications, but those are exactly the same a for "javascript:" URIs...
