Dialog Spoofing Vulnerability
Vulnerability:"Window injection Vulnerability"

found this Vulnerability on http://secunia.com/product/4227/

The problem is that a website can inject content into another site's window if
the target name of the window is known. This can e.g. be exploited by a
malicious website to spoof the content of a pop-up window opened on a trusted
website.

This Vulnerability can be eliminated by selecting the load image from
originating website only. of course then image from a particular website such
a http://www.amazon.co.uk wouldnt load.
