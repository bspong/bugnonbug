Whenever I right-click on the toolbar at the top to disable the Menu Bar, the new Firefox Button either get overlapped by or is overlapping the back and forward buttons. In addition the search engine search box get overlapped by the minimize, maximize, and close button while the browser window is maximized.

Basically, disabling different toolbars is broken.

1. Maximize browser window if not already maximized
2. Right-click the top toolbar.
3. Un-check Menu Bar option
Actual Results:
Back/forward, minimize, maximize, and close button overlap the navigation toolbar and Firefox Button.

Expected Results:
Correct placement of all button and toolbars when option are enabled or disabled.
