Firefox Startup page doe not recognize it own browser's version. Every time i start Firefox, i can feel my mind short-circuiting.

- Do i need to upgrade?
- Huh? But don't i already have 4?
- Maybe it's another release of 4? 4 point something?
- But isn't it supposed to update those minor version automatically?
- Ohh it's just a stupid/unintelligent Startup page.
- Weird... neither Mozilla nor Google are amateurs...

Very subtle but very irritating cognitive dissonance... replaced by annoyance and then by surprise - "could not they make a somewhat smarter start page?"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2. read "Firefox 4 is here! Download it today and put the Web on fast forward. "
or "Upgrade to Firefox 4 and organize your social network with App Tabs. "
or "Firefox 4 ha the performance for some serious gaming fun. Upgrade now! " etc


Expected Results:
"Congratulations - you have the best browser there is - Firefox version 4" or"Great - you have the fastest browser in the world - Firefox 4" ... etc
Anything is better than this.
