The Trash on the Dock must be reasonably consistent across applications. In this case, I dragged a tab from a multi-tabbed window to the Trash to close the tab, but it didn't close. The tab tear away to another window. The UI is misleading because if I hover the tab over the Trash before concluding the dragging action, the Trash dims a if it will accept the action. When I discovered this inconsistency, it seemed that all my other tab had been closed instead of the one I desired to close. After some confusion, I refound the other tab in the old window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two or more tabs.
2. Drag one of the tab to the Trash located on the dock.
Actual Results:
It appears that all the other tab have been closed, except for the one that I want to close. In fact, none of the tab closed.

Expected Results:
The tab should close.
