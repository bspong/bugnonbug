I've been a dedicated Mozilla and Firefox user since the beta day of Mozilla but I'm beginning to get real fed up with this same stupid repeating problem.

Every time there's an update to Firefox I go up and get it. I fully expect to have problem with email link but what's bringing me to the point of giving up on Mozilla product is not doe the same, stupid, irritating problem keep happening it get's WORSE.

The real slap in the face is there's no easy to find or copy fix for it NOR is there any attempt by Mozilla to fix it. The problem just keep getting worse and harder to fix. You just can't seem to work out this bug.

I shouldn't have to go into the Registry or tinker with IE to fix your shortcomings, especially for an upgrade to Firefox that wa installed over a working version.

I have small newsletter that ha a built in blurb about being more secure with Firefox because for the most part I'm pleased with Firefox. That may come to a halt though because of this same simple stupid, recurring email problem.

The ball is in your court now. Previous fix for this error don't seem to work with this version I've spent the better part of a day trying to fix it. I'm tired and I'm fed up trying to fix this same dumb problem.
