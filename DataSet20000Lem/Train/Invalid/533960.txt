After loading the new Firefox 3.5, it removed my saved Norton Cards & logins
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I don't know how Firefox did it - I don't know what code you changed, but after I loaded the new Firefox 3.5, at first the Norton bar wouldn't appear, so I had to re-launch. Then, after I re-launched, the Norton bar came up with it card & logins buttons. The problem is - they have ALL BEEN ERASED! I know that Firefox doe not have the availability to actually erase the codes, so you must have changed keywords in your backcode that Norton had associated with those passcodes.

So now, I have to re-create those codes. Not fun!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Norton 360 installed
2. Enable the Norton Search Bar
3. Have several websites/usernames/passwords encoded.
4. CHoose Help: Check for Updates
5. Load Firefox 3.5.
6. At first the Norton bar doesn't appear. Firefox gave an "oops" message and I relaunched Firefox.

Actual Results:
Now, all the Norton cards/logins are whiped clean for Firefox. They still work in IE, so I know the file still exists. But for some odd reason, they aren't recognized within Firefox.

Expected Results:
I have to re-enter all the username/passcodes now.

That is extremely annoying.

It shouldn't have affected the Norton stuff at all. I can only assume you changed codewords on the programming end that affected the way Norton interacts with Firefox.
