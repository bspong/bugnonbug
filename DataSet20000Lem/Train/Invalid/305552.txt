----BUG's Description & Symptoms----

>>>Firefox crash randomly. When it crash it cause GNOME to hang. Keyboard
get completely locked I can't switch to another virtual console to kill firefox
process. Mouse move but it's "busy animation" get locked; eventually I can't
click anything all button are unresponsive on firefox and gnome... However, I
know that my system is not completely unresponsive. I have loaded acpi power
button feature to the kernel and I noticed that when I try to shut the sysem
down by using the power button it shuts down correctly. This -I think- mean
that all background service and kernel are running correctly after the crash.

I couldn't find any common point at the page that it crashes. Actually, it
hang even in firefox's bug submission page. In some page it hang insistently
(www.ardour.org while loading paypal logo). I tried to run it from the console
but no error message is given. Strangely, when I run it from the console it may
sometimes load a page -talking for www.ardour.org- which it hang insistently.
Afterwards when I run it from the desktop button -the paypal logo being on the
cache- it doesn't hang. In my current configuration It hang so frequently that
I switched to window xp to write this bug report.

I believe that this is somehow related to kernel setting but i couldn't manage
to find an exact solution. I am plunged to linux world 1,5 yr ago. I tried many
distribution and I decided to use gentoo at last. I didn't notice such a bug in
neither the other distros nor in winXP. A friend of mine said the same bug
happened in slackware but he doesn't remember how he got rid of it. I compiled
many different kernel in gentoo including gentoo-sources but that damn bug is
there since version 1.0.4 (I didn't try older version on gentoo). While playing
kernels, changing it options, I managed to reduce the frequency of those
crash but I could never end them. Well, I should say, I wasn't very methodic
about changing the kernel option because of my lack of time.

Neither compiling firefox from it source (by emerging from the portage tree)
nor downloading and installing compiled binary changed anything. Another
important point is that epiphany using gecko engine is infected by the same bug.
Moreover thunderbird -after using it for 5-10 min while composing a mail-
crashed the same way firefox and epiphany did and drove me mad.

Reproducible: Sometimes
