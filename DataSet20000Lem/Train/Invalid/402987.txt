Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.turn on Mozillia
2.new pop up asking to assign a use (present user is default)
3.hit ok page appears like I'm a new customer and my old bookmark are gone!
Actual Results:
The best way to reproduce the problem would be to follow your instructions! there wa no need for a pop up telling me to do something different than before ! it wa fine before!

Expected Results:
It gave me a new Mozilla clean and fresh without my bookmark which I would have preferred to keep over a new mozilla

NOTHING...NOT A THING! it wa fine the way it wa but your guy are always looking for a new and improved angle to hustle something I don't want and did not request!
