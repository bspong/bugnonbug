nsTextFrame.cpp::PaintAsciiText may use uninitialized variable
nsTextFrame.cpp::PaintAsciiText may use uninitialized variable

1) http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/generic/nsTextFrame.cpp#3834
const char* text;
at this point |text| may point to anything depending on previous stack content.

2) http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/layout/generic/nsTextFrame.cpp#3888
if this branch is hit, |text| is uninitialized and may point to anything.

later in this method |text| is used at least for reading, but if it is used
for writing this may be exploitable.

so if 2) is hit, at least a crash may be guaranteed
