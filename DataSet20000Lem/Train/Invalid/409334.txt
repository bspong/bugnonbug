Whatever tooltip wa last shown will repeatedly show whenever the cursor pause for long enough.

I initially noticed after closing a tab and still seeing the tooltip from the closed tab. Upon further examination it seems to show the tooltip no matter what, showing a blank tooltip when first opened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Hover cursor over client area.
2.
3.



new installation of minefield.
