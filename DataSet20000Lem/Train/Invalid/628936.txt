There is no obvious way to access Panorama on the Windows version of Firefox. It took me a lot of searching to find control-shift-e, and there is no longer an icon that activates it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to activate Panorama
2. Where did the icon go?

Actual Results:
Most Windows user will never discover Panorama. It's a really useful feature. But the interface for it is missing!

Expected Results:
Obvious, easy to use interface.
