Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.1

At random times, while using Firefox 1.5.0.1 up to the Bon Echo alpha and the latest nightly releases, my whole computer becomes unresponsive.

First, it appears a though Firefox and other application lose their internet connection.

Second, explorer lock up completely and new application cannot be launced.

Third, process cannot be terminated for the whole machine.

After removing the network cable and plugging it back in, everything return to normal and internet access is restored.

The problem seems to occur more frequently when Firefox is running and I am using other apps that use the internet.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch firefox, browse around a bit
2.Move to other internet requiring apps
3.Whole computer lock up, network cable need to be removed

Actual Results:
Computer return to normal after reconnecting the network cable and waiting a few seconds.

Expected Results:
Not have caused the whole system to lock up.

The problem only occurs while Firefox is running. Other browsers, such a Opera, IE6/7 do not cause the problem.

Problem occurs with all firewall off and with McAfee VirusScan 8.0i disabled.

No extension installed.
