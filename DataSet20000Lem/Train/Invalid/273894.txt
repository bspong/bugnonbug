if we create an html page and the table... in one of the cell we insert an
iframe. in the iframe there is a link...eg href="../html/membs/a.html"
the iframe (source page) is in the membs directory too.
if we click the link... in firefox it doesn't find it! it try to find it in
the "html" folder, but the same link can be opened in IE5+ without a problem:
creating the problem:
1. Folder: HTML
2. Inside html create another folder named membs
3. in the html folder we create a page which ha a table
4. In one of the table's cell we put an iframe
5. The iframe link to a page (html) in the membs folder
6. the iframe_page ha one link.... which link to another html page inside the
membs folder
7. in firefox it search the file in the html folder instead in the membs
folder. it search in the directory were the MAIN page wa which had the iframe
link while IE search the directory were the iframe_page is
8. i can create an example and send it if it help

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Folder: HTML
2. Inside html create another folder named membs
3. in the html folder we create a page which ha a table
4. In one of the table's cell we put an iframe
5. The iframe link to a page (html) in the membs folder
6. the iframe_page ha one link.... which link to another html page inside the
membs folder
7. in firefox it search the file in the html folder instead in the membs
folder. it search in the directory were the MAIN page wa which had the iframe
link while IE search the directory were the iframe_page is
8. i can create an example and send it if it help

Actual Results:
the link cannot be found... if you fix the url link then the link won't work in
IE (any version)

Expected Results:
when a page is being loaded either inside frame or not, to "capture" the
directory were the link got "read" from and not to "still" remember the
directory of the main frame or page/since it's an iframe error

the problem is the same on win XP also...
it doesn;t crash the broswer it justs understand the directory differently
and so my web site cannot be compatiable bot with firefox 1 and IE.
