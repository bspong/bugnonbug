URL mal formed
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)

If you write a malformed URL, the image path become wrong, and also
javascripts ... This error occurs in Explorer too, maybe it's a webserver bug!

This error appears when the url doesn't have GET parameter

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Write a URL in direction bar. i.e http://www.chefuri.com/indexe.php is a
normal URL, but if you write http://www.chefuri.com/indexe.php/hello the URL
relative is broken. It's possible use a ../ i.e:
http://www.chefuri.com/indexe.php/../hello


Please do not crash my personal page :D
