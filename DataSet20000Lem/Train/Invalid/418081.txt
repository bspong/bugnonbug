If you attempt to edit any wikipedia page, ie, using http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Type_of_gesture&action=edit , you will find that Mozilla throw up a dialog for opening the PHP file, instead of displaying it in the browser. The only option displayed are 'open with' (and 'handle with Firefox' isn't in that list) or 'Save to File'. PHP is NOT listed a a file extension in the 'Applications' preferences; other Wikis like the Homestar Runner Wiki (http://hrwiki.org) are editable freely, and other PHP page work fine.
