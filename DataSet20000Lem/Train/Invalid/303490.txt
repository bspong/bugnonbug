Freezes everytime the broswe start for about 2 minutes, also when opening new
window and sometimes you'll be broswing a site and you'll get somewhere that
ha been loading and go back to the web page and won't load and you'll have to
restart the broswer! It ha been like this for over 3 months. And all of this
doesn't go for any other broswer but still like this one better then IE and i
don't have any virus or anything.

Reproducible: Always
