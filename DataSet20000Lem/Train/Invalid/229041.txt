For the last few day at least (since 12/23-ish) ctrl-k no longer focus the
search/google bar for me. It doesn't matter where my focus is, I can find no
circumstance under which I can jump to the search bar with the keybord
shortcut. It did work fine for me in the last stable release.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press ctrl-k.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
Focused search bar.
