This is not a "serious" problem, but it can be one HELP for all people using FF!
I noted during the FF installation "the absence" of one icon for the Firefox
Profile Manager (so we have in Thunderbird :D)
That's possible in the future with the installer to have so "the icon" ?

...Many person do not know where and how to add one "-p" !

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Installation of Firefox with installer !
2.Looking at the Menù-Start
3."Absence" of the <<Firefox (Profile Manager)>> icon !
