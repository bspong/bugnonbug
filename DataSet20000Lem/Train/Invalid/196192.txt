I wa working on some Flash, using Flash MX, to create a simple button. When
you click the button it wa meant to goto the page brochure.htm. As the page
doe not exist I would of expected it to popup and tell me it can't find it.
Instead, the browser open a blank tab, then another blank tab. The 2nd blank
tab then go to www.petetownshend.co.uk for some odd reason.

I've told IE and Opera to be default browser and this doe not happen. I'm not
exactly sure why this happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click flash button
Actual Results:
The browser open a blank tab, then another blank tab. The 2nd blank tab then
go to www.petetownshend.co.uk for some odd reason.


Expected Results:
Told me it can't find the URL.
