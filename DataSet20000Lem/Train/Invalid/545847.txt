I had no problem with Firefox up until last night (02/09/10) when a mess of Windows update came out. I dutifully installed them on both my laptops, and now every time I launch Firefox on the one with Win7 Home Premium 64 bit it crash to a blue screen and restarts the machine (an Acer laptop). My other laptop (Dell) run W7HP 32bit doe nearly the same thing. I can get into Firefox, but then a soon a I try to go anywhere it crash too. The bluescreen isn't up long enough on either to do a printscreen or write down the errors, the machine just restarts. Very weird. I've just gone back to IE8 until it's resolved (which the conspiracy theorist in me is saying is just what Microsoft want me to do!)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Windows update applied 02/09/10
2.Launched Firefox 3.6
3.Windows crash to blue screen of death and reboots



I have an Acer laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit, and a Dell laptop running the same, but 32 bit. Acer came with Win7, Dell wa upgraded. Both were running Comcast McAfee Security Suite. I uninstalled it on 64 bit box, uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox, same results. I've now uninstalled Firefox from both, have uninstalled McAfee from both and am now running Comcast Norton Security, if that matter to you. Microsoft forum have been no help, and I'm not sure if problem is isolated. Just weird that it hit both my machine after Windows update.
