show a most of these report are at start up and this comment confirms:

PicLens 1.6.4.3021 extension causing crash at start up (disabled it, start fine, enable it, fails)

Just installed and wa launching FF3.

just installed and started for the first time. it prompted me with a bunch of disabled add ons, so i hit the check for updates. found new Aero-fox theme, and cool-iris preview add on. installed them, then on the restart, it crashed before it opened

The first comment indicates the older version ha problem which I believe is a known problem. we should condider blocklisting the old version on firefox 3 installs.

http://www.cooliris.com/site/support/download-all-products.php seems to indicate that both firefox 3 and firefox 2 version are now available, but that last comment raise the possibility that the older version might be being served up to firefox 3 users, or there is also compatibility problem with the newer version a well.
