DOM xmlns call-template missing attribute

This is rather difficult to explain, but it feel like firefox fails to add _any_ attribute to tag built in a <xsl:call-template/> call iff there is an xmlns present in the html tag...

I have provided two examples. Sorry in advance if I'm simply failing to understand something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL above and try both with_bugs and sans_bugs
2. The .xml file contain no real thrills, but simply invoke some .xsl
3. The only difference between the .xsl document (besides color and text) is the xmlns attribute on the html of the buggy .xsl ...

Actual Results:
Any tag built in the call-template context will have NO attribute desipte using xsl:attribute or building the attribute by hand. The javascript divtag.id.match(/something/) will fail stating the node ha no attributes!

Expected Results:
The tag should have attributes. The javascript divtag.id.match(/something/) shouldn't generate a j error even if you fail to set the tag id.
