I don't know where to post this, so I am putting it here. My mother-in-law's computer (xp, firefox 3.0.1) stopped getting sound with youtube video after I had visited a few week ago. I have read a bunch about this and have been trying to solve her problem following advice on the mozilla.com forums. In the meanwhile, my computer (xp, firefox 3.0.1) had been getting sound just fine in youtube videos, however this evening I updated skype to the most recent version from a version that wa 2+ year old. The result---no sound in firefox on youtube videos. This reminded me that the weekend that I had visited my mother-in-law I had installed skype on her computer (and she lost sound at this point).

I am quite confident that skype is the culprit in the loss of sound in video in firefox. Hopefully someone read this and is able to come up with a solution (for now I will try to follow the forum's advice to get it back).
