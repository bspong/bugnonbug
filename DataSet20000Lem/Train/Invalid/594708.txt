In the latest nightly the favicon in adressbar wa replaced by #identity-container (e.g. the box that indicates the current domain you are viewing page on), which now doesn't show you the process of searching for the typed into the addressbar word through history.
Old behavior wa so: you type anything in the addressbar and the search begin and the favicon turn into rotating arrows, which will disappear when the search is finished.
And now user can't get know whether the search is finished or not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type anything into address bar.
Actual Results:
Search starts, but the user doesn't get informed whether it is in process or it ha already stopped.

Expected Results:
Search start and the user get informed whether it is in process or it ha already stopped.

This bug appeared since yesterday's nightly build's out, where the new feature (#identity-container) landed.
