Character set problem in automatically opened window -- latin1 character show up a box

There are two way to reproduce this bug. The first method is:

Go to <http://www.posten.no/>, type SM014681520NO in the text
field labeled "Spor sendingen din" (located on the right side of
the screen), then click the button to the right of the text field
(labeled "SØK").

This should open up a new window with tracking information for
the package number entered above. In the first line, in the
"Poststed" column, the correct text would be "3501 HØNEFOSS",
but instead the "Ø" is replaced with a box of some kind.
(As illustrated in the attached screenshot.)

Now for the second way to reproduce the bug. This time, make sure
that Firefox is already running, and type

firefox -remote "openURL($url, new-window)"

where $url is

PS: The bug will _not_ appear if Firefox isn't already running
and you start it with 'firefox $url'. Opening the URL in a new
window is required, but a you can see, it doe not matter if
the Window wa opened by clicking the "SØK" button or if the
"openURL" command is used. I have not been able to reproduce
any of this on Windows, only Linux, but it affect both Firefox
1.0.2 and Mozilla 1.8a6. (I used the pre-compiled Gtk2 binaries.)

Finally, some basic system information:
=======================================
Slackware 10.1
glibc 2.3.4
X.org 6.8.2


Reproducible: Always
