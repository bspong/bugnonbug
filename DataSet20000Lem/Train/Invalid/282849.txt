I have installed the FireFox-Extension "SwitchProxy Tool v.1.3.1". It worked
properly for a long time, but some day ago it caused my FireFox-Browser to crash.

This Problem couldn't be solved by re-installing the Browser or the Extension.

When Extension is deactivated, the Problem doe not appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install FireFox 1.0
2.Install "SwitchProxy Tool v.1.3.1"
3.Restart FireFox

Actual Results:
The Browser crashed. Error message: "Keine Rückmeldung" (in english: "no reply")

Expected Results:
The Browser should have worked properly.
