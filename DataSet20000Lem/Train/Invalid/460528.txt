Neither Firefox, Shiretoko or CometBird show descriptive subtitle when a thumbnail picture is hovered on with the mouse cursor. I can't seem to find any on/off in the options.
This feature is provided in Internet Explorer.
If you don't have it IE may have one upped you here.

Pick a popular porn site to see what I mean using IE versus Firefox.
