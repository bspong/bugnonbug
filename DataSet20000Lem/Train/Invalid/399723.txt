Unknown problem with "Bookmarks"--and the "Display Page"

Problem 1. After installing FireFox 2.0.0.7--I imported previous FireFox bookmarks. However, NOW--"Bookmarks" only work, when clicking on "Organize Bookmarks." Otherwise, when I click on Bookmarks, the only window that come up is "Bookmarks...Organize." Clicking on anything else, brings up a list of INACTIVE BOOKMARKS--which when clicked on, do NOT respond. However, going to "Organize Bookmarks"--brings up a complicated VERY OVERDONE BOX of all kind of bookmarks--(shades of Microsoft!) Clicking on THESE ONLY BOOKMARKS, BRINGS UP THE URL ONE NEEDS! VERY ANNOYING AND OVERDONE!

Problem 2: The HEADER and FOOTER are BOTH EQUAL IN SIZE--AND CREATE AN ANNOYING "LETTERBOX" type SCREEN! The TOP toolbar ha all the usual thing that most toolbars have--but the BOTTOM/FOOTER take up almost the EXACT AMOUNT OF SPACE--AND doe nothing but block 1 1/2 inch of viewer space, which show URL's clicked on BUT the little 'PROGRESSION BARS' STAY ON AT ALL TIMES--AS IN, HOW EVER LONG ONE IS LOGGED ON! ALL the above also affect my home page--MyWay.com.

The FireFox problem described are ONLY associated with FireFox--MyWay.com--also mail.com. When I exit FireFox and MyWay, my display return to normal--as in the "START" bar, is the bottom "footer." Suggestions!??!?

Actual Results:
See Details above.

Expected Results:
Had A useless "letterbox type screen" a a "footer" on ALL FireFox and MyWay pages. Get the useless 1 1/2 inch bottom footer off the screen!

Have a CLEAN INSTALLATION! FURTHER,ABANDON TYPICAL MICROSOFT OVER-OVER-OVER-OVER DONE TACTICS TO RUN A BROWSER! HINTS: FireFox USED to be "USER FREIINDLY!" In the past year, it's getting more and more like MICROSOFT! AS IN BECOMING 'KLUTZY'--OVERDONE--FULL OF USELESS 'OPTIONS'!?!?!

SIDEBAR: I REST MY CASE! When I started using FireFox a few year ago, it worked flawlessly! NO LONGER!!! THESE NEVER-ENDING WAY-WAY OVERDONE DETAILS WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY, IF PROGRAMMERS STOPPED PUTTING STUFF 'OVER THE CURB' BEFORE IT WAS FUNCTIONAL! CAN ANYONE SPELL 'BETA'!??!?
