I tried searching a lot for this bug, but unfortunately could not find one which
matched my observation.

The observed problem happens when a bookmark (folder, single link or live
bookmark) is dragged and attempted to be dropped between 2 LIVE BOOKMARKS.
2. It happens for DND attempted in both the BM menu a well a the BM toolbar.

Since this is a bit strange, let me describe using an example. Lets assume I
have this bookmark list a seen in my bookmark menu:

.
.
.
BM1
BM FOLDER1
BM FOLDER2
BM2
LIVE BM1
LIVE BM2
LIVE BM3
BM3
LIVE BM4
.
.
.

All kind of DND works, except for drop between:
1. 'LIVE BM1' & 'LIVE BM2'
2. 'LIVE BM2' & 'LIVE BM3'







Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Please see details.
Actual Results:
Cannot drop bookmark between:
1. 'LIVE BM1' & 'LIVE BM2'
2. 'LIVE BM2' & 'LIVE BM3'


Expected Results:
Bookmarks should be droppable between:
1. 'LIVE BM1' & 'LIVE BM2'
2. 'LIVE BM2' & 'LIVE BM3'
