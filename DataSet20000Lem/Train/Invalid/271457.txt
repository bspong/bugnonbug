If you nest <code> tag between unordered list it won't render the HTML
correctly. However, nested <code> tag alone work a expected. Here's some
sample HTML showing the problem (same a the link included with this trouble
report):

<html><body>
<ul><code>
First we'll indent with &lt;ul&gt; and then use &lt;code&gt; on it.

<ul><code>
This is another &lt;ul&gt; / &lt;code&gt; pair and both tag
properly closed. </code></ul>

That mean this text should still be displayed with a fixed-width
font because we haven't yet closed the first &lt;ul&gt; / &lt;code&gt; pair.

</code></ul>

Second test case... first we use <code> &lt;code&gt; here...
and then we set another <code> &lt;code&gt; here... and then we
close</code> the second one (meaning this should still be fixed-width:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz.)</code>

</body></html>


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. use HTML above
2.
3.

Actual Results:
rendered incorrectly

Expected Results:
After closing the second unordered list, it should have continued to use a
fixed-width font. Granted, this is a somewhat odd case because there should be
no need to open a second <code> tag, however it is perfectly valid HTML.
