All of a sudden, some bold font look really weird in my Mozilla 3.0. The problem is not bound to any specific website, seem to be an overall thing.

An example is http://www.boligan.se/. Attaching the rendered image. It "seems" that I page without the Swedish national character å, ä ö... doe not exhibit this behaviour. Might be wrong in this, though.

Other example includes http://www.dn.se ( a major Swedish newspaper site), http://borssnack.di.se/Diseconf/Default.aspx and http://www.avanza.se. Contents at these URL:s is continously updated.

This problem wa introduced by some of the update - it wa not present some time ago (sorry I can't be more specific on this).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit one of the URI i bug description
2. Watch the strange, bold font rendered
Actual Results:
Weird character

Expected Results:
Nice character :-)

Fedora 9/x86_64 updated a of today.
