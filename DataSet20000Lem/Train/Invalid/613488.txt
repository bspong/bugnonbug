Anytime I go to https://login.verizonwireless.com/amserver/UI/Login and try to log in I am simply returned to that same login page. I've been able to log in for year in the past but suddenly Firefox refuse to let me log in. I have cleared the cache. cooky are enabled and have been totally removed and restored. I have NO problem doing the login with IE so I know it's Firefox issue.
