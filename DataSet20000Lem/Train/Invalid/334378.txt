I downloaded the latest version of Firefox, 1.5.0.2, Thursday night (4/13). When I try to compose a message in my Yahoo mail account, no editing icon appear on the toolbar immediately above the message window, i.e. cut, paste, font, font size, etc. The blank square are there, but no icons.Also, the message window appears to be too small; just a small square window when it used to extend across the page.
Spellcheck also hang up and I have to save the message a a draft to get it to stop.
In addition, Yahoo no longer recognizes my login name and password when I try to log into my account through Internet Explorer, not sure if that's a related problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to Yahoo mail account.
2. Click on Compose to create a message.
3. Initiate spellcheck for new message.
OR
1. Login to Yahoo mail
2. Begin to write new message.
OR
1. Try to login to Yahoo Mail via IE.
Actual Results:
Same outcome a reported in summary.

Expected Results:
Editing icon should appear above Yahoo message composition window. Spellcheck should work properly, i.e. stop when I click CLOSE. I should be able to login to my Yahoo account from Firefox or IE.

My theme is Cloud Gnome. I'll test with the Firefox default theme but will have to close this window first. Note: This is a brand new laptop, a Sony Vaio FE550G, with a 1.66 GHz Core Duo processor and 1 GB of RAM.
