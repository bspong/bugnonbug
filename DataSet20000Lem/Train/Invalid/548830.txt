If i have a image with id "all" then document.all is reported a a valid property, no such a a problem so far, except that this is not standard. But a you might know many javascript library use document.all to find out if it is IE browser so here is when the problem come out causing the those library stop working properly.
And more over getting a image by document.image_id cause that every script that declares a image with the same name a a property report the image instead of the property.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Declare an image with id "all"
2.alert the value of document.all

This is a small page that show the problem

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<img id="all"/>
<img id="x"/>
</body>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
document.x = 10; //Not sure how many ppl use this but anyway is a potencial problem
alert(document.all);
alert(document.x);
</script>
</html>
Actual Results:
The alert show HTMLImageElement

Expected Results:
The alert should display "undefined"

I am using firebug 1.5.2 just in case that take part.
