Google fails to recognise when <enter> is used to search
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

At www.google.com, you can perform a search by either typing something and
pressing enter, or by clicking the `search' button with the mouse. Normally if
you click the `search' button then google give you the tip: `Tip: Save time by
hitting the return key instead of clicking on "search"'
But in Firefox 1.0 it give that hint everytime (unless you use the search in
the toolbar).
I suspect that this bug might affect other website a well.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.google.com
2. Type something in the search box
3. Press <enter>

Actual Results:
Google think that I have pressed the `search' with the mouse instead of <enter>
on my keyboard. It give the message: `Tip: Save time by hitting the return key
instead of clicking on "search"'

Expected Results:
Google should recognise that <enter> wa used. ie. it should not give the `Tip'
every time.
