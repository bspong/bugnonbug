Clicking the middle mouse button on a link produce result a expected.
Clicking the middle mouse button on a blank part of the page or other non-link
part of the page produce "random" results. Sometimes it doe nothing. Sometimes
I get an alert that say "The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded" (this
behavior always occurs if I have multiple line of text hightlited. Sometimes I
get a page loaded that I have never before accessed or heard of. Never porn,
just "random site. It seems when I have hightlighted text, it tried to do a
search on that term, and then load the website it finds, though I can't usually
see a contection between the text that is highlighted and the page that is being
loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select some random text
2. Click the middle mouse button
3. Random page loads. As long a you do not highlight different random text, the
same page load upon every middle mouse click, regardless of the site I am
currently brosring.

Actual Results:
Random page is loaded IN THE SAME TAB I AM IN. The random page is loaded in the
current tab, not in a new tab. Clicking the middle mouse button on a link doe
load the link into a new tab however.

Expected Results:
Middle mouse click should preform no action whatsoever unless I am over a link,
in which case the link should open in a new tab. Also, Phoenix could allow me to
disable the middle mouse click. This is driving me nuts.
