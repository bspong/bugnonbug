FUEL fuelIPreferenceBranch.reset doesn't work
Happens to me on Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2) Gecko/20081201 Firefox/3.1b2. When I try to call this function, I get:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED) [nsIPrefBranch.resetBranch]" nsresult: "0x80004001 (NS_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED)" location: "JS frame :: file:///Applications/Internet/Firefox%203.1.app/Contents/MacOS/components/fuelApplication.js :: prefs_reset :: line 1010" data: no]

Looking at the documentation, this look about right, the component doesn't implement the reset call. But, considering that FUEL should fix these issue exactly, I would expect it to work around this limitation and reset the branch in some other way.
