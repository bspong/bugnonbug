Ubuntu Firefox us en-GB by default instead of en-US
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009020518 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.6

It seems that en-US packaged version of Firefox for Linux are using British English language pack rather than American English language packs.

As an American, I feel deeply offended by the British spelling that are constantly being recommended by the menu and spell check.

I am able to replicate this with both distro-packaged and Mozilla-issued builds.
