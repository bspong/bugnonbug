I installed an add-on which contained a bug. A very small window appeared. It wa impossible to read more than the first of the window title. The window wa not resize-able. Window title translated from Danish is "Problem loading page".

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
See image: http://www.joergenr.dk/Mozilla/small_window.png

Expected Results:
The window should be so large that it is possible to read it content or the window should be resize-able.

I deleted the add-on and am not able to reproduce it anymore.
