Addons can open arbitrary web page
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

Installed ReloadEvery from:

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reloadevery/


Actual results:

After the addon had been installed for several weeks, it opened a tab to nag me for donation when I launched a new Firefox session.


Expected results:

This expose a security vulnerability where an addon can open any arbitrary web page without my permission.

The expected result of an addon trying to open a web page is that Firefox should pop up a dialog saying something like "the addon foo ha attempted to open the web page bar. Allow the page to be opened? [yes] | [no] [do not ask again ( )]".
