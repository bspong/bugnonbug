Trying to upgrade Nightly to latest trunk through the about dialog fails, informing the user that "Nightly is up to date", although it is not - see Screenshot 1 (taken on the 13th of June)

Reproducible: always

Steps to reproduce:
1. Download and install an older Nightly build
2. Start Nightly
3. Go to Help-> About Nightly

Actual results:
- the user is informed that the "Nightly is up to date"

Expected results:
- the newer build start to download and the user is given the opportunity to update it browser

Note:
- reproduced issue on Ubuntu 11.04 x86, Win7 x86 and Mac OS X 10.6
- while trying to reproduce issue got error from Screenshot 2 - not sure if it's related or not
