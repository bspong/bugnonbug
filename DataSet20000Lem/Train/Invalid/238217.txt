Windows Firewall from SP2 preview kill DNS lookup
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040321 Firefox/0.8.0+

After installing the Windows XP Service Pack 2 technical preview, I noticed that
many of my DNS lookup in Firefox were failing. After some checking I
determined that the reason is that the new Windows Firewall block all ICMP
traffic by default and it seems that Firefox relies more on ICMP response than
it probably should.

None of my other application are affected by this (i.e. Internet Explorer and
eMule and AIM), but Thunderbird also is.

To fix the problem all you need to do is enable ICMP traffic, but telling new
user they need to modify their firewall setting is not really a good solution
to the problem.

I havn't checked to see which ICMP type is actually causing the problem, I just
enabled all of them. This is something that will need to be fixed before the
final release of SP2 if possible to prevent confusion.
