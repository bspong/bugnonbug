Two error message box show up one right after anther after downloading the plug in and then restarting. It say something like "Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIFileInputStream.init]" nsresult: "0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://1clickweather/content/js/utils/filemanager.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 233" data: no]. I noticed on one of the comment page to "Go to http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/addons/1035/ and right-click on 1-clickweather-1.1.9.1-fx.xpi then select Save As." well that did not work either. Looks a if several people are complaining but no one is actually writing in if you check the comment section. One person did add this " Thanks, Silverhawk, that worked great on my WinXP system. I wa about to dump FF4, because this app is one of my top used add-on that I use everyday.

The fix wa easy just following the instruction below by Silverhawk. I downloaded the xpi file by right clicking on the big green "Add to Firefox" button above, and choosing "Save Link As". Then I used the free 7zip from http://www.7-zip.org/ , to right click on the downloaded file and choose 7-zip -> Open Archive. Right click on the "install.rdf" file on the list inside 7-zip and choose edit, make the changes, save and exit.

Now why can't the developer just go ahead and make these simple change already and save a lot of people a lot of grief! Interesting also how the support link go to weather.com and the link there only lead you back here, with no help anywhere - real clever for a developer named "ExceptionThinker"!

Glad to have my weather back - thanks again.
Now I don't know if that help you but I don't write code so am not trying it myself.
