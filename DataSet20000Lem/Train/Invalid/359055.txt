Bookmark export fails when name is blank

In the "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder", I have ~30 links. In order to have them fit on one screen without scrolling, I simply deleted any text from the Name field in each bookmark's properties. I can then rely on the favicon to identify the site. I found this an excellent way to cram a many link a possible under my address toolbar.

The bookmark export function will not export any bookmark without a Name field. I am reporting this a a bug because, at a minimum, I would expect something in the export file, maybe use the URL if the Name field is blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bookmark
2. Empty the name field from the property box
3. Export bookmark

Actual Results:
Create a bookmark, then empty the name field from the property box, and export bookmarks. The blanked name bookmark will only show the description if it is present, otherwise it is blank.

Expected Results:
Expect bookmark with blank name field to be exported, perhaps with the URL a the exported name.

For one or two bookmark without names, a workaround is to simply name them, but this is inconvenient for more than 5 or so.
