Printing from MFF only print first page only. If I have made a query and there are 15 page available MFF print page 1. MS Internet Explorer V6 print all page or selected. While we like MFF we are unable to use it because of this reason and have to advise our customer to use IE6 if they wish to print their "orders list" from our website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.select multiple page on website
2.select File/Print
3.Displays ALL

Actual Results:
first page printed only. Even though page 1-15 are loadeed.
