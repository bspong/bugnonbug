In Library/Places --> History, if you open a link from an entry in the History, that link is deleted from it original place in the History.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find link in the History
2. Open link
3. Observe link disappear from original location (and appear at the top of the history).


Expected Results:
The browser history should represent a record of site visited by date and time. Current behavior seems to indicate a desire to eliminate redundant entry in the history (since they are relocated from the original location in the history chain to the top of the history). However, current behavior render the history essentially worthless since it is no longer an accurate representation of where you've been or when you've been there.
