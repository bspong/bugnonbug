I have been getting a hung computer when comming out of idle if and only if I leave firefox running. No report appear in event log and firefox bug report will never pick it up the hang. But I can make two different computer hang with the same issue everytime. Seem to be independent of the current web page.

Both computer run window 7 x64 latest driver/bios etc.)usb mouse/keyboard on both

computer 1 AMD phenom 9850 4G ram, motherboard gigiabyte 790gp , video card 4870
computer 2 AMD phenom II 955BE 4G ram, motherboard gigiabyte 790fxt , video card 5870.

Details of issue.
Both computer are set to remain on, eg no stanby or hibernate also no screen saver just screen blanking via power setting

If I move the mouse on the idle computer, the desktop returns, If I atempt to click on any destop/app component the comuter hang completely.

So it seems Firefox is hanging when the computer the power state is incresing from (probably) the lowest power state.

No problem whatsover if I remember to close firefox before leaving the computer.

One machine just ha adblock plus and noscript, the other is a vanilla firefox install

This ha been occurring for at least a year, but the sheer lack of info reported by winbows and or firefox ha made it hard to pin down...I gave spent a LOT of time going through bios's and driver from gigabyte thinking it a cpu p state issue.
But it become very obvious at this point ONLY firefox cause this issue

In this descripton I have the computer set to be always on, I am unsure if this is critical a I only set this trying to avoid this lockup in the first place.

An interesting observation is that I can access network share on the offending computer, but try and access the desktop on the computer result in a hang. eg the computer is operational before I do the mouse stuff, hence why I think it the increase of power state triggering the issues.

And when I say hang, it hang the whole computer not just firefox, not even numlock or capslock key work, I have to do a hard reset to get going again


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set computer to always on(maybe)
2.open firefox
3.leave computer idle for hour
4.move mouse and then click on anything
Actual Results:
desktop show and then mouse cursor stop moving...computer will no longer respond to direct user input, acessing it on the network is possible though

Expected Results:
desktop show and then computer responds to user input

NOT hang the user gui session.
