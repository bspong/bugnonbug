Slow start-up with Adblock Plus (Malware Domains Filter)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Adblock Plus 1.1.2 and 1.1.3, when used with Malware Domains filter, slows the start-up time of Firefox. By removing the Malware domain filter, the start-up time reduced from 45 second to about 10 seconds. (Safe mode start-up is about 8 seconds.) I'm also using two other filters: EasyPrivacy and EasyElement+EasyList, but they don't seem to cause any problems.

Reproducible: Always
