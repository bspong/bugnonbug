Tab management is screwed when browser.ctrlTab.previews is set to TRUE
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I entered about:config in Firefox 4 and set
browser.ctrlTab.previews to true.

Now when I try to go to the next tab by using Ctrl+Tab, it work more like Alt+Tab between windows.

For example, if I go from tab 10 to tab 1 and if I use Ctrl+Tab, I should be navigated to tab 2 and not tab 10. Moreover it switch between the tab groups. You get what I mean?
Group 1 tab 2 -> Ctrl+Tab -> Group 2 tab 2 -> Ctrl+Tab -> Group 1 tab 2...

It should be more like Group 1 tab 2 -> Ctrl+Tab -> Group 1 tab 3

OR

It should be more like Group 1 tab 2 -> Ctrl+Tab -> Group 1 tab 1.

Hey guy at Mozilla, you are getting the basic wrong. Firefox 4 is a really good product but don't lose more people. I am a fresh graduate. There are simple way to solve the tab problem.
Please don't screw your APIs.

I write for http://hacktivist.tumblr.com/ and for http://fastestfox.wordpress.com/ and I love Firefox. I have seen people struggling to do simple tasks. Please hire a good user experience engineer.

One more huge problem that FF4 user are facing is that when they save and quit, they have to sort their tab into group again. Why? Can't you think of a simple solution?

Group 1: Tab 1, Tab 2...
Group 2: Tab a, Tab b...

Pinned tab x, Pinned tab y...

Save and quit. When restored, restore the tab and the group that wa closed. Simple a that guys. I can find hundred of way to make this product better but I have a job to find and in the little time I get to test FF4, I find a hundred mistakes.

Guys, somethings in life have very simple solutions. Find them.
Sorry if I vented. I don't want to see Firefox the next Netscape.
