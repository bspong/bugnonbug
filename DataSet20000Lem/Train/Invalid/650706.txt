It's a simple bug to explain. Open http://www.thefreedictionary.com/, type any word in the dictionary to search in Firefox 3.6.*. It show two 'Flag' icons, which when pressed pronounce the word for you(In American and British accent respectively). Same is the case in Chrome. Open the same link in Firefox 4.0, it doesn't show those icon so we cannot hear the words.

Reproducible: Always

Same a above.

Don't see pronunciation icon in Firefox 4.0

Should see pronunciation icons.
