When upgrading to newer version of Firefox from 1.5.0.5 and up (and even 2.0) the internet is non-funtioning
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060719 Firefox/1.5.0.5

The browser simply doe not function with Firefox version 1.5.0.5 and above. THe setting are all set the same but nothing happens with future versions, I have to use 1.5.0.5 or earlier. It must be some malfunction with Firefox because Internet Explorer work just fine. Also, the setting for automatic program update change by itself (I always have it set not to automatically update) yet it doe by itself anyway and it upgrade to 1.5.0.9 which doesn't function. Thanks for any insight on the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Automatic Update ON
2. Let Firefox updrade & install
3. Firefox open but doe not function
Actual Results:
I can be browsing the internet then Firefox say it automatically updated to 1.5.0.9 and it installs on the next opening of Firefox.

Expected Results:
when it finish installing I open it and it's a white page saying website cannot be found. It cannot find any website, browser doe not function at all.

It should open up website just like previous version of Firefox (1.5.0.5 and below) and function.
