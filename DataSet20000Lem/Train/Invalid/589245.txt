Files downloaded from sedar.com have '.do' extension, so they aren't opened with the correct program

Sedar ha a distorted character test requiring one to enter the correct character before allowing entry to the site. I get an error message " /users/eggertpeterson/downloads/CheckCode-1.do could note be opened because of an unknown error".
I go inside downloads and click on CheckCode-1.do and get the message "There is default application to open the document CheckCode-1.do.
I am able to access the site no problem using Safari.

I also accessed the site no problem using Firefox under Windows XP until my computer blew up a couple of month ago (hence the switch to Mac).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Sedar site and follow the step
2.I have tried with different corporate names, so it is not just a fault of the one entry.
3.
Actual Results:
Get an error message a described above.

Expected Results:
Should have opened the corporate document I had specified
