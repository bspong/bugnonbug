Half of the page is missing, there are supposed to be 3 frame (check it in IE
and see what it is supposed to be like), I don't know wether she did any
misscoding the girl who coded it, but either way I'd like to be able to see the
rest of the page aswell...

Thank you for your time...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Refreshed the page
2. Checked it again over 7 hour later
Actual Results:
Nothing changed, still look bad :(

Expected Results:
I don't know, if she DID code something wrong then improve the warning that
there are misscodings so a person can find that out. <p>

Sounds like a standard Java programming thing, if I can't minimise the program
then KILL IT... how about catching the error somehow?
