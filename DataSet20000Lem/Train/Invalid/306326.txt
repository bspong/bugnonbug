Firefox 1.0.6 fails to start since I started to use 1.0+ branch
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20050816 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20050816 Firefox/1.0+

I downloaded the branch build from the following URL:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/firefox-1.0+.en-US.win32.zip
and unzipped it into it own folder D:\Apps\DeerPark. I created a shortcut to
the executeable (firefox.exe) and start the browser using that (this bug report
is being submitted from Deer Park).

Now, if I try to use Firefox 1.0.6, it fails to start up fully. I see the
browser window, but none of the button work, and the URL field is not enabled
for typing into.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Unzip the branch build (Deer Park) into it own folder
2. Start Deer Park and use it normally.
3. Exit Deer Park
4. Attempt to start Firefox 1.0.6

Actual Results:
The browser window appears, but none of the button work, and the URL field is
not enabled for typing into.

Expected Results:
The browser should have started up fully and been available for browsing with.
