I am not sure if this is a firefox problem or not, but on my system, It doe not happen to any other apps other than firefox that I know of, As I said in the description, every single space
is really excessively big
Each space take up what look like should be 3 of them
When I load firefox I get
** (firefox-bin:pid): WARNING **: Exception in gr::RangeSegment
several time

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I don't exactly know how to reproduce it, It just happens to me,
my OS is Debian/GNU sid(unstable) Linux kernel 2.6.22 and firefox 3b4




It happens to me with the default theme a well a any other theme, and It doe not happen with any other gtk2 apps on my system
