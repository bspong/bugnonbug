Firefox should display what beta or release candidate it is
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008060900 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008060900 Firefox/3.0

I can't tell if I have the latest version of Firefox because when I go to Help > About Mozilla Firefox, it just say I have Firefox 3.0. Instead it should display Firefox 3.0 RC1, RC2, Beta 5, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Help > About Mozilla Firefox
Actual Results:
It display that you are using Firefox 3.0.

Expected Results:
It should display that you are using Firefox 3.0 RC1, etc.
