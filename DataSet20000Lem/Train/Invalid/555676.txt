The new Minefield alpha 4 can't switch tab (generally speaking). Clicking on other tabs, or pressing ^Tab doe nothing. I *can*, however, press Alt+1 and Alt+(number) to choose tabs. I can also press ^T to open a new tab and ^W to close one. Right clicking the tabbar doesn't do anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Minefield alpha 4
2. Go to two tab with website
3. Press ^Tab
Actual Results:
Nothing happened with ^Tab or clicking a tab, switching only work with Alt+(number)

Expected Results:
The tab should switch.
