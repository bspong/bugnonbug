When pc is first loading if i open firefox just a blank window loads. I then
have to close the browser and re-open it. If i get a link that is to open in a
_blank page the browser freezes. I have tried all three of the link option to
open in new window, new tab, same tab and nothing works. This also can cause my
linksys wireless B router to have to close wireless connection in which case i
have to reboot the router. Also when this happens i have to use CTRL + ALT +
Delete to close down firefox. Also most of my extension have stopped working
for the most part. Sometimes they load and sometimes they don't. I have the
developer kit a well a foxy tune and ip tracker. These all worked fine in
1.06 but have stopped working in 1.07. Please let me know if there is a fix for
this. I have tried to uninstall and re install but nothing helped.
