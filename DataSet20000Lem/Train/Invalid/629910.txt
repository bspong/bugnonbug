Twice this morning the status panel gave useless or obsolete information.

Once the panel said "Waiting for ebay-static.com..." when the page being displayed wa not eBay. I had previously opened eBay tabs, but all the eBay tab were closed. The current tab had completely loaded and should not have been using eBay.

Once the status panel said "Done". The wa accurate, but I didn't expect that message to persist (or even be displayed at all).

In both case the message went away when I closed the current tab, and before I thought to get a screen shot.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
