After logging in to gmail with one of my accounts, it said "Loading..." a it always does, then after a pause, Firefox crashed and produced "Firefox need to close" or something similar like that with the option "Send error report" and "Don't send error report.d" This ha been happening repeatedly and is a very large annoyance. I believe it ha something to do with the extension "Gmail Notifier," although I wa not sure so I decided to do this anyway. I have 2 gmail account and it happened to both. I tried to disable the extension, but it still happened. Only after uninstalling the extension did it stop, although it is possible it will happen again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Firefox after crash.
2. Go to gmail
3. Login
4. Crashed
Actual Results:
After I tried again, the same result happened until I uninstalled the extension "Gmail Notifier"

Expected Results:
Not crash.
