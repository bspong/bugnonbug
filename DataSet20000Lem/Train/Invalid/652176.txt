Master password prompted in private browsing mode

When you start to use Mozilla Firefox in private browsing mode and you attempt to login into a website, the master password is prompted to unlock the Firefox saved passwords.

I do not think it make sense to ask the master password in this mode, In theory you do not want to know the password stored in the browser and don't want to be saved any more.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put on the master password feature.
2. Go to private browse mode.
3. Go to a website that require or support login (eg. facebook.com)
Actual Results:
Firefox prompt for Master Password.

Expected Results:
Firefox should not ask for the master password.
