If cooky are disabled by unchecking "Accept cooky from sites" in the privacy preferences, and any site is added to the "Exceptions..." list, most video on Youtube.com (though not all) will stream much more slowly than they would otherwise stream, making it impossible to watch them. (In the status bar a different Youtube server will be mentioned than would be if the preference had not been changed). It make no difference which site are added to the "Exceptions" list, a soon a any site is added, and cooky are disabled, the problem occurs. Re-enabling cooky and removing all site from the exception list doe not rectify the problem. It is only rectified with either a new profile, or by deleting "cookies.txt" from the profile in use.

An example video which show this problem is this music video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCTlF4x7MQ

Although the problem occurs with many, many other video on Youtube.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable cookies.
2. Add any site to the "Exceptions" cooky whitelist.
3. Attempt to watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGCTlF4x7MQ or almost any other Youtube video.

Actual Results:
The video will download much too slowly to stream and playback will continually stop while buffering.

Expected Results:
The video would play normally if the preference described had not been changed. Changing the preference back doe not resolve the problem.

The problem wa noted with all Firefox version tested, including the latest nightly build.
