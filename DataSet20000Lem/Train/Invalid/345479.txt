Client param make Google search use google.es in Catalan Firefox
«firefox…» value client parameter in Google searchplugin turn Google search in Catalan Firefox browser (in Spanish state) under google.es domain.

If instead of «firefox» any other value is tried, let's say «mozilla-firefox», there is not such redirection.

This wa already commented in a previous bug 269062.

Many user who use Catalan software, would prefer not being imposed that redirection, so this behaviour should be changed in the Google side.
