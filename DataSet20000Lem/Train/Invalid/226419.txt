MS introduced new "default" for middle button, Open in New Tab doesn't work

With IntelliPoint 5.0, Microsoft have introduced a new default action for the
middle button. I wa using a Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 mouse (the one
with the new Horizontal Scroll feature...). When doing a control-middle click to
open a new tab under version 5.0 of IntelliType, nothing happened.

Unfortunately, IP 5.0 doesn't agree with my machine, it crash every 5 minute
(literally!), so I have rolled back to version 4.1 and the Ctrl+Middle button
work again. As IP 5.0 isn't stable on my machine, I haven't been able to test
it with the latest build of Firebird.

The changed "default" setting are:
Old version: Wheel Button : AutoScroll
New version: Wheel Button : Next Window

I hope this helps. Keep up the good work, this is the best browser I have used!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install IntelliPoint 5.0
2. Open Firebird
3. Ctrl+Middle Click on a Hyperlink

Actual Results:
Nothing

Expected Results:
Opened a new tab and loaded the hyperlink.

Right clicking on a hyperlink and clicking on Open in New Tab... still works.
