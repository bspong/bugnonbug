This is not about the version I am running. It concern the newest update.

When the new FF update is installed, Vista crash bad after a few minute of email, etc. I don't know whether it is FF or the new Flash, but the 3 crash I have had were major and involved a restart in Safe Mode and Last Known Good Configuration. Sorry I cannot be more specific, but it hit out of nowhere each time and I feel the next time I might not to be able to resurrect my computer. I also no longer dare to update Windows. Any suggestions?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF update
2. Update Flash
3. Check email, etc.
Actual Results:
FF suddenly disapppears. shortly thereafter keyboard and touchpad stop responding. I cannot shut down the computer unless I unhook the power and take out the battery. I have damaged a lot of program already.

Expected Results:
I don't know if FF is to blame, but I had similat problem with another update that asked for a flash update.
