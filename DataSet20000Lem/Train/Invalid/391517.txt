when i do file save page a i expect a file that if i reopen will look exactly the same (perhaps without pictures).

this doe not happen.

instead, if i do view source, and then save that file, i get what i want.

the file save page a file should give me something that will reproduce (perhaps without pictures) the same information i had on the screen to begin with.
