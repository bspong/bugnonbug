When FF is open and there are multiple tab open, minimising the window and then
closing it via Right Mouse Button (RMB) then close cause the close tab window
to ask for confirmation. On confirmation that you wish to close FF remains on
the taskbar.

* RMB - close again pop up the confirmation window.
* Maximising the window after any number of attempt to close it cause FF to exit.
