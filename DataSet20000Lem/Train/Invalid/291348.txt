Menu Cleanup
I'm suggesting moving 'Web Search' from the Tools->Go menu, 'Check for updates'
to the top of the tool menu, and remove 'Sanitize Firefox' from the tool menu
and create a button for it. I really don't think there should even be a menu
entry for it in the first place since there are plenty of option to not
sanitize, or sanitize on close.
