browser.xul element getting included in other XUL window
XUL element that appear to be specific to browser.xul are getting included in other Chrome windows. For example, if I open the JS console, then examine it with the DOM inspector, I see lot of browser.xul specific elements. See attached screenshots.

This doesn't seem to happen on all XUL windows. E.g., if I point the DOM inspector at itself, there are no extra elements.
