Steps to reproduce:

Clicked Help/About Nightly


Actual results:

No update button, even though Nightly out of date.


Expected results:

Update button or check for update button should be present.
Use cases:
* Quickly check for a problem encountered on a stable release whether it is present in the current Nightly. It is much easier with an update button instead of having to redownload from the ftp servers.
* If this change is meant for the stable release a well, it will hinder people who run Firefox a non-root/administrator to update Firefox by quickly running it with root/administrator rights.
