FirefoxView 0.31.1 Extension stop working upon installation of Spyware Doctor 3.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Both the "View this Page in Firefox" and "Open Link Target in Firefox" context
menu item available (and functioning properly) in IE5.5 with FirefoxView 0.31.1
installed in Firefox 1.0 continue to be visible in the IE 5.5 context menu but
cease to function upon subsequent installation of Spyware Doctor 3.1 even if
Spyware Doctor is never run.

Uninstalling Spyware Doctor ha no effect.

Use of GoBack to revert harddrive to time just before installation of Spyware
Doctor restores proper functioning of FirefoxView.

First time I discovered this, I had also installed CWShredder and run both CWS
and SD before noticing the problem. Reverted drive to point before both
installations. Problem solved. Reinstalled CWS. Still no problem. Ran CWS.
Still no problem. Reinstalled SD but de-selected option to have it run upon
completion of installation. Problem re-appeared at once upon completion of SD
installation even though SD had not run. Uninstalled SD. Problem persisted.
Reverted drive to point just before re-installation of SD. Problem solved again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with fully patched and updated WinMe, IE5.5, Firefox 1.0, FirefoxView
0.31.1.
2. Install but do not run Spyware Doctor 3.1 (or run it -- make no difference).
3. Attempt use of IE context menu item created by FirefoxView. (BTW, the IEView
extension seems to be unaffected.)
4. Uninstall SD.
5. Again attempt use of IE context menu item created by FirefoxView.
6. Use GoBack or equivilent to restore HD to state prior to SD installation.
7. Use IE context menu items.
Actual Results:
After installing SD, neither of the IE context menu item associated with
FirefoxView functioned although each continued to be present in the IE context
menu when expected.

Expected Results:
Use of the context menu item in question either open in Firefox the same page
already open in IE or open in Firefox the target of an HTML link on the IE page.

Also running: Zone Alarm 3.7.211; Grisoft AVG 7; Spybot S&D 1.4b2 w/ Teatimer
running; Spyware Blaster; Spyware Guard. No prior problem with FirefoxView.
