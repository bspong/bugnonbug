base href is set to target="_new". Clicking a link will open it in a new tab. another click on a different link will open the site in the same new tab and not open another one

I have created a site with <base target="_new" /> in the header. I have some link in it like this:
<a href="http://www.google.com">google</a> - <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">yahoo</a>

clicking on the google link will open a new tab which is correct. now leave it open. go back to the original site and click on the yahoo link. it will NOT open a new tab a expected but open the destination (yahoo) in the tab that wa opened before (google).

In Firefox 1.x it worked but in Firefox 2.0 it doesnt work any more.

Reproducible: Always
