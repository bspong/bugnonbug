When FF3 updated itself to Beta 3, the forward and back button from my customized toolbars were missing. I eventually found it in the default "Navigation Toolbar" (which I have hidden) so I tried to use "Customize..." menu item of the toolbar's right click menu to bring it back, but none of the widget that are already on the toolbar can be moved around. Items can be dropped in from the window that pop up however.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From FF2 (I've never had a need to customize the toolbar in FF3 Beta 1 or 2 so I'm not sure if it would work or not) and customize the toolbars a follows:
- Move all item from the Navigation Toolbar onto the Menu Toolbar
- Hide the Navigation Toolbar
2. Upgrade to FF3 Beta 3 (My first install of FF3 wa Beta 1, so you may have to go through those step a well?)
3. Note how the Back and Forward button are gone from the custom menu.
4. Show the Navigation Toolbar, and try to customize the toolbars again.
Actual Results:
You can't drag any of the button that are already present on the Toolbars around.
Items can be dragged from the "Customize Toolbar" window and unto the toolbars however.

Expected Results:
Items should be draggable even if they are already on the toolbar (similar to how FF2 worked)

Using the default theme.
