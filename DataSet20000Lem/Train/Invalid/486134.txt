Bookmarks disappear everytime I close Firefox. Same thing in the personal toolbar.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; fr; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

There wa a little problem with the bookmark I have had, when i wa still using "SpeedUp My PC" (Uniblue Software): after using the cleaning fonction of this software, Firefox didn't keep my change in the bookmark and in the personnal toolbar (e.g., delete old link, add new link in bookmark folder or in the personnal toolbar).
The only solution wa to uninstall Firefox in order to have the default settings.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
I have uninstall both "SpeedUp My PC" & Firefox; I have deleted all Firefox folders, even the hidden one, to make a complete new installation without preferences, history, cache and everything.
No problem anymore.


Don't use "SpeedUp My PC" !
