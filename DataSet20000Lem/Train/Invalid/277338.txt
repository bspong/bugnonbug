Memory Leak
Leaving Firefox on for more than 12/24 hours, and you will see your CPU
utilization rise dramatically, upwards of 75% and higher.

As you know, this is very, very serious. I'm concerned that once this becomes
known, this could be a major drag on Firefox's new found success.

Question: Why isn't this bug not prominently featured on the Mozilla main page?
You go there and it all nice and cheery a if there were no issue at all.

This is extremely serious, and I hope you are able to fix this forthwith.

Thank you.
