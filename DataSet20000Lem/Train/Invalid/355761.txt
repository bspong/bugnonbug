Middle-clicking the feed button in location bar ha no effect if there are multiple feed on the page
STR:
1. Open http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Special:Recentchanges
2. Middle-click the feed button in the location bar to open the subscription UI in a new page.

Actual results:
Nothing happens, a there are multiple feeds, which mean you're supposed to left-click the button and select one from the popup menu.

Expected results:
Either open the popup menu on middle click or just open the subscription UI and let me choose the feed in there. (Maybe pre-select a feed, a some page just send the same content in Atom and RSS and frankly I just don't care which format the feed is in.)
