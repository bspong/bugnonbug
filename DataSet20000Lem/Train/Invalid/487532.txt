The Browser Highlighter pop up window come up when accessing Firefox - doe not respond to any prompt and block Google search bar. Have uninstalled Mozilla Firefox and re-installed. No change. Annoying enough that I have to use Explorer - which I don't particularly like. Help, please, get this thing moved...!
Thanks
