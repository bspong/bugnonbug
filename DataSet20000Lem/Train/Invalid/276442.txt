CSS Property for <a> tag is being ignored by firefox, but not by IE
hi good guys,

i am using cs on an <a> tag to make it appear almost like a form-button.
everything work fine, the <a href="#" class="navigation">link</a> look like a
button and even ha the 3D-effect (border-style:outset and inset when active).

unfortunately there is an attribute which ha no effect on firefox but on IE
which is "width". i dont know if css-standards allow this property, but it
would be very nice if you would implement it.

greeting
syipisa
