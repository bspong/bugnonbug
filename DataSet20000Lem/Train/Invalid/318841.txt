It's a feature that IE ha and Firefox doesn't have.
Some forums, such a the example I gave, hold the messages' content within a span/div. Clicking on a message's title change a CSS display property from "none" to "block" to display the message content.
MSIE keep the message title in it history, so when you refresh the forum page you can see which message you have already read (they're colored a vlinks). Firefox doesn't.

I may have been kind of vague.. see the "steps to reproduce" :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the example URL (http://jafi.tapuz.co.il/tapuzforum/main/forumpage.asp?id=272)
2. Click on a message title (below the "add message" line) to view message contents.
3. Refresh.

Actual Results:
If you use MSIE the message title is colored a vlink.
If you use Firefox the message title is colored a an unvisited link.

Expected Results:
The message title to be colored a a visited link (vlink/purple)

Other people experience that too, and I don't know of any Firefox user who don't.
In addition, while the source code of my example is long and confusing, similar, simple html page that I've written produced the same problem so it's not the tapuz.co.il website's fault.
