A few minute ago, I tried to log on, and got the 403 message, telling me that I
couldn't have access because spyware or a virus wa sending you automated
messages. Since I keep that stuff up to date, I suspected my Anonymizer
service. Sure enough, that wa it. With Anonyimizer turned off, there is no
problem, but with it turned on, I get the message. Also, with the product on,
when I go to Google.com, I get a page that look normal EXCEPT, there is a
second button under the search box, labeled "I'm feeling lucky". I'm sure you
know what Anonymizer is, so can contact them to get this resolve.d

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to log onto Mozilla/Google home page with Anonymizer turned on
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Got the 403 message

Expected Results:
Your software is OK. I am just telling you the likely source of a problem you
are experiencing - bombardment with automated messages, and other potential
problems, coming from the Anonymizer service.
