FATAL ERROR : The dynamic C library contained in the extension file could not be found
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

I updated my Firefox 5 to the release build yesterday (found on the ftp server then). Today I updated to the final release hoping that would fix it.

I'm on Windows 7 64bit with OS updated and everything.

I have no idea how to get rid of this happening. It doesn't seem to affect how Firefox work though, but is very irritating.


Actual results:

Every time I start FF6 it automatically open a new tab with the page: http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/no_tidy_lib.html. It also happens when I open a saved session using the Session Manager plugin, often 2-3 tab with the same page.

The page says: FATAL ERROR : The dynamic C library contained in the extension file could not be found.
