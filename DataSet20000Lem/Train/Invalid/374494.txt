When trying to use Firefox with the extension MayhemEx Firefox cause the OSX Window Server to crasch and bring down the computer.
The extension add function to use with the website www.genmay.net, and place a context menu in the status bar.
When clicking the status bar icon the menu briefly show and then dissappears again. After clicking the menu a couple of time the crash occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click context menu that the extension place in the status bar. Menu will flash briefly and dissappear. Clicking a number of time trigger the crash.
2. Crash can also occur after just surfing a minute or two, and when accessing www.genmay.net
Actual Results:
Computer UI freeze completely, the window server crashes.

Expected Results:
Context menu should appear normally and allow for setting the extension preferences.

This extension work fine on Firefox on Windows. I have tried it on two Macs (one Power Mac G5, Firefox 2.0.0.2 - and one MacBook Pro with Firefox 2.0.0.1) with the same result (the crashing).

The extension is available here: http://mayhemex.theintarweb.net/
