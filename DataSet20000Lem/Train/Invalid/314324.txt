Since my mozilla autmatically updated to the latest deer-park release I am having problem with page that contain input-fields.

If I use e.g. google and search & use the search input field for some time it sometimes doe not respond anymore, no matter wether I press "ENTER" to start a search or to press the "search" button.
The only way to make the reacting again is to close the tab and re-open the site, only oading another page and going back / reloading doesnt work too.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.google.at/search?hl=de&q=heise.de&btnG=Google-Suche&meta=
2. do some seraches, just change some char and re-search
3. sometimes the textfield is not responding anymore
Actual Results:
textfields stay editable but pressing enter / search-button doesn't do anything anymore.

Expected Results:
work like in FF-1.0
