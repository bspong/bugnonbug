The about:config Page should modify user.js first (if required) then modify prefs.js .
In the Directory (on WinXP) 'C:\Documents and Settings\"LOGIN NAME"\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\"Profile Name"\' we have a file named "prefs.js" and we MIGHT also have one named "user.js".

When I use the about:config Page to modify a value that ha been set in user.js then the about:config Page DOES show that it ha been modified when in fact it EITHER ha not OR is not permanent.

I wa wondering if it were File Permissions but I found that if I modify user.js in a Text Editor then the Value is modified AND is permanent.


The about:config Page should modify user.js first (if required) then modify prefs.js so that the modification 'takes' and we get the expected result.
