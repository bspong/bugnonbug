"Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system." - This is the pop-up appearing whenever I click the Firefox Icon to open the browser and hence preventing to let it open. Internet Explorer is however working.
I believe this ha started after recent installation of the automated Window update! I tried by restarting the PC, reinstalling the firefox3.5 - but did not work. Please Help
