As workaround for bug 415039 I've considered manually adding/moving the "Home" button from bookmark toolbar to navigation toolbar. However, clicking "Customize" on the navigation toolbar doe not offer the "Home" button for being added.

Proposed solution:
"Home" button should be available a button to be added to navigation toolbar.

Reproducible: Always
