While trying to open certain web page (problem doe not exist while navigating
between page of the same site, but only when navigating to new sites), I
receive one of several similar error messages, generally stating that the page
cannot be found. This problem will occur with site of known reliability (such
a google.com) just a often a others. The problem began only after I upgraded
from Firefox 1.01 to 1.02. Sometimes a page will open only if opened within a
blank tab; other time the browser refuse to open ANY page. This latter problem
is usually remedied only by restarting the browser several times, or by
restarting the computer. I am fairly certain this is not an issue with my
internet connection, a other program continue to function normally (IM, IRC,
etc.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I can reproduce the problem on my own computer, but I do not know how or if it
can be reproduced on another computer.

Actual Results:
Error looking up the specified page. In the status display in the bottom left,
it read "Looking up DOMAIN.org" until it display the error.

Expected Results:
It should have navigated to the web page a expected.

I have Verizon 10 Mbps DSL.
