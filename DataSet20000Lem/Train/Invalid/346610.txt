Your update completely stopped Mozilla from working
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 1.5.05

After running the update (1.5.05), I found that I can't browse anywhere with FireFox.

I used to love Firefox, and I thought Internet Explorer sucked, but you guy take the cake. And to make me go through all the ridiculous BS (establish an account, log in, research the bug) so I can report a problem?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Try to browse
3. Nothing
4. Restart Windows.
5. Start FireFox
6. Can't browse
7. Byebye FireFox
