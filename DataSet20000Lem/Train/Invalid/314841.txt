There are a few thing that stop me from switching from Safari to Firefox and I thought that I should enumerate them a it seems that I am not the only one with these feeling from feedback so I'll go ahead and list them out for you:

A) Native spell checking like unto Safari's, not the way extension are currently doing it. It must be like Safari and tap into the User's customized dictionary.
B) Image drag and drop need to be such that it drag like Safari's, not an outline of a box, there is something that make this detract very much from Firefox.
C) widget and button should use Mac OS X native widget to carry over the feel and experience.
D) All cocoa keybindings should be functional, ie ctr-a-> beginning of line, ctr-e-> end of line, etc.
E) Details should be fixed, such a the lower right corner the widget for resizing the window ha a white border around it, it should not be when other theme such a Iridium are applied. It appears that the UI is simply not sized properly there. I see issue like this in other part of the UI a well.
F) Use information from Address Book such a the user's email address, physical address, phone, name, etc. to fill in fields.
G) Build in a function to save browsing session upon crash or close without an extension.
H) A controversial function, but other developer are looking at doing this with gecko and webkit so you could be one up on it if you would implement it; that is to integrate a webkit rendering of page a well right into Firefox such that a user can right click on a page and select to render a KHTML or WebKit. This would be handy for developer especially and would not be overly difficult to implement.

Reproducible: Always
