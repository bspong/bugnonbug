There are page of interest which do rather rarely update. However, drooling
around and checking every few day whether there ha been an update or not is
pretty tiresome.
What would be extremely nice would be an option to monitor a bookmark for a
change: If selected, the current page ha to be saved somewhere by Firebird. Now
every few day (should be adjustable), Firebird automatically (or triggered
manually, where Firebird could give the user a hint) look at that page in the
background (without opening it) and check whether the html ha been changed.
This will not work for page like news-sites, but it may be cool for all those
other page that only update once in a while and of which a user want to stay
updated of. Eg. www.mozilla.org, www.kde.org, etc.
