All go well until partway through install when GUI says:
Fatal error [-618]; Couldn't open xpistub library.
and on CLI from which installer launched:

DLError: libxpcom.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Tried re-downloading installer (though tar hadn't complained on unpacking it
first time) and got exactly the same problem.
