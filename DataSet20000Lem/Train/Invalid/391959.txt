Hi everyone!

I've noticed that some page do not finish off loading
(i.e. load completely but not at all and I have to wait for some sec after it finish off)

some of them are:

www.9down.com
www.athinorama.gr/cinema
www.contra.gr

Tested with safe mode, same problem there too,
load ok with fx 2.0.0.6.

Try them yourself.
