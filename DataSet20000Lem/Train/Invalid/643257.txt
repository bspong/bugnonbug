Firefox 4 RC2 work incorrect with Bartab extension.
It load content of tab not after activating.
It load content only after reaload button is pressed. Please fix it.

Please, don't tell me, that browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs 0 is enough, and Bartab is not needed. Bartab functional is bigger. Main functional of Bartab is unloading already opened tab from memory (and auto unloading). Also Bartab show which tab is already loaded, and which is not. Sorry, English is not my native language.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Bartab extention, and open 2-5 tab with content.
2. Restart firefox.
3. Try to activate a tab, which is not active now. You will see that the tab don't want to load. It will be loaded only after reload button is pressed by user.


Expected Results:
Firefox must load a tab immediately, when user activates the tab.

In firefox 3.5-3.6 Bartab work correctly.
