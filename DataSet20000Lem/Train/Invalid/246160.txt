Import:"Finish" or "Import" before the actual operation, not "Next"

File - Import ha 2 screen where the user selects what she want to import.
On the 2nd screen, after "Next", the import is done.
I would expect either
- adding a 3rd screen "You have selected a,b,c to be imported from <this
browser>. Click Finish to continue", or
- Calling the "Next" button "Import" or "Finish".
A button called "Next" might suggest there's more decision to make before the
actual import.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. File - Import
2. Select browser - Next
3. Select item - Next

Actual Results:
The import is done

Expected Results:
Show me another screen before import
