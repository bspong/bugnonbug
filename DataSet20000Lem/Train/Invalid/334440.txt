I try to open Firefox and my system seems to work but doesn't open a browser window. In task manager > process firefox.exe is listed and using around 17000k, but cannot find any way to use the brower. Tried reinstalling, did nothing. Just installed an old version I had on my computer, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4, and it seems to be working fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on icon or link to open firefox
2.Wait
3.It never opens, but appears open in process

Actual Results:
Can't do it right now, a I have the old version running, but tried multiple time with the same result.

Expected Results:
A brower open and work a it had before

I ran a complete virus scan with AVG, full system scan with Ad-aware, and a system check with norton,restarted and reinstalled multiple times. Everything seemed to come out okay and it didn't work, so I tried installing the old version. I had the dictionary extension and the tabbed browsing option extension installed recently, but it worked fine after doing that. I said critical, because it just won't work
