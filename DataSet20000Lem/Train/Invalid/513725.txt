If Firefox crash during a private session, when it come back up, the main (non-private) session is restored. So any work done during the private browsing session is lost.

Honestly, without some kind of encryption, I'm not sure of a safe way to handle this, since private browsing, by definition, should not record anything. But still, an annoying problem.

Reproducible: Always
