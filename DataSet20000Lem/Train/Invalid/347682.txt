While the new theme look nice on XP, it look absolutely out of place on 'XP with classic theme'/2000/98 etc. Quite a few corporations/individuals use 2000/NT and even XP with classic theme, so we are looking at a large audience here. IMHO since the icon on toolbar a well a the Go/Search button have been polished in the new theme, we should look at adding a background for the Toolbars (Menu/Navigation/Bookmark/Status Bars) & the Tab Bar so that Firefox look consistent across all Window versions, instead of looking great on XP but really out of place on other version (including XP with Classic theme).

Reproducible: Always
