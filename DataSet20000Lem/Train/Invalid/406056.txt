Firefox Mozilla (Firefox 2.0.0.10) stop responding when I attempt to go to some pages. The URL www.milagrohousing.org is an example. I have tried to go to this page with Firefox up in safe mode -- it still hang up. If I go to this same page in MS Internet Explorer there is no problem. This URL is just one example. This same problem happens to me at least twice a day. The only solution I have is to bring Firefox down (the stop button only result in a 'not responding' message) and then restart Firefox. In all case where I have been hung up, the same site in Explorer worked fine.

Reproducible: Always
