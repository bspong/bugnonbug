When I press Ctrl+C keyboard combination in MS Windows, text is not copied a it did in Firefox before 1.5 RC1. I upgraded to RC2, and still experience the same bug. I only experience this problem on regular web page text. the combination work fine in text boxes, and other form input items.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select any text (not in a text box, but in regular page text).
2. Press CTRL+C on the keyboard.
3. Try to paste into a text entry field, or into any outside Windows application that receives text.

Actual Results:
Nothing happens (or older clipboard text is pasted instead).

Expected Results:
The selected text that wa supposed to be copied should have been pasted.
