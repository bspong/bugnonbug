Cannot clear appcache

I played with the application cache (appcache, cache manifets) and I managed to put my Firefox 4 in a state, where it always load the site from the cache. Nothing I have tried ha remedy this:
- I removed the manifest="" from the html file, but Firebug show it being there
- I put the manifest back, it didn't affect anything
- I have cleared my cache (Clear Recent History/Cookies+cache+active logins/time range:everything) many time during this, it hasn't affected anything.
- I have refreshed the page a lot, restarted the browser a lot, no help.

I think I may have to do uninstall/install until the situation is fixed.

The site that I did this is on my local computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Define cache manifest
2. Play with it until it break :)
