"Launch Firefox Now" button launch Firefox a an elevated process
At the end of the installer if you have "Launch Firefox Now" checked on, it will start Firefox a an elevated process.

Running Firefox a an elevated process can lead to a lot of problems, for example, add-on would have access to compromise a system. It's not a huge deal because it's the same a the security in Windows XP and below, but a of Vista Windows changed it expectation on administrative accounts.

Expected behavior:
- If the user is an administrator:
It should use the associated unelevated token to launch Firefox.
- If the user is a limited user and installing via elevated administrator:
It should use the limited account user token, not the administrator who agreed to install.
- If the user is a limited user, and installs without elevating, I think it is alraedy working fine.
