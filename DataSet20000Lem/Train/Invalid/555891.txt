When scrolling around in the little map preview of Google Maps, the little map doesn't change location properly and becomes completely off-sync with the main map.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the URL I provided.
2. Go to the bottom right of the Google Maps screen and click the arrow there to expand the little preview map (if it's already open, ignore the step). It will be to the right of the "Report a problem" text.
3. Start dragging the "blue box" that is inside of the preview to move the map.
4. After you drag it for about 5 second in one direction to attempt to change the view of the preview, let go of the box to allow the main map to update.
Actual Results:
The main map and the preview box are now completely off-sync very badly once you have let go of the "blue box".

Expected Results:
The main map and the preview box should have been synced once you have let go of the "blue box".

The only way to fix this is to zoom in/out and then back to the zoom you were using to get the preview box to re-sync with the main map.

This problem started happening a few week ago (when I wa still using 3.6) before 3.6.2 wa released. This problem also happens in IE8 (both 32bit and 64bit versions).

So, it seems that Google did something to the map that broke it in both browsers. This is really annoying because I use that little preview box A LOT to move the map around to location I need it in. The weird thing is that if you move the map in the main view and not the little preview box, the preview box will stay synced once you stop moving the main map window.

One other thing, I also tested this in 3.7a3 and it wa present there a well.
