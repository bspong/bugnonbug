Do you want Firefox to save your tab for the next time it starts?
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

This function doe not appear to be functioning properly. It prompt me every time I close Firefox, but if I choose to "Save and Quit," the next time Firefox is started, I get nothing but a blank browser. The tab that were "saved" don't reopen nor do my home pages. And there's nothing in the history. I have to hit the home button to open my home pages. If I choose not to save the open tab when closing, then the next time I restart, the home page open just fine. However, just to clarify, the home page are not the issue. The issue is that the save tab for next restart is not functioning, no matter what site I am on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open random site in tab
2.Close firefox and choose to "save and quit" when prompted
3.Reopen firefox and NO page open, not even home page
Actual Results:
Blank browser window after restarting

Expected Results:
I expected my tab that were open when I closed Firefox to reopen
