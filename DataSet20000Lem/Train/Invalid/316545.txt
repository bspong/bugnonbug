Low priority one here, guys, because it seems to be just this particular conferencing package which fails. Nearly everything else work for me via Mozilla. If you go to emdeon.conferencing.com and click participant, the site doe a series of tests. Mozilla pass all of them but the "browser test." I've done a full copy-and-paste of the error under the actual result section below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://emdeon.conferencing.com
2. Click Participant
3. Note the failure of the first test.
Actual Results:
A red box which says, "failed!" and:
