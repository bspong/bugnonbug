Location bar auto complete ha the option to show either history, bookmarks, both or none.
If you don't have history checked, active tab will not be listed in the auto complete.

I want to show bookmark and active tab but not history. This is not possible.

(Also, is there any way to prioritize tab in the auto complete so they always come above bookmarks?)

Reproducible: Always
