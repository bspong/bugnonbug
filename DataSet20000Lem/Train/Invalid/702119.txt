Downloads deleted from the Downloads window still show up in Library
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Downloads window (Ctrl+J).
2. Click on a completed download.
3. Press Del to delete the download from the list.
4. Open the Library (Ctrl+Shift+B).
5. Click on Downloads in the tree to the left.

The download that wa just deleted from the Downloads window is still present in the Library, which is not what I would expect.
