When more than 1 tab contains the same animated gif, which is pretty common a
in the signature portion of any bb forum, they both (i guess) show the same
instance of the gif and closing one of the tab stop the gif from playing in
all other tab that contain it.
(If they are in 2 different windows, OK if I close one of the windows, but not
if I close the tab in one of the windows)
(btw, they shouldn't be playing the same frame if I open them at different time
- a different bug?)
(Not sure though about other embeded object like avi, rm, mp3...)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an animated gif, locally or on the internet
2. Open it again on another tab
3. Close 1 of the tab

Actual Results:
The animated gif on the tab stop playing

Expected Results:
The animated gif should keep playing (animating)
