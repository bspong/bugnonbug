When I modify the web site for update and I select two check boxes, both
“Display an alert” and “Open web page in a new window”, a a notification
message, I realize that CANCEL button, close button, or Alt+ F4 on the message
window doe not function properly. Even if I click Cancel button, it show the
web page; therefore, I believe that combination of the check box creates this
situation.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add the web site in the Bookmarks that Fire fox will notify you when this site
changes.
2.Open the Bookmarks Manager->Properties after selecting the site.
3.Modify the setting in “Schedule” Tab.
4.After that, in “Notify” Tab, select two notifications, both “Display an alert”
and “Open web page in a new window”.
5.Click OK button.
6.Click CANCEL button when Fire fox notifies you the site changes.
7.Finally, the web site is open even if you click CANCEL, close button, or Alt+F4.
Actual Results:
Clicking the CANCEL button, close button, or Alt+F4, the web page is opened when
Fire fox notifies you that the site changes.


Expected Results:
Clicking the CANCEL button, close button, or Alt+F4, the web page should not be
opened when Fire fox notifies you that the site changes.

Additionally, when I remove or delete the scheduled web page from the Bookmarks,
I still receive the same notification message.
