Unexpected doubleclick selection behaviour on Linux

Steps to reproduce:

Doubleclicking current URL on the awesome bar act wrong. Ie. if I doubleclick on the word "programming" on http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/, the whole URL get selected.

On other platform (Windows, OSX) the word between /s would get selected with the first doubleclick. On Linux the whole URL get selected. On the other platform subsequential doubleclick would select the whole URL.



Expected results:

This is bad for usability a the other platform act differently. Also, other browser on Linux platform select the one word only with the first doubleclick. Firefox act differently from other applications, which is unexpected behaviour.
