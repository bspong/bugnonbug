Was developing a page that had two frames. Mistakenly, each frame wa
attempting to set the focus using javascript, when the frameset loaded. This
would cause firefox to lock up completely.

Tried it with several other people, and they all had the same problem when going
to this page in firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Firefox would hang. Sometimes it would crash, but most time it would just lock up.

Expected Results:
Probably, it should have set the focus to whatever frame loaded last.
