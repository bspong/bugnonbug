I have two different free hit counter on this page: from GoStats.com and the eXTReMe-tracker (http://www.extreme-dm.com/tracking/) which both display properly their graphic in IExplorer, but no picture come up in Firefox 1.5.0.2. Both counter code use Javascript for the hit tracking.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load the page
2.--
3.--

Actual Results:
I've enabled every Java option in Firefox, but only the alias text show up, no counter pictures. They do count, though, all Firefox versions, a I see in the statistics. There is no error message about the counter in the Javascript console, just a lot complaint about "unknown scrollbar properties".

Expected Results:
I would want to have the counter picture displayed. The eXTReMe tracker should show the purple ball and the GoStats display the hit number with brass-and-black number pictures.

I can see from the counter statistics, that Firefox show up a browser more frequently, replacing Netscape. E.g. the us for the ref. site: MSIE6 66.10%; Firefox1.5 12.71%; Safari 9.32%; Firefox1 6.78%; Mozilla1 1.69%; AOL9 0.85%; MSIE5 0.85%; Netscape7 0.85%; Firefox0.x 0.85%.
As webdesigner I want my page to look good in ALL common browsers. Difficult task.
