Our server is configured to redirect http://m.locle.com to http://dev.locle.com. This work on Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome and Opera.

On this new "minefield" version of Firefox, we are being redirected to http://eircom.locle.com. This is a valid subdomain on the server, but not the subdmain that m.locle.com is supposed to be redirecting to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type http://m.locle.com into the address bar
2. Click enter
3. You will be redirected (incorrectly) to http://eircom.locle.com
