JavaScript child-to-parent-to-child frame reference doesn't work in a for/next loop.
User-Agent: Opera/6.0 (Windows 2000; U) [en]

I made a page with 7 frames, like this:

<frameset rows="23,7,7,7,7,7,15" border="1" framespacing="0">
<frame src="tstFooPlaceholder.htm" scrolling="no" name="TopFrame">
<frame src="tstFoo.htm" scrolling="no" name="Frame1">
<frame src="tstFoo.htm" scrolling="no" name="Frame2">
<frame src="tstFoo.htm" scrolling="no" name="Frame3">
<frame src="tstFoo.htm" scrolling="no" name="Frame4">
<frame src="tstFoo.htm" scrolling="no" name="Frame5">
<frame src="tstFooValidate.htm" scrolling="no" name="BottomFrame">
</frameset>

tstFoo.htm ha one <input type="text" /> field in it. In the real world, it's actually a file input field where people can choose file to upload, but this is just my quick and dirty test code to verify the bug.

So I have 5 instance of tstFoo.htm in frame 1 to 5. The page in the top frame doesn't do anything, and the page in the bottom frame (tstFooValidate.htm) ha a 'GO' button and some JavaScript code that iterates the content of each instance of tstFoo.htm and tell u the value of each text field foo.htm (there's only 1). Works fine in IE 5.5 or Opera version 6 or 7.

Here is the JavaScript code:

<script language="JavaScript">
function GoValidate() {
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
// Seems to be this line that doesn't work in FireFox:
// (although it work in Opera and IE)
var sVal = parent.frames[i].frmFoo.txtFoo.value;
// show me:
alert ("sVal = " + sVal);

} // next i
} // end function

</script>

The Firefox JavaScript Console tell me:

Error: parent.frames[i].frmFoo ha no property
Source File: http://192.168.0.101/phptest/tstFooValidate.htm
Line: 14

That's this line:
var sVal = parent.frames[i].frmFoo.txtFoo.value;

I don't think so. My JavaScript book ('JavaScript Bible, Gold Edition' by Danny Goodman) tell me that that syntax is a valid and legal way to address frame in a child->parent->other child relationship (plus it work in those other browsers).

Is it perhaps not interpreting 'i' properly? Shouldn't that JavaScript Console error message instead say:

Error: parent.frames[1].frmUpload ha no property

For thoroughness, I should also report that the JavaScript Console show an additional error, thus:

Error: syntax error
Source File: http://wpad/wpad.dat Line: 207
Source Code: <HTML>

I have no idea what that means, but if I click on the http://wpad/wpad.dat link, I see:

<HTML>
<HEAD><TITLE>500 Server Error</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Server Error</H1>
<H4>
The following error occurred:<P>
[code=SERVER_RESPONSE_RESET] The server response could not be read because of an error. Contact your system administrator.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a stack of frame with multiple instance of 1 htm file in frame 1 - 5
2. Write JavaScript loop to reference parent.frames[i].formName.Input.value
3. where i = 1 to 5

Actual Results:
Firefox doe not loop through the frames, show error in JavaScript Console:
Error: parent.frames[i].formName ha no property


Expected Results:
My idea is that it should have evaluated 'i' and didn't. Reason I think this is because the same JavaScript code shown above work fine if I remove the stack of frame and the for/next loop, and the parent.frames[i] reference.

I do not use themes. If you want me to send my test htm files, I'll be happy to do that.

I have to add that I'm highly impressed with Firefox. Good work! One thing that I do miss is Opera's F2 key (open new link)...
