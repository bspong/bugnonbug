"CTRL + drag tab" no longer duplicate tab + state, instead open up new tab with same URL
Since tab animation landed and the new dumb and unwanted behavior of duplicating tab (bug 675438), the tab actually don't get duplicated anymore at all.
Instead of tab duplication - the browser now just open a similar tab. That's absolutely not the same a duplication.
