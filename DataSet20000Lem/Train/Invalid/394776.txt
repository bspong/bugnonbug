This isn't really restricted to any specific site, just all my bookmarked sites. Just noticed this in the last week or so. Only change I have made recently is HTML Total Validation add-on, plus installing Netscape and Opera browser so I can check my webpages. I have changed my resolution a few time to see what my page look like at different screen sizes, but I have always changed it back to my regular resolution (800 x 600...I only have a 15" screen). I do not have this problem in IE, Netscape or Opera, so I have been using them. Liking Netscape...it ha tab too. I doublechecked to make sure I have the right version, and even reinstalled version 2.0.0.6. If I type in the site's address directly, it come up okay...only the bookmark are affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on bookmarked item
2.or go to page from an application (like Webshots or Mail2World)
3.
Actual Results:
the image on the site are half what they should be. Since many time they are thumbnail to begin with, the image are incredibly small and the text on any image are illegible.

Expected Results:
Produced a regular webpage a usual, with full-sized images.

I have not changed any of my addons since I have had them for over a year now. Only the HTML Total validation addon is new to the Firefox application, and I deleted it. But I still have the problem with the bookmarked sites. I wa reading where some problem came up because of conflict with Adblock, but I've had Adblock since the beginning.
