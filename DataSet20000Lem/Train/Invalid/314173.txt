Problem occurs with version 1.0.7 and 1.6a1 on my linux. Couple of friend tested the page, some XP firefoxes crashed others didn't.

I found that java script on web site which keep crashing my browser and I track down various java script includes which ended to code block which is on my home page. I don't why script is being wrote but it seems to cause problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click url http://personal.inet.fi/atk/kerolasa/evil4firefox.html
2. Wait for crash, with my slow box it take 10 seconds.

Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, X window lost icons, toolbar etc and X must be restarted.

Expected Results:
Perhaps stop running java script before it break browser. After all that seems to be mostly useless script, so it should not matter if it not ran till end.
