The build session wa problem-less

I have multiple problem with it only when i use it.
I have the problem both with KDE AND with Xfce

- The window doe not close if i click the "cross" button to close the window .
To close FireFox, i need to "File -> Quit"

- I cannot download file correctly. If i try to download by left-clicking a
tar.gz file, nothing happens . I need to "right-click -> save ... "

- If i have a form (on a web page) that suggest me to Browse my filesytem (when
i want to updload a picture) , hitting the "browse" button ha no effect .

- password management make the Hard drive to work heavily during one minute or
more ( i think it is a kind of swapping ... because kswapd is taking significant
CPU % when it doe it )

I give you my .mozconfig file content :
CC=gcc
CXX=g++
CPP=cpp
AS=as
LD=ld
ac_add_options --disable-composer
ac_add_options --disable-debug
ac_add_options --disable-ldap
ac_add_options --disable-mailnews
ac_add_options --disable-tests
ac_add_options --enable-crypto
ac_add_options --enable-strip
ac_add_options --enable-strip-libs
export MOZ_PHOENIX=1
mk_add_options MOZ_PHOENIX=1

My system :
Linux 2.4
GTK2 2.0
XFree 4.3 / Xfce 4.0.3 ( environment )
I also had KDE 3.1.5 before .
gcc/g++ 3.3.3
Firefox 2004-04-10 CVS
