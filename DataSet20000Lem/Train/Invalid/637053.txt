Hi,
it look like there's any possibility to adjusting setting for playback of html5 audio and video content.

For exmaple, to tell Firefox to use a certain audiodevice, or maybe PulseAudio on Linux, for the audio output. Or in which Firefox render html5 video (Hardware Acceleration, OpenGL, X11-Videorendering, XV-Videorendering).

This already caused me some problem when changing my Linux to pulse audio.
And now I'm experiencing heavy performance problem on video page of the german news website www.tagesschau.de.
For example at this video:

I'd like to try some videosettings. But there seems to be no possibility to adjust those settings.
For the certain problem of www.tagesschau.de -> Those only seem to appear on Linux (more exactly openSUSE 11.3 using an Ati video card). I tried it on a computer and a notebook (both having Ati cards).
On Windows everything work fine, having a good video performance. I didn't test it using other linux distributions.

Could you add some way to change video settings? Maybe using the about:config page?

Thanks
