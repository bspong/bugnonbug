This happens every time. Whenever I go to pcgalore.com Firefox hangs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type "pcgalore.com" in address bar.
Actual Results:
Firefox hangs.

Expected Results:
The pcgalore.com website should load.

This is a new Windows XP installation. The web page load fine in IE7. I have not tried to reproduce this problem with Firefox 2.0. Is it possible to install FF2 along side FF3?
