Hi folks, I'm having a hard time with firefox. It just updated and I'm suddenly having problem where my comp shuts down due to CPU overheating. I have diagnostic program that help monitor and maintain (infact, these are the program shuting the comp off to protect it). I'm watching my CPU temp, and when I start firefox, it suddenly start increasing uncontrolably. I disabled all of my add-on (no change). The problem seems to be with streaming video when played on firefox. The temp increase but stabilizes watching video on other browsers. watching video on firefox (right now), CPU keep getting hotter.
