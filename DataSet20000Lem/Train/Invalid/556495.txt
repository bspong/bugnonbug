After Firefox upgraded to 3.6.2, my bookmark disapeared. I tried to restore them which wa successful. After closing firefox, they disapeared. After trying numerous times, they would either load and disapear or a message would come up saying "Unable to load backup file". I have tried using safemode, restarting the computer, and deleting/recreating a new profile. The bookmark will sometimes load, then disapear mid session. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox with the same result. This also happens on an alterative machine with a different set of backup bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Bookmarks
2.Organise Bookmarks
3.Import and backup -> choose file
4. Find and select file
5. Fail :(
Actual Results:
The message appeared telling me the backup file could not be loaded. I restarted my computer, followed the above step and the bookmark appeared UNTIL I opened a seocnd tab, and they disapeared from both.

Expected Results:
Reloaded my bookmark and left them there!
