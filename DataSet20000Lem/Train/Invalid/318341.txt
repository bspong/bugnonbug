during installation, the EULA for version 1.5 refers to version 1.1.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50215; Avalon 6.0.5070; WinFX RunTime 3.0.50215; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

I would classify this a critical, given that it likely invalidates the EULA

Reproducible: Didn't try




the EULA should be for version 1.5
