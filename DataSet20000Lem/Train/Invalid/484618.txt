Option privacy.sanitize.promptOnSanitize no longer work
The setting privacy.sanitize.promptOnSanitize no longer seems to work. I always set this to false. I loved being able to Ctrl+Shift+Del and have everything cleaned up without a prompt. It's great when somebody arrives and you want to quietly clear the private data. I hope this option can be restored for those who want it. I don't mind removing it from the GUI, because I keep my personal prefs in user.js.
