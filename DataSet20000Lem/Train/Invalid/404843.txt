When using the new Star to bookmark a page, it is not automatically added to any useful bookmark folder. It is added to an "All Bookmarks" folder which isn't displayed anywhere in the Bookmarks menu or the Places Organizer (Bookmark manager).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any webpage
2. Click the Star at the right side of the address bar
3. Look for the link in Bookmarks menu
Actual Results:
The bookmark only show up under the dynamically generated bookmark folder which are 3 layer deep by default. These dynamically generated list allow starred page to "fall off" after adding more or allowing time to pass, effectively losing the bookmark.

Expected Results:
The bookmark should be added by default to the main bookmark list, displayed in the bookmark menu and organizer.
