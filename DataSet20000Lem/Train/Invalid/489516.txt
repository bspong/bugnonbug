I load it, it hang for about 3 minute before loading. Then on the page that took about a second to load in 3.0.8, it take between 20 second and a minute to load the pages. When I click form links, it only work about half the time.

Please tell me how I can downgrade back to 3.0.8, which wa working fine. I need to turn off this auto-install. With each update, Firefox seems to be getting worse and worse. This one simply doe not work on my machine. :-(

Expected Results:
