Every time I manually open a new tab using Ctrl-T, I receive the "You've opened a new tab" screen. When I try to prevent this from displaying again, a Javascript Application window pop up with the ReferenceError message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Pres Ctrl-T
2.Check box "Don't show this page again"
3.Click "Close"
Actual Results:
Javascript Application window pop up with the following message -

ReferenceError: DTFox is not defined

Expected Results:
I expected the software to show a blank tab and never show the new tab screen the next time I press Ctrl-T

After clicking "OK" in the pop up window, I get a blank tab and can continue browsing without further problem until I press Ctrl-T again.
