I get this error when i try to go to the next page. Foe ex.I'm on http://www.rlslog.net/ site and when i click next page, sometimes i get the error
"Problem Loading Page The server at .... is taking too long to respond."
It happens every time but to diffrent pages. Sometimes i can reach the 3'th page or 4'th page, but after that it happens again. And there are 7-8 site on my bookmark site list where i get this error. And one more thing. Sometimes Firefox it look like the page is fully loaded but are mising the photo (not fully loaded the page).Sometimes even clicking on a link it take to long to load that page or i get the same error.
I use only 3 add-ons, and i try without add-ons. The same story.
The other browser works.
Ok. That's all. Excuse my bad english and i hope that you understand what is my problem.Tks.
