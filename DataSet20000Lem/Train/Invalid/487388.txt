A really bizarre interaction between two unrelated sites.

Whilst listening to Rachmaninov's piano concerto number 2 mvt 2 on YouTube and also playing Pacman on neave.com, upon "eating a ghost" the YouTube playback pauses. (And no - YouTube hadn't just run out of buffered content to playback.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gesnsp4XOvo and wait for plenty of the video to be buffered before beginning playback.

2. In another tab, visit http://www.neave.com/games/pacman/, click "Play Pacman", "Yes I Understand" then "Play Game".

3. Eat one of the large flashing white dot then eat one of the ghost (whilst it's still flashing).
Actual Results:
The music playing on YouTube stops.

Expected Results:
The music playing on YouTube should continue.
