I first noticed it on Amazon.com when I wa searching with a given string, I
received a zillion results. I tried to refine the search by adding an
additional string into the search field, and wa unable to do it. When i
refreshed the page, I could type the form field. If i let it sit a little
while, it becomes unresponsive. I haven't had this problem in the past 2 or 3
week of using firebird, or I just haven't noticed. Today it ha become very
apparent.
