Firefox - Excessively high utilisation of CPU and memory

On MS 'Shut Down'or 'Log Off' Firefox doe not seem to terminate normally and ha to be 'killed' with Task Manager which still take a while. May be processor bound - possibly linked to another fault (why I'm reporting both here) that when the PC is left unattended with Firefox running for an extended period, it becomes processor bound at 98-100% usage, together with memory utilisation of .8Gb.

Doesn't seem related to any particular website a happens when different one are being used.

Reproducible: Sometimes



Expected Results:
Normal tidy closedown, normal system response time.

Just happened again, terminated and restarted Firefox CPU now low and memory .1Gb. Seems generic, so I wa hoping you were already aware and could advise.

I'm a private user not using any really sophisticated features. Couldn't think what diagnostics I could get.

Only thing i can think is might be if an Add-On is malfunctioning in the background. I have AddBlock+, British English Dictionary, ColorfulTabs, CoolPreview, Dictionnaire Hunspell en Francais, DownloadStatus Bar, FisheyeTabs, Fission,Flagfox,foxLing, Google Toolbar for Firefox,Javaquickstarter, PDF Download, SkypeExtension for Firefox, WOT and XMarks. Haven't tried removing them systematically yet.
