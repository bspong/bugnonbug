My recently loaded firefox is identified a 1.0
1. I would like the option of viewing all bookmark a in Explorer with the
'unfoldered' bookmark coming AFTER not alphabetically amongst the folders. I
create them quickly and them sort them afterwards.
2. If I wish to put bookmark into the correct forler on creation, it would be
nice to identify the forder name by mean of using the first letter of each
folder and subfolder, perhaps with a prefix such a ctrl.
3. To 'upgrade' can I just overwrite or do I have to go through the pain of
deleting first?
