URL Location Bar forgets previously visited URLs if browser is unused for a couple of week

I just returned from vacation (4 weeks) and opened up a Firefox window only to
find that the URL Location Bar autocomplete history had been zapped and there
were no URLs that Firefox could autocomplete. Is this by design? What governs
this expiry of cached autocomplete entries? This doesn't seem to affect
form-field autocomplete entries.
