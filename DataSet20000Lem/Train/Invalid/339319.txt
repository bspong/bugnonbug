NSIS installer doe not work on trunk build
Is the NSIS installer suposed to be working on the trunk now?

When I do my own builds, a firefox-3.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe file is creaded in dist/sea.

However, attemtping to execute it result in a pop-up saying "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item."
