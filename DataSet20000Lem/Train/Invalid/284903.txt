I had to install Yahoo Toolbar for Mozilla for each user separately.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create separate user account in Windows Xp/2000
2. Login and install the Yahoo Toolbar for Mozilla/Firfox with the first account
3. Login again using second account.\
4. Start Firefox application
5. The Yahoo toolbar is missing.




Anyway to avoid this. I had to install this for each member of my family separately.
