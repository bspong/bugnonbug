Bad merge of tab/window prefs can lead to Options UI showing wrong setting
This came up in #firefox, from a user who prefers window to tabs. They found that target="_blank" link were opening in new tab in Firefox 2, despite the UI saying they would open in a new window. They'd previously had this set up to their satisfaction in 1.5.0.x, and weren't using any extensions.

Steps to reproduce:
1, Create a new profile with Firefox 1.5
2, Set "Open link from other apps" to new window, and "Force link to open ..." to new window
3, verify that the image at the URL load in new window
4, load profile with Firefox 2
5, click on image again

Expected results:
Image load in new window

Actual results:
Image load in new tab, but UI show "new window" for Options:Tabs:"New page should be opened in"

I haven't looked at other combination of those prefs, or other link scenarios.
