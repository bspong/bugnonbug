Displays HTML code when accessing java servlet using tomcat
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.40903; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

In the site

http://flamesofkalimdor.com

Will use the url called

http://www.amazinggrace.com.au/servlet/FOK_PortalCgi

which is basically just a java servlet that return html code.

The problem is that with the current version of FireFox, the result place the
HTML code within the browser, not the webpage itself. Im certain that this
problem occurs due to fact the the URL ha no typical file extension such
a .jsp but most servlets developed follow the same url format (ie no file
extension in the URL)

Is there a way to signal firefox to display the webpage and not the HTML code?
Im sure other java developer have this problem with firefox and encourage
user to simply use IE instead…not good.
