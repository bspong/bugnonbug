I'm using Kubuntu with KDE 4.2. Oxygen Window decoration.

I read firefox use an OS window decoration integration so I tried changin the decoration yo Ozone, Plastik, Keramik... and I happens with everyone (despite de square around de element is smaller with some of them).

It's just a cosmetic problem but it's really annoying, please fix it! ^_^
