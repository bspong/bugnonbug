malformed window on selecting full screen using matrox parhelion triple-head graphic card
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Latest download but uninstalled so don't know????

I use three tft screen running off a matrox parhelion 256mb triple-head
graphic card. The matrox is set give full screen into one monitor (based on
where the target window is located it will maximise to just that one screen).

Selecting full-screen from the top-right of the Mozilla window maximes to the
target screen but the window is malformed (can't see the title bar and the
three box to close/minimise/exit full screen. Selecting 'view' | 'full
screen' then maximises the Mozilla window across all three screen (and the
window is formed correctly).

Mozilla should form correctly on 'full screen' to a single screen! Mozilla
should not go to full screen across three screen unless the Matrox is set to
that mode!

Uninstalled software because of this fault.
