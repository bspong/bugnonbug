When I start Firefox my dial up connection automatically start and I am unable
to stop it.
I have checked the setting via control panel > administartive tool > Services
and checked the three component that are set to manual.
I want to stop Firefox auto dialling so that I can choose the dial up setting it
connects to. Can you help?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Control Panel Admiistrative tool > Services
2.Changed all the setting to manual
3.Applied Changes

Actual Results:
Nothing changed Firefox still dialled the connection by itself. I have even
tried to reinstal Firefox but this did not help.
