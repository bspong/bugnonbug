Using simultaneously two web application on same host but different porst
cause authorization step each time after switching applications. It seems that
Mozilla us the same cookie to store jsessionid, skipping port context. I'am
not fluent about cookie mechanism but on IE5.5 it work fine. Is it part of
standard to use port number a context or M$' extension?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Establish IP forwarding from localhost to two different webapps requiring
authorisation, using two different ports.
2. Open two Mozilla's tab or window for these two apps using localhost URL
3. Try browse simultaneously these two application
Actual Results:
Each switching requires authorization

Expected Results:
Remember two different context (not only host but port number too).
