I am noticing with some flash website that if I am running any flash player le than 10.1 and greater than 9. That some PNG's inside flash are losing their transparency. It appears the image wa being rendered in 16bit rather than 32 bit. It appears on most flash website and on other browser it appears to be fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a flash website with a transparent png
2.view image
3.
Actual Results:
The image appears to be rendered in 16 bit.

Expected Results:
The image should be displaying properly

This appears to happen on Windows machine (XP, Vista, 7) and Flash player 10.1 and le down to 9.
