I have all security setting in place: ie: pop ups blocked, cooky blocked. I
am being bombarded with popups just recently. The offense hit me whenever and
where ever surfing. The offending program is 'Aurora'. I am sure you've heard of
this before. I have seen many blog with post a mile long about this particular
spyware. I have run several spyware program to eliminate it from my system to
no avail. Please tell me that there is a light at the end of the tunnel! Thanks!

Reproducible: Always
