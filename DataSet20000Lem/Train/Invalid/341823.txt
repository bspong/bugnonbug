Mozilla ha been working without problem until a few week ago. I had an error message on my PC about imminent hard drive failure. I took my PC to Geek Squad. They mirrored my hard drive onto thier machine, installed a new drive and mirrored back. Since then when I try to click a hyperlink in Outlook 2000 SP3 it will open my "nt" file. I've set Mozilla a default, downloaded the latest Mozilla and no change. If I make Internet explorer my default browser - everything works! I don't want to give up mozilla! Help!

Reproducible: Always
