I use a favicon used on my homepage, http://roberteklund.info/. However, this address us web forwarding to where the homepage actually resides, i.e. (presently): http://www.ida.liu.se/~g-robek/

When I write in http://www.ida.liu.se/~g-robek/ the favicon shows.

When I write in http://roberteklund.info/ it doesn't.

It seems the favicon disappears in the web forwarding process.

Additional help:

Netscape 7.1 handle both case above. The Gecko engine in Netscape is older:
Gecko/20030624 Netscape/7.1 (ax)



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compare the site above:
http://www.ida.liu.se/~g-robek/ --> favicon show
http://roberteklund.info/ --> favicon doe not show


Actual Results:
See above.

Expected Results:
Show the favicon even when site name is virtual and is forwarded to actual URL.
