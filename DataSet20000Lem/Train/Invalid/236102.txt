The "set default browser" option tab doesn't work.
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Firefox/0.8

Nothing happens when I click on the Options "General" tab for setting Firefox
a my default browser. I am directed to any link I click on in Thunderbird
mail message m via Netscape Communicator 4.5 instead of Firefox. I've tried
reinstalling Firefox but it doesn't help. (BTW, the space provided to describe
previously reported bug is too narrow for me to be able to read other people's
reports--half the column is cut off, and maximizing or using the horizontal bar
doe not help--so I cannot tell if anyone ha already reported this.)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Options, General, Default browser
2.Left mouse click on Set Default Browser ("Make Firefox your default browser")
3.Nothing happens.
Actual Results:
Thunderbird connects to Netscape 4.5 instead of Firefox.


Expected Results:
It should have taken me to Firefox whenever there is a need for a browser.
