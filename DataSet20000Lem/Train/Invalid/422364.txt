When scrolling down the right hand pane of the linked web page sometimes black line are left in the scrolled area. More frequent is if you hover your mouse over the link on the left you get an underline, when you move away the line is left. This only happens when the page zoom is greater than 100%. I have not changed my zoom step and I need to zoom in 2 step before I see this bug on the left hand pane. Zooming in too far stop the bug from being visible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to page
2. Zoom in by using ctrl + mousewheel up two notch (ctrl ++ zoom in too far)
3. Hover mouse over link on the left
Actual Results:
Rendering is incorrect - underline on the link are left when they should disappear.

Expected Results:
Page should render the same a zoomed to 100%
