You cannot talk with a Flash movie via JavaScript (error: "[some] object is not
defined" or "[something] is not a function). It work fine in Mozilla 1.02,
1.3.1, and 1.4b, however it seem to be broken in Firebird (at least since the
0.5 release).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the sample page
2. Click on one of the four link that play a sound from a flash movie
3. View the JavaScript console, and it say "xx is not a function"

Actual Results:
JavsScript error when accessing the flash movie object's methods.

Expected Results:
Firebird should recognize the flash movie object, "import" the method for that
object, and call the method successfully.

Using Flash 6.0.79 in all version of Mozilla and Phoenix/Firebird
