I updated my Firefox from 3.5x to 3.6 and since that moment the following page doesn't open correctly anymore. I don't know if it is a problem with the website, but is ha never been a problem so far.

When I enter the URL http://www.skl.de/fwd?to=1_home.jsp the page isn't being displayed a a web page. Instead Firefox offer to save the file or open it with another application. When i choose Firefox a application the file opened is named file:///C:/DOCUME~1/Arjan/LOCALS~1/Temp/home-1.htm. My JRE had been updated only a few day before I updated Firefox.
