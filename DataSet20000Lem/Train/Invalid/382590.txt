My computer ha Windows ME and Firefox. When I log into my snapfish account to upload photos, it try to install their 'quickupload' tool which let's you quickly select multiple photo to upload. However Firefox just hang and every 15-20 second the page reloads but it never progress past the 'installing software' screen. The quickupload tool work fine in IE 6 and Netscape 7 on a Windows ME machine, so I don't think the problem is with Snapfish.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into www.snapfish.com account.
2. Go the upload photo sections. Select folder to upload to.

Actual Results:
Have to exist browser.

Expected Results:
Installed quickupload tool so I can upload photos. It work in IE 6 and Netscape 7.
