After being opened for a short wile Firefox hog 98% of the CPU freezing the computer. Problem seems to disappear if I hit alt control delete and pull up Task Manager. After leaving it opened for a moment I close Task Manager and most of the time system return to normal. A few moment later it happens again. Many time I have to open more than one Task Manager because the previous one is frozen too. Sometimes it is so bad I have to shut down. I tried cleaning the cache, closing programs, tripled the ram but nothing seems to work. It doe not perceive it a a crash because the incident reporter feature doe not open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.On the Net, everytime.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Just open the Firefox and let it sit there. I don't have to really do anything. Basic Firefox version Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

Expected Results:
Firefox take up 98% to 100% CPU, freezing the computer.

Not freeze and cause me to take hour to do something I used to do in minutes. My concern is that this is a security bug. I have run virus and spyware removal programs, to no avail. I feel someone else "takes over" the computer and I am blocked out of it. The fact that it stop everytime I open the Task Manager, but close almost immediately, make me feel I can't see exactly what is going on and I can't control the computer. It's funny but I feel whatever the problem is, it seems to hide when I look at process and return a very short in while. After going through this for hundred of time (dozens of time everyday)I saw the 98% CPU allocated to Firefox by chance. The cause of the spike on the cpu usage vanishes when I open task manager or it freeze task manager and I can't scroll, can't see the cause.
