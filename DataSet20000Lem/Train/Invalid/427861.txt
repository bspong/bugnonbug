When the activedescendant property is removed from the currently focused control, FireFox will crash.


See the attached file for the repro case.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Focus on an element
2. While focus remains on this element, remove the activedescendant property
Actual Results:
Exception causing program termination.

Expected Results:
Active element is updated to the element that currently ha focus.

This seems to only happen when inspect32 is running in the background. Could not reproduce when this application wa closed. Unsure if there are any non-dev apps that could cause the same interaction.
