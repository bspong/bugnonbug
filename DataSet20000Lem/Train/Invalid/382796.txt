Often some plain text file ha an extension that firefox doe not recognize, and firefox asks the user to choose a helper application.
Quite apart from the fact that this dialog is rather broken: nobody want to navigate the filesystem to find a helper - saving to disk and typing the name of the helper is much faster, and $PATH will make sure that this helper is found in a directory that the user need not even know about - a different issue is that often no helper is needed: the file is ordinary plain text, and one would like firefox just to display it. There seems to be no obvious way to tell firefox: do it yourself.
