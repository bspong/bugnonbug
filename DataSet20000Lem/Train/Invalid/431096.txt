A colleague made this page which work a expected in IE7 and Firefox 2. It doe not work a intended in Firefox 3 beta 5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the link on the provided example page.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens - whereas in Firefox 2 or Internet Explorer 7 the page background will change. The page check out tentatively at w3c, so it isn't a problem with the page.

Expected Results:
Should have changed the page background a intended by the page code.

The example code is probably the best test. I don't know if any other code will cause the same problem.
