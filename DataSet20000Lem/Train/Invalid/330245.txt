alt+d at http://opera.com/download/ reloads the page rather than highlighting the content of the URL bar . This is a minor annoyance but is alt+d not guaranteed to work on every web site, should I just use ctrl+l instead? Is that accelerator guaranteed to work?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://opera.com/download/
2. hit alt+d
3. page is reloaded

Actual Results:
page is reloaded

Expected Results:
content of url bar should be highlighted
