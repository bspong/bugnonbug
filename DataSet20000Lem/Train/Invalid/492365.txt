Click 'Add-ons' in Tools menu and I get the Extensions dialog. By default I get the Extensions tab and if I click 'Find Updates' it work normally. If however I look at one of the other tab then go back to Extensions the 'Find Updates' will not work.

The extension 'Stylish' and 'MR Tech Toolkit' are installed.

Closing the dialog and reopening I can check for update a normal. As far a I can see it's going to be impossible to check for update to themes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 'Add-ons' dialog.
2. Click on another tab.
3. Go back to 'Extensions' tab.
4. Click 'Find Updates'.
5. Nothing happens.
Actual Results:
Firefox doesn't check for update to extension (or themes?)

Expected Results:
Checked for extensions.
