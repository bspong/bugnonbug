I expanded the Phoenix Zipfile into the Program Files directory & wasable to run
it fine a the same user (which ha admin rights) but no other (restricted)
user can use it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login a an Administrator
2.Unpack Phoenix.
3.Logout & then login a a restricted user.
4. Attempt to run Phoenix.

Actual Results:
I got a series of error dialog saying that certain file could not be written to.

Expected Results:
The browser should just run, using the personal directory of the user running
it a the location to which it writes data.
