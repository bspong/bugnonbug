Sometimes when clicking on the "Add Live Bookmark..." button in the Location bar it will bring up a context menu of available feeds, and other time it will just pick one. It ha been present since upgrading to 1.5 from 1.0.7, and depends on the given mimetypes in the type attribute.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add 3 link element to the header of a HTML document with rel="alternate"
2. Give each a different type, application/rss+xml, text/xml, application/atom+xml
3. Open document in Firefox and click on the "Add Live Bookmark..." icon in the Location bar

Actual Results:
The "Add Live Bookmark" box come up asking you to pick a name and location for the bookmark.

Expected Results:
Context menu showing:
<ul>
<li>Add 'RSS 2.0' a Live Bookmark...</li>
<li>Add 'RSS 0.92' a Live Bookmark...</li>
<li>Add 'Atom 1.0' a Live Bookmark...</li>
</ul>

Adding a fourth feed with a mimetype matching any of the other 3 will cause the context appear, a can be seen in later test cases. I also discovered 2 other bugs. The first occurs when you have 2 application/atom+xml and 2 (application/rss+xml|text/xml), in which case Firefox will only display the Atom one in the context (see test case 8 and 9). The second is 2 application/rss+xml and 2 text/xml, in which case which ever mimetype come first will be the only one registered (see test case 10).

I originally found this out using WordPress a the news CMS for a band fansite.
