SERIOUS Windows Explorer Crashes when useing Windows 7 + Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/3.0.195.33 Safari/532.0
Build Identifier: tested with Firefox 3.5 - 3.6 Beta 2

On Windows 7 x64 FF 3.5 - 3.6 Beta 2 seems to crash the Windows Explorer. Dosn't matter if FF is running or wa run once after startup - pure install of FF is enough to cause this problem. Tryed different Windows Reg manipulation from people haveing simular bug (e.g. window 7 "disabled sessions" bug look the same) (very hard to specify what is causing the problem since not only FF seems to cause it!) but nothing helped (tryed like 6 different FF installs) till FF wa uninstalled. Since then, no single Explorer crash anymore.
Stable Windows 7 run for like 2 week now.

Bug wa first spotted at Windows 7 RC (the last 3 build i tested) and IS present in the final Windows 7 ultimate and professional edition.
Windows 7 x64 seems to be the main trouble-maker, even tought SOME people useing Windows 7 x86 seem to have simular problem i suppose some other software is causing theirs since like 85% of all people reporting this bug use a x64 system.
Maybe thats the reason why it wasn't reported before (very little x64 system used compared to x86 ATM) but than this mean that in future even more report will be spotted since x64 presens grows.
