URGENT. I downloaded the new Firefox 2 to my Mac and now QuarkXPress 6.5 will not open. I appears Firefox ha a compatibility problem. I've restarted the Mac...and I also turned it off and then turned it on but no luck. I have been running Quark for year with no problems. Firefox 2 upgrade is the only software I downloaded. Prior to it Quark wa working fine. Please advise ASAP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on Mac
2. Double click on Quark Application
3.
Actual Results:
Quark will not open

Expected Results:
Quark ha alwasy opened.

Is there a way to undpo the download and dump Firefox 2 and go back to the previous version of Firefox?
