Any embedded flash videos, such a YouTube, will crash the operating system if put in full screen. Videos can be watched with no problem in normal size, but if placed in full screen, video will cause the system to go from a black window to a half loaded desktop until the system is manually hard shut down. The video will play for a few second before crashing but may go up to 30 seconds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Play an embedded video
2. Click on full screen button
3. Watch video for a few second
Actual Results:
System Crash
