I registered on Bugzilla today to report a general inability to save page or image using standard dialog and/or contextual menu and decided it wa too much of a hassle.

Firefox 2 is seriously buggy and submitting bug through Bugzilla is more trouble than it's worth.

I'm a user, not a debug engineer.
