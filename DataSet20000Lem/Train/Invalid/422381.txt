:last-child is selecting child elements, of child element of the element being targeted. See source code of test case URL for a clean straight-forward example

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Follow URL
2. Bold text should not be red, it's being selected incorrectly by :last-child!
3. There is no step 3.
Actual Results:
Bold text is marked red incorrectly

Expected Results:
Only the last paragraph should be red

Only tested in Firefox 3b4.
I've selected Severity:Major because it's a CSS regression and could produce massive head-aches for further standards-adoption by user getting into the new selectors, especially :last-child which is just becoming available on all browsers.
