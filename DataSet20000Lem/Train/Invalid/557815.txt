Last night I used a disk cleaner on my computer and afterwards, my Firefox started acting up. It will download hotmail, for example, but I can't click on anything there. It won't download Gmail or load Facebook games. I'm using Explorer right now. I uninstalled FF and reinstalled, but it didn't help. I restored my computer to an earlier time. Nothing. I updated Java. Do you have any idea or know someone who might? I don't like using Explorer

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on to hotmail
2. Attempt to click on new message
3. Attempt unsuccessful


Expected Results:
I should be able to click on my messages, download Facebook game and have Gmail load.
