When typing in an existing tag name in the bookmark panel or bookmark property dialog the focus is stuck in the textbox and autocomplete dropdown. It is impossible to tab forward (or back) to get to the Done or Cancel buttons. Note you have to be typing the name of an existing tag so the autocomplete is triggered, typing a non-existent tag will allow you to move the focus with tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start shiretoko/minefield with a profile that contains at least one bookmark tag.
2. Go to an unbookmarked page and press ctrl/cmd+D to open the bookmark panel.
3. Tab down to tag field, start typing name of existing tag so the autocomplete is triggered
4. Press Tab to move focus forward
Actual Results:
Focus is stuck in tag field or on autocomplete

Expected Results:
Focus move forward

This is a relatively trivial bug a pressing enter will cancel the autocomplete and allow focus to move but that is not intuitive if you want to quickly type a tag name then tabbing on to Done button. Someone on Mozillazine came across this and it confused them http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=1185525

This also happens on the property dialog of a bookmark a well a the panel. Possibly a side effect of bug 49560 but I haven't done any regression testing yet.
