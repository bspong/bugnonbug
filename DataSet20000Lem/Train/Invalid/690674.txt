Addon can block addons update checking

Steps to reproduce:

Try to check for addons update in Addons Manager


Actual results:

The message "The addons are updating" (or similar, I've the Catalan translation) is showed and never hides. No addons are updated.


Expected results:

Checking of addons update must finish. If I disable the "Lab Kits 3" addon (or enter in safe mode) all go fine. I think it's a Firebug bug. An addon problem can't block all the addons updates.
