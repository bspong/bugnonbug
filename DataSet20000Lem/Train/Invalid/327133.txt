Clicking on Pacman in Tools menu brings up the game board, but it won't respond to anything. If I bring up the Extensions window from the Tools menu, and highlight Pacman, Uninstall, Find updates, and get more extension are all highlighted, but option isn't, so I can't access it. I don't know what else to try, to get the game to work. Please advise.

Reproducible: Always
