The HTML5 autofocus attribute on input element scroll the browser view down to the input immediately on page load.

This is undesired because if a webpage is designed such a way (or the browser viewport is not tall enough) that the input is below the fold, the user may suddenly find themselves looking at a part of the page below the masthead, and not be sure what site they are on, or have missed important title information pertinent to the input in question.

Imagine for example a EULA which required the user to read the lengthy text and enter the word "OK" in the textbox at the bottom. To save a click, the developer may want to add autofocus to the input. It doe not help the end user if the browser automatically scroll right to the bottom of the page where it is not evident what they are looking at, why, and what action to do next.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open attached test case in Firefox 4
Actual Results:
Whoops, now you don’t know where you are and have missed important information.

Expected Results:
Page load looking at the top, like every other website.

Chrome also suffers from the same problem. In Safari there is an instant scroll back up. This is odd, but suffices.
