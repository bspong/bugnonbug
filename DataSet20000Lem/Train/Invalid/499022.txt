I'm sorry if I'm missing something or if this ha been posted elsewhere, but I've spent about 20 minute searching Bugzilla and didn't find any suitable *Firefox* bug (there is one in Seamonkey at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=319038).

IMO there are some pretty large issue with the Firefox bookmarking UI:

1) The Ctrl+D pop-up need to be movable around (it can obscure a portion of the page the user need information from)

2) The pop-up also need to be resizable

3) It need a way to display the extra field that are accessible through Organize Bookmarks, mainly the Comment field.

In general, the Ctrl+D pop-up should behave and look much more like the bookmark Library. Its current state for the past year(s) made bookmarking on delicious.com WAY more functional than in Firefox.

4) In Organize Bookmarks, what is the difference between Tags and Keywords?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Ctrl+D
Actual Results:
Crippled bookmarking pop-up

Expected Results:
Something much more like the bookmark Library.

I'm surprised at the sorry state of bookmarking in Firefox and by all means, please point me to an existing discussion or rationale if I'm missing something.
