firefox 3.5.5 will load one page (slowly) and then rarely will it load others
User-Agent: Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux i686; U; en) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.10
Build Identifier: [user@localhost ~]$ rpm -qa firefox firefox-3.5.5-1.fc12.i686

I've been going in circle on this one with IRC people. Got GDB installed and found lot of .dynamic error though unfortunately couldn't get gdb to tell me why page load so slow. OPERA 10 load all page very quickly for me. FX few to no page load at speed or at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox
2.wait for page to load (almost never happens)
3.
Actual Results:
I waited.
