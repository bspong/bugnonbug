Make ours exactly like theirs or with any change you want. By the way, fedora gnome 3 app button work too. Copying from chrome or ie make you lose a differential, but copying from ubuntu or fedora make you win a market share, because you're competing with chrome and ie, not ubuntu and fedora.

Reproducible: Always
