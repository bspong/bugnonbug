There is weirdness with the popups on the listed url. The popup happens and show but it almost a if the popup is both full screen and not fullscreen at the same time. Or maybe they are just artifacts.

For the record I'm running ubuntu 8.04 with nvidia driver and compiz running. I'm not sure if this is a problem with this particular setup or not but it doe happen with firefox 3 beta on that page.
