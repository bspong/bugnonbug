Although JavaScript work on XHTML served a XML, but labeled a XHTML by both
DOCTYPE and HTTP-EQUIV, in that the DOM is correctly manipulated, element
created are rendered a no-ops. In this instance, the <em> created might a well
be <span>.

If running locally, the JS work when the file is named *.xhtml and fails when
it is named *.xml.

Reproducible: Always
