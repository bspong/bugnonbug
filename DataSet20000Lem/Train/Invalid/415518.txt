firefox ha problem with webservers that do chunked encoding only (e.g. publicfile) and miss to read e.g. cs style file like in this example

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit http://nn7.de/pics/photos/bled08/002-CIMG3681.JPG.html using firefox
2.do the same with i.e. IE6/7, opera: firefox miss to load the cs
Actual Results:
page miss style file and is plainly displayed, although there should be a grey border around the small image


it seems to be that publicfile doe only chunked encoding and never us content-length:

I think the problem here about 'YUM' is exactly the same that hit firefox:
https://lists.dulug.duke.edu/pipermail/yum/2004-March/004047.html , quote follows:

I agree. What make publicfile different is that it seems to use
chunked encoding all the time. There's no rule against this, but most
server only use chunked encoding when they "need to". The chunked
encoding is intended largely to deal with dynamic data for which the
content-length is not known at the time the transaction begins.
Othwerwise, it would not be possible to do keepalive because the
client would have no way to locate message boundaries. For most
static file with an obvious (from stat) file size, most server send
the file with "identity" encoding and provide a content-length.

Again, the issue is not that publicfile is wrong. It's just a little
different from how most server behave. Neither it nor the other
server are incorrect. This is not a protocol-violation issue. The
issue in yum is above the protocol layer.
