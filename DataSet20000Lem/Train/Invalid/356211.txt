The magnifying glass search button in the search bar doe not have any drop-down text when hovered over, nor doe the button to chose a different search engine.

Having button-specific drop-down text in the search bar might make the buttons' function a little more obvious to people who aren't a computer savvy.

Also, every other button in the default navigation toolbar ha drop-down text. Im not sure why the search bar wa left out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover your mouse pointer over the button in the search bar
2.
3.

Actual Results:
No drop-down text appears when search bar button are hovered over

Expected Results:
The drop-down text for the search engine button could say something like "Choose a search engine..."

and for the magnifying glass button it could simply say "Search".
