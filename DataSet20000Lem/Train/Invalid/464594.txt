XHTML attribute with qualified name not recognized
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_4_11; en) AppleWebKit/525.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1.2 Safari/525.22

If an XHTML file defines a namespace prefix which refers to the XHTML namespace and then us that prefix to specify XHTML attribute using qualified names, those attribute are not recognized correctly.

An example of the bug may be seen at: http://goliath.cs.ucdavis.edu/bugs/qname_attr_test.xhtml

The file is an XHTML 1.1 document, served with Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml. It defines xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" and us the "h" prefix to construct the qualified attribute name "h:id" and "h:href". Neither attribute is correctly handled by Firefox: the CSS style that should apply to div#yes element isn't applied nor is the link href interpreted correctly.

This problem also occurs with Firefox 3.0.3 Linux and Minefield 3.1b2pre on OS X (i.e. Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081112 Minefield/3.1b2pre).



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://goliath.cs.ucdavis.edu/bugs/qname_attr_test.xhtml
2. Note that CSS style which would indicate id attribute being recognized correctly isn't applied, nor is the href attribute on the link.
Actual Results:
The :after content of the div with id="yes" is set to "No". The link doe not point to "#".

Expected Results:
The :after content of the div with id="yes" should be set to "Yes". The link should point to "#".
