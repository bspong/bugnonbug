When I click on the new tab button, or when I click a link that open a new tab, the window itself is the correct size, but the content of that tab is in a tiny, unresizable (so far a I can tell) column. I can scroll up and down and left and right, but the scroll bar themselves are all the way to the left of the content, with a huge white space between them and the window border.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on the new tab button.
2.OR Click on a link which open a new tab.
3.
Actual Results:
New tab open which show only a tiny portion of the content, with a blank white space showing for the rest of the browser window.

Expected Results:
It should open up a new tab and the content take up the entire browser window, instead of a tiny column.

I tried changing tabbrowser preferences, forcing the minimum width to be 1024 pixels, javascript window resizing options, etc. Nothing worked.
