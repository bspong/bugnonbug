Need hotkey for open URL

I am a recent convert to FireBird, but I find the lack of a hotkey to open a URL
very frustrating. I find it even more frustrating that Ctrl+O give me an "Open
File" dialog box. This is a browser, and 99.9% of the time, people want to open
URL's, not local files. For people migrating from Internet Exploiter, this is
quite frustrating. Having to change my input ethic from keyboard to mouse to
keyboard and back all the time is quite tiresome.
Can you make Ctrl+O the equivallent of Mozilla's Shift+Ctrl+L and perhapos
assign Shift+Ctrl+O to an open file dialog. The same applies for Mozilla BTW,
but I will post a bug about that to that list too :)
