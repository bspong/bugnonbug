Some javascript menù, like mine, have some problem with their background when it is transparent. The background is set to be transparent but i see it black.

The CSS is correct in fact with opera or IE or safari I see it good

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the page
2.Go over the left menù
3.See the color of background with opera/IE/Safari and with firefox
Actual Results:
Left menù's background is black instead of transparent

Expected Results:
Background color have to be transparent
