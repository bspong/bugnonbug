I am unable to hit the mail tab on my tool bar and email a page link, like I wa
able to do with the older build of Firefox. Now I have to copy and paste the
link into the body of the email, rather than simply clicking on the envelope,
hitting send a link. I can send a new message, or read mail, it doe not give
me the option of sending a link.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on a URL from the addres bar on any website

2. click the envelope at the top of the page.

3. No option to email a link.

Actual Results:
Nothing happens, it is the same all the time, after roboot, looking for
extensions, asking on the Mozilla Firfox group at yahoogroups and win home.
Thanks for you time.

Expected Results:
I shoud be able to click on the address bar of any open webpage, click on the
envelope and get the option to send a link.
