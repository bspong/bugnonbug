My Toshiba Satellite U205-S5034 laptop feature a biometric fingerprint scanner and us Protector Suite QL to manage it.

In earlier version of Firefox (pre-2.0), I wa able to use my biometric scanner to log into websites, etc. Now, I get an error that the browser doe not support the feature. I've searched for plug-ins, but only plug-in for pre-2.0 exist (to my knowledge). I would like to see integration with biometric (fingerprint) scanner and their respective software in future updates.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter log-in info on any site.
2. Swipe finger to register log-in info with Protector Suite.
3. Click "register."
4. Error message indicating browser doe not support the feature.


Expected Results:
Firefox ha always been fully functional with Protector Suite QL in the past versions. 2.0 lost this functionality completely.
