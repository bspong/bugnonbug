when i try correcting the word by pressing right click,
the right click menu show suggested word option which are shown at the top of the menu.

the problem is when i trying to move the cursor to the words, the mouse cursor pass on some extension in the menu , like "noscript" , "switchproxy" , "webdeveloper", etc

the moment the cursor highlight those menu links, the correction word list gone!

this becoming very annoying whenever i try reaching the words, i try moving the cursor (around) the box to avoid highlighting those extension , just to pick up the word...
