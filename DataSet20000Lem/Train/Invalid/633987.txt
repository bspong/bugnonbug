In any situation, there is no little arrow next to the back button that brings up a list of page to go back to

Why are we LOOSING feature in Firefox "Minefield"? If I know that the page I want to visit wa twenty page ago, I don't want to have to rapid fire the back button to get there. Two keystroke (like from all other more "normal" version of firefox) is plenty.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser.
2. Go to any webpage.
3. Navigate through a few different pages.
4. Look for the little menu arrow next to the back button. Notice that it isn't present.
Actual Results:
No little arrow menu next to the back button.

Expected Results:
There should always be a little arrow (in firefox 3, it is just to the right of the "forward" navigation button) that show all the page you've been to previously in that tab. Minefield seems to lack this. What's going on?

Default theme.
