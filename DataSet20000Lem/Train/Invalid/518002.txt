the return-to-parent-on-close-tab behavior is defined in:
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Link_Targeting#Moving_Focus_after_Closing_Tabs
it state that on closing a tab, focus should return to parent if:
* a new tab ha opened with focus
* focus doe not move from that tab before it is closed
this is broken if from the newly opened child tab, additional tab are opened in the background. although focus remains on the child tab, closing it will no longer return to parent.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open some tab
2. go to the first tab and either middle-click or shift-middle-click on a link to open in new tab *with* focus (depending on your setting "when i open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately)
3. from the newly opened child tab, open some link or bookmark in the background (*without* focus)
4. close the child tab
Actual Results:
focus move to the adjacent tab on the right

Expected Results:
focus should return to parent tab
