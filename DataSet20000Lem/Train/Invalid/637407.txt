Howdy,

This wa a feature for a while and then it ha disappeared.

I place the mouse pointer into the tab "bar" at the top of my browser window and use the mouse wheel to move forwards/backwards in the bar. Each tab moved to this way "lights up" but the content of the url which the tab represents doe not appear.

Earlier version of Firefox (Minefield) had this feature but it seems to have disappeared.

The feature wa VERY useful to me since I load large number of tabs.

George...
