Using the latest build of FireFox, using Windows XP SP2. On the tab bar, located to the far left is the "open a new tab". When clicking this button once, it correctly creates a new tab. I've noticed however that when clicking this button twice in quick succession (for example), it will create three tab instead of two. I have been able to reproduce this bug everytime.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the "open a new tab" button on the tab bar twice quickly. It generates three not two tabs.

Actual Results:
It produced three new tab instead of two.

Expected Results:
It should have created two new tabs, since the button wa clicked twice.

I don't think any extension or theme is affecting this issue, a it occurs on FireFox with no theme/extension installed.
