Firefox 1.5.0.7 for Windows will not start under Windows ME. The installation seemed to go smoothly (didn't crash or anything). When I try to start the program, nothing show up. When I checked my system's processes, FIREFOX.EXE show up for about 10 second then disappears/closes. Rebooting the computer after installation did not help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch FIREFOX.EXE (double-click on program icon)
Actual Results:
Find "firefox" program under C:\FIREFOX (where I installed program) in Windows Explorer. Double-click program icon.

Expected Results:
Should have launched Firefox 1.5.0.7 program

A trace of the program's dependency show several particular error of possible interest:

*GetProcAddress(0xBFF60000 [KERNEL32.DLL], "IsTNT") called from "OLEAUT32.DLL" at address 0x7FE8D090 and returned NULL. Error: The specified module could not be found (126).

I checked and have found all of these DLL file on my computer. After the last error, the program seems to begin the process of exiting.
