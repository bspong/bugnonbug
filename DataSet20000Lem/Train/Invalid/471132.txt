Skype online status button do not work under Firefox.

But they work fine under Webkit.

Reason seems to be the icon. If icon is forced not to load, then clicking at the box open Skype and make the call.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to a website that ha Skype online status button (eg. go to my website and scroll to the bottom).
2. Click on the Skype online status button.
Actual Results:
The link below is called...

http://download.skype.com/share/skypebuttons/oops/oops.html

...which pop up a notification window explaining that user need to download the latest version of Skype.

BUT user already ha the latest version of Skype.

I repeat, it work fine under Webkit.

Expected Results:
Skype is initiated and a call is being placed to the Skype name selected (eg. in my case that is my own Skype name).
