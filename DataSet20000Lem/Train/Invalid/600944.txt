Firewall shutdown by page visit.

Recently I had some bad experience when I visited some adult content pages, with Javascript off, all Plugins and extension off, history and cooky off.
I don't know exactly what happens, but some server seem to be capable of shutting my jetico firewall down. The icon will remain in the tray until the mouse is over it, forceing a graphical update that remove the tray icon. Virus scan did not find anything. Avast Antivirus claim to protect the bootup sequence from rootkits successfully. Unfort I could not identify the causing URLs so far. It's rather scary. I have to say, I just updated to Firefox 3.6.10. Could it be that this wa some sort of DLL Injection vulnerability? And would this be fixed in version 3.6.10?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. A version older than 3.6.10 is needed, probably 3.5.x, with Jetico Personal Firewall 1.0
2. Javasctipt and all Plugins deactivated in Firefox.
3. Shady page must be visited, be it adult, warez or something like that
4. It may be a matter of "luck" to find one of the infected nets.
Actual Results:
Some http-servers seem to be capable of shutting my jetico firewall down. The icon will remain in the tray until the mouse is over it, forceing a graphical update that remove the tray icon. (it's still there for some time, while the app is already shut down, so the user is not alarmed)

Expected Results:
Actually - nothing else than displaying plain html.

Of course, maybe Firefox ha nothing to do with it, other than contacting a webserver and telling them my IP. It may be a firewall problem only. Nonetheless, if there are similar problem on other systems, please let me know.
