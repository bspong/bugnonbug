Session restore: loading wrong content for frame
While in a logged in session with this business portal, the OS locked up while on a payment form. The computer/OS wa warm-booted. Firefox restored the session by opening two tabs. The first tab wa the portal login screen (unexpectedly malformed because FF loaded the wrong content for the frames), while the second (visible, active) tab correctly displayed the same login form. Neither tab restored the previous login session, nor displayed the payment form.
