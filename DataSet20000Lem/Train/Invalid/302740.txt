Large table cause vertical black bar rendering problem on Solaris and Linux platform (not in Windows to my knowledge)

Whenever I load up the large table show Firefox and NS7 in Solaris will show
vertical black bar over the table. In Linux it is not a bad and the text
under the table is still readable. The table validates and ha proper tagging.

It seems to be a rendering problem because highlighting the text will take away
some of the black bar over the text to where it is readable and some time it
will not. Scrolling effect this a well and the bar will either disappear or
move to another location above or below on the table.

I should also note the table are formatted with a CSS style sheet.
