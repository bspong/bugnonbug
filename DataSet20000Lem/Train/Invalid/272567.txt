But this is not present in the tool -> options.

Consider a site where after clicking a link, a new browser window opens. But
this is irritating. I would like to open it in new tab.
There is no option to do so.
Actual Results:
Link open in new window.

Expected Results:
Link should open in new tab.

I know that the woraround is to use middle mouse button. But the end user
constantly us rt. button. Its v. distracting and irritating to purposely use
middle button to open the link in new tab.
