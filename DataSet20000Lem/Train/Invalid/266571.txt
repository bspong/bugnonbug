PopUps shouldn't open a new tabs, they should open a new window instead.

In 1.0RC1 there's option regarding tabbed browsing. These option replaces
SingleWindow plugin functionality. I'm using option "Force link that open in
new window to open in NEW TABS". This option is forcing PopUps to open a tabs,
but this is incorrect. PopUps should remain popups, I can't work with some site
due to this behaviour. The good-old SingleWindow plugin worked perfectly for me.
