Firefox deletes our window clipboard data whenever a new firefox
window is opened. It's really nice, and cool a a feature .. . but i only need
to get rid of my clipboard's data "Intentionally"

Side effects: I have to recopy a second time what i previously copied on my
desktop before opening a new firefox window

Reproducible: Always
