I'm running Firefox 3.6 on Ubuntu Lucid 10.04 (GNOME) and the throbber (on tab buttons) doesn't look inappropriate
I've tried firefox-3.7a from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/ and the throbber doesn't look native anymore : firefox-3.7a6pre just look ugly to me on GNOME whereas new throbber is very distracting

(note that GTK+ 2.20 provides GtkSpinner)

Reproducible: Always
