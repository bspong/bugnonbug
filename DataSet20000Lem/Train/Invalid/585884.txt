After reissuing a geotrust quickssl premium cert for www.firstexchanger.com , I noticed the cert ha become unknown to firefox version 3.6.8 and give the untrusted connection warning message.
the cert is working fine with other browsers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox 3.6.8 ( latest stable version )
2.open https://www.firstexchanger.com/
3.
Actual Results:
This Connection is Untrusted
You have asked Firefox to connect
securely to www.firstexchanger.com, but we can't confirm that your connection is secure.
Normally, when you try to connect securely,
site will present trusted identification to prove that you are
going to the right place. However, this site's identity can't be verified.

Expected Results:
Do not show warning message and load the website normally.

I guess a root certificate of geotrust which is used to sign reissued cert is missed and is not imported in firefox.
