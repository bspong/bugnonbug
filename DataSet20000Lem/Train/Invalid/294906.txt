The Firefox product crashed can not be uninstalled "Completely" new install doe not work at all!
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: From your web site, Mozilla Firfox 1.04

The problem started when the tool bar disapeared. We uninstalled FireFox and
down loaded the new version 1.04. All I have is a page with one tab and you
can not do ANYTHING! We ran the unistall and tried to load software with the
same results. We went into the Microsoft Directory and tried to eliminate all
refernences to "Mozilla" and "FireFox" along with any reference to those
workds in the C: dirve. The result are the same!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There is obviously something that is still configured that we do not see that
disables the product from working! All indication are the install went fine
or the applicable uninstall went fine, but at this point in time it is
impossible to run the Mozilla Firefox product.

I am a Chief Information Officer and I have very talented people that work for
me, no one can find the problem!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.There is nothing to reproduce, you can not install the product to run.
2.
3.



Expected Results:
When doing an Unistall, ALL REFERENCES TO THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM
THE PC. As we saw, there are reminents of the product all over the PC after
you do an uninstall and we obvioulsy could not find all of them to try to get
a clean NEW install!

There wa and is not crash, the origional bug wa the Tool Bar disapeared and
we could not figure out how to get it back. We then did an Uninstall and
installed the latest version 1.04 i had 1.03.

It wa all down hill from there.
