Y-Mail Notifier wa updated to 0.1.6 and Firefox began running slower, progressively using more CPU. It is now going non-responsive. I have deactivated the Add-On and now testing. It seems to be running better but I wanted to give you a head up that there might be a compatibility issue with the Y-Mail Notifier build.
