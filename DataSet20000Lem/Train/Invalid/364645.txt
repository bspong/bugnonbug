Firefox offline state management check whether the wrong pref is locked
Current code check whether network.online is locked - except Firefox doesn't really give a ... about this pref, it us browser.offline for all it state checking - meaning that checking whether this pref is locked is (a) wrong and (b) useless. At least, that's how I read the code in the URL, and a lxr for "network.online"
