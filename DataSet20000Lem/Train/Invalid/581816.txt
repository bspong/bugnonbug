When clicking on some links, and using the back button, the address bar/awesome bar doe not get updated with the new link. I have seen this when doing a search on google and imdb.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two tab
1. on one tab, go to www.google.com
2. Enter a search query (e.g. "firefox")
3. Press enter to perform the search
4. Select the other tab
5. Select the tab with the google search result
6. Select the mozilla.com link (the first link)
7. Select the other tab
8. Select the tab with the google search result
9. Press the back button
Actual Results:
3 - the page changes, but the address bar still say "www.google.com"
5 - the address bar show the correct link
6 - the address bar is showing the search result url from (5)
8 - the address bar show the correct link
9 - the page changes, but the address bar still show the url from (8)


Expected Results:
5, 6, 8, 9 - the address bar should show the correct location

This is a recent regression in behaviour.
