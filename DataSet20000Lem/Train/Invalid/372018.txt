patcher2.pl doesn't clean up temp file
Having run patcher2 a bunch of time during setup and testing I managed to fill up my temp dir. When I went and looked there were TONS of directory lying around that had un-marred mar file in them. No wonder I ran out of space. A full gig dedicated to patcher. :-)
