Example: If I do a Google search and click on the resultant link - - each click on a link DOES NOT open a new window. An already existing window is used. Argggg

If I click on Tools/Options/Tabs I see that "New page S/B opened in a new window" is selected.

Is this the nature of the beast or is there something I can do to make Firefox open a new window for every new page?

I'm asked about severity in the box below. For me the severity is high because the way it currently work it cost me a lot of time and frustration. And sometimes I forget I have to use the back arrow to get back to a page I wanted to study further and I lose that page (sometimes temporarily and sometimes for good). That's a BIG BUMMER!!!
