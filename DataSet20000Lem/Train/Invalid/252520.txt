[linux] File Types list in Download preference is empty
seen on recent linux firefox 0.9+ branch build

-Go to Edit | Preferences | Downloads

notice that the field under File Types is empty. On Windows and Mac this field
is populated with many various file types.

The lack of File Types listed cause many various file downloads to trigger the
"What should Firefox do with this file?" dialog.
