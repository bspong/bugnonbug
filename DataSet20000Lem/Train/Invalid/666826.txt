When surfing the web my experience is perfectly normal. But once I launch a flash based object like a youtube video. Once I try to close that tab 98% of the time the system will go into 100% load and lock up. After clicking on the desktop you get a single beep code and then the entire system hangs. No crash report or nothing either. I have to hold down the power button to reboot the machine. I have ran this test over and over on many fresh installation of Windows XP Pro SP3 x86. This ha happened with 4.0.x version a well. But never with 3.6.x version of firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few new tabs.
2. Open a youtube video.
3. Close the youtube tab.

Actual Results:
Its a on and off bug. Tho it happens more often on, then off. Usually about once or twice a day.
