The setting 'Allow page to choose their own fonts, instead of my selection above' which is ticked in preference by default, is not actually enabled by default.

When viewing a page which override the default font, the correct font is not visible until this box is unticked (with the Ok button pressed) and then reticked.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit a page with a custom font (ie Verdana specified in CSS)
Actual Results:
Overridden font is displayed even though 'Allow page to choose their own fonts, instead of my selection above' is ticked.

Expected Results:
The custom font should be displayed
