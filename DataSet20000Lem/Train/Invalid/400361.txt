While using an Content Management System (like OpenCMS) and teh FCK editor. With a right click, the Firefox context menu appears "on top" or "over" the desired CMS context menu. Threfore it is not available a the mouse select item from the FF context menu only.
One workaround to this annoyance is to press the escape key and the FF context menu disppears while the CMS context menu remains and then becomes usable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use OpenCMS an set you preference to the best editor available (=FCK editor)
2a. Right click anywhere in the right pane
2b. Edit a html page, and right clik anywhere
Actual Results:
FF context menu display over the CMS context menu making it impossible to select any option from the CMS context menu.
Workaround is to press the Escape key, FF context menu disapears, and CMS remains and becomes usable

Expected Results:
FF context menu not to appear only the CMS one while in the CMS window.

addon installed that have context menu options:
- tab mix plus
