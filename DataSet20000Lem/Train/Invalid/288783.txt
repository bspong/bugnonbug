When inserting an URL without the protocol ("http:","ftp:") Firefox only default to http in Windows
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

I think this is a regression, or a behaviour that only ha Firefox on Windows,
because I think this ha always worked.

If I insert an URL like //bugzilla.mozilla.org/, Firefox should redirect to
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/, don't you think?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the URL bar and type an http URL without the protocol character ("http:").
2.Press enter.

Actual Results:
The firefox think I want to access a file: "The file ... cannot be found.
Please check the location and try again."

Expected Results:
Insert the default protocol ("http:") to the URL and open the web page.

If the thing is that we have a different behaviour with FF in Linux than in
Windows, why? shouldn't we try to get thing easier and the same for all
platforms/OS's?
