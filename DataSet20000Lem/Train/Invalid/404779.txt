When the pointer is hovered over an image which ha a "title" tag, the title tooltip appears correctly. But if the pointer is moved to any other page element that ha no title assigned, the title previously displayed a a tooltip. This is only reset when the pointer hovers over another element with a title. That tooltip is then displayed over everything else. This behaviour even persists across tabs, so I am actually seeing tooltips from the page in another tab while I type this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://www.suffolkcamra.co.uk/pubs/
2. Hover pointer over the picture of a pink pub in the top-left corner.
3. Title text "Click here to return to the front page" appears a a tooltip.
4. Hover pointer over any paragraph on the page or on the picture below the "pick a town or village" drop-down.
5. "Click here to return to the front page" appears a a tooltip.
6. Hover pointer over one of the small flag icons.
7. Foreign language tooltip appears.
8. Repeat step 4.
9. The same foreign language tooltip appears.
Actual Results:
Inappropriate tooltip appears

Expected Results:
No tooltip should appear over a page element without a "title" tag.
