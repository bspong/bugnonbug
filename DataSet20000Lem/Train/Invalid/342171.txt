While messing around with encryption thing using php's mcrypt() functionality I entered the result of encryption into the url bar. The way in which I arrived at the string entered are not important a they are separate events. The string entered is "Êƒü-|JûE¶3Ö£E9/Žjp^2/P¿_­e‹â¡" (without the quotes).

When one type carriage return, it come up with a download box from a site called http://www.localhikes.com.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type Êƒü-|JûE¶3Ö£E9/Žjp^2/P¿_­e‹â¡ in the address bar
2. Submit
3. You may wish to download and inspect this file. For obvious reasons, i haven't

Actual Results:
Download box opens, file from localhikes.com, from seemingly invalid url

Expected Results:
Error in syntax, page not found...

Using default theme, a couple of tab open, no proxy, firewall / antivirus active. Everything a usuall. I imagine it's something to do with the way in which the browser validates/changes entry to the url bar; this url can't exist, surely.
