Stray text about Firefox trademark at end of credits, even in unbranded build
Created attachment 285649
refactor trademark text

step to reproduce:
1. download a minefield nightly from:
2. install it.
3. run it.
4. help>about minefield

actual results:
©1998-2007 Contributors. All Rights Reserved. Firefox and the
Firefox logo are trademark of the Mozilla Foundation. All right
reserved. Some trademark right used under license from The
Charlton Company.

expected results:
no mention of Firefox nor Charlton. For people who are curious, in some jurisdiction it seems we're using the word Firefox under license from them.

This bug is not critical, however I believe we should fix it, a it doe bother my licensing feelings.

I'm doing two other thing in my initial patch:
1. per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved - I'm removing the sentence from each about instance.
2. I'm adding a slot for an extra trademark bit. I didn't know about Charlton, but conceivably it should be possible for a Gecko application to want add a trademark license to it and all brandings, I'd rather they not have to do this work later.

I'm asking for review from mitchell and gavin. I'm hoping not to need to get extra review for each application, however if people object or are concerned, I can push for firefox now and the others later.
