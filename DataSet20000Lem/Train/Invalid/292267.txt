double-dash within an HTML comment tag break the comment tag
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050223 Firefox/1.0.1

When a double-dash is found inside a comment tag, e.g.

<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/footer--main.lbi" -->

Firefox drop the "<!" from the front and render the remainder of the comment
tag visibly on the page, e.g.

-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/footer--main.lbi" -->

Changing the "--" in the middle, e.g. footer-main.lbi, fixed the rendering
problem. My guess would be that Firefox's tag parser is looking for the next
occurrence of "--" instead of "-->" to determine when the tag is "closed".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insert an HTML comment field into an HTML file. In the text surrounded by the
start and end comment indicator ("<!--" and "-->", respectively) insert a
double dash "--".
2. View the file in FireFox

Actual Results:
The leading part of the comment tag disappears from the view file, exposing
whatever text wa inside the comment tag.

Expected Results:
Not rendered the comment tag at all. Firefox is mis-parsing the comment tag
content in violation of HTML.
