Browser lockup on Vista 64, also other apps lockup afterward

This is a very difficult bug because it is impossible to forcibly reproduce in my experience. The problem appeared after updating 3.0.8 to 3.0.10, and persists in the current 3.0.11. In my experience it is dependent on 64-bit Vista running the normal 32-bit Firefox public release. I run the full Vista Aero desktop.

After browsing for long period of time (usually once or twice a day) Firefox may suddenly lock up and show a (Not Responding). All FF window will become unavailable when this happens. Firefox may or may not be killable via Task Manager at this point.

Even if Firefox is killed and restarted, some malaise still persists in the system that will cause other apps to start locking up, often while trying to do filesystem access in the vicinity of the user's Windows home directory (IE, saving a file to My Documents from Notepad may jam.)

Shutting down Windows at this point may take several attempts, may take a long time to actually finish the logout/saving user data stage, or may fail to ever shut down at all.

I know the nature of this bug make it seem like it is NOT caused by Firefox. However, the issue definitively arrived along with FF 3.0.10, and regressing Firefox to 3.0.8 make the problem go away. I did not test 3.0.9. Switching to other browser (Chrome) also avoids the problem.
