Prefer toolbar name over name in other menu when importing bookmark
On import when there are duplicate item with the same URI, whichever one wa defined last get the global title for the item. Instead, we should use, in order of preference: (1) the name in the toolbar, (2) the name in a submenu of the toolbar, (2) some other name. This will reduce the pain of having a unique title by giving the name most likely to be customized.
