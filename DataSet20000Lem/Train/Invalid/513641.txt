The problem begin when I log in at the above address, it's our site CMS. If I login, leave the keyboard alone, the browser crashes, with no error message. If I do perform an action after logged in, I don't get to do much before a crash.

This happeneda lot in FF3.0, wa better in v3.5,and is the worst it's ever been in v3.5.2. Changes that may have bearing on this - I installed Snow Leopard on Friday.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Hard to give you precise instruction on this, it would result in me giving you logins to our CMS. The CMS in question is called Aurora.
Actual Results:
The browser crashes, no error message, just the window asking to report the problem to Mozilla.


This is only a problem while in/on our CMS. I can browse, visit all manner of other site without an issue.

I am using the default 3.5.2 theme.
