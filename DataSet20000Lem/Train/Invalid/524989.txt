If your create a form field of type text and name it the same a a password field, pressing the down arrow in that field will show you a list of remembered form data for password type field of the same name from a different page. Example exploit.
* Your daughter ha an account on myspace and you want to know the username and password.
* Form auto-complete must be enabled the last time she logged in.
* You find the field name of the username and password on myspace.
* you create a html document with the following form fields.
<form>
<input type='text' name='myspace-user-field-name' />
<input type='text' name='myspace-pass-field name' />
</form>
* browse to the new html document
* click in to a field and press the down arrow key. Yoou will be given a list of all form data entered in to field named the same.
* since the password field is a text type it display the password in plain text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable form auto-complete feature
2.Log in and out of any website
3.Create special web page with two form field that have the same name a the target website but set the type for both field to TEXT
4.Browse to new page, select a field and press the down arrow
5.You will see a list of all form data for any field with the same name
Actual Results:
You are shown, in plain text, the form data (including passwords) of any field (from any website) with the same name.

Expected Results:
Password field data should only be completed if the field type match the original field. Presumably 'PASSWORD'

I am not sure if you can simulate the same behavior using a script embeded in a web page. If you can, this bug is much worse.
