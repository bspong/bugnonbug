I have a new server with Apache. It wasn't configured for shtml (SSI)
originally, unbeknownst to me. I opened the URL with firefox and the index.shtml
page wa rendered a text/plain (from tools->page info)

So I went into Apache and reconfigured it. It then worked fine on MSIE 5.5. In
firefox, however, it still appeared a plain text. I know it not firefox
caching the content a well, a I changed the page, and the content of the shtml
file when i checked again wa the updated content, but it wa being rendered a
text/plain.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable Options +Includes in apache for this directory
2. Load the URL (http://www.adamfowler.co.uk/articles/index.shtml)
3. Enabled Options +Includes and restart apache
4. Change the page content so we know it been modified
5. Either hit refresh in firefox, or clear cache and restart, and see the
updated content rendered a text/plain.

Actual Results:
Page wa still rendered a plain text, not html

Expected Results:
realised a different MIME type wa being sent by Apache and re-rendered the content.
