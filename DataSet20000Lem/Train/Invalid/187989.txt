The practice of hiding some setting under 'advanced' is unhelpful - it just
mean that there are two place to look for every change. By what rule is
'animated image loop only once' "advanced", but 'always use my fonts' is not?
It's not apparent to me, except by reference to where they were historically.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Decide to change a preference
2. Tools -> Preferences
3. Search linearly through preference category until you see the desired
setting or reach the end
4. Click on 'Advanced'
5. Search linearly through preference category until you see the desired
setting or reach the end
6. (optional) repeat from step 3 looking more closely

Actual Results:
I bugzillad and found that 'empty cache' is now under Privacy

Expected Results:
Don't know
