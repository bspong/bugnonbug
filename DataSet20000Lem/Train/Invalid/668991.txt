Expected results:


firefox 5.0 contact google even with the firewall set a "not allowed to act a server" it try to push something unknown through. the fact that the transfer actually start indicates that it IS acting like a server or trojan. if it doe not happen for you it may already have pushed something through so suggest reinstall on computer that ha not connected to internet. when i looked at the PID of the open port is showed the firefox process. the ip it contact go through google. google ha no right to track when i am online. when i enter a search that moment in time only if fine for them to know a search is being done but not to collect anything from my computer. no matter if i have a google account or not.

option advanced update "automatically check for update to" firefox addons search engine all unchecked. should not update without permission. i do not believe that what is being pushed through is a search engine update. i suspect it is google annallitics spyware. backdoor pun intended.

better privacy ha disable ping tracking checked so i also want to know what cause firefox to contact google. i separated the bookmark from this a a separate issue because i believe it is.

virus scanner and antispyware used and did not show anything that should contact google.

this should obvious but going to say it anyway. did not start happening until upgrade.

homepage set to about blank
