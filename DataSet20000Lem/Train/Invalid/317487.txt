Firefox 1.5 enumerates GeckoActiveXObject
As of bug 308856 enumerating the window object find the GeckoActiveXObject constructor, whereas in 1.0 it did not. The function existed in 1.0, however, and it's not any more functional now in 1.5, just more visible.

Since we don't actually support any ActiveX control by default we probably would be happier if it were non-enumerable, but I don't think it's actually hurting anything.
