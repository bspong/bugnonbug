After I have successfully loaded www.potterybarn.com and successfully logged in
under my user ID, I am unable to open image to view the items. When I
right-click an image, I click "View Image" only to get a blank page. In the
Address bar is "http://127.0.0.1:1030/bug.cgi" Also down below in the status bar
I see" Waiting for a451.g.akamai.net. I use MacAfee Security including Virus
Scan, Spy Sweeper, and Zone Alarm Security. Again I stress this is the only
website I am having problem with.
