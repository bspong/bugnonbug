Our biz card have individual web page address for our performer (www.partymagic.info/deebest). In Safari (on my Mac) or in Internet Explorer on my PC, I can key this url in and get right to the page. In Firefox (the latest build), when I key this in, a small window pop up asking me to "Open deebest" which is an application/octet stream from http://www.partymagic.info What should Firefox do with this file?"
