This is a ridiculous bug and I'm sure it'll be hard for you folk to fix. Still, it's gotten me to the point that I'm using IE now and I HATE IE.

I downloaded the latest nightly zip file and ran Firefox. Went to http://staff.varhosting.net - the page load fine.

However, the moment I start typing my username in the first field, it hangs. I can't do anything about it other than killing the app with the Task Manager.

It is independent of any profile setting because it's a fresh installation. I feel like it ha to do with some latest Windows XP update and I wish I could tell you more. Really sad. :-(
