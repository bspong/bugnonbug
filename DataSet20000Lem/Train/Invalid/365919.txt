Since switching to Firefox 2 from 1.5, I've encountered the following problem: After any length of time using certain other application (including Google Talk, Crossword Compiler, CGoban, KoLMafia, the website OKCupid), I begin to experience problem with the autocomplete function in Firefox's address bar: When I type a letter or two of a frequently visited site, it take a long time to complete the URL, or it never completes it at all. Two other problem accompany this one: Web page such a Gmail lose their ability to open a new browser window using an alias -- the new window get stuck on the alias URL -- and, if I let the problem go without restarting or rebooting, all search engine disappear from my Google Toolbar. (When the bug reach this point, restarting Firefox doe not fix the problem -- I have to reboot. If I restart Firefox before this point, the bug is usually corrected, though it reappears later. Closing Firefox often cause other slowed-down program to snap back to life.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
N.B. Because it usually take at least an hour or two for this problem to emerge, I haven't tried to reproduce it under controlled condition -- it would take forever and keep me from using my computer for other things. Lately, however, it doe happen every session.

1. Run Firefox and keep it running, with Gmail open in one window.
2. Run any two of the program listed above.
3. Wait a long time. Do other stuff while you wait.
4. Type the first one or two letter of a URL into the address bar.
Actual Results:
- All program begin to slow down. Alt-Tabbing from one to another result in delay and temporary screen artifacts.
- The vertical text insertion cursor disappears, and the program appears to hang.
- Nothing appears if you try to pull down the address history.
- Clicking on link in Gmail produce empty window with a Gmail alias URL, not the URL linked to, in the address bar.
- Java application take an inordinately long time to load.

Expected Results:
The same seamless behavior obtained with earlier browser and earlier in the current browser session.

I use the Qute theme. When I first upgraded to Firefox 2, I also upgraded the User Agent Switcher; upon hearing that it wa responsible for some problems, I uninstalled it, but the problem ha persisted.
