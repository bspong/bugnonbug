Go to https://www.thepiratebay.org/ The certificate is only valid for thepiratebay.org

(Error code: ssl_error_bad_cert_domain)

But if you go to thepiratebay.org it will work,i think ssl must be done so that if the site match *thepiratebay.org to work,i seen many problem like this on site telling the site ha bad cert domain,i think this is a bug that must be fixed. If a site match thepiratebay.org and you visit www.thepiratebay.org i think it must accept it a it's the same domain,https://www.thepiratebay.org and https://thepiratebay.org


Reproducible: Always
