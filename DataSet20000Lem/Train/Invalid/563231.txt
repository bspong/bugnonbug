I have a plug-in called All-Glass-Firefox, work great, it make firefox fully transparent, problem is that firefox 3.6.3 didn't had any problem with it, but 3.6.4 sometimes doesn't recognizes it, and instead of transparent firefox you get the same look like Vista without the Aero UI. And not to mention Adobe Flash Plug-in crash a LOT with 3.6.4 , early version had a few problem but 3.6.4 is horrible with Flash crash :(.
And some of my plug-in like BitDifender Anti Phishing Toolbar witch worked great with 3.6.3, doesn't work in 3.6.4. So, yah, there are a few bugs.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Youtube.
2. Type something that you know is gonna be a large file, wait fot it to load a bit, and click the play button, sometimes it freezes, Flash crash and firefox need to file a crash report :)
Actual Results:
Not always, but firefox crashed a few time because the Adobe Flash Plug-in :(

Expected Results:
Not crash :))

I see a lot of improvement since the last last (3.6.3) version, however there are a few bug to workout with the new one. So guys, when should we expect Firefox 4, with tab placed above the adress bar, fully transparent , with FTP built in and possibly with a download accelerator built in also, something like "Down them all" but without having to install it . And most off all, i'm sure everyone hate this part, how can we install all our favorite plug-in easily without having to manually install them every time? Something like a service, that will remember my user name and password on your website, them save a list of my favorite plug-in there, and the next time i install firefox again, just with a few click, I should have it all back, just like that !
There are a few plug-in that pretty much do that, but it is complicated, because i have to install them first and them log in, and open another plug-in and .. bla, bla, bla .. to damn complicated, it should be simple.
You've already proven that Firefox is the best browser, now ... take u to the next level, please !!!
