Actual Results:
When using Firefox please note that the the button in the first row of the table is askew. When you use Explorer they are not.

Expected Results:
All button and all cell are defined the same so there should be no difference in their display.

If you go to source and copy the first row of button and paste it in before the existing first row creating a new row for a total of four row the problem get corrected on the second row but now appears again on the new first row.

This is a cosmetic problem but it is important to my website and I would like to get it fixed a I wish to recommend the use of FireFox for my subscribers.
