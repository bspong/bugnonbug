Any linked image of a button such a search, or the Find button that is located on bugzillas main page doe not work. I click on it to progress and the page just sits there. This is a problem on every site that contains a linked image of a button. I have uninstalled the browser and reinstalled including safe mode and the problem still exists. This happens a soon a I open firefox for the first time of the day and at any time it is opened.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
after clicking button the Find, Search or Next action should start and bring me to the next page.
