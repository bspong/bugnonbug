Was at URL (no other tabs) and had Firefox and another application running.
Firefox wa not minimised, but behind other window. Used Alt-Tab to bring
Firefox back to front, which it did, but immediately received error:

MS Visual C++ Runtime Library
Program: C:\PROGRA~1\Mozilla\Firefox\firefox.exe

R6025
- pure virtual function call

The Talkback agent wa not started. Using the default theme and few extensions;
don't have access to the machine right now but if a list of the installed
extension would be useful I can get it.

Checked SHA1 sum of Firefox's Program Files folder against my workstation and
they all checked out OK.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Could not reproduce.
Actual Results:
Firefox exited without launching Talkback.

Expected Results:
Let me continue reading the news. ;-)
