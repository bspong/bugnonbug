Hi all
Ive recently installed Firebird on RedHat 9 KDE.
What I'd like to know is whats the correct command for launching it.
My newsreader, Pan need to know this, in Pan preference I have;
mozilla-firebird %s
this sort of work but if Firebirds allready running it try to start a
new Firebird profile and asks me to create one
All i really want is a new firebird window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Have firebird allready running then try to open another instance from a link in
email etc

Actual Results:
profile manager pop up asking to create new profile

Expected Results:
Should re-use existing (running) profile and just launch new window
