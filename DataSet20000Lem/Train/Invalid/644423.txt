Outlook web client doe not work with Firefox 4, give ssl_error_renegotiation_not_allowed error
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.20.25 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.4 Safari/533.20.27
Build Identifier: Firefox 4

I get to the log-in screen for company Outlook, then cannot connect after logging in. No problem w/ older Firefox or with Camino.
I get this screen, with a yellow warning triangle. If I can't get to Outlook, Firefox 4 is no good for me.
