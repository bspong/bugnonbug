Tab close unexpectedly, when clicking on it (touchpad: synaptics driver sends middle-click instead of left-click)

When switching between 2 existing tabs, the tab I want to switch to unexpectedly closes. No error message shown whatsoever, the crashed tab is listed in History->Recently closed tabs. Unfortunately i have no idea how to reproduce this. It happens frequently, but is not restricted to the case, when the second tab is still loading.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
