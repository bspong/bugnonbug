Hey. I have a problem with Firefox constantly hanging on startup. I've been browsing all sort of information on how to eliminate this problem but I've had no luck so far. One tip wa to create a new Profile, which I did. This solves the problem for a short period, then the browser is back in business hanging for at least a minute on startup.
During this process of creating a new profile, I discovered that Firefox creates two set of Mozilla folder on my harddrive. One is created in <code>C:/Documents and Settings/User/Application Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/</code>, and the other one is created in <code>C:/Documents and Settings/User/Local Settings/Application Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/</code>. Why doe Firefox need two separate, but identical, Profile folders? Is there something strange going on with my system?

The bug is present regardless of plugins and theme used.
