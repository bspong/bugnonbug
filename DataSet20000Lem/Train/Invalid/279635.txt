help! help! firefox won't visibly launch!
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: firefox 1.0 in window xp

my firefox no longer will launch -- at least not visibly. this happened after i
tried to install the extension del.ici.ous. i've uninstalled and reinstalled
the browswer. i've eliminated all files, cooky and object through the msie
browser. i've used three virus checks, all of which said no viruses. i've run
anti-spyware software to no avail. interestingly, perhaps, i've also lost the
ability to raise link contained in outlook express e-mails. also of possible
interest, the re-install process often throw up a notice that it will close
down version of foxfire that are running, even though i don't have any visual
indication of the browswer. but right now, i just want to be able to use
firefox again. don't know if this problem is repeatable because i have no
browser! (and if i get my browser back, i won't be eager to try to reproduce
this disaster). basically, you click on the desktop shortcut icon, you get an
hourglass for a few second, the computer crank a bit, then silence and nothing
on the screen. any help you could give me would be greatly, greatly appreciated.
thank you so much.
