After I installed this add-on extension entitled "Tabbrowser Extensions"
by Shimoda Hiroshi, I restarted FireFox and a 'Program Error' window screen
popped up saying that "firefox.exe had generated error and had written an error
log." The Firefox program would not startup after this Tabbrowser Extensions
install had been completed. I Uninstalled FireFox, rebooted the PC, then
reinstalled Firefox application. Same thing occured since I could not uninstall
this stupid "Tabbrowser Extensions" app! So I created a New user profile under
Profile Manager in the Mozilla application and that wa the only way I could get
FireFox to start up and work without crashing out completely.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install this extension, "Tabbrowser Extensions"
by Shimoda Hiroshi.
2.Choose not to install the Japanese language files.
3.Restart Firefox
4.Tabbrowser Extensions will start up with option to select.
5.Once any of the option are choosen and you click ok to startup Firefox, the
Windows Program Error window pop up, see above for the rest of this story!

Actual Results:
read above

Expected Results:
I don't know since I never got this stupid "Tabbrowser Extensions"
by Shimoda Hiroshi program to ever work. Yank this dame thing off of your
Extensions List. It's a Joke to be sure!!!


I am using the default Firefox theme.
