When I upgraded from Firefox 3.5.4 to Firefox 3.6b1 I found that creating a new window is very slow. This happens when I use command-n, and also when I right-click on a link and choose "Open in New Window." There is a significant lag between the command and the appearance of a new window that wa not there in Firefox previously.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new window using any of the various method to do so.

Mac OS X 10.6.1. Occurs under any given memory/processor load.
