I looked up a picture on google, of a Ocelot. When a satisfactory image wa found and a picture displayed, I right clicked on the image and chose to save image as, which would have triggered a save a "download sort instance" (downsort 2-5-8) installed and reported compatible. No download window triggered and no download went through. I had to use copy image , and fire up irfanview, to paste the image from the clipboard into that application - then save it.
Further other extension also will not work.
I may revert to version 3 (or go to a competitor.
This is a case where not enough research went into the upgrade revision.
