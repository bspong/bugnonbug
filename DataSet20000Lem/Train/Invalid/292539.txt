If you see the little icon at the top of this page, it should be red one the
computer davidbergeron.yi.org is offline and green when it is online.

I try to change many thing to have it change, and if you look in the View Page
Info when it's online you see that the image is green with "En Ligne" text, so
it seems to work, but it does'nt show in the browser windows.

Like the Javascript document.images["name"].src work but not completly.

If you press the right button and click on "Properties" you will see the url
from the davidbergeron.yi.org web site.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just load the page, if the davidbergeron.yi.org web site is online it should not
take very long.


Actual Results:
If it's like here you should see the Red tag just on top of the Page Title logo.
But if you check the url of that image and try to open that url you should see a
green square with "En Ligne" text on it. (Just if my davidbergeron.yi.org is
online.)


Expected Results:
It should be the green with "En Ligne" on it that should appear there.
