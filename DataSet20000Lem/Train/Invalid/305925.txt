FF Browser & google.com search for any keywords doe not sure current google
listing & adwords - IE & NS google.com search doe show current listing and
adwords. I've noticed this for the last couple weeks, going crazy a to why my
adwords where not showing up. They do when using IE or NS browseres & google.com

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.OPen FF - use google.com - search key word "nipple jewelry" Odd listing & old
adwords
2.Open IE - use google.com - search keyword "nipple jewelry" Current listing &
adwords
3.Open NS - use google.com - search keyword "nipple jewelry" Current listing &
adwords.

Actual Results:
see above, sample keyword search. FireFox browser seems to return old or odd
results. Definately not current listing nor adwords.

Expected Results:
shown the same "current" result a found when using IE and/or NS

Bug may be minor to you, but to company paying for adwords and/or top ten
listing are losing sale from customer using FoxFire browser, this is a MAJOR
problem.
