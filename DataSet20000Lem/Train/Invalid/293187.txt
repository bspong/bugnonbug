Need global getSpecialFolderKey
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050402 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050402 Firefox/1.0+

The function getSpecialFolderKey is defined several time in Firefox (the
download manager and download pref related code to name but two uses).

The problem is that it is defined within other function and is not directly
accessible without overlaying lot of core code that I have no intention of using.

It would be preferable (at least to me) and probably logical to have
getSpecialFolderKey or an equivalent a a global Firefox function so that it can
be used by function other than those intended.

Normally I would simply replicate the code in case like this, but ifdefs are
used to select the appropriate OS for the return value, so I either have to
implement OS checking code or overlay code that I don't want.
