Trigger search from address bar with question mark
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Firefox allows me to enter search term directly in the address bar. However, if
any of the search term contain a dot, I need to prefix the query with the
string 'keyword:' - tedious.

Also, I don't feel very confident about Firefox's ability to automatically
distinguish between hostnames and keywords. (At one time, if I entered the name
of my development machine, but had forgotten to start the web server, I would
automatically get redirected to a site with nasty pictures...)

Therefore: Would it be possible to provide an option that, if set, would only
trigger web search if the entered string is prefixed by a question mark? (E.g.
"? firefox 1.0"). This would seem like a safe and convenient solution.
