Documentation state that CSS:margin Applies to: all element but setting margin for tr, td or th ha no effect (same in IE7)

I hope the documentation is right

As seen on my test-app there is no way to adjust space between cell-borders in a table



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run test-app



A fix for this would simplify and reduce the amount of code needed to control table-layouts very much

(usually done by removing cell-borders and inserting a block-level element with margin and borders)
