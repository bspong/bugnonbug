Form without action attribute isn't submitted when in XHTML

When a form element without an action attribute is submitted it is usually posted to the same URL it came from. This work in FF when the content type is text/html, but changing it to text/xml (assuming that it wa a well-formed XHTML document in the first place) will break this feature, and the submit button will have no effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a valid XHTML document with a form tag without an action attribute
2. Load the document in FF
3. Submit the form using a submit button (<input type="submit" />)

Actual Results:
The button is clicked but nothing happens. No new request is made to the server and no error is displayed.

Expected Results:
I'd expect it to behave the same way a non XHTML document behave - submit the form to the originating URL.

I've created an XHTML document a detailed above in a JSP file. Adding a single line at the top of the JSP fix the problem:
<% response.setContentType("text/html");%>

Of course, I loose XML validation this way.
