GTK error on mouseover of navigation button or personal toolbar bookmark

Moving my mouse over a navigation button, a personal toolbar bookmark, or any
other GTK button, the terminal I ran Firefox from is spammed with the following
messages:

(firefox-bin:12690): Gdk-CRITICAL **: file ../../gdk/gdkwindow.c: line 1846
(gdk_window_clear_area): assertion `GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed

(firefox-bin:12690): Gdk-CRITICAL **: file ../../gdk/gdkwindow.c: line 1846
(gdk_window_clear_area): assertion `GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed

(firefox-bin:12690): Gdk-CRITICAL **: file ../../gdk/gdkwindow.c: line 1846
(gdk_window_clear_area): assertion `GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed

This happens over and over, and there is a noticeable delay when mousing over
these buttons. It happens every time I use Firefox 0.9.1 and 0.9 GTK2-and-XFT
(haven't tried earlier). I can reproduce it on Mandrake 9.1 and 9.2, fully
patched. GTK 2.2.4 is the version used on Mandrake 9.2, I don't have my 9.1
system in front of me.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox in a terminal.
2. Mouse over any button.
3.

Actual Results:
At least 4 error message will be displayed for any given button, often more
than that.

Expected Results:
It should have done nothing, like Mozilla.
