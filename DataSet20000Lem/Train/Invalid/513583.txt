List of item displayed don't line up vertically when opening View in 3.5.2 Toolbar.

Whenever I open View in the main Toolbar, three item on the list displayed are no longer aligned in a straight column beginning next to the light vertical line.

The list look like this (with period representing an indent, since this Forum doesn't seem to allow indenting in posts.)

........Toolbars
....Status Bar
........Sidebar
....Adblock Plus: Blockable Items
........Stop
........Reload
........Zoom
........Page Style
........Character Encoding
........Page Source
....Full Screen

As you can see, the term Status Bar, Adblock Plus: Blockable Items, and Full Screen all begin to the [u]left[/u] of the light vertical line (which is in front of all the other terms).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open "View" in main Toolbar.
2. Look at list display.
3. Status Bar, Adblock Plus: Blockable Items, and Full Screen are not aligned with the rest of the list (all being to the left of the light vertical line).
Actual Results:
As noted.

Expected Results:
All item in list should be aligned evenly to the right of the light vertical line, a they are in all other Toolbar item (File, Edit, History, Bookmarks, Tools, Help).

This only seems to happen in build 3.5.2.
