[RFE] Firebug should be included in Firefox, or perhaps Gecko
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I find it a little surprising that Firebug ha not been absorbed by Mozilla in some way. I see FF4 ha the web console, but it's just not the same.

The reason it surprise me is that Chrome and Safari (by way of webkit) and Opera include firebug-like tool by default. Furthermore, firebug wa the first of this type of tool and continues to edge the others to varying degrees.

One final note: this is obviously up to the Firefox devs, but it's possible this bug would be more appropriately logged against the engine (Gecko) a opposed to the product (Firefox), a Chrome and Safari's chosen rendering engine (WebKit) is what provides them with their similar tool.

Reproducible: Always
