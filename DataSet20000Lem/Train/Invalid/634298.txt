I run a cyber cafe and an engg student .many time we have to browse lot of page and want to go back...we cant always keep on clicking back key all the time to go to the nth last page. so i request u to kindly include a feature in which we can see all the page visited while clicking the back key so that we can directly jump to a particular page.
thanks mozilla..

Reproducible: Always
