Honestly, do you have any idea HOW BLOODY LONG I spent accumulating those bookmarks? Ya they're on a backup server. But your bloody browser can;t bloody import them. Thank god the old version is still on your server. God this fucking sucks. You shipped this?? Do you know how many time Microsoft software BLEW AWAY my personal data?? ZERO FUCKING TIMES. ZERO. So ya, go talk smug shite about Microsoft, and take Google's money. Just know that you don't hold a candle to Redmond's work.
