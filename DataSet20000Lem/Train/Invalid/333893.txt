Places popup appears below/behind firefox when trying to remove it
1. Open place popup by clicking on the place button.
2. Click anywhere else, even the place button will do fine

Observe how the place popup is below the firefox screen by moving the window away from it current position.

Clicking again on the place button will make the popup dissapear.

Desired result: Popup should not move below/behind firefox window but dissapear entirely when clicking outside the popup or on the button
