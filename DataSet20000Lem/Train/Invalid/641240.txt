Link hover bar doesn't revert to left side immediately after closing find bar
On opening the find bar, the link hover box move immediately to the right side of the screen. On closing, however, the box remains on the right until you next mouse over a link. This mean that if a document is loading, all of the status message are displayed on the right side of the screen, which is not ideal.
