I had an overloaded CPU malfunction this week ( 6/7th Dec 2010 ) which gave me heap of trouble. My Task Manager showed the CPU running at 100% for period far too long, when I opened FireFox. I tried all sort of thing to clear the problem but closing FireFox left me with CPU 50 – 55%, which slowed everything else down to almost stop. Using Safe Mode I wa able to run SpyBotSD and discovered three entry in Documents and Settings which read something like this:

PlatinumAdvertiser/www.downloaditfree.com/avast..xyxy etc etc…BOOKMARK

I concluded that Avast and FireFox were somehow connected and uninstalled the Avast application. But I wa still stuck with slow PC functions. I got SpyBot up and running again and it rediscovered the same entry in Documents and Settings. SpyBot cannot “fix” this problem. I uninstalled FireFox with Revo Uninstaller which discovered/selected a whole raft of apparently infected file which I deleted a per instructions. There were something like 5000 item I deleted. My PC then started to behave properly with one exception. All my internet setting were lost and a I am no IT expert I had to resort to my ISP phoneline helper who finally discovered that the “DNS cache” wa overloaded which I think in part, kept the CPU running at 100% !! A circular function of some sort I think. The DNS cache prevented my reconnecting to the net a well because the the cache function wa preventing in the Windows connection “repair” function. My ISP helper got me to run a test in DOS mode which “flushed” the DNS cache ( a I understand it ). He also got the rest of my setting corrected and I am now back on line.

I hope that this is something your expert have already become aware of and can solve, a I really do like FireFox and ant to keep using it.
