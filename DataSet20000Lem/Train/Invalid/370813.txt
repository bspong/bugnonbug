Hi,
(As per Ubuntu bug 53092 https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/53092 )
It seems odd to me that FIREFOX_DSP is an environment variable while almost everything else is adjustable a a config/preference - even if it wa only in about:config.
It's a pretty common problem for user and it really doesn't feel right, and it seems nasty for people to have to get out a shell to fix something that should just work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.


Expected Results:
A prefernce setting for the same option that FIREFOX_DSP drives.
