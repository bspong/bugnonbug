I am using Ubuntu 5.04. I had problem before, so I reinstalled Ubuntu. I just
got everything working. Then I made keyboard shortcut like I had before. I went
to the System menu, then preferences, then keyboard shortcuts. After that "p",
some arrow keys, and some others quit working. When I make a shortcut for a
right arrow key, it show a 0x66, 0x64 for left arrow key, and 0x21 for "p"
key. I went back and removed all the keyboard shortcuts. That did not fix the
problem. Most people do not know how to fix this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type the non-working key anytime
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Keys are not shown on the screen, or do not work.

Expected Results:
The software should have let me create some keyboard shortcut without problems.
I have to copy and paste "p" everytime I want to use it.
