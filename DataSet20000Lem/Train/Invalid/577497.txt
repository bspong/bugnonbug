browser ignoring tabMinWidth and tabClipWidth
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:2.0b2pre) Gecko/20100708 Minefield/4.0b2pre

First noticed with the nightly build for June 5th. In about:config, browser.tabs.tabClipWidth and browser.tabs.tabMinWidth setting have no impact on the width of the tabs. Have tried different value to the same effect (after restarting the browser).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use about:config to change the value of browser.tabs.tabClipWidth and browser.tabs.tabMinWidth
2. See that the tab don't change their width.
3. Profit.
Actual Results:
Nothing, which is the problem. The tab don't resize.

Expected Results:
Up to and including the nightly build for June 4th, the tab would resize based on the setting in browser.tabs.tabClipWidth and browser.tabs.tabMinWidth.

I typically have browser.tabs.tabClipWidth and browser.tabs.tabMinWidth set to 20 and 18 respectively (I normally have a large number of tab open, and immediately noticed that the tab weren't shrinking down to the size I'd set).
