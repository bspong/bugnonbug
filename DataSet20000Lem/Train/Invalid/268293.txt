This is new with RC2. I didn't notice any problem with RC1 or before. The
yahoo StatTracker Java applet is not displaying correctly. Any change in the
screen - pressing a button or even putting the window in the back cause part or
most of the screen to go blank.
I am using the latest Mac OS X Java machine. Safari handle this correctly.
For some reason, Java 1.4.2 is loaded on this machine, but about:plugins show
Mozilla using 1.3.1
I found some similar bugs, but nothing that seemed directly the same.
Maybe pertinent - I just updated to 10.3.6, however Safari is still working
correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to yahoo fantasy football
2. select the classic StatTracker program
3. click on one of the matchup on the left side of the screen
4. or bring another window to the front.

Actual Results:
part or all of the screen just go blank. You can bring part of it back
temporarily by clicking on different part of the screen.

Expected Results:
displayed all the information correctly
