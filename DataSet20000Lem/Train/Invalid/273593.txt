File -> Close should NOT close all browser

I've found that the behavior between the close button (the "X" on Windows
machines) and the File -> Close menu option is not the same and this is very
annoying. If you simply click on the "X" it close only that browser. However,
if you go to File -> Close, it close all instance of Firefox. Either there
should be a separate menu option for "Close All Windows" or it simply should
behave like IE since a recent Firefox migrator like myself will become
frustrated very fast when you spend all day at work with 10-20 browser window
open to accidentally close them all without any dialog unless one of them ha
tab open.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two or three Firefox instance that do not have tab open under them.
2. Go to File -> Close
3. Curse many time because you have to go and open all those window back up.

Actual Results:
All window are closed.

Expected Results:
Close only the current window.
