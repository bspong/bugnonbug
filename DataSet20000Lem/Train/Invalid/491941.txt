After a while whenever a Fire Fox window is inactive, my entire system restarts. I don't know much else, except that this happens even if the separate window is Fire fox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Fire Fox
2. Open new window of any kind
3. Wait a while.
Actual Results:
System completely restarts.

Expected Results:
Not restarting completely.

I'm fairly certain that it happens no matter what, some program take longer than others though.
