After some time, Firefox constantly take about 10% CPU time in average (according to "top"), even when it is iconized. It doesn't make the machine slow, but this problem still ha an annoying consequence: it make the machine very noisy, because every few second the fan is going at a full speed.

After closing the window and reopening the last session, the Firefox CPU usage is back to a reasonable value: about 0.3%.

Reproducible: Sometimes




There are a lot of open bug concerning CPU usage problem, but a lot of them seem to be different, and here, it disappears after reopening the session (but not for a long time). I think that I've never had such a problem under Linux.
