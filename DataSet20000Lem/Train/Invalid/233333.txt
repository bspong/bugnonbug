Images that are enclosed in <a> (link) tag are often not displayed.

In the link that I've provided, the image of the cover of the book (immediately
to the left of pricing information) doe not display.

I have also boiled this down to a simpler HTML page that includes the image in
question in a couple of different configurations:

http://www3.telus.net/ccwall/Firebird-bug.html

As illustrated there, the image doe display sometimes. Also, clicking on the
region where the image should be displayed follows the link, and right-clicking
on it provides a context-menu with image-related features--so the image is
there; it's just not being displayed.

This occurs in both Firebird 0.7 and 0.8 (the latest one I could find). It doe
not occur (i.e., all three image are displayed) in Mozilla 1.6.
