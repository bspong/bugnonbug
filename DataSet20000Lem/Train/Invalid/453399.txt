If Firefox is the default browser, is not already running, there is more than one Firefox profile (with neither being set a default), and then Firefox is then launched either by clicking a web shortcut, or via a request from an application attempting to launch the default browser, Firefox will load about 9 MB of itself and immediately hang (i.e. the process halt and will not proceed). Normally, at about the point where Firefox is hanging is where it would normally display the Profile Manager. However, the Profile Manager dialog doe not show.

This bug exists in 3.x, but worked properly in 2.0.0.x

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Profile Manager to create more than one profile, but make sure neither one is set a default
2. Create a web shortcut then exit Firefox
3. Attempt to launch Firefox via the web shortcut

Firefox should fail to load. If you check Task Manager, you will notice the Firefox process stalled and showing about 9 MB memory usage. What you should have gotten wa Profile Manager.

Actual Results:
Firefox process stall with about 9 MB memory consumption.


Expected Results:
Firefox should have displayed Profile Manager, allowing a profile to be selected so that the process could continue loading.
