User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/530.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/530.15
Build Identifier:

When specifying a font-family to use Futura Consended Medium, no matter how it is being specified Firefox will not render the actual font, and will instead fall back to something else.

By comparison, Safari support it under the "Futura-CondensedMedium" syntax, which may not be the most intuitive but at least there is an option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Specify something to use font-family: "Futura-CondensedMedium"
2. observe lack of actual font being used
Actual Results:
Firefox us different font entirely, whatever you specify a the first fallback after Futura Condensed Medium.

Expected Results:
I expected the right typeface to be shown.
