When you have two or more instance of Firefox running and doubleclick the tabbar in one of the them to open a new tab, instead two new tab are opened. This only happens if more than one firefox window is open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox and open a website
2. Open another firefox and open another website
3. Doubleclick the tabbar in the second firefox instance
Actual Results:
Two blank tab are created

Expected Results:
One blank tab should be created

I have several plugins installed like
Tabbrowser preference 1.3.1.1
IE Tab 1.3.2.20070404

These could possible have an effect on this behaviour
