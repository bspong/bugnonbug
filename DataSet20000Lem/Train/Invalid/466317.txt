View Source, reloads the page instead of using already downloaded data

When I click on "View Source", browser reloads the content, instead of showing the source code of the already downloaded page. The consequence are:

1) Browser make an unnecessary request to the server
2) Source code in the second request is not necessarily the same a in the first one, specially with POST requests, but even with GET one

I am not sure if this happens always, or only if the page indicates the browser not to cache the content. It happens for sure in some web project I developed. When it is a page obtained by post, it even tell that data must be sent to the server

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load any web page
2.Clear the browser cache (Just the cache, is not necessary to clear sessions). This is not needed if the page hint the browser not to cache content
3.Disconnect from the network
4.Click on "View Source"

Actual Results:
The browser is not able to show the page source, a it try to get it from the network, and network is not available

Expected Results:
Browser should show the source of the already loaded source
