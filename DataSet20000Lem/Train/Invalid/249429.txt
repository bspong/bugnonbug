User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

When I right click on an image that doe not have an extension in the filename
(e.g. photo1, not photo1.gif) and select Save Image As, the image is saved with
a .htm extension on the file name.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse to a web page that ha a GIF image without the .gif filename extension.
2.Right click on the image and choose Same Image As.

Actual Results:
The browser appended .htm to the image's filename.

Expected Results:
Two possibilities:

1) Saved the image without appending any extension to the filename.

2) (A better idea) The browser wa able to properly display the image, so it
must know that it is a GIF file. It should have given me the option to append
.gif to the filename.
