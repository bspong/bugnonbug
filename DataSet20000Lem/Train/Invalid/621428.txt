The new "close add-on bar" button can't be hidden with the customizer although it appears to be a draggable element.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. show add-on bar
2. right-click toolbars, "customize"
3. try to drag "close add-on bar" button out of add-on bar into customize box
Actual Results:
The button stay where it is.

Expected Results:
The button should have disappeared.

This button is technically redundant since the add-on bar can be closed through the toolbar right-click menu and unchecking "add-on bar". I'd even argue the usefulness of this button since it could create user confusion between that and closing the tab/window (actually I'd argue that the status bar should return or at least be an option without having to install 2 extensions, but that's neither here nor there).

It's annoying to me especially because I'm using userChromeJS and Status-4-Evar to get my status bar back, and the [X] being ever-present is visually distracting and I won't ever want to close the status bar. Also for consistency the button should be movable/removable like the other UI elements. I consider this a regression since the last beta let me emulate the old status bar with the above extensions, but this break that "classic" behavior.

Thanks
