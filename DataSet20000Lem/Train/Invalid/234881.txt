crash with "reload every" extension and two tabs, one with password autocomplete
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040212 Firefox/0.8

I experienced a crash after logging in on some web form on one page, enabling
"reload every" on that page, and then opening another web form for which firefox
know my username/password in another tab, and then closing this second tab.

If you look at the "steps to reproduce", I must admit that this is a pretty
special situation. I just think that since the "reload every" extension is
obviously involved in this crash, why should firefox be crashable by extensions?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install extension "reload every"
2. start firefox without any page (!no homepage!)
3. go to a page where you need to login (like an email service), then perform
the login, and then enable "reload every" via the right mouse button menu
4. open a new tab, and go to a page where you have your username/password stored
in firefox (but don't login)
5. after the second page ha fully loaded, close it by clicking the close button
to the right of the tab

(note that you need to do it exactly in this order. any browsing inbetween will
prevent firefox from crashing)
Actual Results:
Firefox crashed:
firefox exited with non-zero status (11)
