I downloaded 1.0.2 this morning, no longer display webmail logon page
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

Previously, using build 1.01, I wa able to logon to may cable ISP web mail
page.

This morning I installed build 1.02. I wa hoping you fixed the quality
feedback agent wanting to report user initiated exiting of Firefox a a
crash. You didn't, but this bug report is not about that.

To test your build, I went to my cable ISP webpage to see if I could log onto
the webmail function. I could not. When I click on the webmail icon, a
firefox browser instance is started that open the same page. I am not
presented with the weblogin page. BTW, I had logged in using build 1.01 this
morning, logged out, then installed build 1.02. The first time I logged into
the webmail, Firefox used my previous cached login credential and brought up
the webmail page. Which I thought wa odd. I rebooted the computer, which
cleared the cache, and I have the problem reported above. Additionally, while
writing this, I took the time to login to the webmail page using IE. It work
fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.optonline.net
2. Select "webmail" icon
3.

Actual Results:

Expected Results:
