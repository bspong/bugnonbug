some bug
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/8.0.552.237 Safari/534.10
Build Identifier: firefox 4 beta 11

I do not know English, I'm using Google translator, please be patient.

I'll report all the error I found this version.

1 - Not working shortcut CTRL + /
2 - When you close firefox, doe not appear the option to save, or alert you that closing more than one tab, we now have two open firefox, the message appears.
3 - When you hide the menu bar, new menu doe not appear in firefox display option and tools.
4 - When you do a search in the address bar, with just a word of error, when doing research work in two word correctly, this bug only happened in the window version, linux ubuntu, it work correctly.
5 - When you hide the menu bar, and Firefox is maximized, if you double-click on the bar where is the flap doe not open a new tab. If you use firefox without being maximized, it work normally. Now with the menu bar displaying work properly maximized, and also work without being maximized.
6 - If you do this with a few tab open, you close firefox, when you open it again, a square appears in the middle, with advice if you want to restore the tabs, but if you change your homepage, not to restore the tabs.
7 - If you restore the tabs, firefox tab open in a new window of firefox should open tab in firefox wa already open.

Some suggestions.

1 - When the option to save password, it would appear the three good options, it's somewhat annoying having to click the button to see the option not now or never save password on this site.
2 - The Portuguese translation for not now, is incorrect, the right would be "Não agora"
3 - It would be nice if it were a left sidebar, customize, add button to add, bookmarks, etc.. Or have the option to change the extension bar to the left.
4 - It would be nice to have an automatic translation.


For now it would be.

Reproducible: Always
