I wa in hotmail. Firefox asked if I wanted to update to this latest version. I clicked Yes. I tried to get on hotmail or google again and wasn't able to with Firefox, Seamobkey or IE. I wa still able to IM on MSN so I wa connected, but couldn't get into yahoo IM. I turned off the Windows Firewall, nothing happened. I un-installed Firefox and now I still can't get online and now can't MSN IM, but I checked the Network Connections and I'm still connected. Firefox's error console didn't show any errors.
