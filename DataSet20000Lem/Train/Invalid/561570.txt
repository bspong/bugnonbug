If I have been browsing in my current window for a while, and have not activated the "list all tabs" in some time, when I click on it, it turn blue but doe not show the drop-down menu with my tab listed. I have to click on it a second time to "de-activate" it, then a third time to actually activate the drop-down. If it ha recently been activated (within maybe 5 minute or so, though I haven't timed it formally), the color change and drop-down happen simultaneously a they should.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tab in Foxfire
2. Leave the "list all tabs" button alone for several minute (5+?)
3. Click the "list all tabs" button - it will change color but the drop-down will not show.
4. Click the button again to de-activate it.
5. Click the button one more time - it will change color and the drop-down will show.
Actual Results:
The drop-down menu take three click to activate instead of one.

Expected Results:
The menu should activate with only one click.

I am using the default theme.

I am using the following add-ons: FeedFilter, Firefox PDF Plugin for Mac, Flashblock, LiveJournal Addons, Session Manager, Undo Closed Tabs Button, AdBlock, Better Gmail, Delicious Bookmarks.
