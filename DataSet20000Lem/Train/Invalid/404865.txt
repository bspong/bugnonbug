Preferences window open with Content prefs preselected and clicking on all other preference pane doe nothing. Content prefs remain displayed. This worked fine in 3.0b1 but doesn't work in latest nightly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Preferences window
2. Try to select a preference pane other than Content
3. No response
