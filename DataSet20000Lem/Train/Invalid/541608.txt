the box appears in the top left of my screen and says;
ALERT
TYPEERROR

ha no property

I reinstalled firefox thinking that would solve the problem but the ALERT still appears.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on firefox symbol
2.ALERT appears
3.
Actual Results:
I have to click the firefox symbol again to gain access to firefox

Expected Results:
Gone directgly to firefox without the alert

I have never had a problem with firefox until I added an "update" from TATTOO
