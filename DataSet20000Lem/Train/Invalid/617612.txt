FIREftp
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6
Build Identifier: FF 4.06b

Can not get a ftp client to work in this build. I 'publish' my own set of web page and this is a premiere utility. Works fine in the FF 3 builds, is quick, easy, and while it may not do everything I need, ha been flawless in accomplishing what I have asked it do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FF 4+
2.Go to add-on
3.Try to install FIREftp
4. will indicate not able to install app.
Actual Results:
NO joy, what-so-ever.

Expected Results:
transfered file from my computer to Go-Daddy, who provides my domain & web page service.

Been waiting through the 4+ build for this easy problem to be resolved.
