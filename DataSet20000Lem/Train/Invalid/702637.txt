Location bar input not working first time in new tab

Steps to reproduce:

I open a new tab (either with a ctrl-t, or via le menu). I type text in the address bar and I hit return.


Actual results:

The tab text flash (like if the page were going to load) but the page doe not load. Instead, it's the start page that reloads.


Expected results:

The new address should load.
I've tried both typing a new address and choosing something from the dropdown list. Neither works.
This is a regression since I installed V8.

As a big user of bookmark keywords, this is very frustrating. I've been with firefox since firebird day and this ha gotten me thinking about switching...

Workaround: After the page fails to load the first time, thing start to work a they should. I retype the address I want or choose something from the dropdown and the browser works.
