When I put my desktop to sleep and wake it up, after 2 or more session of this, clicking on a Firefox window (usually with some type of webmail) cause the whole screen to blank to white. Unable to leave white screen with either (alt-tab, alt-f4, or ctl-alt-del).

Only started happening recently (after 5.02 patch).

Desktop is using an Nvidia card (8800gtx) latest driver and window vista 64 home premium (8gb of physical mem, no paging file). Quadcore 2.53Ghz.

Problem wa also reported on UMPCPortal.com a happening with a Gigabyte M912 netbook w/ Firefox.. no detail though.
