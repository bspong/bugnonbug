High cpu use since version 3.6.4

Showing cpu use

I am seeing 50% flat cpu use on my core 2 duo (one of the two core i guess at 100%) since installing 3.6.4 (also 3.6.6 which is what i am using, window xp) after browsing a few tab with flash content. I notice this after scrolling on a site slows down. I have 2 gig of ram.

My guess is that the cause involves the new process scheme developed for 3.6.4/3.6.6 to isolate plugins, since i am sure this didn't happen in 3.6.3

The intranet's homepage (i am at work) ha 6 flash animation (i know) but they are fairly simple. When i close it, cpu go down. When i open it back again, cpu stay down. After a while of browsing some page in tabs, cpu go back to 50%.

I don't know if this is caused by some page or if this is just time-related.

Sites that i frequently visit are:
docs.google.com
noticias24.com
slashdot.org

This is random, i can't reproduce it at will, but it happens everyday, so my guess is that this is a combination of flash use in site and time.

Tried to search for existing bug before posting, but didn't find one that exactly describes this situation.

Also, i am using adblock plus but I don't think it is causing this problem.

Please dupe or comment a necessary.
