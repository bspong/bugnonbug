If a Firefox profile is started with --profilemanager --no-remote parameter, external link can't opened with that profile
Steps to reproduce:

1) download and install the latest Fx trunk
2) create a shortcut to Fx with '--profilemanager --no-remote' parameter
3) open the link
4) select a profile, deselect 'Don't ask at startup' and start Fx
5) try to open a local page or a link from another app. Profile Manager must be shown
6) select the profile already in use and try to start

Actual result:
Profile Manager try to start another Fx process using the same profile, but this is not possible because it's already in use

Expected result:
the page or the link should be opened in a new tab of an already existing window of that profile.


Please someone can test this bug also on Linux and Mac?
