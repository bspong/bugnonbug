Minimized toolbar icon look like embryo

While overall the new branding of Firefox is outstanding, I think there is an
issue with the icon used when you minimize to the taskbar in Windows. Put
simply, the "fire fox" swirling around the globe is not plainly distinguishable,
and thus what it really look like is an embryo. I realize that this affect no
one, but perhaps just the Firefox head could be used when minimized? Other
application do this, it needn't be just a smaller version of the main icon.
Eudora for instance, minimizes to a picture of an "inbox", even though their
default icon is an envelope.
