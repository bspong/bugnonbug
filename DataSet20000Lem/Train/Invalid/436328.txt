The Google Web Toolkit (http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) us history token appended to the end of URLs in order to maintain state without refreshing the entire page. For example, GMail us URLs such a https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox and https://mail.google.com/mail/#starred to load different set of message without reloading the entire page. Firefox correctly note these a different page (even though the base URL is the same), but when using the Back/Forward button to navigate back and forth through series of such pages, the title shown in the back/forward button dropdown menu become switched. Specifically, if you start on page A and then navigate to page B, the page title are stored correctly and in the right order. However, if you then click on the back button to go back to page A, the entry in the back/forward button dropdown menu now depict two instance of page B rather than one of page A and one of page B with page B appearing after page A (chronologically). The original page title for page A ha been replaced by that of the page visited immediately before using the back/forward button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page A (e.g. https://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox).
2. Navigate to page B (e.g. https://mail.google.com/mail/#starred). Note that the two page are treated a different page and the ordering is correct if you view the dropdown menu for the back/forward button.
3. Open the dropdown menu for the back/forward button and click on the entry for page A (i.e. one page back). Alternatively, click the back button.
4. Open the dropdown menu again and note that the page title for page A (which is the current page) ha been replaced by the page title for page B. The title of the window ha been changed correctly, but the page title shown in the dropdown menu doe not match.
Actual Results:
In the back/forward button dropdown menu, the page title for page A (which is the current page) ha been replaced by the page title for page B. The title of the window ha been changed correctly, but the page title shown in the dropdown menu doe not match.

Expected Results:
The back/forward button dropdown menu should display title for page A and page B with page B after page A (chronologically). The current history item in the dropdown menu should also match the window title.

Performed on a new installation of Firefox 3 RC1 in Windows XP SP3. Also appears in new installation of Firefox 2.0.0.14 in Windows XP SP3 and Windows 2000 SP4.
