The pie-chart throbber wa implemented in Bug 334697.

Comparing to the old throbber, the pie-chart throbber is much more opaque and look almost like a black circle, when it's near finishing loading (for example if one small image or script is taking very long to load).

There are a few problems:
* The color of progress bar is in most current OS blue or green, and throbbers and other loading indicator are bright gray in most cases.
* When at almost 100%, the current pulsating black circle look very unusual, almost like a broken favicon or an evil black hole, it doesn't tell the user the (usual) positive message of "hooray, loading is finished in a second".
* The dark color doesn't match the Windows 7 design.

Suggestions:
* Make it green or blue
** But make sure it doesn't look like a radar screen sweep
** And make sure it is visible when the tab background is green/blue (for example because it is selected)
* make it brighter/less opaque
* use a horizontal loading bar instead?
* When page layout is complete (for example the page favicon ha loaded and there are only a few image and maybe script missing) display the page's favicon and put a small version of our pie throbber somewhere in a corner of the favicon.

Reproducible: Always
