Assisting a friend on why his text wasnt showin up properly in FF but wa in IE, I viewed sorce and noticed that the only thing that wasn't working properly wa the size of his text and it wasnt bolded. He wa using the <h5> command in the html. We managed to get it fixed by placing font size tag and the bold tag to make it look like it wa supposed to. He us a forum based script and tpls for his site and for some reason FF would not recognize the <h5> tag. When I tested it on my own site it seems that it is making the h5 actually font size 5 not header 5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I use a phpbb based site that using tpls so dont know if can be replicated outside of a forum based site. This is what I did to reproduce it on my own site.
1. in my code I have this <th width="50%" nowrap><b>WELCOME</b></th>
2. i changed it to be this <th width="50%" nowrap><h5>WELCOME</h5></th> which is what my used used to get the size that he currently uses.
instead of font size 2, i believe that is what he had to use now, with bolding.


Actual Results:
i go to my site it actually look like it is font size 1 without bolding

Expected Results:
instead of font size 2, i believe that is what he had to use now, with bolding.

this wa replicated on 2 different computers. my personal computer here and his computer that is 1000 mile away.
