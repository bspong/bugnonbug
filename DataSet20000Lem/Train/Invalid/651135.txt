This problem occurs in several different system with Firefox 4.0.1. It work a expected in Google Chrome and IE. I don't remember this problem occurring in 4.0.0, but I can't be certain. I first noticed it yesterday after the automatic upgrade to the 4.0.1 beta wa applied to my system.

I'm sorry if this bug ha been reported previously. I attempted to search the list, but I saw nothing like my situation in the results.
