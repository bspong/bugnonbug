After using Organize Bookmarks to move some Live Bookmarks (of RSS feeds) into subfolders that I created on the Bookmarks Toolbar, using the Reload Live Bookmark option sometimes doe nothing, and sometimes take a long time to complete.

Also, if I then copy and paste the bookmark folder back onto the toolbar, it show an updated feed on the toolbar but not in the folder.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar
2. Subscribe to the following feed and put it in the folder that you created
3. Right-click on the folder and choose Sort By Name
4. Left-click the folder, then right-click the Live Bookmark and choose Reload Live Bookmark
Actual Results:
"Live Bookmark Loading..." doe not appear inside of the Live Bookmark, unless a load wa already in progress when Sort By Name wa used. Loads in progress will fail.

Expected Results:
"Live Bookmark Loading..." should appear, followed by any new item in the feed.
