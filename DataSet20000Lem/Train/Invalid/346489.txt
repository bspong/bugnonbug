I have been using Mozilla Firefox for a long time now and just recently updated to the newest version of Mozilla Firefox. Once it updated, I can't access the Internet through Mozilla Firefox. I can access it through Internet Explorer and Avant Browser, but when I try to open any webpage in Mozilla, it show me:
Unable to connect













Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at en-us.start.mozilla.com.








* The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few
moments.

* If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
connection.

that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

I have uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled it and still nothing happens. I have even gone back and reinstalled older version of Firefox. Still nothing happens.
