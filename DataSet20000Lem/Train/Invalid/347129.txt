Flash doesn't work (similar to bug 346167?)

My FF updated today to 1.5.0.6 so I went to see what wa fixed. Apparently the main reason wa the bug #346167: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346167

However when I tested one of the site mentioned there (http://www.milaadesign.com), it still doesn't work. I have restarted FF and also used a profile with no extension installed, without luck. However, the same site work well with MSIE 6.

My Flash plugin info:

Shockwave Flash

File name: NPSWF32.dll
Shockwave Flash 9.0 r16

MIME Type Description Suffixes Enabled
application/x-shockwave-flash Adobe Flash movie swf Yes
application/futuresplash FutureSplash movie spl Yes

only one odd thing: I have noticed there is also Flash 8 in about:plugins..
Shockwave Flash

File name: NPSWF32.dll
Shockwave Flash 8.0 r22

MIME Type Description Suffixes Enabled
application/x-shockwave-flash Macromedia Flash movie swf Yes
application/futuresplash FutureSplash movie spl Yes


HOWEVER, if I right-click on the milaadesign page, I get "About" flash info: 9.0.16.0. The only other entry in the menu is "Animation non chargée" - animation not loaded (french).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://www.milaadesign.com


Actual Results:
Nothing is displayed, only the background color and the page title.

Expected Results:
The page is flash-based. I expect to see it..
