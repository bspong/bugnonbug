I have Vuze installed. When I open a link to torrent file (with ".torrent" extension) a popup window appears. I select "Open with..." and enter "/usr/bin/vuze". File is opened with Vuze. When I open this link again the popup window appears again and path "/usr/bin/vuze" is not remembered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
You need to have installed Vuze.
1. Open any link to ".torrent" file. Popup window appears.
2. Select "Open with..." and enter "/usr/bin/vuze". Press OK and the torrent-file must be opened in Vuze. Don't forget to set flag "Remember selection".
3. Open the link again.
Actual Results:
Popup window appears asking what to do with the file.

Expected Results:
No popup window appears and the file is downloaded and is opened in Vuze.
