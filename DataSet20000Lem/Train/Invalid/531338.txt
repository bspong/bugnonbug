Firefox doesn't warn to close tabs, always save tab without asking

Since I upgraded to 3.6b1, I have noticed my tab have acted strangely. I tried downgrading to 3.5, but the behavior didn't change.

I have browser.tabs.warnOnClose = true, but Firefox will not warn me about tab I have open when I quit Firefox. It does, however, always save my current session tabs, and then reopens them when I launch Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tab
2. Select Firefox -> Quit Firefox (on Mac) or Command-Q.

Actual Results:
Firefox close all tab and window and save the tab for the next use of Firefox

Expected Results:
Firefox would prompt whether to save the tab or not.

I have no special themes, and only a few add-ons.
