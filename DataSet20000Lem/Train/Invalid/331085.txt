Want to build 1.5 from source, but getting extra file in tarball (test binaries)

I am building Forefox .1.5 according to
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Build_and_Install

Both "make -f client.mk build" and "make -C objdir/browser/installer" stage perform ok, but resulting tarball have noticeably more file (and is ~10% larger) than "official" Firefox-1.5 binary distribution. Those file are mostly binary named "DebugXXX" and "testXXXX"

I read http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Configuring_Build_Options and tried to add --disable-tests and --disable-debug in mozconfig. Did not help.

Hoped that http://www.mozilla.org/build/release-build-notes.html explains how to duplicate release tarballs. No luck.

Is it possible to add "mozconfig" file to future releases, so that it will be easier to find out how exactly Firefox wa built?

Sorry for a bit vague description, I'm not on build box at the moment.

Reproducible: Always
