text in top frame on site ("User Results") is invisible unless I use IE Tab add-on to switch rendering engine to Internet Explorer. In older FireFox 2.x this wa not necessary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install and run tcpIQ line speed meter - let it collect some data or manually force it to do a few test so you will have data to display
2.from line speed meter menu choose "My results..."
3.observe empty frame in "User Results" frame
4.use IE Tab plug-in to switch rendering engine to internet explorer - text appears
Actual Results:
text reappears only with IE rendering engine

Expected Results:
text should have appeared properly even with the FireFox rendering engine

compare with performance in old FireFox 2.x.
Compatibility with website only designed with IE in mind is still a FireFox bugaboo
