With this version of FF, a of yesterday, I am no longer able to enter my Virtual Horses into any Gallop, Trot, or Cross-Country Competitions. This is not logical, a I am able to enter Jumping and Barrel Racing Competitions. I do not know what happened to FF 3.05 but please FIX! I am now having to use IE to play this game and the difference in Graphics and speed of play is HUGE. I want to use FF to play! No clue what happened! Saw that others have had same problem, this wa posted in your Forum since Dec. 14th? I only started having problem 24 hour ago. Unable to fix! Very disappointed. There are over a million player on this Sims Game! FF is highly recommended to ALL newbies!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to enter fully trained horse with proper Tack and Shod in Competition.
2. Choose Gallop, Trot, or Cross-Country.
3. NOTHING HAPPENS. The Competitions just DO NOT SHOW. Unable to ENTER. ????
Actual Results:
This mean that a a player I am unable to use FF to play the game! I cannot ENTER a RACE. NOTHING HAPPENS.

I have stopped using FF and gone BACK to IE (which I hate by the way) to play this game. IE is slow, the graphic are terrible, need I say more?

Expected Results:
That when I go to enter my horse in a Trot, Gallop, or Cross-Country Race, a list of 25 race SHOULD "appear" QUICKLY. These are the race that my horse is qualified to RUN in and that have the highest purse or payout.

Please repair! One million English player on this game folks! WE LOVE FF!

WE HATE IE!

Thanks!
