visitng site allows malicious spyware to download to window temp folder and
install, which dial out an get more spyware on host computer. note: NO WAY TO
STOP THIS FROM DOWNLOADING EXCEPT BY THIRD PARTY SOTWARE (that I know of). The
spyware is called IST Bar, or Integrated Search Technologies. It immediately
installs a program "iinstal.xxx" where xxx is a constantly changing couple of
numbers. It may also add registry keys, but I'm not sure about this. It may
also be related to install.xxxtoolbar.com. Somehow, this even break through
firefox's protection

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. NOTE THIS WILL POSSIBLY INFECT YOUR WINDOWS COMPUTER EVEN IF IT'S NOT RUNNING
WINDOWS XP. ONLY TRY THIS IF YOU HAVE A LEGITIMITE ANTISPY PROGRAM (OR THREE)
2. Visit www.seriall.com
3. Click on any link.

Actual Results:
The program(s?) downloaded, immediately ran without prompting me first, and
attempted to dial out, after which my firewall caught them. They also attempted
to modify my registry (blocked by Lavasoft Ad-Watch Pro)

Expected Results:
It should never have been downloaded, much le run. All content from
"Integrated Search Technologies" should be banned, with some type of dowload
lockdown in firefox to prevent the infection in the first place.
