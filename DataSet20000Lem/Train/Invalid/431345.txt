This appears to be specific to 3.0, a 2.x and Safari neither have this behavior (which is why I believe it may be browser related, and not site related). When searching google, the very first result that is returned is also queried by the user's browser, and unless HTTP_REFERER is disabled, will show that the user wa Googling for a particular site even before they click on it. This may be related to the context lookup for sub-pages which is done on the first result, but if it wa specifically related to Google, I'd think other browser would be behaving this way a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Google your own web server so that it is the first result (or you can google mine "Jonathan Zdziarski" and I'll send you the results)
2. Look in your access log and you will see the site wa queried by your browser
3. Panic
Actual Results:
The site wa queried by my browser without even clicking on it, and with a referer

Expected Results:
No querying done until I click on the link
