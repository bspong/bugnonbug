Last day I wa googleing to find some file to download. When I found them, I began to download them. I then closed the firefox main window and kept the downloads window opened, so these file were downloading. I realised in the gnome system monitor that the firefox process wa using 200 MiB of memory only on the downloads window, so I thought the memory related to the firefox main window or the visited page wa not freed.

It's an important fault in performance in my opinion. In my case most of the 200 Mib were on the swap memory, so the system wa doing a lot of disk access and wa very slow while downloading these files.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
The memory related to the firefox main window or the visited page is not freed when you exit from the firefox main window and you keep the downloads window opened.

Expected Results:
The memory related to the firefox main window and the visited page ha to be freed when you exit from the firefox main window and you keep the downloads window opened.

I wa using Ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty 64 bit and Firefox 3.0.13.
I don't know if that occurs in other OS and/or architectures.
