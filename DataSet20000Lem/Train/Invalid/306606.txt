Web site, and immediately or shortly thereafter, either ProcessGuard or
ZoneAlarm alert user to an attempt by file asdf.exe to access the Internet.

some were able to check the time stamp on the file and determine what site they
were visiting, and determine that no other Internet program except Fx wa running.
