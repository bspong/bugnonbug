I keep my Opera bookmark file in My Documents instead of \Documents and
Settings\username\Application Data\Opera\profile\. Firefox doesn't find my
bookmark because they are not in the expected location. The actual location of
the bookmark file can be found in opera6.ini in the Opera profile directory under:

[User Prefs]
Hot List File Ver2=C:\My Documents\opera6.adr

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Opera go to Bookmarks, Manage Bookmarks.
2. Click the "File" dropdown button and choose "Save as".
3. Choose a new location for the bookmark file.
4. Open Firefox and go to File -> Import
5. Select the Opera radio button
6. Click Next
Actual Results:
The Bookmarks option is not listed.

Expected Results:
The location of the bookmark file should be found in Opera6.ini
