Addon bar reappears after browser restart
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101207 Firefox/4.0b8pre

The new addonbar can be dismissed via context menu. If you do so, I would expect it to stay away just like a toolbar. However, when the browser is next started, the addonbar is again open.

This is particularly annoying now because closing the bar requires context menu interaction. This would be le annoying if bug 616014 or bug 616015 were resolved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close addonbar
2. Restart firefox
3. Addon bar is open.
Actual Results:
Addonbar is always open when firefox is started

Expected Results:
Addonbar should be in the same state a when the browser wa last open. If the last session had the addon bar open in some window and closed in others, the addon bar could either have the state of the last window to close, or have the state of the last window where the state wa explicitly altered.

I have firebug 1.7X.0a7 installed.
