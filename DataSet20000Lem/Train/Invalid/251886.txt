When we do a call in the Java Plugin under Firefox to the system property
user.home (System.getProperty("user.home")), it return the Firefox
installation directory, and not the user home in Windows 2000!

The problem is that the installation directory normally is not writable to a
not privileged user. The correct directory should be the user directory in
window (normally c:\documentes and settings\<username>).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a java applet
2. Return the system property "user.home"
3. If it is the case of a signed applet and you try to write to that directory,
you will run into trouble.

Actual Results:
You don't have permission to write to the user.home directory.

Expected Results:
You should have permission, with user.home returning the user directory
(c:\documents and settings\<username>)
