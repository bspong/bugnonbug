FireFox is great, but ...

Where are bookmark stored? I want that on secure drive/location.
Can't find with file search or regedit.

Being asked to allow entry AND exit for page of mixed security
is a major time waster. I unchecked "ask each time", to no avail.
ALL SECURITY WARNINGS ARE IN THE WAY. LET ME TURN THEM OFF!
I could not even get a bug report account without this nonsense.
Allow user to pick level of security, then SHUT UP.

Setting color for "visited links" ha no effect.

Getting to place on your site to REPORT a bug is DIFFICULT.
I don't want to TRACK but to SUBMIT.

Software should NOT be GOD, but servant.
Overall good product is being marred by some Bill Gates type assumptions.
Still, I think I am a convert, after only a few hour of use.
