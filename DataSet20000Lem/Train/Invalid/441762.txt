When booting PC from cold then invoking FFox version 3 my home page specified in the option panel doe not always load, I get a blank page. If I then close FFox and re-invoke it, it load fine and continues to load ok while PC is running. When the problem happens If I click the home page tool bar button it load ok.

I have set the home page to http://www.orange.co.uk/ and "show my home page on startup". When exiting FFox I clear all 8 category of private data.

Unfortunately I cannot force this to happen but it ha been happening about every other day since I upgraded (I think I upgraded on the day of release) When it doe happen I checked the option panel and confirmed that home page is specified a required.

Hope I've given enough detail.

Regards,
Ned.

Wouldn't normally bother you but there used to be a virus/trojan/malware/whatever associated with setting one's home page to Blank so it made me a bit twitchy.
