Firefox option (configurability) incomplete compared to Mozilla 1.7.12
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915
Build Identifier:

The configuration dialog is quite incomplete.

A lot of item which are configurable under Mozilla 1.7.12 are not configurable under Firefox. Just compare the Edit/Preferences of Mozilla 1.7.12 with the setting from Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
