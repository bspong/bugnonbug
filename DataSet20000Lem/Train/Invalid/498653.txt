I can send sample but have recieved complaint about using Fire Fox to open up a listing.
COnsdiering this affect million of users, can Fire fox fix their problem?
NW MLS is recommending NOT to use Fire Fox, so that will affect your list of clients.
I don't have time to search all through your system, so if you can correct, that would be helpful.
Your site is so confusing just to report a problem, I will not use it, nor recommend it.

Reproducible: Always
