google notebook when running (on mac) cause select - for the purpose of just copying stuff from a web page, or, for the purpose of adding stuff from a web page to google notebook, to not work. Ie, select works, then in a few second something seems to be saved (a progress bar appears in the status area), and the selection go away.

Related may be the fact that every time something on a web page is selected, a "note this" button appears near the selected material, but when I try to click on "note this", the above process happens.

On window the notebook work perfectly for me in ff 3.0 pre.

The question is I guess - where doe the "note this" thing come from? Maybe there is some interaction with something else I have running. I guess I'll systematically uninstall various extension and run the notebook until I figure it out? not.

Google notebook I have come to rely on, but I guess I can't anymore. Google Docs are flaky, ie, I wa working on a spreadsheet and some network glitch happened and I had to change browser and flail mightily to save my work. Steve Balmer wa right - Google thing are "cute", but way not ready for prime time.
