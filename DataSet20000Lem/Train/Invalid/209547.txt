Features that need to be fixed!!

Page down scrolling bug, too many segmented jerks, when page down is depressed
Where is the 'Send link' button that open default email and paste the link of
the web page one is sending?
Need True full screen with no frame border at all, just like opera
goto sheet that descends from nowhere to enter a url
need autocomplete where there is no droplist, but url just complete themselves
finally what is the strange window bug that occurs when clicking a link in
another app, like Eudora or Ircle. Instead of opening the link in the current
browser window, it spawn a strange unthemed extra window with different menus.
Very strange. Fix those, and you guy have got yourselves a FIRST CLASS browser!
