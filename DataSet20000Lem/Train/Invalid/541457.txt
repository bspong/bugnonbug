Sometime recently I lost the ability to click my scrollwheel and then use the trackball to scroll the page. It started with v. 3.5 something. Every time I click the wheel, Firefox stop responding. I am trying to unlearn the habit of clicking it, but until then, I keep getting lockups. Plus, I know longer have that feature.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I click the scrollwheel.
2. Happens, a it say above, every time. Didn't used to do this.
3. On some Web pages, just rolling the wheel lock up Firefox.
4. I use http://stockcharts.com and that is where I noticed it, but it happens on other Web page too.
