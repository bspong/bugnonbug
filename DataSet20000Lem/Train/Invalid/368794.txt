PNG file with gamma correction stored in them are not gamma corrected by Firefox. This result in the image either being too dark or (in this case) too bright.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the page I specified
2. Look at the second post on that page, at the preview image.
3. Click on the preview to see the full image.
Actual Results:
When viewing the full image, it appears extremely bright and washed out.

Expected Results:
The image contains gamma information which Firefox should use to adjust the brightness. The color should appear a they do in the preview image (which contains no gamma correction information).

Many program ignore gamma correction in PNG files, and blame the picture author for the image looking wrong on various systems. This is sloppy programming. If gamma correction were not present, not handling it would be acceptable.

However, when the gamma information is present in a file, it should be accounted for. Images containing this gamma correction should be adjusted accordingly. Although doing so will probably break many existing web pages, it will break them in the same way that correct support of CSS break web page designed for Internet Explorer. That is, the web page are already broken, and Firefox should behave appropriately regardless.

Since so much of the Web is imagery, I consider the lack of correct support for one of the most common image format to be a bug in a major feature.
