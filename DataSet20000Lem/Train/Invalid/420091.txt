(originally from the Red Hat Bugzilla, see URL above)

In firefox 3 in Rawhide, when you select "Print to File" a the printer and
specify the name of a file that already exists, it happily overwrites that file
without prompting for confirmation. Mozilla used to ask for confirmation, a
doe Seamonkey; I can't remember whether older version of Firefox asked for
confirmation.
