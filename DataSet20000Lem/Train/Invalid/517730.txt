Favicons for bookmark doesn't load when I turn FF in Private mode (Auto-load FF in Private mode). But I like if FF in Private mode because with it ff hide username and password (i.e. *****) on website for which one saved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark any page with favicon
2. Turn to Private mode (Auto-load FF in Private mode)
3. Bookmark any page with favicon OR go to previous saved page...
Actual Results:
Fivicon for bookmark not appears

Expected Results:
Show favicon
