All instance of the text box with number + up/down scroll button (I am not sure what such a control is called) appear abnormally enlarged. An example can be seen under: Tools > Options > Privacy tab > the box against the label "Keep my history for at least [this box] days". See attached screen shot for example.

Reproducible: Always

1. From menu select, Tools > Options > Privacy tab
2. Under "History", see control with label starting with "Keep my history for"

Actual Results:
The control in question is enlarged

Expected Results:
The control in question should appear in normal size.

I have upgraded from FF2.0.0.14 to v3.0
