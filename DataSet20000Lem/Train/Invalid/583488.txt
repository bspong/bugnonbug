note: I'm adding this a an enhancement but some may consider it a bug a bookmark can be lost.

Recently my mouse scroll wheel stopped working and I didn't have time to order a new mouse.
By habit, I used to open the Bookmarks sidebar and click the scroll wheel to open several website in a folder.

Thinking it work just like opening a new tab - which go by pressing Ctrl+T - I just right clicked and pressed T thinking it would open in new tab but it turned out the letter to press is W from "Open in ne*w* tab"

Fair enough, I'm not saying T is bad for Cut a it's the same a in Windows. The problem is that by doing it in speed like an automatism, I've selected cut on the link and it dissapeared from the bookmark folder.

Didn't notice right away a I wa going through the link I wa planning to open... After three link I've finally noticed that all three link have vanished and I kind of panicked thinking I've deleted them so I went to Edit > Undo and managed to get all three back.

Made some more experiment and noticed that if you cut one link and close the Bookmarks sidebar, when you open it again the link is back in the sidebar.
However, if you cut two or more link one after another and then close the sidebar window, the link are gone - Undo will work only if the sidebar panel is open - it won't work if it's closed and I can go to Edit and select Undo twice or how many time I've used cut.

So link are lost this way, which is not how cutting work in Windows. Furthermore I think link that are "cut" in Bookmarks should remain there but maybe grayed out - they shouldn't dissapear from view a file don't dissapear in Explorer or other file manager programs.

I don't know - in my oppinion they're not text chunk to be gone when you cut them.

Reproducible: Always
