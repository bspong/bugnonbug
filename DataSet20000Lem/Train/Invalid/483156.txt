Now it start installing Shockwave director without asking for my option first whether I want to install this plugin or not. After a few second it give an error dialog saying something about XTRA. I dont see Shockwave in my Tools > Addons in Firefox but there is a "Adobe shockwave" in my add/remove programs.

Reproducible: Always

2. It start installing shockwave
3. Gives error
Actual Results:
Error message or dialog

If I have shockwave installed already then it is not appearing in Minefield Tools> Addons...
