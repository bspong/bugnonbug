I am access the site "www.statebankofindia.com" via a proxy server which ha
authentication. Once the home page is loaded, the Java Plugin's proxy
authentication window is popping up and I am clicking "No" without entering any
username/password in it. (I don't want the Java applet to run).

After this the browser window simply hand and I am not able to navigate the
link nor enter any other URL in address bar also. I need to close the browser.
When I close the browser by right-clicking on the Taskbar and choose "Close", it
is crashing and quality feedback window is coming.

The Java Plugin version I am using is: j2re1.4.2_02
