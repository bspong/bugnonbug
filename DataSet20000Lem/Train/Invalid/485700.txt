Let's take Yzis a example (it work with every website, at least when firefox doesn't replace http:// with http://www.).

When you go to http://yzis.org, and click on some links, their color changes.
Now, if go to http://www.yzis.org, you'll see that the link are in the default color, instead of the visited one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.yzis.org
2. Click on some link
3. Go to http://yzis.org, and look at the link you just clicked, they are in the default color
Actual Results:
Links are in the default color instead of the visited color
