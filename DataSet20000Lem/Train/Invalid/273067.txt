Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

1. Go to:
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=175850&sid=07db964dc861cd118828f54101274049
2. Click on the link to the image in the first post using the middle mouse
button (for a new tab).

Actual Results:
The new tab open the forum page instead of the image.


Repeat the process by clicking on the link to open it in the same window, and it
take you to the forum page again.

If you open the page in a new window, it work correctly. After I got it to
work, I could no longer reproduce the bug.
