Cannot access extension and downloads, even using Mozilla's "safe mode".
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

When I try to access "extensions" using "tools", I get the following message:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.xul?type=extensions.
Line Number 18, Column 34: [Line Number 17, Column 34: for downloads]
orient="vertical" title="&extensions.title;" statictitle="&extensions.title;"

This message appears when trying to access themes, extensions, and downloads, from the tool area. It show up when I download pictures.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
N/A

Expected Results:
Same a in "details".

I deleted Mozilla Firefox, and re-installed it. Instead of starting out from scratch, I ended up with all my "old" settings, etc... I need to be able to clear all extensions, etc., and start over. OR, I need to find out how to "fix" this problem.

Thanks.
