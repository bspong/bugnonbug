Firefox Page Setup changed by changing printer properties.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3

If I change my print page orientation to landscape (could be in Word or Excel or even using browser) in my printer property window this change the "Page Setup" in Firefox so the next page printed through Firefox becomes landscape.



Reproducible: Always




Firefox should not be allowing this change to be made.
