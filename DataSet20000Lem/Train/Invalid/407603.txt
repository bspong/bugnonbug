Firefox 2.0.0.11 crash all the time for no obvious reason

Since I have upgraded to Firefox 2.0.0.11 from 2.0.0.10 through the automatic update, the aplication is highly unstable. Sometimes it run fine for days, then it crash every couple of minutes. It crashed when closing a tab, when navigating to a link, when doing anything. After a restart and with the session restored, the very same action work without a problem. I cannot see any scheme behind it other than Firefox becomes close to unusable from one day to another! Sometimes, I get a debugger window (from Visual Studio) and a crash report is sent automatically, the other day the Firefox window just disappears with no trace. This behaviour can be seen on several computer here, so it's not a hardware problem. I have disabled some of the le important extension but it doesn't help. All of the extension and plugins have worked fine over months. So it can't be them, too. I'm now trying to uninstall Firefox and get version 2.0.0.9 which worked for sure. Need to disable auto-update then. I don't want to switch to Opera, and IE is not an option for me.

Reproducible: Sometimes
