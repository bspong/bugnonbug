Let's type such HTML-file part.
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD style='text-decoration: underline;'>
<DIV style='text-decoration: none;'>abc1</DIV>
abc2
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
Both "abc%" will be underlined.

If "font-weight" is used instead of "text-decoration", the behavior is correct.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create HTML page with code that is shown 2 field earlier.
2. Run this page in your browser.
3. See the incorrect result. ;)
Actual Results:
Both text cut will be underlined.

Expected Results:
Only "abc2" must be underlined. "abc1" must be cleared of underlining.

Happens not only on my computer ;)
