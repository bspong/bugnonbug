Application fails in FF4 due to setting a property on DOM node of "hidden"
http://m8y.org/js/solitaire.xhtml wa a page I made quite a few year ago just to muck about w/ unicode, which I'd just discovered had all those nifty glyph (kinda like chess.xhtml in that same dir).

Recently, I accessed that file in FF4b nightly and noticed that it wa no longer rendering all the table cell a it doe in FF3.6 and other browsers.

Tentatively going with a regression although I'm not sure what the cause is since this is admittedly not a reduced page.

Hoping someone could say at a glance what happened. Could it be because I used a table? I thought it'd be cute to render a small deck of card for browser if javascript wa not enabled.

Filing this in the wrong product due to a recently added (past year?) flaw in Bugzilla's bug reporting template when using a non-javascript browser. My apologies. Hopefully it'll be eventually fixed.
