Can not load security device .dylib file in 4.0b7

Fx 4.0b7 is not able to load Finnish national e-ID card's security device dynlib (http://www.fineid.fi/vrk/fineid/home.nsf/pages/index_eng). This worked still in 4.0b6 and there ha not been any change in the e-ID card software since I installed 4.0b6. I also today tested that the e-ID card software work OK with 4.0b6 and 3.6.12 on this very same mac I am using. Does not work in 4.0b7 even if I create a new profile.

When I try to load the device I just got error message telling "Module addition did not succeed" (actually a I am using Finnish locale it tell in Finnish: "Moduulin lisääminen ei onnistunut"). No other hint why it did not succeed, not even if I start firefox from macos unix command line.
