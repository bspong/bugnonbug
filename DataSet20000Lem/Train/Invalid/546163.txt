When ClickCutter AutoCopy 1.2.1 is installed, Firefox take much CPU time after a series of text copy. As the ClickCutter AutoCopy developer can't reproduce the problem, it isn't clear whether this is a Firefox bug or ClickCutter AutoCopy bug. Firefox may be to blame on the non-deterministic behavior. Could other user test (see below step to reproduce) and report their build identifier and what they get concerning the CPU usage?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Quit Firefox and remove the current profile.
2. Start Firefox.
3. Install ClickCutter AutoCopy:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14077
4. Restart Firefox.
5. Select some text *slowly* with the mouse, meaning that a small red "C" in a circle will appear from time to time (copy operation by ClickCutter AutoCopy). This way, make a "C" appear about 20 times, then release the mouse button.
Actual Results:
The top command (or htop, or equivalent) show that the firefox-bin process constantly take about 50% CPU time.

Expected Results:
The firefox-bin process shouldn't take any CPU time (or very little).

Note: in practice, this also make Firefox become very slow after some time.
