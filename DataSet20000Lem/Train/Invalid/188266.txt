[split] autocomplete show credit card number when only the first number is typed

Autocomplete seems to collect information that user may not want collected,
even down to incorrectly typed URL's, and incorrectly entered user-name/password
details, but what is worse, it collect credit card numbers, and other
"sensitive" data, and display them whenever a number is typed, a long a the
number entered is the first number of the series.
OK so autocomplete can be turned off, not that your everday user know where to
find their profile, and then know to create a user.js file. But even with
autocomplete turned off, doe it continue to secretly squirrel away information
in the event of being turned on again.
It would seem a lot of information is collected with the everyday user having no
idea how to edit this info, even down to Download manager continuing to collect
download info which it is unable to delete simply because there is no apparent
way of finding it.
Anyone with the knowledge of where these detail are stored and how to access
it, can use this information even when they do not have the authority, simply
because the average user ha no idea on the internal working of Mozilla, and
Phoenix.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. detail above should be self explanatary
2.
3.



Expected Results:
able to edit autocomplete, or have the ability to determine what information is
collected, or turn autocomplete off, and have no information collected at all.

There appears to be no level of severity to cover the loss/misuse of sensitive
personal data.
