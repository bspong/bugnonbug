Page info misreads shortcut icon (.ico) file type
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20040214 Firebird/0.7

When autoloading a .ico shortcut icon, the browser incorrectly determines the
file type. The correct type should be "image/ico" or "image/x-icon". The actual
assumed filetype is "text/plain."

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL: <a
href="http://webstu.messiah.edu/~sf1183/icontest.htm">http://webstu.messiah.edu/~sf1183/icontest.htm</a>
2. Click on Tools > Page Info
3. Click on the Media tab
4. Examine the file type for the icon file "favicon.ico"
This always work for the above address, but other website do not exhibit the
same behavior. For example, the site <a
href="www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a> us the exact same icon (I
copied it a a test file) but for this page the browser correctly detects the
file type.

Actual Results:
The type read "text/plain"

Expected Results:
The type should auto-detect to "image/ico" (or "image/x-icon", I'm not sure which).

This may be related to (or a part of?) bug 234374, but I included it because
that bug seems to deal with file on a computer hard drive and this one deal
with file on the internet.

In addition, this may (or may not) be related to problem like that which occurs
in bug 222602 - problem where the browser ha trouble recognizing shortcut
icon properly.
