I have a SaaS web application and this problem wa reported by one of my end users, and verified by me. On some page in our application, particularly those which display search results, the text "create new collection" appears in the browser window many, many times. I am attaching a screen shot of the issue and the source of the page so you can see that the text rendered in FF is not in the HTML source.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View http://www.brightmove.com/downloads/ff_bug_example.html
2. Observe Rendered Page with "create new collection"
3. Observice HTML Source. Text not in source.
Actual Results:
Page with "create new collection" displayed.

Expected Results:
Page without "create new collection" displayed. Actual page from source.
