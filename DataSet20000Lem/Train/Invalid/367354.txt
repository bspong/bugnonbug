When I enter this page:

http://sabadonoche.tk/

i get a blank page. There appears the cross in the bottom toolbar and if I allow pop-up for that page then the web loads. I have tested it under opera and work fine even if I have pop-up blocked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable firefox 2.0.0.1 pop-up blocker in preferences.
2. Load the web http://sabadonoche.tk
3. Check that there is a blank page and try the same page in opera for example.
Actual Results:
The problem is persistent.

Expected Results:
The webpage should be loaded correctly. This can be that the web check for loading pop-up prior to loading the web or may be a firefox problem.

I can workaround the problem enabling pop-up for the specified pages.
