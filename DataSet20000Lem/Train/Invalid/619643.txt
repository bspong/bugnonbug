While using Google Apps mail client the reply, reply to all and forward button do not work. I have conferred with a Google Apps technician and this is not an error with the GA mail suite.

Intermittent functionality loss of the reply, reply to all and forward button in Google Apps. As I already stated, this is not a Google Apps issue. The bug is completely random (doesnt matter where the sent email ha come from, what it contains)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an email
2.Click reply, reply to all, forward
3.None work
Actual Results:
As the problem is intermittent it did not work this time

Expected Results:
Either a fail or success of functionality

Work around is to hit compose email and manually paste other email into bottom of newly created one to make it appear a a reply.
