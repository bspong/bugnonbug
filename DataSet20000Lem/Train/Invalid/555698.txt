firefox doe not open the file specified
Description of problem:
If a file name contains question marh '?', firefox may truncate the file name,
opening a different file.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
firefox-3.6.1-2.fc14.i686

How reproducible:
always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. echo foo>foo.html; echo foo_q>'foo.html?a=1'
2. firefox 'foo.html?a=1'

Actual results:
foo

Expected results:
foo_q

Additional info:
The same thing happens if "file:///tmp/foo.html?a=1" is typed into the location
bar.
It is a necessary condition that file "foo.html" exists; otherwise, the file
"foo.html?a=1" would be open.

So it seems there is some heuristic involved. Unfortunately, if there is an
ambiguity, it is resolved in a way that doe not suit to my needs.

If this behavior (pass variable to local file) is required, then it would help
if a warning were displayed if an ambiguous reuest ha to be resolved.
