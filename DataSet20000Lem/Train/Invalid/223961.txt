During virtually every web session, for one website or another, I get a
"timeout" or "page could not be found" error message. These are page I visit
frequently and they are available. And every site I try to log onto after this
point is error-messaged. So I log off the net, log back on, go to the page where
the glitch first occurred. The page load just fine, a do all the subsequent
ones, until the problem occurs again--as many a 6 time in a 4 hour web
session. It seems to be more likely to happen if I have two or more site
loading at once in tab of the same window. It seems to be more common early in
the session (the first site after the start page can lock up). It seems more
likely to occur on some site than others. But these are not necessary conditions.
This ha happened with two different IPs. I have tried to duplicate it with IE
(I can't really stay on IE very long, wtf) but I've loaded several site at once
in multiple window and don't get a lockup.

Its a sure thing with two or three site loading, but it COMMONLY happens with
just one site loading.
