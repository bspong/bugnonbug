Improve anchor behavior in Firefox history
This is a bug to track potential change in anchor behavior in Firefox. See: http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_frm/thread/f2078651cc7f5bb0/ea8c0bd212e0348e#ea8c0bd212e0348e

Note: what happens is: nsDocShell::InternalLoad call nsDocShell::OnNewURI to add the anchored URI to history. This need to be updated to also transmit the referrer, which look like it is present and correct in InternalLoad, but OnNewURI doesn't have a parameter for it.
