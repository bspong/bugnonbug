Currently a website that is misconfigured and doesn't send an intermediate SSL certificate is reported a "sec_error_unknown_issuer", which is fairly confusing.

If the website is misconfigured, the better thing to do is to say so: an intermediate certificate wa supposed to be sent by the website, but wasn't, and we don't have it cached from elsewhere.

It's much better when the browser correctly blame the website, than when it simply fails to work. Then the user know who to be annoyed at, and who to complain to.

Reproducible: Always
