When using a specially modified theme, Firefox will under certain circumstance
enter a busy loop when opening a new tab. I've only noticed it when running on
Windows XP using the default Windows XP look (and having the tab bar hidden when
only one web side is open). The same theme work just fine on Windows XP with
the classic look or on Windows 2000. See below for the small change needed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Qute 2.1.4 (it might not be available on Mozilla Update; I found it
on the author site).
2. Unpack the theme.
3. Edit the file global\global.css, adding the following line at the end:
browser[type] {
border: solid 2px;
-moz-appearance: ListBox;
}
4. Re-package the theme and install it.
5. Start Firefox on Windows XP with the default system theme ("Windows and
Buttons" in Display Properties/Appearance set to "Windows XP Style").
6. Open a new tab.
Actual Results:
The browser entered a busy loop.

Expected Results:
A new tab should be opened.
