Since latest SU update, I can no longer send shares, a the Send To button in the toolbar only display two thing now - New Email Address and Import Contacts. I can still reply to share sent TO me, but cannot initiate a new share.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Browse to webpage I wish to share
3.Click 'Send To' in toolbar, only to find it empty
Actual Results:
I am unable to share, a there are no name to select. If I attempt to import, it simply offer to pull in all my MSN contacts, which I certainly don't want.

Expected Results:
It should show me my usual list of friends, and allow me to click on one of them to share the current webpage with.
