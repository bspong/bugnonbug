I have replicated this problem on both Firefox 0.8 and 0.9.3 on Windows XP.
http://www.barkster.com/index.html is validated xhtml with validated external
cs http://www.barkster.com/default.css. The cs is pretty simple, no
positioning except for one "float right". The is no script on the page. Styles
set for Body, H1 through H4, links. Page render according to stylesheet with ie
6. Stylesheet is ignored in Firefox 0.8 and 0.9.3.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. surf to http://www.barkster.com/index.html
Actual Results:

Expected Results:
page should have rendered with cs instructions.

problem replicated consistently on two computers, one running Firefox 0.8 under
window xp and one running Firefox 0.9.3 under window xp
