Apparent silliness with JS parsing; context.getImageData() & Math.ceil()

I discovered that FF4 b10 ha a rather odd dislike of the following piece of JavaScript:

visData = raw.visGradient.getImageData(Math.ceil(z) - 1,0,1,1).data

this cause the following exception to be logged:

[22:51:55.563] uncaught exception: [Exception... "An invalid or illegal string wa specified" code: "12" nsresult: "0x8053000c (NS_ERROR_DOM_SYNTAX_ERR)" location: "http://svc.sl.marvulous.co.uk/raw2sculpt.js Line: 70"]

However, altering the code to use Math.floor(z) instead of Math.ceil(z) - 1 allows the code to run a expected.

I don't think this is some quirky math rounding error, since the following is also trigger the same error:

visData = raw.visGradient.getImageData(Math.floor(Math.ceil(z) - 1),0,1,1).data

This issue is specific to FF4, a FF3 & Chrome both handle the generation of the texture without a problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the context of http://svc.sl.marvulous.co.uk/raw2sculpt.js, on line 70 use Math.ceil(z) - 1 instead of Math.floor(z)
2. drop a Second Life RAW terrain file onto http://svc.sl.marvulous.co.uk/raw2sculpt.html
Actual Results:
Error is thrown when attempting to generate third (terrain visualisation) texture.

Expected Results:
Terrain visualisation texture is generated.

example RAW file can be obtained via a link in the raw2sculpt.html document, and a video demonstrating the expected result (albeit under Chrome) is also linked.
