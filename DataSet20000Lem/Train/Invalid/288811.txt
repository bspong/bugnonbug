after getting all of the extension i wanted, i found that i could not view my
history. so i created a new profile, and one by one redownloaded the
themes/plugins/extensions i had. upon doing this, i found that after installing
just the adblock extension, my history became unviewable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a new profile
2.don't download any extensions/themes/plugins but adblock
3.try to view history...it doesn't work

Actual Results:
couldn't view history, and it worked before i installed the adblock extension

Expected Results:
let me still see the history. adblock itself work beautifully, except that it
disallows viewing of the history.
