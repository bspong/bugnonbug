Steps to reproduce:

I had bought my mother the new samsung galaxy tab 10.1 thinking that she would at least be able to play her game on pogo.com but to my suprise she cant. After doing some research, it seems like there is no plugin to expose an api connection through to the dalvik jvm, so no java can be run in my browser. I dont know if thats the reason or not but i find it to be very backwards that flash game work just fine yet java doesnt. If it is just a plugin issue, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do something sooner or later that would allow my tablet the ability to play simple java games. Pogo is a HUGE site with MANY user and i am not the only one who is upset about this. Others have posted the same concern on forums.
