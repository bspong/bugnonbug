background frame and tab get reduced or truncated, when converted into pdf format, through a pdf virtual printer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install a virtual printer (currently PDF reDirect v2, freeware)
2. Choose any web site with tab or embedded frame
3. Print it, using this virtual printer

Actual Results:
Even if the page printer preview look OK in appearence, when you start this virtual printing, background frame get reduced into ridiculous size, web site tab get truncated in the end pdf file.
This issue doe not happen with Internet Explorer.

Expected Results:
Frames and tab with normal size and at the right place, should be a shown in printer preview.

I think there is something to do with vectorial conversion, like with some fonts.
Saving a web page a a file is not interesting with htm format (not faithful). While the pdf format is universal, therefore it is very interesting to do it this way.
As I said, this bug doesn't occure with Internet Explorer. Too bad !
