Reversion to FF ver 2.0 from 3.6 is incomplete and buggy
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.17) Gecko/20080829 Firefox/2.0.0.17 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I decided to go back to Firefox version 2.0 because the more recent version have too much disk writing activity. The uncalled-for noise pollution from the disk bother me when reading. And meanwhile there's really nothing in the version beyond 2.0 that is of any value to me. So I want to stay with version 2.0. Now the bug is that, despite 2.0 being the installed registered version on the machine, the Windows Vista registry is configured such that ver 3.6 get launched when I open an HMTL file stored my local disk by clicking on the file in Windows file explorer. Furthermore the launch of ver 3.6, when ver 2.0 is otherwise the installed registered version, cause a handful of errors, including mixups in installed version of add-ons, and ver 3.6 stay alive a a zombie after the Exit command.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install FF version 3.6
2.Install FF version 2.0
3.Open any local HTML file in Windows file explorer.
Actual Results:
FF ver 3.6 is launched

Expected Results:
FF ver 2.0 is launched.
