In the previous version of FF and any other browser I know, moving the mose over an element containing title attribute would show up simple tooltip with the text provided in the attribute.
After upgrading FF to version 3.5, the tooltips are not displayed at all. Instead of text in the tooltip I can see only small white box with black border, that's all.
The simple example is provided below.I should see aaaa in the tooltip, but only small white box with black border is displayed.
