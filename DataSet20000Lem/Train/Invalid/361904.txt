Firefox keep accumulating entry in Task manager; crash Windows

Since 1.5, Firefox will keep accumulating entry in Task manager that cannot usually be ended with closing the browser or "ending" in task manager. Sometimes when the browser ha been on long enough, closing the browser will crash Windows. When I restart, Windows say that there's been a serious error that forced a stop. Firefox is the ONLY program that doe this.

I am also running the latest build of Zone Alarm, SpySweeper and NOD32 from Eset.

I have noticed NO particular web site or function that crash the system except that Task manager seems to have a lot of Firefox entry that it will not let go of, even if the Firefox window is closed.

Also, sometimes I see FoxSrvr2 in the entries; sometimes not.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave Firefox on for a while, doing normal browsing.
2. Leave anti-virus, anti-spyware, Zone Alarm on, a usual.
3. Keep checking Task Manager (XP Pro) to see if all/any Firefox entry can be ended
4. When Firefox entry number at least 3 and the accumulated memory is > 80M, a crash is inevitable. I have 512M memory.
