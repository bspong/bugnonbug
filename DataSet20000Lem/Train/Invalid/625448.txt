Mozilla may need to adopt Chrome's development and shipping model

I'm worried about the future of Firefox. FF4 is supposed to ship next month, but major browser component seem much buggier than in past major release at this point before the release. Flash video is still unusable, and I have to switch to Chrome or Safari to watch video. There are still major interface problems, like the flashing title bar, on some of my systems. But what worry me even more is the development schedule compared to Chrome. Google ha adopted a model where they focus on one or two major features, put their resource into perfecting them quickly, and ship an updated browser every 6 week or so. The update aren't a large a those in FF4, but every 6 weeks, I can look forward to an incrementally improved browser. In most respects, they've caught up to Firefox, and if it weren't for FF's better interface, better adblocking support, and the ability to access new feature through the daily build and betas, I might have actually switched by now. Typical user who don't use the Beta or daily build won't have seen a substantial improvement in quite some time.

Frequent update provide user with a reason to get excited over Chrome every 6 weeks, and keep it in the news. Infrequent update mean that FF appears to be perpetually catching up to Chrome if you are not using the beta or daily builds, even if improvement are made to FF and Chrome at the same average rate. Chrome spoon feed you improvements. FF make you wait a long time, then give you everything at once. (Think about Apple's release cadence - every 3-6 weeks, Apple release something significant. There's a focus on only one or two related products, and the message associated with the release is tightly focused. There's always a reason for Apple to be in the news.)

I propose a change in Mozilla's development and shipping model to better compete with Chrome:

1) Focus on a small number of significant new feature at any given time. If possible, those improvement should be orthogonal - a problem with one should not block shipping of another.
2) Ship a new browser version a soon a a new feature is ready. Don't wait for other feature to be ready.
3) Develop a marketing message highlighting that new feature, and market FF with that message.
4) Rather than planning a large set of new feature at once, offset introduction of new feature into the development queue, so there's always something new to come out of the pipeline. ie. If 1...n are new features, progression should like like this over time:

1
12
123
234 (1 ships)
345 (2 ships)
etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Firefox development bundle many new feature into each release, resulting in long development times, a slow release cadence, blocked feature that could otherwise ship, reduced medium exposure, and the perception of feature lag relative to Chrome.

Actual Results:
Typical user wait a very long time for new features, giving them a chance to switch to Chrome.

Expected Results:
Firefox frequently ship a new version with only one or two new, nonconflicting features. Users get a sense of continuous improvement. Each new version should generate medium attention for the browser, keeping it in the news more frequently.
