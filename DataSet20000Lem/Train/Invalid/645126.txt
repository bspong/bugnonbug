I got firefox 4 and moved my bar around to make it more like 3 , but some toolbars didn't show a expected or didn't move so when I went back in to change them the toolbar changer didn't pop up and the menu bar went grey[inactive,would not take clicks] , leading me to restart to get the toolbar setup back and my menu-bar to to action and rinse repeat when I tried to load the toolbar changer again.
