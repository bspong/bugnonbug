after logging into facebook the error console show massive unrecognized command and facebook is laggy and sometimes unresponsive until clicked a few times.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.facebook.com, login
2. open up error console
3. watch the declaration drop statement poor
Actual Results:
pretty much the above

Expected Results:
I'm guessing that the warning should not have been there, and that firefox should have recognized the term it dropping.

same on ubuntu 9.10 64 bit, Backtrack 4 pre, Mac OSX 10.5.7, and Windows Xp service pack 3 (actually checked all of them)

guy there are 350 million user on facebook, probably most of them are using firefox. we sorta owe them a good experience with it, I mean although some may not know it they are supporting an open source Internet explorer killer, so let get this fixed, please let me know how I can help. (not so great at coding, learning C++ right now).

cout << "hello firefox!" << endl;
