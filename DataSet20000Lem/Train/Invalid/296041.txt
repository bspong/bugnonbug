When I open the firefox browser it display incorrectly. The first page and all
other page look like the are alligned to the right and I can't scroll to the
right. Tried going tru the reported bug but whatever is on the right I can't
see it. Also there's this bit of code on the bottom like in the footer:
<menuitem label="&ff.main.options.label;"
accesskey="&ff.main.options.accesskey;" default="true... can't see more coz it's
on the right side. Tried loading other page and they all show up alligned to
the right (yahoo.com, nu.nl, gratiz.nl) in fact this is the only site that
alligns left. Tried opening the browser again, tried a reboot, stopped all
processes, but problem keep occurring.
