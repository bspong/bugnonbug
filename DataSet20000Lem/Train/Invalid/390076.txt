Firefox started hanging when I close it after I downloaded the 2.0.0.5 update. Had no trouble operating it on this system (Mac OS X v. 10.3.9 Power PC G4) before that.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox on Mac OS X system a described
2.Browse
3.Close Firefox
Actual Results:
Hangs about half the time I use it.

Expected Results:
Firefox browser should first ask to clear personal info and then close

Didn't have this problem until updated to 2.0.0.5
I sometimes leave Firefox running a while after I've tried to close it (while I do other work on the computer) then go back to it and it will close - but have had to use force quit more often than not.
