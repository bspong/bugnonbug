I wa testing an extension with the new version (3.0pre) and the button were wider than they were in the previous version (3.0b5). I tried setting max-width in cs file, but didn't help. Also, I noticed that I couldn't change the background of button element using cs while I wa able to affect other elements.

I made a test file with a button and a label. Label responds to style attribute, but button doesn't.
Finally, when I set the max-width in style, the button follows it for value larger than about 50 px, but if you the value is lower it won't get shorter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create new xul file
2.Add a button
3.Change background color using style attribute
Actual Results:
Button color doesn't change

Expected Results:
Button should change color
