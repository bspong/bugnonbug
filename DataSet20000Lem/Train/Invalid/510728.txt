Only Firefox version 3.0.13 and 3.5.2 cause movie clip and audio/video file name to be deleted with ForceField. PLEASE SEE BELOW!

After I installed Firefox 3.5.2 and 3.5.1 (update 3.0.13), I discovered an incompatibility with Zone Lab ForceField that wa not present in 3.5.1 (update 3.0.12). In Firefox 3.5.2 when I downloaded movie clip or audio/video files, Windows wa unable to determine what type of file they were, and if I indicated that they should be run with Windows Media Player (my default for this type of file), it took a very long time for them to begin running. If I closed ForceField, they would automatically run in Windows Media Player. I thought that perhaps a ForceField file may have been corrupted, so I uninstalled ForceField and then reinstalled it. However, movie clip or audio/video file would still not automatically run in Windows Media Player when ForceField wa on. Therefore I reinstalled Firefox 3.5.1 (update 3.0.12), and now audio/video file would automatically run in Windows Media Player when ForceField wa on. It appeared that when ForceField wa on and movie clip or audio/video file were downloaded, the file extension associated with the temporary internet file were deleted by Firefox 3.5.2 and 3.5.1 (update 3.0.13) so that Windows could not determine what type of file they were. Could you please fix this bug in Firefox 3.5.2 so that I can reinstall it?
