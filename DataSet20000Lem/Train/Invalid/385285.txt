lately whenever i use firefox pop ups intermittently come up. however, instead of them being firefox based pop ups, the pop ups are formed from new internet explorer windows. i don't believe it true malware in that it only occurs when i use firefox/internet explorer, and that when i'm not currently using a web browser i do not receive any pop ups. anyway, some help on how to get rid of this random problem would be helpful - i tried using pop up blockers, but all of the one i used were exclusive for firefox or internet explorer, and did not stop my problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. boot firefox
2. (optional) go from web page to web page?

pop ups every few minute or so

no pop ups at all
