When navigating to my work timesheet page which is restricted access, Firefox
fails to align correctly and display everything. IE
6.0.2800.1106.xpsp2.040919-1003 display correctly. I have screen shot in lieu
of you going to the site a it's restricted. How can I get those screen shot
to you?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the site
2. Failure occurs
3.

Actual Results:
Webpage, which I suspect is built with tables, fails to format correctly and
some information never becomes visible.

Expected Results:
Table should appear for entry of information by me in block for hour worked, etc.

I am authorized to use the site in question a are all employees. Those who
are not employee or otherwise specifically authorized may not access the site.
I have screen shot to send depicting Firefox display of website and IE
display. Tell me where to send them for your use a access is restricted.

Thanks,

Susan
