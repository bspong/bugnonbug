crash gdm while loading large JPEG? image

Happened to me several times:
I click on a large JPEG image (usually a scan) and during the load GDM crash and restart.

I think it happened at least two time when I'm trying to display a Gmail attachment so GMail header might be in cause

It never happened on a freshly opened Firefox ; hence the difficulty to reproduce.

I am using Ubuntu 10.04 with Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 from distro channel.

Reproducible: Sometimes
