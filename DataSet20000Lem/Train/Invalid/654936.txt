Channel switcher shouldn't be hidden behind a "Change" link
When trying to switch to another channel, a user ha to read a lot of text to discover how to switch. I think a lot of people trying to switch open the About dialog and close it because they don't find the switch buttons.

Instead of hiding those options, we should display the <select> option by default. It will allow people to quickly scan for that.
