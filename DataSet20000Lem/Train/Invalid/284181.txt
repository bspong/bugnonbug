I had some nice plugins when LiveConnect wa around. I see there is a new
initiative to bring back scriptable plugins. If I want to build the "basic"
plugin (from GeckoPluginSDK - samples) will this work with FireFox. I would
like to "send and receive" stream and utilize call like NPN_GetURL and
NPN_MemAlloc. With the new scriptable API evolving, is there any merit to
develop around these tool of the past?

Reproducible: Always
