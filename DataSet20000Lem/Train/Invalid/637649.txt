Status bar overlay doe not elide URL properly, widens entire content pane (w/Vertical Tabs add-on installed)
See: http://people.mozilla.org/~beltzner/firefox-b12-bug.mov

I cannot reproduce this locally, but Phil (who reported it to me) can, and we should figure out what's happening here. It seems like for Phil, no eliding of the URL is happening, and so the overlay end up widening the entire content area which ... doe poor thing with the layout on this particular web page.

We should add some form of guard that ensures that the status bar overlay never widens the entire content area.
