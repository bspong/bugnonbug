I show the mail I send to the Zope's list.
Possible this is not bug. But I don't understand, why it is working with IE, and
why not with Mozilla/Opera.
The problem is tested in PHP, and in Zope too.

The mail is:

Hi !

My contributor have a problem.

His problem is very interesting, but it is in php.

I try to help, but I get same problem in Zope.

The problem is that:
He have a site, and he is paranoid. He is not use static page to avoid
penetrations.
So: in a dynamic page he is check the request. If parameter are wrong, he is
want to set the resp. header status to 404.
(This is a file downloader method, and if the file is invalid, he want to answer
404 - page not found.)
He is not want to set location to a static 404 error page (because he is want to
"protect" the orig. URL).

When he is send header with php to Mozilla, or Opera, these browser are showing
blank page.
IE is showing good page (404).

Then I try to write this example in Zope, to help it:
# test2.py #
request = container.REQUEST
resp=RESPONSE = request.RESPONSE
resp.setStatus(404)

When I try this, I get same result in Zope (/test2).

So: what is the problem ?
And what is the solution ?

Thanx for help:
