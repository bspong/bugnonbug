Opening two Firefox window at the same time kill the enter key. (as of Firefox 3.0 RC2)

People open two Firefox window all the time, thinking the first click did not work. I would do that, and then close the extra window. Closing the extra window cause enter to not work on the remaining window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all firefox instances. Open two firefox window at the same.
2. On the second window, enter an address (e.g. www.yahoo.com) and press enter key. All should be normal
3. Close the second window.
4. On the first window, enter an address (e.g. www.yahoo.com) and press enter. Enter key doe not work. Green 'go' button doe not work
Actual Results:
nothing happens. no alerts, etc.

Expected Results:
the url is fetched upon pressing the enter key
