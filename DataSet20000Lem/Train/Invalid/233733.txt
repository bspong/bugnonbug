I've just upgraded from a nightly build in december to the new release of
Firefox 0.8 and have noticed that one of my web page stopped working. It seems
that the problem is in the method of using frames.location.href to change the
location. I've written up a testcase which demonstrates this.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Put both test case file in the same directory and open testcase.html.
a) Click on the first "broken" link.
b) Click the first "works" link
c) Click on the "Security error in the right iframe

Actual Results:
a) Does not change the location of the iframe a expected. Gives "Error:
uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005
(NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMLocation.href]" nsresult: "0x80004005
(NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: <unknown filename> :: onclick ::
line 0" data: no]" in javascript console.
b) Correctly change the location of the iframe.
c) Does not change the location of the iframe a expected. Gives "Security
Error: Content at http://localhost/testcase-a.html may not load or link to
chrome://browser/content/testcase.html." in javascript console

Expected Results:
All three action should correctly change the location of the iframe.

This regression (security fix??) break a few web page that work in IE and in
previous version of Mozilla Fire(bird|fox).
