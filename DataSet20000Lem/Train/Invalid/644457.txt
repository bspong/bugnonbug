Firefox's memory use increase monotonically during browsing. I've had it up to 1.8GB with 3 tab open.

I don't think this wa a problem in RC1, but I only used RC1 for a day or two so I can't be sure.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Browser
2. Open every Gawker website: gawker.com, gizmodo.com, lifehacker.com, kotaku.com, jezebel.com, jalopnik.com, deadspin.com.
3. Weep a the pageouts begin; closing tab doe not save you.
Actual Results:
For me doing it just now, memory use for firefox-bin increased from 14% to 42%, and dropped back down to 36% several minute after closing the tabs. On net, browser memory use increased nearly a gigabyte.

Expected Results:
Browser deallocates most of the 1.1 gigabyte it allocated to load those pages.

This is running on a Macbook Pro with OSX 10.6.6. I use noscript but I think I've allowed all the domain that gawker websItes use. I wa also using a userstyle but I really doubt that's the problem (also this happens with regular browsing too but the Gawker site are the worst).

I'm marking it critical because it make the browser fairly unusable after a few hours, forcing the user to restart it regularly (or le savvy user to get very confused), and overall make the browser considerably le competitive against Google Chrome.
