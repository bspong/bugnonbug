The SSL cert is valid for the wcbc.edu domain which includes all subfolders, but firefox is reporting incorrectly. I checked in version 3.5.3 on Win Vista and it work properly. Must have broken some time in between.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to https://wcbc.edu/apply
2.You will notice that you do not have a lock and it is reported a partially encrypted
3.
Actual Results:
Web page loaded. Then it is reported a not secure.

Expected Results:
Web page loaded. There should be a lock in the bottom left and there should be a blue button with the domain name inside of in the location bar. When that button is clicked it give the correct SSL iformation
