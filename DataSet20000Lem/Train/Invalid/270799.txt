The CSS command style="background-repeat: no-repeat" do not work. You will see
this on the menu background if you compare the web-page www.abigael.dk in EI
and Firefox. "no-repeat" may not be defined in CSS (only repeat-x, repeat-y
and repeat-xy are defined in my book), but EI understands "no-repeat" and it
is the only way to stop repetition since repeat-xy is default.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

Wrong repetition in the Y-direction until something else is written on the web-
page.

Expected Results:
No repetition of the background image.
