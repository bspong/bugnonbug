leaving image off of toolbarbutton throw up big group of icon
Created attachment 284197
screen shot

I have reproduced this on my Mac OS X 10.4.10 system with both 2.0.0.7 a shipped and with a trunk build from 20071001_093023_PDT.

You have to see the screen shot. It is a beauty.

I will try to attach an extension that show this. A copy of it will be at http://www.wykiwyk.com/mozilla/xyzzy.xpi.

Essentially, all the extension contains is the overlay below. Load the extension, then add the XYZZY button to the toolbar. Then, quit FF. Then delete the image line from the overlay and re-start Firefox.

Instead of a generic icon, it look a though it is taking all the icon in the customize drawer and adding them into one cell. Very weird.
