Pre-Private browsing Tabs are restored after exiting browser browser in private browsing mode and then starting normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open some page in tab
2. switch to private browsing
3. close firefox (File - Exit)
4. start firefox

Actual Results:
Firefox open the tab which where opened before changing to private browsing.
This could reveal user identity, by identity of IP and opening a page which wa opened before in private browsing.
I guess, a session restore happens.

Expected Results:
The browser should open without session restore, just opening default page a if started normally.

In my opinion, session restore should be disabled when beeing in private browsing mode (maybe it is already).
