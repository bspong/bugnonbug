The page http://hukolau.home.att.net/Documents/EP_Notes.html
display "correctly" in Netscape 7.1 and Mozilla 1.6 but not
in Firebird 0.7 The problem is with the width of the column
in Cyrillic. It look like Firebird doe not do text wrap
for this character set the same way that either Netscape
and Mozilla do it.

Note that it display properly in every other browser EXCEPT
IE 5 for the MAC. That is, it display properly on all browser
I have tested it with on a PC (including IE and Netscape 7.x),
display properly with every MAC browser except Firebird and
IE 5.
