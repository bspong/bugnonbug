After automatic upgrade to 1.5.0.2 cannot connect to internet
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2

FF 1.5 automatically upgraded itself to 1.5.0.2. All of my onld extension and bookmark ant theme are still in place but FF will not connect to the internet. I am using IE on the same machine at the same time and connect flawlessly. Therefore I must assume that it is the new build of FF that is the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch FoxFire.
2.Wait for something to happen.
3.Watch a nothing happens.

Actual Results:
Server not found
Firefox can't find the server at www.mozilla.com.
* Check the address for typing error such a
ww.example.com instead of
www.example.com
* If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
connection.
* If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

Expected Results:
I should see a pretty website called Mozilla

I have change nothing on my computer except for the upgrade to 1.5.0.2 I have set the default theme and disabled all extension (although 1.5 worked perfectly with them), all to no avail.
