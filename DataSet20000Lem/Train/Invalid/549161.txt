Certain letter cut off in location bar when Persona active and DirectWrite/Direct2D enabled.
It doesn't matter which Persona I install, if I have an active Persona and DirectWrite/Direct2D enabled, the bottom half of the letter g, j and q are cut off in the location bar a seen here:

As soon a I go back to the default theme that ship with the nightly build, the font are fully visible.
