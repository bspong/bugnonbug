Loading a page is quite fast, but any change happening after a page is loaded is a slow a watching a picture slideshow.
This problem doesn't exist in ff 2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start the browser.
2.go to http://home.arcor.de/bazonbloch/scrolltest/whyisscrollingonlinuxslowerthanonwindows.htm
3.start scrolling.
Actual Results:
i get a beautyfull picture slideshow.
at 1920x1200 it take 24 second to scroll up or down, at ~1024x786 it take 7 second to scroll up or down.

Expected Results:
schroll up or down in under 8 second on 1920x1200. Or in the least generate more then two screen update per second.

The feeling I get is that the page is rerenderd every time something happens, and no form of smart buffering/layer technique is applied.

The https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&format=guided page also kill performance.

with firefox 3 50% of all the internet page or more are slow, and some unbearable with viewing.

System:
Intel core2 E6550 2.33GHz
GForce 9600GT
