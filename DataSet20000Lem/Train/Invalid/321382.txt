Multiple tab open when I open the browser, even after I deleted the folder that these tab were contained in.

I set up the browser to open with three favorite tabs, but decided that I didn't want to use three tab when opening a new window. I am not able to stop the window from loading the three tab even after deleting the tab from the homepage folder, and even deleting the folder.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Open my browser and there are three tab that automatically open


Currently using Noia 2.0 Theme. I have tried uninstalling firefox and reinstalling it, but it doesn't get rid of the multiple tabs.
