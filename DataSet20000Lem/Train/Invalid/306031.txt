When I try to close a single tab, either through the 'close tab' button or the
tab menu, firefox close instantly. This also occurs when more than one tab is
open, and the 'close all tabs?' warning is on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox.
2. Open a page in a second tab so that the close tab button appears.
3. Click on the 'close tab'-button or use the tab menu to close the tab.
4. Boom.

Actual Results:
The browser closed without an error message.

Expected Results:
It should have closed the currently active tab.
