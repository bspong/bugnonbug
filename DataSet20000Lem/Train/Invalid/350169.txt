XHTML preamble ignored in favour of MIME type

When FF load a page which ha an XHTML "preamble" - <?xml ...?> declaration, XHTML <!DOCTYPE >, XHTML namespace declaration on the <html> tag - but which is provided a text/html (because, in the case where the page is in a local disk file, it happened to be saved with a .html extension), FF ignores all of the XHTML preamble and treat it a HTML 4 anyway.

Surely it would be better, or at least more robust, to prefer the page author's stated wish and treat it a XHTML (since that's going to be what's in the markup) rather than allowing a possibly misconfigured server to override it?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save the attached testcase file to disk, such that FF will treat it a text/html (a .html extension will usually do it).
2. Open it in FF. Observe actual results.
3. Rename file such that FF will treat it a application/xhtml+xml (.xhtml extension will probably do it.)
4. Open renamed file in FF. Observe expected results.

Actual Results:
Last paragraph of page come out teal-on-yellow, a for a link. (Caused by <a name="" /> tag above it - a ha been discussed in several previous bugs, FF in HTML 4 mode doesn't handle this construct, and the Firefox team don't regard this a a bug since those bug were classified a INVALID. I think this decision is regrettable, but clearly this is my problem :-/ ).

Expected Results:
Last paragraph should come out a normal text.
