The DPI (normal: 96dpi, big; 120dpi) setting in Windows Configuration - Display
- Settings- Advanced doesn't have effect on Firefox. This is disturbing on
Laptops with XVGA schreens (1400x1050). Internet Explorer work better in this way.
I tried the setting within Firefox (Options - General - Fonts & Colors - Display
resolution. But also this setting doesn't have effect.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.change dpi setting setting in Windows Configuration - Display - Settings-
Advanced in 120 dpi
2. start Firefox and load a page
3. Start Internet explorer and load a page
Actual Results:
you see a different format of font of menu's and in page between firefox and IE

Expected Results:
display must be equal between Firefox and IE
