it crash when entering thumbnail-viewed folder (my case: with image [my
pictures], folder name doesn't matter, image format doesn't matter, sizes,
filenames)
i.e. AFTER open dialog wa showed and BEFORE 'ok' is clicked or any file in the
folder is selected

in my case when clicking button to browse in uploading form (file field)
in any folder, configured to be viewed with thumbnail
with or without thumbnail cache set
explorer manages that good

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click button to browse file in multipart/form-data upload form, input type=field
2. select thumbnail view in opened dialog box
3. go to folder with image (and crash)

Actual Results:
crash without notice

Expected Results:
doesn't crash
