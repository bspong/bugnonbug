I get this error every time I start the browser:
load:TypeError:Components.classes['@checkpoint.com/XPComTrustCheckerMozilla/TrustCheckMozilla;1'] is undefined

I can close the error window and still use the browser and everything seems to work fine so far. I've only been using this for a couple of day so will see if this really affect any browsing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double click on icon for Firefox Beta 4.0b2 to start browser.
2. A browser window pop up minimized.
3. The error window pop up over the minimized browser window
Actual Results:
I took a screenshot of the error window. Closed the window and wa able to maximize the browser window and am using the browser not to enter this bug report.

Expected Results:
The browser should have started maximized without an error window.

I have not made any adjustment to the original browser download. I wanted to try the beta version first to see how it function without any additional add-in or functions. The only thing I did do wa have it display the menu bar at the top of the screen - which work fine.
