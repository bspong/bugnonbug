Ctrl+R stop working after switching tab

I often load about a dozen tabs, using Open All in Tabs (right-click a bookmark folder). Some are market charts, here's a typical URL:

http://finance.yahoo.com/charts#chart1:symbol=^ixbk;range=5d;indicator=volume;charttype=candlestick;crosshair=on;logscale=on;source=undefined

As time passes, I want to update the chart, so I press Ctrl+R (View, Reload). If I click a different tab at the top, and press Ctrl+R, that page (on the new tab) will not reload.

If, on the other hand, I use Ctrl-PgUp or Ctrl-PgDn to switch tabs, Ctrl+R works. Selecting View, Reload from the menu bar always works, no matter how you navigate to the tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load multiple tab
2. Press Ctrl+R to reload a tab
3. Press Ctrl+PgUp or Ctrl+PgDn to access another tab
4. Press Ctrl+R to reload the different tab, nothing happens.
Actual Results:
The page on the tab accessed by Ctrl+PgUp or Ctrl+PgDn will not reload in response to Ctrl+R. It will reload in response to View/Reload (from menu bar).

Expected Results:
The page should reload in response to Ctrl+R.

Because Ctrl-R work on the first tab, but not on subsequent tab that are accessed by Ctrl-PgUp or Ctrl-PgDn, I doubt that any other program is intercepting the keystroke. That's especially unlikely considering that a tab that is accessed by mouse click doe reload in response to Ctrl+R.
