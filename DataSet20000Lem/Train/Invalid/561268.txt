Two systems: Pentium-III w/ ATI Radeon M6 LY and P4 w/ nVidia NV11 [GeForce2 Go]. Both system exhibit problem.

Two Desktop Environments: Xfce and KDE. Both DEs exhibit problem.

Two profiles: Default and special with different add-on enabled sometimes with only one add-on enabled.

Two add-ons: NoScript and Cookie Monster usage caused crash independent of one another (NoScript without Cookie Monster installed and vice-versa).

Seems to be only in Lucid Beta1, Beta2, and RC. Have not demonstrated problem in Debian 5.0.4 GNU/Linux (KDE) or Linux Mint 8 Helena Xfce CE. Have not tried Ubuntu 9.10 (except that Mint 8 is based on 9.10).

Crash close desktop and all application back to tty and then *dm automatically reloads with graphical login prompt displayed. All unsaved data is lost but recovered session stable a long a add-on not used.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run {K|X}ubuntu Lucid Lynx Development Branch in Desktop Environment.
2. Run Firefox.
3. Click Add-on icon.
4. Watch the crash.
Actual Results:
Crash.

Expected Results:
No crash?

Filed bug report in a few place including "dead-ends". After living with this I believe ultimate responsibility life with the Ubuntu Development Team with respect to Xorg since it is allowing an application to crash it. However, Firefox shouldn't crash either. Not enough memory to enable Crash Reporting Assistant to effectively do it's job. Installed firefox-dbg but doesn't appear to help ID the problem. xsession-errors file saved offline for forensics if it can be useful -- I'm no expert here and cannot tell for sure where the crash start in the Xorg error file, although I have a decent idea.

Potentially relevant excerpt from xsession-errors:

I'm listing this a critical for now because it doe cause a crash and loss of data even if only Firefox were to crash.
