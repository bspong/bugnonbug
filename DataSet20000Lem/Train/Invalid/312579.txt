If visiting http://rink.nu/tmp/broken.html, you will see that Firefox
incorrectly render the document content a part of the <textarea> attribute.
However, W3C's validator claim the page is correct XHTML, so this should not
happen. Only elinks (lynx and w3m fail) render the page correctly of all
browser I have access to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit the URL.
Actual Results:
You will see part of the document in the textarea, whereas it should appear in
the document.

Expected Results:
It should support short-tag <textarea /> in which textarea's do not have any
content.

The only solution is to use <textarea></textarea>, which doe render fine.
