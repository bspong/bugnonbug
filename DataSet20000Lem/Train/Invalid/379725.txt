Links clicked in Outlook 2007 open two tab due to file type association

The "file type" (Tools/Folder Options in Explorer) of "URL:HyperText Transfer Protocol" ha the following setting when Firefox is set a the default browser:

Application used to perform action:
C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -url "%1" -requestPending

Use DDE: (checked)
DDE Message: "%1",,0,0,,,,

Note there are two entry for %1. If one remove one of the %1 entries, such a changing the first line to

C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -url -requestPending

...then the URL is only opened once, however, Firefox then think it is not set a the default browser and want to "correct" the command line entry. What happens in the background is that Windows "fixes" the commmand line to:

C:\PROGRA~1\MOZILL~1\FIREFOX.EXE -url -requestPending %1

Since the -url is not next to the %1, the command line URL is not opened.

Firefox should not process both the command line %1 and the DDE %1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click link in Outlook 2007.
2. Notice two tab open.

Actual Results:
Two tab opened. :)

Expected Results:
One tab opens. :) Firefox should not process both the command line %1 and the DDE %1.
