Firefox freeze for several seconds, ad related
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

While loading webpages, Firefox will often freeze for 10-20 second and give the spinning rainbow wheel (I'm on a mac). The message in the lower-left corner say "Transferring data from ad.doubleclick.com". This occurs on many webpage (presumably all one that use content doubleclick.com), but doe not hang up when loading content from any other web page (ads or otherwise). After ten to twenty seconds, it finishes/unfreezes and I may continue to browse.

This happens multiple time during a single browsing session, but doe not happen more than once while loading a single web page.

I do not use any ad-blocking extension or tools.
