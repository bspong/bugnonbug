If I open www.pandora.com and let it load into the browser, open new tab and start switching between them, the switching becomes extremely slow and eventually hang the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open www.pandora.com
2.Open other page in individual tab
3.Switch between tab
Actual Results:
The tab switching is extremely slow. The time to switch between tab is anywhere from 30 second to 2 minutes. I've even gotten the browser to hang.

Expected Results:
The browser should switch between tab rapidly.
