scaling of jpeg image is broken: scaled jpg image sometimes display all white (blank).

the test case display two image that are scaled up to the width of their container, which is the document body.

by changing the width of the browser window, you should see the two image scaled, but sometimes one or both image are displayed a white rectangles.

note: one image is scaled using the old-style form (width="100%") and the other is scaled using the cs form (style="width:100%;height:auto;"). the scaling fails in both cases.

Reproducible: Always

1. go to http://www.loupiote.com/test-ff-3.5.5-jpg-scaling-fails.shtml
2. change the width of the browser window (slowly)

this is a critical bug, and it affect all website that scale jpg image to fit their containers. it is especially a problem when the container size is adjusted based on the window size.
