Firefox 2.0 worked great. Firefox upgraded to 2.0.0.1 and now sslexplorer 1.6 menu after logging in doe not work (only tested WinXP). I've checked this several time on several installation (using WinXP). I've tested with FF2.0 and then allowed the upgrade to FF2.0.0.1 and then sslexplorer menu don't work. Perhaps there is stricter JavaScript checking in the update a the error console ha a message cannot convert value to interger.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install SSLExplorer 1.6
2.Install FireFox 2.0.0.1
3.Run SSLExplorer Client through FF and login
4.Menus in SSLExplorer no longer working
Actual Results:



Expected Results:
This should work a is did in FF2.0, i.e. the menu should have worked

FF2.0 supported SSLExplorer 1.16

FF2.0.0.1 broke this function supported in 2.0

I had to uninstall FF2.0.0.1 and install FF2.0 with no update or FF1.5.0.9 with update
