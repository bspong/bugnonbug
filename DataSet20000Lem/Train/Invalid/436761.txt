I can't find the actual Larry UI bug.
I can find a billion bug that mention Larry, even one (bug 395694) that mention "since larry landed", and usually in the "since x landed" bug there's a reference to which bug landed. Not here.

For some reason I guess MoCo ha decided that referencing bugs, or at least putting a bug somewhere reasonable (wiki.mozilla.org, or bugid=larry) so that when referenced it could be found, is passe. Let's just forget about making it possible to use bugzilla by references, because we've got that search thing that requires 3 credit hour at the local community college to use efficiently.

So where's the Larry bug? Is it a security problem so it's hidden? I'm sure people could still reference the bug number.

(And you're free to view this bug a a "the search function of bugzilla sucks" bug, if you like.)
