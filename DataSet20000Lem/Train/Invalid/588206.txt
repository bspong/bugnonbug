Identi.ca (similar to twitter) pop open a geo-location "arrow panel"(?) whenever you visit the site, and if you dont accept to share or not, you’ll see it every time you visit.
Currently, if I want to use the link on the site, I have to click on a link twice.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ignore geo-location pop-up
2. Click link
Actual Results:
Link is not navigated to.

Expected Results:
Link should be navigated to.

This wasn’t a problem when the geo location request wa in an information bar at the top of the page, this feature seems like a regression.
