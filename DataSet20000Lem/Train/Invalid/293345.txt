"Error launching browser window:no XBL binding for browser" upon start
User-Agent: Opera/8.0 (Windows 98; U; pl)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050507 Firefox/1.0+

Whenever I start Firefox, an XUL error appears stating "Error launching browser
window:no XBL binding for browser". I click "OK", and the main Firefox window
appears, but... There are no bookmarks, and I can't open any page. Whenever I
enter an URL into the address bar and hit "Go", it just stay there.

The problem appeared on the 2005-05-05-07-trunk build. It worked in 2005-05-04-
16-trunk and earlier, but...

I deleted my profile and installed the newest trunk. It didn't work again, so I
uninstalled Firefox and installed 2005-05-04-16. It also didn't work, and I got
the same error. Could it be related with the profile?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla Firefox
2. Hit "Ok" on the error
3. Try to load any webpage

Actual Results:
First an error appeared, then Firefox won't load any website.

Expected Results:
No error should've appeared, Firefox should load every website which URL would
be provided in the navigation bar.

* Deleting the profile didn't work
* Reinstalling of Firefox didn't work
* Any about: URL doesn't work
* Safe Mode doesn't work
