system randomly crash since installing firefox.

Ever since installing Firefox, my system will frequently give me the blue screen
of death with an error message that I can not read (flashes too fast), and then
the computer reboots. I have not experienced this problem until after I had
installed Firefox. So far I am very happy with the program otherwise.

Also, trying to report this problem ha been a pain. I'm not even sure if this
is going to the correct division, if not, please forward.

Reproducible: Always

1.No rhyme or reason
