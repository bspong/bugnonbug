"Ubuntu Firefox Modifications" addon break toolbar icon related addons

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot Ubuntu
2. Start Firefox with "Ubuntu Firefox Modifications" enabled (which is the default).
3. Some addons now have lost their functionality.
Actual Results:
It seems to affect only addons that have toolbar icons.
For example, icon from the "Personal Menu" addon are missing.
"Tab Mix Plus" is also affected.


When I install "Personal Menu" from a new profile in Ubuntu, the icon appear when installed, however they never appear in my own profile that I created in Windows Vista (even after re-installing) on Ubuntu. The only way to make them appear in by disabling "Ubuntu Firefox Modifications".

Ubuntu Firefox Modifications (0.6)
Ubuntu configuration default and apt support for firefox extensions/plugins.

"Ubuntu Firefox Modifications" isn't needed by default since only power user would want apt support (for what ever reason?!). I don't know ``configuration defaults'' are loaded, but I assume it's small thing like using the user's Network Proxy's settings. A permanent addon seems a little extreme here for that task. Although I realise that Ubuntu are correctly assuming that most user are inept with computers, it should not affect power user who want to move their profile into Ubuntu. I think Ubuntu should only enable "Ubuntu Firefox Modifications" when user create a new profile. Anyone smart enough to be able to move their profile into Ubuntu can figure out what ``configuration defaults'' they need if they do indeed need them.
