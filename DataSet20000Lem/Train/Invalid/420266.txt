Both the short-hand security info (at the left edge of the address box) and "Page info" consider "about:" URLs to be located on remote sites. The user is warned about lack of verification of the site's identity, and is told that "unencrypted data is transmitted over network".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to about:blank or similar
2. click security info just next to the address box
3. be told that you're connecting to an unverified site

Same work with Tools|Page Info
Actual Results:
"Connection Not Encrypted"
"The page you are viewing is not encrypted."
"Information sent over the Internet without encryption can be seen by other people while it is in transit."

Expected Results:
"Local Page"
"The page you are viewing is stored locally, and wa not transmitted over the network."
