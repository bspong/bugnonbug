- open the page "about:blank": the "about:blank" vanishes from the address bar
- right-click the the toolbar "Customize"
- confirm th customize-window to close it:

Now the address bar show the "about:blank"!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:
The adress bar show another address than before "Customize".

Expected Results:
"Customize" should not change the address-bar!

But I like what Fireox doe after "Customize" more...
So I suggest to show always "about:blank". The fact that "about:blank" is not
shown after entering is irritating for unexperienced users. They could think
it's possible to get an empty page by confirming an empty address bar. IE
correctly always show "about:blank" if this empty page is "loaded".
