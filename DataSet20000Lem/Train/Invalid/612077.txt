Whenever I try to download/saveas an image, or file, I get nothing. The download manager is either not there anymore, or it's turned off. It's obviously a portion of the browser overlooked when this beta7 release wa released.

Also, there are several other thing that worked in Beta 6 that do not work in Beta 7:

1. Feedback button. Click on it and it give you choice but you can't click them.

2. Sync doesn't work. No mater how long you wait after clicking, nothing happens.

3. Closing multiple tabs. It used to ask me if I wanted to save or quit, and it no longer does.

Reproducible: Always
