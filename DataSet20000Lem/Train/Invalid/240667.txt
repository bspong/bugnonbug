I am a new firefox user firefox. You people are all doing a great Job.
Thank you.

I am used to being able to drag a URL to the "link" toolbar in "IE" and then
"right clicking" to choose "rename" and shorten the entry to a simple phrase to
save room on the limited line availale for "links". This allows for many more
"visible" "links".

I could not figure out how to do this.

Thanks again,
Stephen Scheuer
