I am using the ArsClip clipboard manager (http://www.joejoesoft.com/cms/showpage.php?cid=97). It work a intended with every other application, except Firefox (including other browser such a IE and Google Chrome). The ArsClip program option is set to "Copy to Clipboard and press CTRL+V". It is clear that the "Copy to Clipboard" bit work but not the "press CTRL+V" a subsequently manually pressing CTRL+V completes the operation. I have spoken to the developer and he state that the problem is that "...Firefox fails to correctly report the text window with focus...". Consequently, ArsClip doe not know where to paste the text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy text (ArsClip save the text to it database, a can be confirmed in the pop-up window).
2. Select a text window in Firefox to receive the copied text.
3. Click the desired text from the ArsClip pop-up window (does not have to be the first entry in the list of saved clips). Nothing appears. Press CTRL+V, the text appears.
Actual Results:
Selecting desired text from ArsClip list of saved clip fails to paste it into any text window within Firefox.

Expected Results:
Text should immediately appear upon selection.

Work a expected.
