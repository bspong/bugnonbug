Hi,
When I looked an introduction of a game on the webpage, I pressed the button on the pop-up screen incidentally

Then, the antivirus system: “BitDefender Antivirus Plus v10” show repeat message while I am opening FF and closing FF. The message said the computer got virus about Javascript, they are:
1.Exploit.HTML.IframeBof.A
2.Generic.XPL.CodeBase.38E3FFEE

FF can be generally used a normal and nothing is wrong. It only get the message again when I wa opening FF and closing FF at every time.

Today, I found that there is no response after I pressed some button from some webpages. Those button are written by Javascript. I guess BitDefender showed the real thing that the virus are made from Javascript.

I followed the path of virus listed by BitDefender where I cannot find the folder and files. BitDefender showed it “block” entire virus and they have the number of error of JAVASCRIPT.
They are:

1. JAVASCRIPT 20 Errors
2. JAVASCRIPT 19 Errors

I went to the BitDefender official webpages, and I cannot find the content of these two viruses, but relatives. It said these “may be” virus or “maybe “worm”. I am confused.

I run again BitDefender to scan the window XP, it found these viruses, but BitDefender showed that it cannot solve the infected file and folder and it can only block and remove them.

Even if I tied to command BitDefender to manually remove these infected things, it didn’t work.

I uninstall FF and use CClear to clear the registry of FF.

Then I re-install FF, but the situation is the same…

Can anyone help me with these two viruses?
