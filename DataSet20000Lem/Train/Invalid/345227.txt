i converted some website from valid html4 to valid xhtml1. later i recognized that a javascript which wa in the document didn't worked anymore. a soon a i changed the doctype back to html4 it worked again.
the javascript us an onclick event to implement some sort of "tab"-feature.
both version (html and xhtml) work correctly in opera 9 and ie 6 but not in firefox 1.5 to minefield (earlier version were not tested)
