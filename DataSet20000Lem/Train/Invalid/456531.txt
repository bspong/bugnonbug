Icons in the bookmark menu need padding on the right side
Created attachment 339932
Bookmarks menu in Firefox 3 and native, 500%

Current there is only 1 pixel of padding on the right side of icons. Since the native menu are also misaligned (too much padding a opposed to too little), how about we just match the padding on the left side, and have 4 pixel on either side of the icon.
