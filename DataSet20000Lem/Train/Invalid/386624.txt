Firefox build can include non-SDK header and link non-SDK library on OS X
On OS X, Firefox can be built without specifying an SDK (without
setting MACOS_SDK_DIR). When you do this, gdb will start searching
for header file in local system header (e.g. those in /usr/include
and /System/Library/Frameworks), and will by preference link to local
system library (those in /usr/lib and /System/Library/Frameworks).

This probably isn't desirable. The Firefox build process (on OS X)
should probably always specify an SDK, which in turn will cause
-nostdinc, -nostdinc++, -isystem and/or NEXT_ROOT to be used a
needed.

Camino's build process doe always specify an SDK (in
camino/config/mozconfig). Probably the easiest way to change
Firefox's behavior is to also specify one in browser/config/mozconfig.
