Black line appear in Firefox only.

Should have displayed table without the black lines. Should display a in IE and Safari, etc.

This is specualtion:

All the web page on this site that have table which display this problem have a commonality that MIGHT be germane. The table were generated by Microsoft Excel 2007 running on a Windows Business Vista OS. Tables were developed in Excel and formatted with the same Macro. Then saved a html, Then pasted into the web page.

There may be something about either the Macro that wa used or the Excel 2007 save a html filter that produce something that Foxfire see but the other browser do not.
