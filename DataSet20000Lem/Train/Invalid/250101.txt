Frequent report of build failure in mozilla/rdf/chrome/src (nsChromeRegistry::UninstallPackage)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040629 Firefox/0.9.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040629 Firefox/0.9.1

The need to use a mozconfig with at least the standard option to compile
Firefox & Thunderbird doe not have a high enough profile. Consequently, many
people using unix or unix-like OS are downloading the source tarballs and using
only ./configure; make to build the Aviary, and get the following error:

nsChromeRegistry.cpp:2693: prototype for `nsresult
nsChromeRegistry::UninstallPackage(const PRUnichar *, int)' doe not match any
in class `nsChromeRegistry'
nsChromeRegistry.h:76: candidate is: nsresult
nsChromeRegistry::UninstallPackage(const nsACString &, int)

in mozilla/rdf/chrome/src.

For example, bug 247292, bug 247389, and several thread at the Mozillazine
forum (search for UninstallPackage).

I suggest a line be added to the release notes, which point to the build page
at http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/build.html, and
http://mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/build.html
Or, it may be helpful to add a file in the mozilla/ directory, called INSTALL in
the usual Linux fashion, which point to the same locations.

Given the growing popularity of the 'birds, the unusual Mozilla build system,
and the tendency of linux/unix user to prefer to roll their own, this change
will save many question and frustrated people.
