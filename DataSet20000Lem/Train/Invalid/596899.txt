In the latest minefield build, when you hover over a link, it appears in a confusing interface in the url bar. The link is highlighted in grey, and sepparated from the current page link with a > graphic. However, this appears to just be part of the current page link. It's hard to read. It's hard to distinguish from the current page. It cut off the current page link unnecessarily. It also cut off the tail end of the target link, making it very hard to read. This "feature" should be removed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover over link
2. Greyed, hard to read, text appears on the right side of the url bar.
3. Current page link is partially obscured, target link tail is cut off.
Actual Results:
Greyed, hard to read, text appears on the right side of the url bar.

Current page link is partially obscured, target link tail is cut off.

Expected Results:
Target link appears on status bar. Or, it could appear in the url bar, with easy to read highlighting and background coloring, and an indication that it is the target. This would *replace* the current page link, not cover part of it. However, any use of this location to display target link might confuse some users.
