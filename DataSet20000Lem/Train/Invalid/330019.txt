Cannot start Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5

I am getting the following error while trying to start FIREFOX version 1.5 on my personnal PC running Window XP Home edition.

"Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."

I have been using Firefox for almost 2 year & wa very happy with it. But suddenly I came accross the above error yesterday Thursday 9 March 2006. I did try to shutdown my Computer to restart it but not to avail. And there are no other instance of other Firefox process running.
Can you please tell me what is going on & guide me how to fix this poblem. I do not want to go back to Internet Explorer.
