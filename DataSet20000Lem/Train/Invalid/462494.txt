Many popups appear asking my master password when I restore my session with many tab and a proxy

I have a master password, and I use a proxy (with user/password authentication).

If I close Firefox when it have 10 tabs, at next restart I will have 10 popups asking me my master password, and 10 others popups to validate credential of the proxy.

This problem exists since at least version 1.5 of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a master password (preference -> security -> use a master password)
2. Add a proxy with credential (preference -> advanced -> network -> settings)
3. Open 10 tab
4. Close Firefox
5. Open Firefox, and restore session
Actual Results:
10 popups asking for the master password, and 10 others for the credential of the proxy.

Expected Results:
Only one popup asking for the master password, and only one other for validating the credential of the proxy.

Sometimes, I don't know why, with by example 2 tabs, I have ~50 popups for the master password. Maybe Firefox try to download all element of a web page in a restored tab.

Sometimes too the popup asking for the master password is empty, there is no text on it.
