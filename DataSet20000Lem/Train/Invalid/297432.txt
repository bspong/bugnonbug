Hotel web page hijacked most of my tab

As a guest of the new Wynn Resort in Las Vegas 6/10/05 I had to use their
portal to access the internet from my room.

I have checked out of the hotel.

I am at the airport using an air card.

Of the 10 tab I normally use, 6 of them will not allow me to see the original
sites. Instead I get the Wynn hotel sign on screen. It will not let go.

How do I release this to get my "tabs" back?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.You would have to be a hotel guest I assume.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The web page line show the wsj.com site, but even starting a new tab, every
time I try to access it, I am locked to the Wynn Resort sign on page.
