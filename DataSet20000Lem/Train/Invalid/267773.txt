Firefox get stuck in startup, unresponsive
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Unable to provide (see error).

FireFox doe not start anymore.

I have used FireFox 1.0PR for quite some time. Yesterday it stopped working.
It sort of starts, but is unresponsive, menu do not open (except for the
context sensitive one on tabs) and keypresses (like ctrl+t) do nothing. I
can't activate the address bar. So effectively, FF can't be used.

I tried installing FireFox to a new directory, but it did not help.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FireFox.


Actual Results:
See details.

Expected Results:
Start up normally.

Search bar menu open up in the wrong place.

I can't test with the default theme, because I can't access the theme setup.
