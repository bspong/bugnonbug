I went to Help > Check for Updates... since 3.5 ha been released. The whole process went fine, but when the newly installed 3.5 launched, it loaded the RC page and link to RC release notes.

Help > About list version 3.5 -- not 3.5RC or the like.

I think the start page URL in the production build need to be updated.

RC version: http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5/whatsnew/
