Window not redrawing until moved or resized
For couple of week now Firefox sometimes stop updating window contents. If I move or resize window it resume rendering updates. Also, popup menu sometimes show up with garbage.

I have D2D disabled but it also happens with it enabled.
My GPU: AMD Radeon HD6850
