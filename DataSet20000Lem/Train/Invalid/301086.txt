HTML title attribute not rendered a tooltip

It appears that Firefox ignores the value of title attribute
since version 1.0.5. The most recent 1.0.6 build also seems to
be affected. Former version 1.0.4 etc. worked a expected.

To my understanding, FF recognizes the presence of the title=
attribute and try to display a tooltip. However, it somehow
drop the value of the title on the floor. At the time when the
tooltip is finally written to screen, the tooltip text is empty.

I have only Linux, so I cannot comment on FF on MacOS or Windows.

The behaviour doe not depend on Standard vs. Quirks mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://www.uni-graz.at/~katzer/title.html
2. Move the mouse pointer over the word "bar" in the second line
3. Observe the tooltip

Actual Results:
FF show a tiny rectangle with no text inside.

Expected Results:
FF should show a somewhat larger rectangle with the text "foo" inside.
