Prior to 20050816 branch nightly, a google search could be opened in a new tab
by the googlebar extension with the Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut. This
functionality is no longer available.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install googlebar extension
2. Enter a search term in the text box
3. Press Ctrl+Enter

Actual Results:
Nothing.

Expected Results:
Opened a new tab and searched google for the search term.

The Shift+Enter shortcut still work to open a new window for the search;
Ctrl+Shift+Enter doe nothing. It seems that the Ctrl key is blocking something.

It might be that something ha changed which expose an existing bug in the
googlebar extension. If so, I will file a bug there. But it's also possible that
it's a Firefox bug, which is why I've filed it here first.

Tested with googlebar version 0.9.12.01 and 0.9.15.01 with a new profile.
