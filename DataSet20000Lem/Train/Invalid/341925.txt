Here's a simple piece of HTML: <table><tr><td>foo</td></tr></table>

The td element (the one containing the foo) should be stylable with the following CSS:

table > tr > td { border: 2px dashed purple }

However, it is not. You have to specify tbody in the chain for it to work:

table > tbody > tr > td { border: 2px dashed purple }

A CSS guru I talked to said it wasn't just uncomfortable (since tbody isn't present a an actually written element) but also seriously problematic since tbody is an optional element.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load the following HTML: <html><head><style>table > tr > td { border: 2px dashed purple }</style></head><body><table><tr><td>foo</td></tr></table></body></html>
2.Notice that the td doesn't have a border a it should.
3. add the tbody between the table and the tr so you get: <html><head><style>table > tbody > tr > td { border: 2px dashed purple }</style></head><body><table><tr><td>foo</td></tr></table></body></html>
4. now the td ha a border

Actual Results:
style is not applied (to a table cell border in this case)

Expected Results:
style should be applied (to the table cell border in this case)
