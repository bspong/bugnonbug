I get this problem whenever I try to view an attachment a Bugzilla bug at
Eclipse.org.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the provided URL.

The provided URL go directly to a Bugzilla attachment. The parent page that
link to the attachment is https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=55760.

Actual Results:
Firefox open a dialog that prompt me to open the image in "Firefox" or
"gimp-remote". Selecting Firefox pop up a dialog telling me that Firefox is
already running (this is a separate bug - "Firefox" shouldn't be an option if
it's not going to work). Selecting "gimp-remote" doe nothing. This could just
be a configuration problem on my machine.

Expected Results:
On all other browsers, going to the provided URL just correctly show the image.
This is the correct behavior. I'm filing this a "major" because Firefox is
failing to do something a basic a showing an image.
