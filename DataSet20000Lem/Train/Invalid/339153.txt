Occasionally in Norton Internet Security's Connections log, local and remote IPs on communicating port will log a jgillick.nettripper.com. This occurs on various port that normally log a localhost. I run Firefox with a number of extensions, but a far a I know, none of them were written by Gillick. I also have a multitude of anti-virus and anti-spyware programs, and none seems to register anything odd. It seems to occur randomly, but continues for the entire session.

Reproducible: Sometimes




This may have nothing to do with Firefox, but since all the information I could find indicates that Jeremy Gillick is (or was) part of the Mozilla development team, I figured I'd ask.
