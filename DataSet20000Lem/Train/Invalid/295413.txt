I love firefox exremely for it's technical feature but, a all of u know the
important part of the browser is GUI.
in this stage I almost work with firefox but when I using Opera or IE the fresh
user interface of them give me another sence but I should say that I never
discard firefox for this cheap reason but it is very important for spreading
firefox.
I suggest that design skin and theme that they be too like IE 6 or Opera 8,
exactly like them, then all user can use firefox with great.
