Bookmark backup is either broken or useless, bookmarks.bak is always a copy of bookmarks.html

This is 1.0PR on Linux and MacOS. When my start page is a bookmark then
Bookmarks.bak is updated when nothing ha happened eliminating it's value a a
backup

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.enable bookmark backup start firefox then exit it without doing anything
2.Look at bookmarks.html and bookmarks.bak they will be freshly updated and be
identical.
3.

Actual Results:
Both bookmark and bookmarks.bak had been updated and were identical

Expected Results:
I would not expect bookmarks.html to be updated unless something had been
accessed (caveat, my default startup page is a bookmark). I would not expect
bookmarks.bak to be updated unless I had explicitly edited my bookmarks, i.e.
added, removed, moved or edited a bookmark - updating e.g. access time should
not update a backup.

I reiterate, the value of a backup is to protect against user error, therefore
the backup should only be updated a a consequence of USER action
