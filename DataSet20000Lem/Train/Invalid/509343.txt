i asked firefox to open blank page when it starts. But it reopens the tab I had when firefox starts. This happens when I open a couple of tabs, shift to private browsing and close firefox while I am still browsing privately.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools-> Options -> Main -> Startup -> When Firefox start -> Show blank page
2. Open 3 tab
3. Shift to private browsing while the 3 tab are still open.
4. Open 3 more tab in private browsing
5. Exit firefox while browsing privately
6. Start firefox

Actual Results:
Firefox open with 3 tab (the one that were opened in step 2)

Expected Results:
Firefox should open with a blank page
