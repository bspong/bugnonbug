It is weird that customize toolbars split the reload and stop button
In a new Firefox profile, the reload and stop button are combined in the toolbar. But if I go into customize toolbars, they split, pushing the home button to the right. This seems like a confusing way to express "you have a combined stop and reload button, but you can split them if you want".

Instead, I think the combined button should appear in customize toolbars a a single button with both icons, and distinct button should be available in the panel or by clicking something near the combined buttons.
