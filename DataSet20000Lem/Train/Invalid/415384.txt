Actions for downloads is limited, you can only remove action but cannot add for instance it would be good if I could add manually .ogg -> open with plugin X...
The bug is that Firefox doe nothing... at least it should ask for a plugin, but it doesn't happen. In my machine I have VLC and Windows Media Player, both can play ogg audio file (I tested) but Firefox doesn't give me a chance to tell it at least to open that file with x program.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
No audio is played and no plugin is asked

Expected Results:
Firefox should ask to install a plugin

In order to Windows Media Player to manage ogg files, I needed to download and install the ogg codecs by a program found at internet.
