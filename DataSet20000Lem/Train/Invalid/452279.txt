Incorrect certificate analysis with system time in the past
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0.1

Every time I log onto a new site I am told the certificate is invalid even when it isn't. Happened on bugzilla, by the way. With particular site I must repeat this step several times.
Then when firefox block content there is no way to unblock it. I find this in particular with site where one ha to type in distorted letter to confirm one is not spam (sorry don't know what they're called). craigslist is an example. Sometimes if there is an option it is not activated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go through the posting process on craiglist real estate for sale, by broker, dc.
2.Fill in ad description, continue to acceptance terms, continue to validation page
3.only continue button - no distorted security letter
Actual Results:
No security letter so when I hit continue nothing happens

Expected Results:
Nothing

Happens on other website where there is security such a my real estate firm form site.
