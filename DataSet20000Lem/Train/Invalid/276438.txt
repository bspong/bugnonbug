View Selection Source should appear in toolbar menu
this is a very nice browser...I downloaded it for mac because I really need the
view selected source option that you DO have for the pc version.

why is there always something missing
in mac versions?

an liklihood of it showing up in a new version? is there a ful l featured
version I can pay for for mac osX that I can buy which ha the view selected
source?

sigh
