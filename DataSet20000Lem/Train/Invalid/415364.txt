Firefox had a complete freeze up at my own site. Never had this happen with FF2.

Was looking at my own blog just after updating comments. Using middle mouse wheel to scroll down to the bottom of web page. FF froze up. The only thing I could do wa move the mouse around, wa not able to click anything. Could not move to another tab or window. Waited 5 minutes, still no thawing. Did control alt delete to bring up task manager and that gave me back access to my PC again. Did not have to actually close down FF or restart the computer. Never had that happen with FF2. Just downloaded the beta last night.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Went to page.

Actual Results:
Tried a second and third time and did not have a problem.
