CSS not handled correctly unless you toggle Page Style

In the page at www.fromltojsoftware.com is a link to My Account. Take the link
and you will go to http://www.fromltojsoftware.com/stars/HomePage.do (which is
the entry way into a secure area, but you do not have to go any further to see
the error.)


The HTML source from the step to reproduce (1) and (2) is identical. The page
work on Safari, IE 5 and IE 6 on appropriate Mac (8.6 - X) and Windows (98 -
XP) platforms.

CSS is defined as:<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen"
href='/stars/styles/default.css' />, so the MIME type is coming in correctly (I
think).

There are no JavaScript error reporte dint he console.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.After taking the My Account link, you will get a Firefox page that is "Done"
but blank.
2.Use the View/Page Styles and toggle to "No Style" - page look funny, but use
the View/Page Styles and toggle to "Basic Page Style" and all is well.
3.

Actual Results:
Data table not displaying.


I have set the severity to Normal, but all of our Firefox user have had to
switch to IE...not a good thing.
