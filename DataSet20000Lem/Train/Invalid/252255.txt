Our server log tell u that most of our visitor use IE. Therefore I design
for IE but try to keep other browser in mind. Foxfire messed up my CSS left
nav. I finally figured out that the Foxfire proportional font default of
"Serif" wa the culprit. When I changed it to "Sans Serif" the page rendered
correctly. Not many user will tweak their preference to that extent and I
would suggest that the default be set to "Sans Serif" to be more compatable with
the broad usage base of IE users.

Second problem: the Foxfire default of "Underline links" overwrites our CSS
style sheet. In IE, link are normally underlined anyway but in specific area
of the page I can change that with CSS. Not so with Foxfire. Foxfire ignores
the CSS and underline anyway. (None of the box are checked in "Always use
my......")

I love your tabbed interface. Pure genius.
