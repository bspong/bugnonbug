Disabling panel GUI is confusing

It feel like we're trying to do a 3-way toggle with a 2-way switch (checkbox). I'm looking at Firebug Console panel. All the checkboxes are UNchecked - this should mean that nothing is enabled. But "Script" is in bold, and the rightmost column is blank (whereas for Console and Net it say "disabled").

The checkboxes are telling me nothing is enabled, but the rightmost column is telling me Script is enabled.

I'm guessing the checkboxes are supposed to indicate the enable/disable state for the current page, whereas the rightmost column indicates the state for all web page (unless ow overridden). But I'm not sure, and regardless this is confusing.
