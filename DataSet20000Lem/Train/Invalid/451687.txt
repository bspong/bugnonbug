I am not able to create a XPI with dlls and xps that I need to copy to system32 and some dlls to plugins folder of mozilla and xpts to component folder of mozilla.
It give -207 error message.
How do I create a xpi which will copy these dlls and xpts to respective folder?
I don't find any sample xpis either.
All the xpis that have component and plugins folder doesn't get installed in Mozilla 3.0 because all of them have install.js script.
Why mozilla is not able to read install.js file?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a xpi with component and plugins folder and put the dlls and xpt into them
2.Create install.rdf file
3.Create a xpi. drag and drop to mozilla.
Actual Results:
It dooesn't copy the dlls and xpts

Expected Results:
It should copy the dlls and xpts to respective folder
