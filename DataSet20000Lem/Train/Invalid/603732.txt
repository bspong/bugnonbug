nsSVGUtils::ReportToConsole() is unused?
The nsSVGUtils::ReportToConsole() method seems to be unused, there are no call to it. This also mean there are no error message to display from the SVG category?

See bug 595934 which is about tracking the relevant message from all of the categories. SVG seems to be one, but the aforementioned issue seems to make the SVG category not relevant.
