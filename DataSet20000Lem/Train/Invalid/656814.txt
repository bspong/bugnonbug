The application doe not show up but it is on the Win Task Manager, it is not loading at all and it had been minute already.

My solution is to end task, relaunch Firefox and hope it will show up, sometimes I do this 4-5 time til FF finally show up

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. freshly boot system
2. open firefox
3. (note sometimes there are already other program that are running)

Actual Results:
nothing it just sits there at the win task manager eating 35mb - 50mb of memory you could not see it on the task bar either

Expected Results:
when you click the program to lunch it will initiate instantly...
