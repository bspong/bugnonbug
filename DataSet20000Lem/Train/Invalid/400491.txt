I guess Mike wanted me to create a whole new bug, because he didn't open it back up when I changed Bug 399113's description.

Basically, if browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace is set to false,
shift->middle clicking on a folder of bookmark should not replace the currently existing tab unless it is blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set broswer.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace to false
2. Create a folder with multiple bookmarks.
3. Go to your homepage
4. Hold Shift and middle click on the folder of bookmark you created.
Actual Results:
The bookmark open in new tabs, but the first bookmark replaces your homepage tab.

Expected Results:
The bookmark open in new tab but don't replace any open tabs.
