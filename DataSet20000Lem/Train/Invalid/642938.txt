We build corporate solution with Web a interface. There is javascript written using the onkeypress method which isn't supported but firefox. Everything work perfectly in IE7+ and we have to limit our customer to only using IE because of the incompatibility of the javascript onkeypress calls. You should consider adding this functionality to be more compatible with IE specific web page so Firefox and be a valid alternative to IE.

Reproducible: Always
