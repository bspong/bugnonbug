becuase the cs call the focused tab to have a two pixel wider left padding
than an unfocused tab, we get a growth of the entire tab bar to the right two
pixel when you select a new tab. this cause a bit of disorientation and
generaly dirty feel to the tab bar here. I've posted an example screenshot that
show the growth.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the page-info window
2.select a new tab
3.watch carefully for the shift

Actual Results:
tab bar grew two pixel to the right

Expected Results:
all tab should remain fixed widths. And at the very least the tab bar itself
should remain a fixed size.

this occurs in the tabbox.css file in the global folder of the classic theme.

in particular the segment at fualt are

here:

tab
{ ...

padding: 1px 4px 2px 4px;

...
}

and here:

tab[selected="true"] {
margin-top: 0;
border-bottom-color: transparent;
padding: 1px 6px 4px 6px;
}

In my theme by making the tab[selected="true"] padding the same size a the
"tab" padding I've stopped this slidding effect. In general I believe this
give a cleaner feel.
