Seems like the problem is that Firefox doesn't treat absolute positioned element a block element.

CSS 2.1: Absolute positioning: "An absolutely positioned box establishes a new containing block for normal flow child and absolutely (but not fixed) positioned descendants."

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Inline absolute positioned element treated a inline element.

Expected Results:
Inline absolute positioned element should be treated a block element.

Opera 9 and Safari 3 do in right.
