CSS3 background-image and border-image do not allow overlay

Example CSS3 code:

.note-large-curl {
/* Title: note-large-curl
Purpose: To display what look like a piece of paper.
The upper left corner ha a curl in it and
there is a pin placed in the page.
*/
background-image: url('images/red-pin-small.png');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: 50% 50%;
margin: 20px 20px;
padding: 20px;
border-width: 27px;
-moz-border-image: url('images/note-large-curl.png') 31 round round;
width: 100px;
height: 100px;
}

The center of the border-image is solid and the middle part is supposed to repeat. The red-pin.png is supposed to be displayed to look like the pin is in the paper. When any part of the border-image is set, there is no ability to allow layering with the background image.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add this code to the CSS3 file:

.note-large-curl {
/* Title: note-large-curl
Purpose: To display what look like a piece of paper.
The upper left corner ha a curl in it and
there is a pin placed in the page.
*/
background-image: url('images/red-pin-small.png');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: 50% 50%;
margin: 20px 20px;
padding: 20px;
border-width: 27px;
-moz-border-image: url('images/note-large-curl.png') 31 round round;
width: 100px;
height: 100px;
}

2. Add this code to the HTML file:

<div class="note-large-curl">
Relocation
</div>

3. Display the file in the browser.

Actual Results:
I just see the piece of paper. I cannot get the red-pin to display.

Expected Results:
The red-pin should be displayed on top of the piece of paper, so it look like the pin go through the piece of paper.

The image can be obtained from the "notebored" image set by "boo".
