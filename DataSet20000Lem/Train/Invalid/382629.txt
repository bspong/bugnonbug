Hi,

first off, thanks for a GREAT product!

Since release 2.0.0.4 ha automatically been installed I experience problem when the yahoo.com shortcut are to be displayed.

This is: special word or http link are underlined with dotted line and a local scripted menu appears if one is hovering over it.
These menu are now not correctly drawn. Maybe their script are buggy...

Thanks again
Uwe
