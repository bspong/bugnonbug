The page at http://www.stiri.rol.ro, a soon a it's opened, processor usage
rise at almost 100 %. The scrollbar can't handle anymore scrolls, and many
other problem derived from that. I've seen some ad server trying to connect
and I think that is the problem. Other browser display a status bar message
with "errors on page" and stop loading the page (I belive that is a timeout
event or a cpu usage event).
