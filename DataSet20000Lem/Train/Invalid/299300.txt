The preference 'accessibility.tabfocus' is defaulted to 1 on the Mac, and 7 on
other platform (Win, Linux). Presumably this is to make it consistent with
Safari on the Mac, where tabbing doe not by default take you to every element
in a web page.
However in Safari, under Preferences->Advanced menu, there is an easy way to
change this by clicking on the checkbox for 'Press tab to highlight each item on
a web page'.
Firefox on the Mac, should likewise provide an easier way to do this rather than
doing an 'about:config' in the browser and editing this field to the value '7'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.apple.com on Firefox on Mac.
2. Try tabbing in the web page and note that the tab image (for Store, etc.)
are not accessible.
3. Repeat on a Windows machine.
