Alert dialog appears upon utility start-up. As well, there's a lot of stuff, suddenly, in my Error Console. Alert; "chrome://clearcache/locale/clearcache.properties". I took your little broom add-on (Clear Cache)after last updating, yesterday. Removed it; still there. Reinstalled little broom; still there. While once cleared it doesn't seem to affect session, it's po it froze me up (first time w/Firefox; you guy rock!) while I wa trying to review a PDF. Please advise if more info needful, and, too, what I need to do (or perhaps stop doing!). TY. ps... Mozilla crashed. U suck...;)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Simple; start a Firefox session
2.
3.
Actual Results:
The Alert box appeared. Oh, and possibly froze me out in a couple of instances. Could've been the PDF page, though.

Expected Results:
Is this a quiz... Uh... Not had Alert box? Sorry... I sometimes tickle me...

Again; While I suspect that my taking the Clear Cache add-on is the issue, I'm darned if I can figure it out. You know; How to make it quit. I religiously check for update for the Firefox utility (did I tell you you guy [generic] rock?) and haven't any other useful thing to add, I think.
