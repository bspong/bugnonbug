(I am french, so sorry for bad english)
I can still hear the flash video playing in background while i have left the site where there were the flash video. It happens when there is another instance of firefox running and where there is a "choose a file" window opened in it.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1 : open firefox and go to a site where there is an file input html form, like http://fr.selfhtml.org/html/formulaires/affichage/input_file.htm

2 : click on the form but don't choose a file, let the "choose a file" window open.

3 : open a new instance of firefox.

4 : In this new instance, go to a site where there is a flash video, youtube for example.

5 : play the video, and then leave youtube by going to another site. --> you can still hear the flash video.

If you select a file in the "choose a file" window in the first instance of firefox, or just cancel the selection, the flash video is stopped.
Actual Results:
Still hearing the flash video playing in background and can see that firefox is still downloading the video

Expected Results:
the video should stop downloading and I could not hear it.
