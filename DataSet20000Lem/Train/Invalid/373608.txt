When nesting (block-level) elements, the margin of an element is transfered to it parent when that parent doesn't have a border defined

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. nest a few divs (without border)
2. give them different background-colours
3. define a top-margin for a nested div and look what happens to it parent
4. now define border and look what happens again
Actual Results:
Without border, the parent div will take the margin of the nested div

Expected Results:
the div with the margin defined should display this margin, not it parent

I'm using firefox 2.0.0.2
