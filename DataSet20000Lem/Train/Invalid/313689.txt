Websites won't load upon clicking on link in the Bookmarks Menu, plus it won't display the url in address bar.

After I open Firefox I go and click on the Bookmarks Menu and it display properly, but upon clicking a link it won't load the website. The Bookmarks Menu will disappear like it is supposed to after click on a link, but the website won't load and the url isn't displayed in the address bar.


P.S. I would like to note that the defect is most likely related with the menu it self. It likely isn't pointing to the link correctly. I've come to this conclusion, because I'm using the extension All-In-One Sidebar and with it I go to the Bookmarks section and I am able to load a website from there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Click on the menu titled "Bookmarks"
3. Click on any link

Actual Results:
Bookmarks Menu disappears, but the website doesn't load and the url isn't displayed in the address bar.

Expected Results:
Bookmarks Menu disappears and the website load and the url is displayed in the address bar.

I don't know if this is relavent, but I'll give the build configuration just incase.
