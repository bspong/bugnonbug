A misclick resulting in accidently clearing all your cooky when you meant to
clear the cache can be very annoying. A dialog box popping up when you click
one of the clear button ("Do you want to clear all stored
cookies/cache/history?" Yes/No) would be sufficient to prevent unintentional
clearing of important data.

Note: This should be a major issue a all the clear button are situated on the
right hand side of the dialog box, placed next to each other. If the field are
not expanded, you could miss the button or click the wrong one, clearing data
you didn't mean to.

Perhaps a a follow up bug, the clear button should be rearranged and placed
further away from each other, and/or give each catagory it own dialog page with
it own options.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Options dialog
2. Click Privacy panel
3. Click Clear button for any of the catagories, or Clear All button

Actual Results:
Data is cleared without further confirmation by the user.

Expected Results:
Confirmation dialog should appear, prompting the user of their potential action.
