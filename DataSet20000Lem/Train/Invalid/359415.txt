I'm having two major issue and have been asking about them on the Forum but no solutions.

Clicking on link http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2565570#2565570
where clicking on a Link often will send me wildly up the page instead of opening the Link.

Back Button Issue http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=480660 where often when I'm on a page, and click on a link, when I'm at the new page and use the back Button, I often get taken back to the top of the previous page instead of the spot where I wa on that page.

Both these problem are random, and in one session I can have them happen, and then not happen.

Hope you're aware of these two issue and are working on them!

Reproducible: Sometimes
