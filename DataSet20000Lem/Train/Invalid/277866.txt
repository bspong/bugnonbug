extension to view using IE, when necessary
At my office, I could definitely get everyone on board to use Firefox 1.0, given
it user-ability and security. However, a number of our client require u to
use specified website to send and receive documents. And of course, these
site only support IE or Netscape. If you could make an extension, like the one
for Mozilla Suite, that allows one to easily open the same page in IE, then that
would resolve the issue.

Please think of the long-term benefit of this a well. The more business that
start using Firefox, the better chance it ha to reach the mainstream a well.

thanx
