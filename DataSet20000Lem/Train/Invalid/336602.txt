Since Firefox upgraded itself to 1.5.0.3, uploading a file to a PHP-powered website often trigger the "unresponsive script" message box, even when there's absolutely no JavaScript on the page that appears.

The file is uploaded correctly. The animated rotating icon in the tab work normally up to the point where the file ha completed uploading. It then freeze for a few seconds. Then the error message appears.

Clicking "Stop script" make the response page appear normally. Clicking "continue" only lead to the same message box another few second later.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
"Unresponsive script" message box appears inappropriate. There is no script on the page.

Expected Results:
Response page should appear a usual.
