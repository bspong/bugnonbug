Need File/Close Tab pulldown command, ALT +F doe not always work.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

There are two related problem here with normal and abnormal response.
It seems that several of the site I visit that don't provide arrow to return to a previous page.




Actual results:

1. Normal Response: I have to enter ALT+F to open (long) File Pulldown memory to close the Tab to return. In this instance the program is working normally, but the frequent need to access the long Pulldown by KB ALT+F is a pain.

2. Abnormal Response: This occurs after clicking Wh on Red X (Upper R) to return, and I get a warning: You are Closing 2 Tabs - many time when I then enter ALT + F, I get not pull down File Menu. In This instance, proceeding not only close the tab that I am on, but close Firefox, so I have to open Firefox, select bookmark, Log on, and page through several page to get where I was.


Expected results:

Close Tab command appeared.

Clicking this should have returned to previous page without KB entry in Normal Response;

Clicking this should have returned to previous page without having to open Firefox, log on, and click through to the previous page in Abnormal Response.
