root relative path are missinterpreted (tested image and links)

if there is an image on a page:
<img src="/somepath/someimage.some_ext">
the image is not displayed. The Properties window show that the image should be
in <current_html_file_path>/relative_path. And the path's separator
corresponding to the relative part are shown (in the Properties window) with %5C
instead of / like:

http://somesite/current_path%5Crelative_path_dir1%5Crelative_path_dir2%5Cimagefilename.some_ext

But path beginning with / are relative to the server root, those beginning
with ./ are relative to the current html file path.
I don't remember if, in the past, there were some missunderstandings about
this and /path wa interpreted a a ./ relative path.
Other browser have no problems.

Here is a html test:

<html>
<head><title>TestPage</title>
<body>
This (html) file is located in e:\temp\www, or in /temp/www
<br/>
Do you see the image below? (Which is in e:\temp, or /temp)
<br/>
<img src="/temp/test.bmp"/>
<br/>
<a href="/temp/test1.html">Test link like the test image (located in e:\temp,
or /temp)</a>
</body>
</html>

Reproducible: Always

1.Visit/Make a page that ha an image OR a link with
src/href="/some(different)path_on_this_server/some_file.some_ext"
2.
3.
