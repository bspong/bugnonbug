Button missing that allows one to post comments. I am using Firefox 3.6.3, Mac OS X10.5.8 on a 1.6 GHz Power PC G5 with 2.25 GB DDR SDRAM.

Build Identifier:

To comment on an article in the Times of London, one type the comment in the box provided and then click on a button marked "Post". The button appears when I use Safari, but not when I use Firefox.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
The software should have displayed a button marked "Post" which allows one to post his comments.
