I connected to a server using https. When dialog box asked me about, I checked
'Accept this certificate temporarily for this session', so phoenix connected and
gave me the paged I needed. So, when server public rsa key and certificate
changed, I immediately get phoenix crashed, without displaying the dialog box.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to an http server, accepting the certificate temporarily for a
session only.
2. Change that server key and certificate.
3. Reconnect to the http server.

Actual Results:
Phoenix crashed

Expected Results:
Phoenix should have shown to me the page I asked for.

Workaround: delete all file that contain *cert* or *key* in the name within
[HOME]/.phoenix/default/*, then retry to connect
