Installer list wrong destination directory after backtracking to change it
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

If you confirm the default install directory, then click back, change it, and
then confirm the new directory, the next pane show that the installer still
think it's installing to the default.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. ./firefox-installer
2. click forward
3. click accept
4. click forward
5. click back
6. click change
7. type 'foo' or whatever you like, and click ok
8. click forward
9. click yes (to confirm creating the directory, if necessary)
10. observe that 'to the following location:' still indicates the default
install directory.


Actual Results:
see above. I didn't click install.. maybe it will actually install to 'foo' but
that's not something I'd like to experiment with..

Expected Results:
The installer should now say:
... to the following location:
... /foo
and then install to foo. Note that if I change the install directory before
clicking 'forward' at step 4, then everything work fine.
