Cache all message that are logged after UI is shown
Followup bug for bug 611032. Some error message will not be cached if the UI is shown. This may be a simple fix, just recording this here so I do not forget about it.

To keep the same behavior a the Error Console - where all message are cached until the limit of 300 is reached regardless of having the UI open - we will need to tweak the way message are routed around the HUDService.
