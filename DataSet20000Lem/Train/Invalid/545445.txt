The all tab view should show URLs since it search on them. Perhaps title and URL should appear next to the thumbnail, so there'd be room to see full title and URLs for the purpose of narrowing by searching

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on all tab view
2. Bring up all tab view
3. Type some text
Actual Results:
Tabs are narrowed down to those whose title or URLs match, but even if the match is on the URL, it isn't shown

Expected Results:
URLs should be shown.
