If the website ha problem downloading (for instance the bottom message say
"waiting for something"), the browser becomes locked. It will not respond to
"stop download" button. Perhaps if you wait long enough (forever?) it will get
unlocked. I found myself using three finger salute at least four time in one hour. This began happening after the latest update. The frequency of occurence is such, that the browser is nearly useless.
