I changed the key config.trim_on_minimize to TRUE and I minimized FF with two ways:
1. Using - in the Upper right corner: I looked at the proccess manager and memory wa down from 40,000K to about 15,000K
2. Using Windows Key+M(Minimize all windows) : memory consumption didn't change at all

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FF
2.make sure in about:config that config.trim_on_minimize is set to TRUE, if not, change it and restart FF.
3.Open Proccess manager and check FF memory consumption
4.Click Windows Key(Also Command key I think)+M
5.Restore Proccess manager and check memory consumption
Actual Results:
You can see that consumption of memory didn't change

Expected Results:
Memory consumption should have reduced
