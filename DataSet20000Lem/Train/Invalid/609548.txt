multiple tab detected while it is multiple window

I have two ff window opened with one tab each. When I close one, the popup "Do you want Firefox to save your tab and window for the next time it starts?" appears, if I click "save and quit" only the window I wanted to close is save and close (as expected).

The problem is that the popup should not appear and the window should be closed.

I don't know if it is because now tab are like new window but regroup in one and in my case having 2 window opened is detected a having two tabs...
