I accidentally somehow installed firefox with the my locale set a en-gb making all of my default search engine use the UK sites. However my real locale is en-us, so I changed that in the about:config. When restoring the default search engine it will still restore the en-gb engine and not the en-us ones.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox with the locale a en-gb
2. Go to about:config and change the general.useragent.locale key's value to en-us
3. Restore the default engine
Actual Results:
The en-gb engine are restored

Expected Results:
The en-us engine should be restored
