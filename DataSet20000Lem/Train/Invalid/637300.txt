UI split

When I created my addon, a Mozilla Addons editor complained about nothing to click, striving to see something and finding nothing to click.

I have Firefox 4 and lot of extensions, but some of them are in the app button and most of them are in the old menu bar's Tools. This split is bad.

- if most of the firefox addons use the menu bar, people'll drop using the app button to use most of the firefox addons

- if half of the firefox addons wa in the app button and the other half wa in the menu bar, I would be limited to downloading and installing half of the firefox addons

- you can keep switching, app button, menu bar, app button, menu bar, but I don't think you're going to like that

Please, think of word to complain with the addon authors. "The app button is the default user interface setting. Wanna put your addon name there?"

Thanks!
