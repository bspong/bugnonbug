Alternate stylesheets are not clean - trace of the original cs remain.

Elements of an original stylesheet remain when style is switched.
Example given is of display:none but I wonder there are more examples.. border etc.
Currently there's a need to exactly neutralise the original before beginning a
new style.. it's a nuisance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two stylesheets and in the first include a display:none;
2. In the second omit to neutralise the first original css.
3. switch back and forth.

Actual Results:
The second style includes part of the first.

Expected Results:
The alternate stylesheet should be an alternate, i.e. not an addition to the
original style.

Why the need to neutralise the original?


Does appear also in Opera [7.54u1 build 3918] but not sure what this implies.
(This in XHTML 1.1 but I expect in other flavour too.)
