Preferences dialog can't be closed with "OK" after viewing Downloads tab

After the Downloads tab in the Preferences dialog ha been viewed, the OK button
no longer responds and so preference change can't be saved. This can't be
bypassed by viewing a different tab before pressing OK: once the Downloads
preference dialog ha been viewed once in a Firefox session, OK doesn't
function and the only way to close the Dialog is via the Cancel button / Esc key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open preference dialog
2. Click on Downloads tab on LHS
3. Try to press OK

Actual Results:
Nothing... the dialog remains and can only be closed by pressing cancel. From
this point on, the preference OK button is non-functional.

Expected Results:
Closed the dialog and saved the preference changes.
