I do not know whether or not the bookmark property dialog box is supposed to close when Save Changes is clicked, but either way, the name of the bookmark cannot be changed. The bookmark location is changed upon pressing Save Changes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on bookmark, either on the toolbar or in the Bookmarks organizer.
2. Click Properties.
3. Change the Name field.
4. Click Save Changes.
Actual Results:
Dialog box remains open, bookmark name is unchanged.

Expected Results:
Dialog box should close (?), bookmark name should be changed.
