basic property (html/css) not correctly rendered

The code of the page go like (semantically):

<!-- snip -->
<body>
<div style="text-align:center;" name="toplevel">
Some-Text-1
<div style="width:780px;" name="lowerlevel">
Some-Text2
</div>
<table style="width:780px;" name="lowerlevel">
<!-- snip -->
</table>
</div>
</body>
</html>

For some reason, the two "lowerlevel" child (div and table)
of the "toplevel"-div are not centered (while Some-Text-1, of
course, is).
(they are positioned fully to the left, a one would expect from
text-align:left).

Reading cs & html standard documentation, a I understand it,
all child should be positioned the same way, independently,
if they are <![CDATA[]]> or further html-elements...

(Also, IE render it, a expected (even if that doe not mean
anything ;-)

Is something wrong with my interpretation, or is this indeed
a rendering bug in Firefox?


It seems to me, that centering object is quite an important
and basic feature that should be correctly handled.


Reproducible: Always
