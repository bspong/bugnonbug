Application hang seemingly at random. Sometimes when clicking link, sometimes when scrolling, sometimes when loading page, sometimes when typing in a forum. Has crashed when loading external page and also internal one (e.g. router). No pattern. Sometimes crash 2X in 2 minutes, other time OK for an hour or two, rarely longer. Without question this is due to the new version (I wa on 1.5 before) a it started 30 minute after I'd downloaded it and I've never had this before. PC itself is very stable with no event log error apart from these and no resident virus or malware etc. Fully patched, XP SP 2, 2x4400 CPU, 4Gb RAM.

Event Log: Hanging application firefox.exe, version 1.8.20061.1023, hang module hungapp, version 0.0.0.0, hang address 0x00000000.
