Images fail to display on many website

This problem is not unique to the current version of Firefox. I have tried every version of Firefox for OS X and have quickly abandoned every one because image fail to load on many of the website I regularly visit, e.g. Amazon and eBay. There is something terribly wrong and I am completely baffled. I've had this problem over a period of years, using several different Macs. For me, Firefox is utterly unuseable because of this issue. I have also written to Mozilla about this before, but never got a response. I will be happy to send you screenshots if anyone there is interested.
