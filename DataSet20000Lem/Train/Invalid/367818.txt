Clear Private Data feature not working
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

When I use the "Clear Private Data" feature under the "Tools" menu, the "Download History" and "Saved Form & Search History" option -- although checked -- are in light gray font. Therefore, I am unable to Clear these Histories. I have checked these option under Preferences>Privacy>Settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Tools>Clear Private Data
Actual Results:
I still see the result from my past Google, Yahoo, etc. search performed from the box in the upper right hand corner of Firefox

Expected Results:
Should have not been able to see any of my past search entries. At least shouldnt have had the option 'grayed' out when I selected "Clear Private Data"
