h1 tag in my web app have text-transform:capitalize; applied in CSS. Sometimes, it render fine. Sometimes the SECOND LETTER is capitalized, whether the first letter in the text is previously capitalized or not. HTML is simple: <h1>Problems</h1>, which sometimes appears a "PRoblems". <h1>my tickets</h1> sometimes appears a "mY Tickets". The strange thing is I couldn't get the example HTML file to exhibit the same behavior.

Reproducible: Sometimes
