While using KDE, I choose to use the Mac OS style of menu bar (where the menu
for the current application are always on the top on the screen). Then, when I
open firefox, the Firefox menu are show propely, but the menu on the top of
the screen are for the Desktop. I beleive the menu are supposed to be shown on
the top of the screen only.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start KDE
2. Right-click Desktop & Choose Configure Desktop
3. Click Behavior -> Current application's menu bar (Mac OS-style)
4. Click OK
5. Open firefox
Actual Results:
The desktop menu bar wa shown at the top of the screen and firefox's wa shown
within firefox.

Expected Results:
The firefox menu bar should have been at the top of the screen above the firefox
window.

I'm using Fedora Core 4 with Firefox 1.0.6 running on the x86-64 architecture.
