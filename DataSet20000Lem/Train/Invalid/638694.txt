Starting from FF4b8 when i use non default theme i get transparent modal dialogs, like alert, prompt etc.
The problem is that transparent alert are on even theme which marked a FF4b supported by addons.mozilla.org.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use some custom theme, like "Chromifox Basic".
2. open javascript:alert('this is alert');
3. see alert with no background and titlebar.
Actual Results:
see attachment screenshot

Expected Results:
show old alert style, like ff3.6 then no alert style is defined by theme.

I hoped it's a temporary bug, bug it haven't changed for last month. I couldn't find any submitted bug before. This bug affect too many firefox 3.5 themes.
