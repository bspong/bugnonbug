I am trying to add some structure to my bookmark but adding subfolders to do this is almost impossible. The number of issue are too numerous to mention however, anyone using OS X 10.6.4 FF 3.6.3 should be able to replicate it easy enough. I only tried under the bookmark toolbar section. Fr instance, adding a subfolder result in the new folder being created but I can't do anything after unless I hit escape which then remove the folder. I cant select other folders, rename the new one etc. The only way I managed to do it is to set up my folder on a Vista machine with FF 3.6.3 and use firefox sync to get the folder across. however tag are not synced but I suspect thats another issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select organize bookmark
2. Click Bookmarks Toolbar
3. Add new folder (doesn't matter where you put this)
Actual Results:
Try and click on something else.

Expected Results:
option to rename folder. Ability to continue organising
