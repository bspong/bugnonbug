CRH dialog called via Tools always clear passwords/offline website data after a MU from Firefox 3.0.0.x (settings cannot be undone via UI)

After a major upgrade from 3.0 user who have set to clear password in the CRH dialog will not be able to revert this setting. The CRH dialog always clear the passwords. We had the same problem on shutdown which wa solved in bug 497656 but that patch didn't fix problem in the CRH dialog run during a session.

Slightly modified STR form bug 497656:
1. Open about:config
2. Flip "privacy.cpd.passwords" to 'true'
3. Visit URL (or any login page)
4. Type in username and password (at URL, username='foo' password='bar')
5. Click "Remember" in notification-bar, to save password
6. Inspect saved password in Prefs / Security / Saved Passwords.
7. Ctrl-Shift-Delete to bring up "Clear Recent History"
8. Uncheck all box -- so, nothing should be cleared.
9. Press "Clear Now"
10. Inspect again saved password in Prefs / Security / Saved Passwords.

With step 9 all saved password will be removed from the profile. There is no way to stop this action via the UI. Users would have to enter about:config to reset this preference.

As said this only happens when running CRH from within the tool menu. The password are not getting cleared on shutdown.
