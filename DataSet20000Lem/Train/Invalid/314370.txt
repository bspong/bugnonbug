Windows 98SE: no version since 1.0.2 will render any page at all. v1.0.2 work fine.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0.7

I have tried each version since 1.0.2 and can never get any page to render.
Each time I have to revert to 1.0.2 which work fine.
When visiting any site, the address window show a blank icon and the word 'Done' is displayed.
O/S is Windows 98SE, patched up-to-date via Windows Update.
Also use ZoneAlarm (currently v 5.5.094)
Behind h/w firewall/router, closed a tight a I can.
Do Firefox version 1.0.3 & later use a new port number perhaps?

Reproducible: Always

3. Watch nothing happening
