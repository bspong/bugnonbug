Firefox about: logo should link to getfirefox not mozilla.org

Sorry if it's a dupe but the search thing on here is b0rked for me.

The image at the top of the firefox about: page link to http://www.mozilla.org
Surely it would be more appropate to either link to www.getfirefox.com or
mozilla.org/products/firefox.

While the "Firefox 1.0+" text below it link to
http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/1.0.html the image doe say
Firefox and not Mozilla. Maybe having either a text mention or image of the
Mozilla logo linking to the mozilla.org homepage would be more appropriate.
