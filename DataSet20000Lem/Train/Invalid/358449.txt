I had no trouble using Foxit pdf reader with earlier version of Firefox. However, when I installed version 2 I wa unable to download or open any pdf files. I got an error message that stated that the pdf file wa corrupted. I removed Foxit and all registry entry for Foxit (the uninstall program doe not remove registry entries) and installed Acrobat reader. The problem wa resolved.

Reproducible: Always
