I use Gmail constantly. If Y use the chat enabled version, I get freeze for 10, 30 seconds, or even a minute.
Firefox go all gray and the CPU monitor go all the way up to 100%, Then everything is back to normal , but It doesn't last , and the problem go up again.

It all go away if I chose to use gmail without chat, and come back if I get the chat enabled version.

Having google talk open in a popup window doe not produced the problem.

The situation is new: no more than two week and I think it go back to the last time Firefox auto-udpated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log onto gmail with chat enabled
2.open a mail
3.click on answer and start typing a few word : freeze
Actual Results:
Firefox go gray (but not always) and the cpu jump to 100%
