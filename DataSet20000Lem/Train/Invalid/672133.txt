current x86_64 nightly build 8.x fails to play embedded video content
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7pre) Gecko/2009021806 Minefield/3.0.7pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build ID: 2009021806

Steps to reproduce:

Tried to play video embedded on a page (see Video Corner at this link):
http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=cws


Actual results:

Nothing. The display pane for the video remains empty without anything being played.


Expected results:

The video should have played. It should have worked correctly out-of-the-box. That wa the case for Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7pre) Gecko/2009021806 Minefield/3.0.7pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729).

Somewhere between 3.0.7 and the current version it broke.
