MY normal default E-mail client is Eudora.
BUT:
File-> Sen Link lead mne to G-mail client.
Tools-> new message lead me to G-mail client
GO: ha an entry in the menu G-Mail

I have been unable to find a method for changing the DEFAULT E-mail client.
No entry in HELP.
No entry in reported bug that I can match.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to all the menu and check them -> all lead to G-mail.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Everything lead me a G-mail screen instead of Eudora.


GO menu or File-Send Link or Tools-Options should have a mean for entering the default E-mail client and location.
