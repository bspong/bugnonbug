This ha been a longstanding bug in Firefox: there's no way to turn tab off completely. Sometimes, Firefox insists on putting a new URL into a tab instead of doing something else (opening into the existing window or making a new one).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
First set Firefox the option "Open new window in a new tab"
Go to a web page configured to open a new window on clicking a link. An example is http://www.quackit.com/html/codes/html_open_link_in_new_window.cfm. Click on the link "HTML Help". Ironically, the code in this URL is intended to show how to open a new window.
3.
Actual Results:
The window open into a tab in the same window.

Expected Results:
It have opened a new window.

This work correctly in Safari 4.0.2.
