Cookies not cleared when Firefox exit

When the privacy preference "Always clear my private data when I close Firefox" is enabled and the "Settings..." dialog ha been set to erase cookies, the latest version of Firefox is not clearing cooky when all instance are closed normally. I noticed this after my bank website mysteriously started managing to remember my user name on return visit day apart.

"Show Cookies" confirms this behavior. Having been used to this feature working in past I generally expect that closing out the browser before visiting site that I don't lend much trust to will erase all tracking cookies, prevent some type of XSS attack on authenticated site and so forth. Apparently that is no longer the case.

I have Adblock Plus, Web Developer, and NoScript extension installed, but I doubt these are interfering with this function of the browser.
