Save Page As... Web Page, complete on valid page save HTML file with [many] error

By default, Firefox save page a "Web Page, complete". This save an HTML page plus the medium associated with it like image and CSS files. Making the page use these local medium file requires changing the HTML file. The HTML file saved is therefore not the same a the original.

Unfortunately, the file saved ha extensive modification from the original, enough to break it. For example, taking the validating homepage of w3.org, it is converted to a page with ten of error (The w3.org homepage is the first I tried to get an example not on localhost. This must affect many pages). For example, the start is changed from:

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">

to:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xml:lang="en" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" lang="en">

Note the change of case in "html". This cause these errors:

*** Errors validating World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).html: ***
Error at line 1, character 109: DTD did not contain element declaration
for document type name
Error at line 2, character 67: document type doe not allow element "html"
here

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to affected page.
2. Check validity
3. Save Page As... Web Page, complete
4. Check validity of saved HTML file
Actual Results:
Second validity check show more error than the first.

Expected Results:
Same number of error in both validity checks.
