The first page viewed in a new window (either by starting Firefox, opening a
link in a new window or clicking on a link in an email client etc.) is not added
to the history, so when you click in a link in the new page the back button is
still greyed out.

Clicking on subsequent link enable the back button but you can only go a far
back a the 2nd page, never to the page that wa originally opened.

Opening a link in a new tab doe not cause this problem and the problem wa not
present in FireFox 0.9.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox or right click on a link and open in a new window
2. Click on a link in the page

Actual Results:
Back button is greyed out

Expected Results:
Back button should be available and take me back to the previous page

Firefox used with default theme and no extra theme installed. Extensions
installed are googlebar 0.9.0.29 and Web Developer 0.8, although problem is
still reproducible with them disabled.
