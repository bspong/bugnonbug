occasionally I get automatically redirected to another unrelated website and can't go back

Today I wa looking at my email and automatically got redircted to this website http://178.17.163.163/f82a16d0d83fd46a571ec6f132a80e1ec042be2a68b005da. When I hit run, there is a mal-ware zip file that want to load, which I havn't allowed. One other time I wa looking at something else and got redirected to happytv or something like that. This problem just started with the new foxfire update 4-5 day ago. I hope this help and you can correct the problem. Many thanks! Doug
