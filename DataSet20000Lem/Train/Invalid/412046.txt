As soon a I open my firefox brower, MULTIPLE window start opening automatically after the original opens. Each contains "Entering yahooBuildToolbar"only.

Today there wa an update for firefox browser which i allowed. Ever since then I get this problem mentioned above untill I can deleted these window before anymore will open, leaving only the original open window that I expect to receive. Once I have stopped them from opening, I can use the browser without and further problems.

I hope you can help me out with this problem. I hate to lose all of my bookmarks. Maybe I will have to reinstall the browser???

Thanks....George Murray
