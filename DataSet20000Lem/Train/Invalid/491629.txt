I list auction on eBay via Auctiva.com. I use Auctiva.com to write HTML, then the listing is posted to eBay.com. The HTML programming that I write on Auctiva is interpreted correctly on I.E. 8, but not on Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to eBay listing #150343515731
2.View on I.E.8 then on Firefox.
3. On I.E.8 all paragraph are displayed correctly. On Firefox, the only paragraph that display correctly is the blue paragraph under Description Of Gold Coin. The rest of the font is too small.



When you view the above auction, you'll only be able to see it on the old version of the eBay listing page. The new version of the listing page is only available to eBay account holder own account. When I view the same auction number on the new listing page, it look even worse. Instead of everything being comic sans font, it's a mixture of several different fonts. In addition, some of the writing that is supposed to be blue, is black and vice versa. If I click reload/refresh, the font type is corrected, so that everything display in comic sans, however, the only paragraph that display the correct size is the one mentioned above. This is indicative of either eBay having a bug on one or more of their server or Firefox simply rendering my code differently than Internet Explorer does. The bottom line is that the HTML is being interpreted correctly by I.E. 8, but not by Firefox.
