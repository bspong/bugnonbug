Firefox 4 going into "half fullscreen", with a little part of the toolbars poking out and doesn't restore properly
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:2.0b2pre) Gecko/20100702 Minefield/4.0b2pre ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:2.0b2pre) Gecko/20100702 Minefield/4.0b2pre ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C)

When I press the fullscreen button (F11), the toolbars slide up only halfway, a if it is getting stuck in a crude shaft. Half of the close/restore/minimize button are slightly visible. The orange Minefield button is gone, but still the word still hang there.

Later, when restoring back from fullscreen, the entire window restores to a small box.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Minefield (4.0b2pre)
2. Press the fullscreen shortcut (F11) [first problem]
3. Close the fullscreen mode [second problem]
Actual Results:
The toolbars did not slide up properly, with the 'Minefield' text remaining where it was, flying. After restoring, the window becomes a small box.

Expected Results:
The toolbars should have slid up properly, with all the button and text, and come to the original position again after pressing F11.

I am using the default theme, no Persona, with Vista's transperancy enabled.
