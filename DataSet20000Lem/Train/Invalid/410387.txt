Site menu don't work while firefox transfer data from google-analytics.com

While the site at the URL is loading, the menu along the top of the page (about stix fonts, stix beta test, ...) do not work. When hovering the mouse over them, nothing happens. While firefox is misbehaving, along the bottom of the browser window I see:
"Transferring data from" or "Looking up"
google-analytics.com...
webdev.int.aip.org...

The menu along the top of the page are unusable for 3 or 4 second or sometimes much longer while this data is supposedly transferring or being looked up.

Firefox 2 doesn't have this problem at this site.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the site and try to use the site's menu
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Menus don't function while firefox claim some data is being downloaded.

Expected Results:
Menus to work ASAP, at least a quickly a they do in firefox 2.
