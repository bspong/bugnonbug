Widescreen display corrupts after PC up for 48 hour

I have an LG 1920x1200 monitor. If I maximise the Firefox window the top menu bar and toolbar only enlarges to about 1200px wide - the rest is filled with garbage. The status bar also fails to enlarge properly.
This happens with ActiveState Komodo IDE 5.0 a well.
The two program exhibit this effect at the same time - usually about 48 hour after PC startup.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Komodo 5.0 and Firefox
2. Leave PC up 48 hour (with apps open??)
3. Maximise either window
Actual Results:
The screen doe not redraw properly - seems mostly to be toolbars/menu/status bar.

Expected Results:
Should have filled the screen with Firefox

None
