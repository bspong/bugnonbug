Occasionally now, when I try to post an answer on Yahoo Answers I get a 999 We Can not Process You Request Error from Yahoo. The only fix I can find is to close the Yahoo Answers Tab and then re-open it, but that get annoying if you have written a long response and it won't post. I have tried this on Internet Explorer and so far haven't had the problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

1.Go to Yahoo Answers (answers.yahoo.com)
2.Sign in
3.Go to one of the board
4.Post an answer
Actual Results:
Occasionally I will get a 999 We Cannot Process Your Request Error from Yahoo.

Expected Results:
The answer should post.
