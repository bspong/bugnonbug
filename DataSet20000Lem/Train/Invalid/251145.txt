I spent yesterday trying out foxfire compared to netscape 4.73. I advise you do
the same. Foxfire is to slow to be considered an interactive tool.

The installation and configuration feature are the best I've seen, but the
speed performance a a browser sucks. There is a time between 2 and 5 second
where interactive response exists, longer than 5 second and the system is no
longer interactive and becomes a pain to use.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:
To speed foxfire up, you shopuld do the following:
1. Put a second counter on the hourglass and see what the time are from click
to ready for another click.
2. Keep track of the mouse pointer by the millisecond, to know when the mouse is
over an active area.
3. Shorten tracking time to le than a second and response time to le than 4
seconds.
4. report time count for processing, waiting, and display time.




Foxfire is already better than Mozilla and most of the competitors, but speed
improvement ha to be better or it won't work a an interactive browser.
This "bug" is a Blocker, it prevents CUSTOMERS from using it!
