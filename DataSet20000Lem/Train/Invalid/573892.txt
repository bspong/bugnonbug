Complete system freeze after today's Firefox version update. It installed, then suggested I install flash again. Did that, but now any flash related site i.e. youtube, gmail, facebook and my system completely lock up.

Not terribly consistent but happens every 15 minute or so of use. So then I have to ctrl/alt/del and end firefox manually.

Reproducible: Always
