FF 3.6 auto upgrade disables Java JRE plugin and Flash on a Debian installation.

I use a Debian 5.0.3 GNU/Linux system, current browser is Firefox 3.5. Java JRE is now 1.6.0_18-b07, Flash is now 10.0.r45, this morning on accepting the popup notifying I should upgrade to Firefox 3.6 I found after downloading that both Java applet and the flash functionality wa not present. I removed the current flash and installed the latest version (dpkg -i) I downloaded the latest version of Java and linked the runtime as:-
libjavaplugin.oji.so -> /home/adrian/Downloads/jre1.6.0_18/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so in the ~/firefox/plugins directory

On checking the about:plugins Java wa not listed - there did not seem to be a way to have Firefox 3.6 recognise there wa a valid JRE present. I am unsure why the flash wa not working.

I accessed the JRE console to see if I could kick it off from there - no luck.


I removed all of the Firefox 3.6 and regressed back to the 3.5 version, re-establishing the JRE link - back to square one where thing work a they should.

This wa a painful exercise in futility - the Mozilla help didn't - the url link to SUN is out of date, for the average user to follow the convoluted instruction is I believe far beyond most user's capability.
