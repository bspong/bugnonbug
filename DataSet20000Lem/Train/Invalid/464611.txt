When I right click on a picture, the selection drop box doesn't... drop. Nothing happens. I checked on same URL site with Shiretoko and Gran Paradiso, it's ok. The problem started with Minefield about 2-3 day ago (I always get the latest build).

I found a similar problem in nr. 400447, but that wa fixed long ago.
