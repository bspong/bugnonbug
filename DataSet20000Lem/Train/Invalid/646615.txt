I'm browsing a web site, say reddit for example. I click a link to go to a story and read it. I click the Back button to go back when done. Normally, this cause the visited link to change colour from blue to purple. At some point in every session, this stop happening. Links previously showing a purple remain so, but link visited after the problem start remain blue. Closing the browser and restarting it fix the problem, temporarily.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse a site that contain internal link that are styled in the normal way, with unvisited link being blue and visited link being purple.
2. Keep trying link until the problem occurs (sorry).
3. Profit.
Actual Results:
Eventually, returning to a page containing a link that wa just visited show the just-visited link a not visited.

Expected Results:
Visited link should appear a visited.

This is new behaviour with Firefox 4. In other words, even doing all the same things, I never saw this behaviour in Firefox 3. In Opera, sure, but not in Firefox.
