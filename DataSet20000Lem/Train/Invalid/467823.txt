I have a log in form that us a POST method to submit user and password. After the form is submitted, the url in the history show the form field and data on the url (get method).

I have other log in form that do not show this symptom. I've compared the source of the two and can not see any difference that would cause this.

The form are intranet application but if you'd like I can send you the html so it can be replicated on your server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.fill out form
2. submit form
3.pull down url history
Actual Results:
http://zzz.example.com/cgi-bin/admin/login.pl?username=yyyy;passwd=xxxx;Login= Log In

Shows in the history but the login.pl used POST method in the form

Expected Results:
http://zzz.example.com/cgi-bin/admin/login.pl

I did not want to post actual url information but will supply it to someone working on the bug.

I listed this a a major bug since log in and password information a shown in clear text in the history and web logs.
