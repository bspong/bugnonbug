Java applet cannot display some image for some user
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100723 SUSE/3.6.8-0.1.1 Firefox/3.6.8
Build Identifier: SUSE 11.0 FF 3.6.10 from upgrade; not filing bug from that box

On this multi-user install, I have one user for whom Java applet cannot display all of their images:

* Some CAPTCHAs do not display, frex www.wsj.com
* Googlemaps display the tile and zoom control, but not the panner or layer control
* Bing map display all the chrome and pointers, but no map tiles.

I've checked the "display images" site exception list for this user, and it's empty. Neither this broken user nor a properly working user display libnpjp or any other JRE lib in their about:plugins, though their pluginreg.dat doe show the expected mapping for java applet (though these are for 1.4.2_08) -- this machine ha been upgraded to Suse 10.2 from at least 2 older versions, and wa upgraded from FF 2, which is when this, and my related bug 583769 both started troubling me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Retrieve the specified page
2.
3.
Actual Results:
See that the image are not properly displayed.

Expected Results:
The image should be properly displayed.

The browser wa installed in a fresh directory from this tarball:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 10624411 2010-07-22 18:38 firefox-3.6.8.tar.bz2

Older browser are still on the machine, but are not being used *by the user with the problem*.

I suspect this is a configuration problem, but nothing especially relevant turned up in an inspection of about:config.
