(I couldn't find this in the bug list) I can't make new folder in my Bookmarks. When I click on "new folder" all kind of thing happen, different thing each time, but rarely can I make a new folder since the latest updates. I've been using Mozilla for years, and this ha never happened before.

(BTW, I don't know what "hardware platform" means, so I just left it at the default selection.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Bookmarks, Bookmark this page
2.Click on "Show all the bookmark folders"
3.Click "new folder"

Actual Results:
When I click "new folder," sometimes it highlight in silver the "bookmarks toolbar" and "bookmarks menu" at the top, and that's it. Sometimes it highlight everything in the list and make them all blue. Sometimes nothing at all happens. Every once in a while, I can make a new folder, but it's very rare these days.

Expected Results:
I expect that when I click "new folder" it give me a new folder at the bottom of the list that I can name and put my link into.
