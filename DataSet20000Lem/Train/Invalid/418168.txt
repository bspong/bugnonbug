Memory creep/leak, seems to never release image or page from memory

Since the 2.0.0.12 update installed, I've started seeing drastic increase in the amount of both RAM and VM that Firefox is taking. It seems to go up the fastest when viewing image gallery or rotating images. Sites that never caused this are now causing it. Browsing both static images, animated images, and Flash with animated static image cause it. Closing tab doe not reduce it, only exiting Firefox reclaims the memory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit your favorite image heavy site and keep refreshing the page or browsing through more page of images.
2. Watch the memory keep going up.

I've found this on browsing various image galleries, watching the Flash-based animated radar on weather.com, browsing Amazon.com, etc.

Actual Results:
Memory usage continuously creeped up. The Flash-based animated radar at weather.com would claim an extra 20K of memory everytime it loaded a new image in the radar loop, even when it should have reused the previous image. Reported memory usage went from 80MB to 480MB in just a few minutes.

Expected Results:
Release the memory for anything not on screen or whatever the standard Firefox memory caching behavior is.

I've seen this on four different computers, all running 2.0.0.12 on up-to-date Windows XP Pro. All of the computer component and software is different, all had pre 2.0.0.12 installation for at least a year without this issue.
