I've used firefox for ~4 years, no problem before. for the last week, on clicking link I've used before, the link work a normal but a new window open with an advert in it. All firefox popup option set to prevent popups. This doe not happen with IE5, google chrome or safari.
The new window in window task manager is associated with process "gesayic.exe", if this process is closed, the new window closes.
The link which seem to cause to problem are just normal one I use all the time.
Tried deinstalling firefox and installing new download of version 3.0.10. The very first link I clicked on cause an advert window to appear.
PLEASE help, I love firefox but not with the adverts.
