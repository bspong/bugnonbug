Add bookmark is even worse than before
In RC1, in addition to the add bookmark window still not being resizeable, it is now transparent and black, making it almost impossible to read. There is NO possible advantage to this window being transparent, but if you insist on allowing this, it MUST have a setting to turn it off that is obvious.

And if you have a lot of bookmarks, it is really hard to navigate in this tiny window. I filed that bug before, and it is still there in RC1.
