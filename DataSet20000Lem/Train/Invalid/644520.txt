Options set to open Home page on start,but just show blank tab. Unable to customize Navigation toolbar (menu option greyed out). Menu toolbar - unable to drop down menus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Upgrade Firefox 3.6.16 to 4
2.Click Menu toolbar item to access drop-down menu
3.Right-click on toolbars to Customize
Actual Results:
Firefox not opening after System Restore, re-install Firefox 3.6.16 to return to normal.

Expected Results:
Basic toolbar function should work normally after application upgrade, especially drop-down menus.

Further testing to carry out. Maybe clean install of 4 instead of upgrade would work better.
