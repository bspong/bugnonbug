The site-button text for DV-SSL is wrong
I'm seeing the "www." being dropped from the URL displayed a the site-button text for DV-SSL when browser.identity.ssl_domain_display is set to 1. For example, we display "amazon.com" when you go to https://www.amazon.com/ . We should not be dropping the "www." since amazon.com and www.amazon.com may be totally different site (although Amazon may be a bad example in this case).
