All setting are ignored after firefox re-open, including visited address and customizable controls. All extension setting are ignored too: tab mix plus extension doesn't open last session (appropriate checkbox to do this is checked). All-in-one Sidebar i always placed on the left-hand side instead of setting it to right-hand side. Sage is not showing feed's news list.

Reproducible: Always
