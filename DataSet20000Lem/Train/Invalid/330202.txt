Closer is normally on just the currently active tab. Somehow - and I can reproduce it but not in any consistent manner - all tab get a closer. It then take adding a couple of new tab (CNTL+T) to remove the [X] closers.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click tab to right,
2. Click first tab
3. repeat until occurs

Actual Results:
All tab appear with a red or gray closer [X] in them

Expected Results:
Only the currently active tab should have a red closer.
