With a DHTML menu, a sublist of link is set to display:none. When the user tab to the sublist's name in the upper list, the sublist is set to display:block. But whereas in Firefox 2, the link in the sublist are then in the taborder, in the current Minefield it is impossible to tab to the link in the sublist. See attached testcase for an example. Unless I'm mistaken, this is a serious accessibility regression.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the testcase.
2. Tab with the keyboard to A-Z.
3. Try to tab to the first link in the sublist ("Skip A-Z").
Actual Results:
Cannot tab to "Skip A-Z".

Expected Results:
Can tab to "Skip A-Z".
