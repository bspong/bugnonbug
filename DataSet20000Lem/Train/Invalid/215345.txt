An idea for preference and some more...
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4) Gecko/20030624 Netscape/7.1 (ax)

I would suggest that preference should also be a seperate application which is
tested for whenever a major component/application is installed if the one found
on the system is older the upgrade it. This would allow a common approch to the
management of preferences.

I would also like to suggest we should, via the preferences, be able to specify
the application to run so for browers: we could choose Mozilla, Netscape,
Firebird etc. May it would evolve to a Launcher/Preferences manager...

Maybe also think about making Bookmarks/Addesses a seperate application too this
will allow more sharing and maybe reduce the total size of the installed code
base.
