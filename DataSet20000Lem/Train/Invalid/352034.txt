MS clipboard keep loading with screenshots
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla ver. 1.5.0.6

I upgraded to this ver. of Firefox today. I used control C (as usual) to capture (in this case a URL from the command line). When I opened a new mail message (Outlook 2003) and did control V into the text space a screenshot of the browser window wa pasted. Opened Word (Office 2003) and the smart clipboard wa full of screenshots, and when I deleted all, just immediately filled again. Same in Powerpoint etc.
Have tried renaming firefox.exe to afirefox.exe.
Have tried nothing else a this is critical for me - I must be able to use Office properly.
Am left with offloading Firefox (reluctantly), and if necessary re-loading office 2003. Please help quickly.
Many thanks
Liza
