[RFE] No clue given to verify a certificate
When accessing the above URL I'm granted with a dialog saying that the certificate doe not match the server (it match www.google.com).
That dialog box ha two button accept and verify the certificate.
If I click on the verify button, I'm presented with a dialog boxe and some text and some values. However I have no clue on the meaning of all these number and strings.

It would be nice to add a link titled "How to verify a certificate", that would point on some documentation explaining what these value are, what should be tested in order to see if one can trust the certificate.
