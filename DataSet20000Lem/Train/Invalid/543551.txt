This error is a little bit difficult to describe. I'm using Corel iGrafx-Software (competitor of well knonw ARIS-Software) for business process modelling. Models are published by a web-server using a JAVA-Applet. In previous version this Applet wa OK but there where problem with some MS-Explorer versions. Now the applet doesn't work right also with the new Firefox version, i.e. there wa changed something in the JAVA engine?! I never changed the JAVA engine on the computer (1.6.xx JRE).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just connect to a iGrafx-Webcentral server
2. Log in to the process repository
3. process are notdisplayed even if applet run
