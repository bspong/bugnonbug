A single phone number will redact itself after page load completes. The redaction is consistent across websites, TV News, Local news paper and twitter.

It only seems to affect standard web pages, it carry through in Gmail and show without redacting.

I can see the information on the newspaper site page souce, copied here.

it is only affecting one machine at this time, probably an infection but may show there is a security hole.

it is likeley a malware issue, but it may represent a security issue. The odd thing is the NORMAL main police number (209) 937-9377 present fine, it is just the number for vice (209) 937-8422 that redacts.
