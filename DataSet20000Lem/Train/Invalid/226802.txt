I downloaded a new nightly build several night ago and I noticed the back and
forward button were missing from the navigation toolbar. Also the horizontal
and vertical scroll bar are gone. I can still scroll using my mouse or
directional key on my keyboard but I cannot drag the scroll bar up or down or
side to side.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Windows ME
2. Download any new nightly build
3.

Actual Results:
The button and scroll bar are gone.


I didn't change any theme when this occured. I even looked in the customize
selection for the toolbars and the back and forward are not there.
