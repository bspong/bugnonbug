Theme reported by theme page to be compatible doe not show up after installing
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040120 Firebird/0.8.0+

AFter installing the theme which is compatible ( Under the theme there is a
statement giving if the theme is compatible with the present build), the theme
doe not show up under theme and hence no change occours.

On the other hand, on installing theme which are incompatible, they do show up
and ofcourse they are incompatible(scroll bar vanishes or some of the toolbars
dont occour).

This bug seems to be there starting with this 0.8 build that i am using 0.8.0 +
I didnt see such a bug with earlier versions. Only the Mozilla Firebird Default
Theme work perfectly.

Reproducible: Always

1.Install any 'compatible' theme from http://texturizer.net/firebird/themes/
2.Then go under Preferences - theme
3.

Actual Results:

Show the new installed theme and given the option to select the same.
