Bug report based on Hendrix report at http://groups.google.ca/group/mozilla.feedback/browse_thread/thread/6e90ad639736c6b8 :

When I visit https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3366/ and install David Bartlett's British English Dictionary R1.19 I get a message saying it's incompatible with my version Firefox and that it can't be installed. The message is something like: You use Firefox 2.0.0.2 but this extension is only for Firefoxen between 2.0b1 and 3.0a1.

But how can that be? My Firefox is later than 2.0 beta 1 and earlier than 3.0 alpha 1.

Thanks to Montague Howard (montaguehoward at tiscali.co.uk) for Hendrix report.
