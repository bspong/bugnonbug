Some request for the Add On's window & for multi lingual Firefox release
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; nl; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

When a user installs a lot of add on's , the Extensions part of the Add On's window get cluttered & it becomes more difficult to find that extension you want to remove, update or change preference from.

however in this list of Extensions there are atleast 2 kind of Add On's that might not belong there. There are the Tool & Side Bar's which could possibly get their own list in the Add On's window.

And there are the dictionary's which could be installed (in most case a user should only install one of them, except in those case you live in a bilingual not native english speaking country & you end up installing about three of them or even more if you are a real polyglot). Again they might better have their own list in the Add On Window.

It would be great to see Firefox 2.0 somehow to get these small change rather soon, maybe in a Firefox 2.0.1 Release.

I also wanted to request for a multilingual version of firefox OS X (like the camino guy make one for Camino) instead of language specific monolingual release - maybe the camino project also ha some internationalized part which in firefox OS X are only available in english ( inside the xxxx.app you find the talkback.app application )

Reproducible: Always
