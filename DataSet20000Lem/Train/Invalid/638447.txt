google search continues after result display. Screen is locked
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla firefox 4.0 Beta 12

Using google tolbar search box. After result are displayed google search continues to run and link are not acessible. Cursor show hour glass. move cursor to Red X (top right of screen) to close and it change to pointer. Move to link and it stay a a pointer instead of changing to a hand. link are not accessible. Mozilla is unusable. Have to close it. Tried reboot several times.I've gone back to using IE for the moment so I could send the bug report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla and Close using Red X top right of screenclick on OOpen
2. Open Mozilla. Message: Firefox is already running, but is not responding
3. CNTRL-ALT-DEL to open Windows Task Manager, then close firefox.exe
4. Open Mozilla. Google search is still running and Mozilla is not usable, I tried Restore Previous session and Cancel. Identical results.
Actual Results:
Started a Google search. I'm not sure which google box I used. On my Mozilla screen there are two google search boxes. One in the toolbar and one level with the URL address box which ha the AVG Security symbol inside it.

Expected Results:
The returned search result were not acessible. The expected result would be returned search result with active link

google search should stop running when the result are returned.
I think the two search boxes, one in the google toolbar and the AVG search, are in conflict. I changed the AVG search to Yahoo, but the error still occurs,
I removed the google toolbar, same results.
