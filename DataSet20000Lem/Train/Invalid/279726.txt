I'd like to be able to shift+click into a new Tab just like i do that in Crazy
Browser (IE shell).

An idea to train me into switching between shift+clicking and ctrl+clicking a i
switch between Crazy Browser and Firefox is not welcome, to put it lightly.

Tabbrowser Extensions can do that but last time i checked they were evil.
