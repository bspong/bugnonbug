If a link is a plain filename which contains a colon, firefox will issue the
warning: 'xyz is not a registered protocol', where xyz is the part of the link
before the colon. The problem doe not occur if the filename is preceded by "./".

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with the link: <a href="foo:bar.html">Test</a>
2. Load the page and click on the link.
3.

Actual Results:
A warning popped up saying: foo is not a registered protocol.

Expected Results:
A plain filename is a valid relative URL conforming to RFC 1808, and thus
Firefox should be able to resolve it to an absolute URL following the procedure
outlined in RFC 1808, and render the corresponding HTML resource. I am not aware
of any specification that requires the presence of a leading "./".
