4.0b7 is considerably slower than previous build (4.0b6 and others) that I have

4.0b7 is noticeably SLOWER than previous releases, inc. 4.0b6 which I wa happy with previously. I don't think it's just a matter of perception (now that there is a distinction between 'conntecting' and 'loading' phases, graphically.
I suspect something with the DNS queries, but also afterwards, it's simply slower - logging in to gmail take up to a minute - on both Chrom and IE8 on the same computer, it's faster.
Please let me know how I can help debugging it. It's not against a specific site, but overall seems slower. Perhaps some mis-configuration on my behalf?

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Going to almost every site is now slower. Once it's in the site, it appears that loading the complete page element is faster, but the overall experience is worse - it take age in 'connecting' (gray) phase and quite slower in 'connecting' (green) phase (which I assume is loading).

Expected Results:
4.0b6 or better performance, perceived and real.
