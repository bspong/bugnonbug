Window can be resized while maximizing
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b9) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b9

While Firefox is maximized, the resize handle in the bottom right still appears, and one can click on it and shrink the window size.

This is undesirable, a the maximize button on the title bar doe not appear, and clicking on the Restore button only serf to recreate the maximize button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Maximize Firefox
2. Grab window handle
Actual Results:
Window handle appears and will resize the window.

Expected Results:
Window handle will not appear, and resizing will not be possible unless the window is "restored."

I'm calling this normal since it's not merely cosmetic, and there is no workaround a far a I know.

Also, this ha been around since 4.0b8--I just didn't notice.
