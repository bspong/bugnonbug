The online store at the attached URL and Firefox 1.0.7 got along just fine and then I upgraded to v1.5 and now when I log-in to the online store my keyboard no longer works. I tried re-downloading the plug-in for Firefox but still no luck. My keyboard work fine on the front-end of www.sanmar.com, but while the web-client plug-in is being utilized by Firefox the keyboard function is completely gone except for the tab, ctrl and enter keys. All of the alpha-numeric and punctuation key are nonfunctional. Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the web client plug-in for Firefox from the link under 'First Time Users' in Step 2 on http://shop.sanmar.com/ while using Firefox 1.0.7 and go into the log-in screen under 'Returning Customers', you don't need a log-in, but you SHOULD be able to see the log in screen and type in the empty fields.

2. Upgrade to Firefox v1.5 then re-visit the log-in screen under 'Returning Customers' at http://shop.sanmar.com/.

3. Attempt to type in the empty field in the log-in screen. The ability to produce letter and number with the keyboard is gone.

Actual Results:
The keyboard function wa gone after the browser started utilizing the plug-in.

Expected Results:
The keyboard should be functional.

We believe that the file 'orfcexec.dll' in the plug-in software is what the browser is not utilizing or seeing even though it's in the install and the plug-in work without fail with FF v 1.0.7. There is no connection to Win XP or 2000 or different theme with this issue a we have recreated this error on different machines. Thanks!
