Firefox nightly build MSIs do not correctly advertise
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

The MSI doe not correctly advertise Firefox when used in a GPO (group policy
object) a part of Active Directory. Shortcuts do not appear, Firefox is not
made the default browser (as seems to be the intended result of installation),
association to .html file are not made, etc. Basically, nothing happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a GPO to deploy nightly firefox MSI build to a test lab.
2. Push it out.
3. Go to a test computer, and notice no sign of Firefox.
