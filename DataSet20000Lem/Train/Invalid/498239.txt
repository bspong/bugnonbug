FF 3.0.10 is installed via a thinstalled app from thindownload.com
I downloaded the 3.5beta a of june 13 2009.
closed my thinstalled version and proceeded to install 3.5
I used all default except I did not want an icon on the desktop or in the start menu. Only the quick launch toolbar.
Well when 3.5 started, it had all my bookmark and setting from the 3.0.10 thinstalled version.
The quick launch icon did not get installed and 3.5 is not in add/remove programs.
There you go. Cheers.

Reproducible: Always
