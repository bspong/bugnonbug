When I login to my banking account on chase.com, every selection I make result in a long delay for the page to load. During this time, firefox stop responding entirely - that page and all other windows/tabs open. This problem started a couple week ago (around the time I upgraded to v3.6?) and doe not occur if I load the same page with IE. The main login page for account (https://chaseonline.chase.com/Logon.aspx) doe this, and doe not require a chase bank account.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Open IE
3. Go to https://chaseonline.chase.com/Logon.aspx in both browsers. IE load much faster than FF.
4. Hit back on both browsers. Hit forward on both and again IE load much faster than FF.
5. Same thing happens if you login with an account, and go from page to page under the account. But other link from the main page do not have the problem.
Actual Results:
FF take several second to load and go unresponsive during this time. It isn't the site itself, because IE doe not have this problem.

Expected Results:
Firefox should load the page a quickly a IE under same condition (like at same time, on same computer).

Loaded the page in same time a IE. Do not go unresponsive during delay between pages.

I am using FF 3.6. My computer ha Windows XP Media Center Edition. It is a Dell XPS M1710 notebook. I have tried using a new profile and clearing my browser cache & history.
