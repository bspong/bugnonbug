Firefox stop responding when opening medium to large pdf file with Adobe Reader 6.0
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

The moment the link is clicked Firefox stop responding, then it sits and sits
with 100% CPU usage. After minute of waiting with still nothing happening I
simply open the file with IE which handle the exact same file no problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click link to medium to large pdf file
2. KA-BOOM!
3. Close Firefox through task manager
4. Use IE to open the same file, no problem

Actual Results:
Nothing. That wa the problem.

Expected Results:
The file should have opened the reader IMMEDIATELY and while the file is loading
I should be able to browse what ha already loaded. I expect some time between
Adobe starting and my ability to view the page, but not much, and it definetly
should not crash.
