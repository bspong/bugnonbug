I had or maybe still have a MOFO huge issue. with my browser VIRUS ... I believe it to be PART or a result of the FIREFOX BROWSER. AFTER 3 MONTHS of trying to fix the issue ( worked 15 year IT manager-Bank). Running Virus program | MALWARE PROFGRAMS. Remove the SATA harddrive and connect to USB-SATA Drive to run many Virus program from a clean computer on the harddrive. TODAY I REMOVED The SEARCHbox (topRight) search of FireFox (BING and YAHOO) seemed to resolve the issue. however I have to test for a few more day. But my rush to NOTIFY ... ASAP... because this may effect many and a class action law suite. :). please confirm that you know of other with the same issue.
