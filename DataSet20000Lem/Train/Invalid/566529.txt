Opening a link in new tab not working when toolbar is collapsed
(Note: this is filed a part of the “Paper Cut” bug — we assume that there may be multiple existing bug on this. Please make them block this bug, and we will de-dupe if they are indeed exactly the same. Thanks!)

To reproduce:
1. Click the "pill button" in upper right on Mac, so the toolbars are hidden
2. Click a link from an outside application
3. Link will either open in a new window or overwrite the existing tab, depending on your setting

Recommendation:
Should be obvious, make it work like normal tab opening. :)
