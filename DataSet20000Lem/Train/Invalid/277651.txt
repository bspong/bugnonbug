Wrong behaviour while navigating through a listbox using alphabet key
When navigating a listbox on a web page one can press a letter to skip to the
first position beginning with that letter. The problem is that it's impossible
to skip to another position pressing another letter, one ha to press up/down
arrow to 'unlock' the listbox first. For example, if you press 'A', the
selection bar jump to the first position beginning with 'A' but if you then
press 'B' nothing happens - and you even cannot anymore use 'A' to browse
through the position starting with 'A'; when you press a cursor key, the
listbox start reacting to letter/number keys.
