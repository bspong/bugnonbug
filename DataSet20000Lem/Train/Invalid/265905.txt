instead of being limited to a specified table size, the div based menu expands
to the full size of the page, i can make it any size i want but is still in
proportion to the whole page. the menu is made for IE mainly, but work in opera
6 and 7, and display in firefox (wheras it doe not in mozilla) which led me
tobelive it wa a firefox bug a opposed to bad coding (i have played with the
code and understand what is happening, but it would seem like a rather large
flaw in an otherwise fine page rendering engine.

other le complicaed div's like align="right" also display outside of thier tables.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit http://greencanteen.co.uk/sk/home.html
2.hover over the menu item (one, two, three, four, five)
3.the popup should be 20% of the table the menu is in

Actual Results:
the menu span the current width of the page (from it's set origin), adding that
to the overall page width

Expected Results:
displayed the div a 100% of the table cell it is contained in, and not 100% of
the whole page

this is the only website i have seen the problem on, i made it myself and feel
quite confident that i know what is happening in the code. understandably,
browser are differnt, but with the cahnge from no support in mozilla to this
limited support, i imagined it wa still a work in progress.
