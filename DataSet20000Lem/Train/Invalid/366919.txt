Persistent "Could not initalize the browser's security component..."
Getting a persistent "Could not initalize the browser security component..." message on Fx2 on Windows 98.

Followed the troubleshooting step at:

The hard disc ha 10+ gig free. I have tried new profile and reinstalling Firefox. Best case scenario -- remains fixed for several days. Worst case, it still doesn't work.

Unfortunately, I can't get a debug build spun on this platform -- any thought debugging on a production build?
