Grammatical error in "about:rights"
In aboutRights.dtd, there's currently a following entity

<!ENTITY rights.webservices-term4 "The Services are provided &quot;as-is.&quot; &vendorShortName;, it contributors, licensors, and distributors, disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including without limitation, warranty that the Services are merchantable and fit for your particular purposes. You bear the entire risk a to selecting the Services for your purpose and a to the quality and performance of the Services. Some jurisdiction do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, so this disclaimer may not apply to you.">


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it should say "whether expressed or implied" instead of "whether express or implied" in the first sentence.
