After installing this build, the status bar (bottom which eg. show request/response activities) is gone.
I am not sure if it is me, shouldn't this be an option in the View menu?
If I choose Menu: View - Toolbars - Add-on bar the status bar is sometimes displayed and somtimes just a flat grey stripe


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the build mentioned in this form Build Identifier field.
2. Run the build.
Actual Results:
I can not see the status bar. I guess it is off by default, but I expected a menu item in the View menu to turn it on. I can turn it on by choosing Menu: View - Toolbars - Add-on, but this seems a bit misleading.



Expected Results:
A View menu item that turn the status bar display on and off.
