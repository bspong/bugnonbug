The link don't work on the left side of the link-list div. The exact same coding work correctly on the right. The page above is W3C HTML and W3C CSS validated. The link work in Opera and in IE. The page ha been tested on both Linux (CentOS, Ubuntu) and Windows. I put the stylesheet on the same page so you can see the link-list coding if you "view source".

The appearance of the link is correct. However, when clicked, nothing happens.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://www.alwanza.com/bells/firefox_bug.html
2.Click on any of the link on the upper left side of the page (inside the border)
3.Notice that the link do not function.
Actual Results:
Although the link have the appearance of link (and the coding is correct), clicking on them doe NOTHING - like clicking on regular text.

Expected Results:
Links should work. Proof is that exact same coding work on the right side.

This bug ha existed for years. This is not the first report I've made, but searching the database, I wa unable to find my previous reports.
