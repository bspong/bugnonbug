I'd like to see some option of mozilla 1.7 rc1 ported to firefox;
* A new option to prevent site using Javascript to block the browser's context
menu.
* It is now possible to fine-tune Mozilla's pop-up blocking using two
preference (dom.popup_maximum and dom.popup_allowed_events) but there's no UI
for that yet. Even without a UI, user should notice a greater variety of
pop-up blocked (primarily mouseover pop-ups) and a limit of 20 or so open at
one time, regardless of whether pop-up blocking is active which provides some
protection from site that open hundred of window in a loop. (but then with a UI)
And, an option to open target="_new" link in a new tab. I don't mean javascript
popups because you can't create a new tab with different size etc.
A feature to block irritating marquee would also be great.
