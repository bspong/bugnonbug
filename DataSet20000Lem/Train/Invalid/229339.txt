I just installed the beta of Service Pack 2 for WinXP, and my toolbar and
bookmark icon are mangled (all icon seem affected, including such thing a
the topic icon in the preference page). They have differently colored square
and/or indentation surrounding them. These come and go occasionally based on
thing like whether you've recently moved over the icon, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install XP SP2 Beta
2. Reboot
3. Launch Firebird

Actual Results:
Icons mangled


Using the "Mozilla Firebird" theme.
