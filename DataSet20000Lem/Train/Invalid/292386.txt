I use the extension sessionsaver (which save the session information so that it
will be reopened when I restart the browser). But now I want to uninstall
another extension and it say 'plugin will be uninstalled when restarting
firefox' BUt I can't restart. (it go neither withy taskmanager nor by clicking
'restart session' in the sessionsaver preference menu)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install the extension
2. click at another extension on uninstall
3. try to restart it

Actual Results:
It did'nt function

Expected Results:
be able to restart the session
