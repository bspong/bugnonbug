I have window XP Pro, Roadrunner High speed cable with router, Firefox v1.5
I have this problem on more than one computer. I have tried 20 or so different IP Addresses
I am trying to use different anomonous proxy while I surf to cut down on popups and webjunk.
I do not like website telling me my computer spec and browser info.

I got Firefox > Tools > option > General tab-Connection setting > Manual proxy configutation
Then I type in an IP and the port number. Some IP's i have tried are :
204.146.30.20 : 80
81.169.167.128 : 3128
69.147.26.150 : 553
68.87.72.164 : 553
12.193.208.172 : 80


I close browser and reopen it.
No matter what site I go to, it streches horizontally so wide, you can not see what is on the screen.
I get part of an error message at the bottom of the window.

<HTML>[]<Head>>[]<title>error: the requested url could not be retrieved............

I can surf/access any site. After I arrive at the site the screen is normal for a few second then it stretch out by itself and the error message appears. If I change tab the problem disappears for a short while but always returns.
Firefox is the only browser affected. Firefox's display is normal if I go back to using a direct connection. (Tools > option > General tab-Connection setting > Direct connection to the internet.)

Try it for yourself. This bug make using proxy useless.
I need help.
How can I fix this.
