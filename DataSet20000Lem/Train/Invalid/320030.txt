This may not be a bug but a "feature" or oversite. On a page that take a while to load if you click on a different tab and then go back the timer start back at 0. I think it should display the total time it took to load that page even if you switch tab and return. Programatically this mean you would have to save the time for each tab that is still loading.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Bring up google on a tab.
2.Start a new tab and bring up a site that take a while to load. Notice the timer counting up.
3.Click on the google tab and then back and notice the timer starting at 0 (zero) again.



Expected Results:
I would expect it to display the total time it took to load.
