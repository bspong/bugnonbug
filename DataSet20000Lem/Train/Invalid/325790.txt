Firefox will not connect when Norton Personal Firewall 2003 is running.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; DigExt; SV1)
Build Identifier: 1.5

I cant find anything on this problem, I'm sure you've seen this before. Firefox will not connect when Norton Personal Firewall 2003 is running, But IE will. I shut the firewall off.... firefox work fine. Any idea how to fix this?

Thanks, Paulie
