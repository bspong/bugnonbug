Adaptive learning remembers and match the page that do not match the string anymore. This make temporary tag useless after some time of a profile usage.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tag some (preferably 6-10 or more) page with a tag not present in the URLs or titles.
Visit those page many times, so they have a high frecency. All or some of them should have the highest frecency among all of the place throughout the whole test.
2. Tag some more page with that tag. The sum should be (or you can just imagine that it is) higher than the number of entry in the autocomplete dropdown list.
3. Remove the tag from some or all of the place from step 1. The untagged place should have high frecency, and there should be enough of them for step 2.
4. Enter the tag into the Location bar to get suggestions.

Actual results:
Few or none of the page that are still tagged are displayed; the list is full of adaptive result that had been tagged before, but are not anymore, because of frecency.

Expected results:
All (or however many can fit) of the page currently tagged with the tag should be at the top of the suggestion list.
Pages that do not match on anything but the adaptive memory should be underneath or not appear in the list at all.
