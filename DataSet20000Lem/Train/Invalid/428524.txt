When clicking the star icon in the location bar, it sort the page in "Unfiled Bookmarks" by default. However, when using cmd+D (and I assume ctrl+D on win/linux) the default is the Bookmarks Menu. Cmd+D should file in "Unfiled Bookmarks" instead, for consistancy (and because it's more logical in my opinion).

Reproducible: Always
