Opened Firefox and it wanted me to create a new profile - saying my default profile wa in use.
The new profile did not have my usual bookmarks.
Could not recapture the original from bookmarks.html. This only ha the default Firefox bookmarks.

Upgraded to version 1.7 and but the bookmark are gone !

Is there a backup file I can restore from ?


Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:
There should be a way to revert to the original profile or switch between them.
There should be backup bookmark file I can restore from.
