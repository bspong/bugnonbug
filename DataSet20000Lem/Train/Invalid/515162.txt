The addon Amazon Shopping Toolbar cause a major glitch in the firefox bookmarking.

When installed and I go to "Bookmark this page" Firefox automatically make the bookmark in the main folder, no dialog box appears giving me the option of putting the bookmark in another folder. Further more when I click on the filled in "star" in the address bar that denotes the page is bookmarked, again no dialog box appears.

I originally reported this a a bug not knowing it had anything to do with the addon, and after the source wa found the tech support (for want of a better term) said I could go ahead an report the addon; I hope I have it in the right place.


Reproducible: Always
