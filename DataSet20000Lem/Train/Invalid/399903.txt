CSS id with . character

According to W3C http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#type-name The id field may have the . character.

However, the following will not apply the correct style
<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
#myid.2 {color: blue;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<span id="myid.2">This should be blue</span>
</body>
</html>

Since the class field cannot have a "." it would make sense to identify the cs class by finding the first "." from the right, rather than the left.
