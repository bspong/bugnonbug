Unneeded tooltips appear in Yahoo Mail Beta

Tooltips should only be used to display additional information. In the Yahoo Mail beta interface, tooltips appear that simply repeat text that is already on screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into Yahoo Mail beta (requires free account)
2. Open your Inbox
3. Adjust the width of the Subject column so that you can read the entire subject of a message
4. Move the mouse pointer over the subject of that message
Actual Results:
A tooltip will appear, showing the exact same text you can already see

Expected Results:
No tooltip should appear, because you can already see the entire subject line

This bug also occurs in reverse:

1. Locate an email with a long subject line -- at least 80 character
2. Adjust the width of the Subject column so that you can read the entire subject
3. Move the mouse pointer over the subject of the message

A tooltip will appear, but it will show LESS text than is already displayed in the browser! For the example message I used, it showed the first 77 character followed by "...".
