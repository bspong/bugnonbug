Open Location from either File menu or Apple-L key combo doe not bring up the open location dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

2. Then click Open Location...

-or-

1. Type Apple-L
Actual Results:
Focus go to location bar and existing URL is selected.

Expected Results:
File chooser dialog should be displayed.

In case it's important, I'm using Firefox 3.6b1 on a Mac running OS X 10.6.1. Additionally, double clicking on an .html (or .htm) file generates the same behavior... the file is not loaded and the current location bar gain focus and the existing content are selected.

I can make a video of this if it would help.
