google apps (including map and docs) don't fully load (javascript?)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

Google map and google doc show "Loading..." message indefinitely (maps handle it better than docs). Much of the javascript-driven functionality doesn't work, like zooming in and out of a map or drag/drop navigation in map and the menu in Google docs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to maps.google.com
2. zoom in/out (widget only partially shows) or try to scroll around map
3.
Actual Results:
Basically nothing. Maps' "Loading" message time out and offer basic HTML functionality, which work (so early web, though)

Expected Results:
I think we all know what should happen, right?

Only really started happening after this morning's update to RC3. RC2 seemed to work ok, though I can't be super sure.
