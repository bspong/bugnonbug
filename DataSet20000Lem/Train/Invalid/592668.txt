When using the latest nightly with bit.ly's "Shorten your link and share" service, text cannot be entered in the text area after the URL entered ha been shortened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to reproduce:

- Login to bit.ly
- Copy a URL from the clipboard to the "Shorten your link and share from here" text box
- Wait for the shortened URL to be returned
- Try to enter text in the text box

Expected result: Text can be entered post URL shortening.

Text can be entered until bit.ly try to parse text that trigger it URI recognition and shortening. As soon a parsing starts, no text can be entered, and the error console report "Warning: The 'charCode' property of a keyup event should not be used. The value is meaningless."
