I need JRE1.5 for Business Objects XI (BOXI) V2. Firefox 3.6 ha JRE1.5 listed in it plugins, but say plugin unavailable when loading BOXI report and begin to download latest JRE runtime environment which is incompatible with this BOXI version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start BOXI
2. Open BOXI report
3. Plugin unavailable! even though JRE1.5 listed in Plugins.
