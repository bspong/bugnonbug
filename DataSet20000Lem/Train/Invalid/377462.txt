I've checked for this problem where the problem is similar to the one noted in the FF page this one is slightly diffrent.

i had a system freeze due to a system component erroring out and I had to hard power down my system I had 3 FF window open in the background with a total of about 15 extension and various GreasMonkey scripts.

once i restarted and opened FF i noticed 95% of my bookmark where gone. thinking that they where all gone anyway i exported the remaning list and checked the damage to find out not a single bookmark wa missing from the list. FF just isnt displaying them. I went into safe mode and restored the default and cleared the bookmarks/extension/passwords and cooky but the problem remains. I've even reinstalled FF to no effect.

<feel free to reassign this to a diffrent value if you feel it severity is exagerated...>
