Firefox seems not to recognize any website a safe to install extension
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 Ubiquity/0.1.4

I don't know if this happened before or after I upgraded Fx3.5.5 to 3.5.6, but now when I try to add an extension, *even from AMO*, and *even in safe mode*, I get the warning bar "Firefox ha prevented this site (addons.mozilla.org) from asking to install software..." I press Allow, and the installation go through.

But when I check Tools>Options>Security>Exceptions, nothing is there. I know I used to have several site listed there.

I tried restarting Firefox in safe mode, and manually adding AMO back to that list. When I next restarted Firefox, the list wa empty again.

Is there an about:config preference, or something in a sqlite profile database I could check to see if my profile is corrupted? I really don't want to have to migrate profiles...

Reproducible: Always
