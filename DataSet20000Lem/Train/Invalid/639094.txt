gfx.use_text_smoothing_setting not respected after video driver restart

I have gfx.use_text_smoothing_setting set to true, which normally works. (I have ClearType disabled on Windows and Firefox doesn't do any font smoothing.) However, if I restart my video driver while Firefox is running (don't ask, it's another long story), Firefox will use text smoothing even though it shouldn't. Restarting Firefox solves the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set HKCU_Control Panel\Desktop\FontSmoothing and FontSmoothingType to 0.
2. Start Firefox.
3. Set gfx.use_text_smoothing_setting to true
4. Restart video driver, e.g. with "devcon restart"
Actual Results:
Firefox ha font smoothing enabled, even though it's disabled on the system and Firefox is supposed to respect that setting.

Expected Results:
Font smoothing should be disabled.

Aero enabled.
