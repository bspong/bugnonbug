Needless MySQL database entry for session control
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

The problem is not visible for normal users!!!!
When the page on the site is opened for the first time a unic number is
generated for session control, in al the link on the site this number is send
with the URL
URL?sid=#number#
this number is also stored in a database on the site so session can be tracked.
en when link are followed within the site no new number are generad, only when
firefox is used to view the pages, every click genereds a extra database entry,
which is not used on the viewed page. (When the page is viewed with MIE it work
correctly.)

This is verry un plessand when your webspace is limmed

I have the feeling thad firefox send de request 2 time 1 time with te variable
and 1 time wihtout the variable and the brouwser only display the page with de
varibals

I hope jou can fix this bug (or if you think it my programming let me know)
