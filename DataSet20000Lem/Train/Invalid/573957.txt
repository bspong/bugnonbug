intermittent problem with reload page warning. It should not warn unless you ask it to in preference but it doe anyway. The checkbox "Preferences-Advanced-General-Warn me when web site try to redirect or reload the page" will frequently start acting like you have checked this box when you have not!

1. Go to ebay and search.
2. Select an ebay item to look at.
3. press back up to go back to your main search.
4. A pop down window come up saying that the page is about to reload do you want to.
Actual Results:
You should never get this warning message when on ebay or other sites. Of course you want to go back and reload the newest information!

Expected Results:
Should not warn you unless you check the box (see detail above).
