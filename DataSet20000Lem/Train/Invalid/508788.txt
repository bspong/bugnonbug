On this page, two layer are displayed after the page loads: somthing like a bubble tip in the right lower corner, and a large (ad) image flying in from the left after some seconds.

While in chrome and IE the ad layer fly in (and out) smoothly, in FF 3.0.12 and in 3.5.2 it stop when the mouse pointer is not moving.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load page
2. wait until the image fly in from the left
3. see what happens when not moving the mouse pointer
Actual Results:
slow and stuttering movement of fly-in layer, depending on mouse pointer movement

Expected Results:
fast and smooth fly-in, independent of mouse
