My history doesn't show site I visited over the last 9 days. It show the site I visited over the 9 day from 29/12/07 till 06/01/08 (dd/mm/yy because I'm Australian).
Saved form don't update either. The dropdown menu of thing I previously typed (e.g. previous search on google) show search I did age ago and search I did in my current session, but not thing I searched for yesterday in a different session. I've tried clearing private data. This appears to work for a while, but when I start a new session everything is back again. Other thing (e.g. cookies) aren't affected by the bug (clearing private data deletes them properly and permanently)
It doesn't seem to happen when using Firefox on other computer or when a different account us Firefox on this computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox
2. Do some browsing/surfing
3. Close Firefox
4. Run Firefox in a new session
Actual Results:
History (ctrl-h) display two Subfolders: Today and Older than 6 days.
Today subfolder only show my homepage
Older than six day show site I visited between ages. When I google things, the search bar ha a dropdown menu of thing I've searched for previously. It remembers search I made over 3 month ago, but won't remember more resent search after the end of the session. same applies for all other search bar and forms.

Expected Results:
My history should show, and only show the page I visited over the last nine days.
Forms should remember what I typed into them in the previous session.
