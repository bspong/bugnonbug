New iFrame hijack vulnerability?
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I've tested this with every browser I can find. They're all vulnerable. I'm not a developer, so I can't tell you what's going on, but I can tell you how to reproduce it using any browser. (You can't get to the hijack via the direct URL --you've got click the Google search result.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Google
2. Search for mancow waterboard
3. Look for the page with the following link (it will probably be many page down by the time you try this):

http://usanews2009.com/mancow-waterboarding

4: Your browser ha been now been hijacked, and all of your surfing will be done within this iFrame.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Going directly to the URL above will NOT demonstrate the exploit. You MUST get there by clicking the link on the Google result page.


Actual Results:
Browser hijack. The URL is not obfuscated in any way, but the content is misleading. Appears to be a possible attempt to steal personal information.

Expected Results:
Should have ignored the script. Should have broken out of the iFrame. Firefox, Chrome and IE 8 are all vulnerable.

I'm not a developer, and I have only a vague idea of how this works. This may be a known variation on an existing, unfixed problem, but I couldn't possibly know because I don't know enough to understand most of the existing bug reports. If this is a known problem, my apologies. But I'm online alot and I've never seen anything quite like this before.
