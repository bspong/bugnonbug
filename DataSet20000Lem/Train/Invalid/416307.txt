Microsoft Vista is a piece of shit

I just wanted to alert you to the possibility of Fed tampering with MS Vista.
It seems it ha hole in it designed for FBI (homeland security) exploitation.
Perhaps you recall the win32 kernel virus that appeared on the scene
approximately 2 year ago. It is my belief that they (the feds) had MS reverse
engineer it just so that they could snoop on people. Take this alert with a grain of salt, yet every indication, including my firewall recognizes it.

P.S. I use sygate firewall which allows me to monitor all port traffic!
There ha been some really weird activity in my log of late, including
but not limited to 0.0.0.0 remote attempt to infiltrate. As you I hope
know 0.0.0.0 is not a remote address, it is a local port call. So why did
it show up a a remote? I don't trust Vista, I use XP instead. I am considering
switching to Linux instead!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Microsoft Windows
2. Sygate Firewall
3. Requested port using kernal32 support
Actual Results:
Not related to Firefox, is Windows specific.

Expected Results:
I noticed several attempt by my firewall, of remote access using
port 0.0.0.0

Again, it is not Mozilla related but should be considered in future
development. IMHO Vista is a pile of junk. Alot more system are crashing
because of it. The Kernal32 ha something about it.
