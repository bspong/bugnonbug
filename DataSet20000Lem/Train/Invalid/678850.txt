The new locationbar highlight feature slows/freezes the browser in FF6 just like the Add-On with FF5.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

Installed FF6 which ha a it main new features, the location bar highlight.
The feature, IMO, freezes/hangs FF6 with browsing to new link or other reason still unknown. When FF6 freezes, the browser becomes white, the Windows curson becomes a rotating circle, etc... and then 15 second later FF6 unfreezes.

This freeze/hang behavior is virtually identical to what I experience when installing and uninstalling the locationbar Add-On in FF5...Constant FF5 freezing/hanging until I uninstalled the locationbar Add-On in FF5.

In FF6, that locationbar is built-in and hence, if it's the same code used a the Add-On, it could be causing FF6 to freeze just like it did for me in FF5.


Actual results:

Freezing of browser when navigating to other link via click on a link in a page or using a bookmark.


Expected results:

No freezing, regardless of what link or bookmark I click.
