A few day ago, I opened up an e-mail at my Yahoo in box. As it wa opening, it wa shut down and I received a message from Firefox that it wa opening, it could not be completed (or something like that). The next time I turned on my computer, my home page now ha not two, but three item in the second frame the top bar. 1) Getting started, 2) Latest headline and the new 3) Super Hot Pornstar. If you hit the Go button on it, it connects you to: http://www.thecockfreaks.com/flexiblepositions/20080729k/index.html

I have tried to look into my cooky to check thing out, but I can not find the cooky anymore. My system still work OK, and it asks me if I want to accept cooky from site when I open them. The site I use most often are secure site and the cooky from them must be somewhere. But I can’t find them. Anything I open that I don’t usually use, I choose “Allow for session” or “Deny”.

I can not find how to get rid of this problem. I have downloaded, from Monzilla, the same Firefox browser I have now (2.0.0.16). The download doe not fix the problem or give me a clean window without the Super Hot Pornstar button.

Is my problem something that is internal with the Macintosh hard drive, or do you feel it is in the Browser?

My hardware overview is:

Number Of CPUs: 1

Is there any way you can direct me on how to solve this problem or how to find the cookies? Is their anymore information I can supply you with? Have you experienced a problem like this before.

I have taken a picture of the window with Grab, and will try to attach it to this e-mail.
