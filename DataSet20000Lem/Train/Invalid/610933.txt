Tweak the shadow on the right pane of the Firefox menu
The right pane of the Firefox menu is currently using a shadow created with an inset box-shadow. We should switch to using border color so that we can make sure that it is perfectly native.

This effect will be used in a few different place in our window theme, so other bug will later be pointing over here a a reference.
