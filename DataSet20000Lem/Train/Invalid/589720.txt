I discovered this problem with password (and user-id) exposure.

This is when you login via Firefox to your google, yahoo, pay-pal, and probably other accounts.

I used Firefox and it benign add-on AutoCopy. On the login page, after typing your credential (or using auto-fill-in), when you double click on the password hidden by dot i.e. ..........

AutoCopy will highlight it. It will also decode the "hidden" password, copy that, show the decoded password. Now you can paste your exposed password !!

I can easily see this apply to many browser and other add-on on any OS using specifically modified script and add-ons. For e.g., I can also see this apply to FTP and Email software that use similar login windows.

It can probably expose your Pay-Pal, credit card, bank account user-id and passwords, etc....

CONFIRMED: it work with Pay-Pal, yahoo, google, but doe not seem to work with live.com (hotmail) !

When, on the pay-pal site, I double clicked on the password hidden by dot i.e. .......... I wa able to see my password via AutoCopy.

I can easily see a malicious script in this type of add-on forward the decoded password.

I tried this with my regular Firefox user profile and my JonDo (JonDonym) profile.

I also use a master password for my regular firefox profile.
