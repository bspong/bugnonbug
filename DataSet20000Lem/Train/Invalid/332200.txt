Cursor in calendar cause wrong selection
In the calendar the cursor "resize" is used. I think "w-resize".
This cause a weird problem here: when I hover over a day on the calendar the right date is selected but when I click it selects the date to the left.
So: I click on 29 March but 28 March get green.
I think another cursor would be better.
