apparent crash of GDM on loading URL. Ubuntu Dapper.

Firefox had my System crash/hang on loading of the URL:

http://www.lkb.ens.fr/recherche/qedcav/english/welcome.html

My whole Gnome-Desktop froze.
No <ctrl>-<alt>-<F1-6> to change to virtual Terminals,
No <ctrl>-<alt>-<backspace> to restart X.
Still had mousecursor movement and occasional HD-LED blinks.

This happened while surfing along and again after rebooting and recovering my session via Tabmixplus' Crash recovery.

Sorry for not testing again.
