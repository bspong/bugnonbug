After automatic update to 3.5.3, got a 404 for the update page
Just now I created a brand-new profile and started up Firefox 3.5 -- this is a regular install, not a nightly or a trunk or anything -- with the new profile. It told me it needed to install updates, it installed the updates, and then it restarted. When it started up, it opened this URL:

http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.5.3/firstrun/

Which gave me a 404. Again, this wa on a brand-new profile.

The "About Mozilla Firefox" dialog box say my version is 3.5.3, which is weird because I didn't think that wa released yet.

In about:config, my startup.homepage_welcome_url pref is this:

http://%LOCALE%.www.mozilla.com/%LOCALE%/%APP%/%VERSION%/firstrun/

I'm on Mac OS 10.5.
