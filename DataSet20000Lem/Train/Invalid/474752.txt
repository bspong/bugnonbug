There wa a problem with downloadhelper after I upgraded from version 3.7 to 4.0 and the preference window stopped opening fully and became inoperable. Then upgrading to the fix, 4.0.2, caused the total loss of the downloadhelper preference window. Now it is nothing but a weird line on the screen that I can move around but can't open. There's nothing to see or read.
I'm running a Mac G4 with OSX 10.3.9
PLEASE let u know if your version of any of your software for Mac require Tiger or Leopard version of OSX.
Can't wait for downloadHelper to work with my system!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. right click on download helper icon (or choose preference under "Firefox"
2. choose preference
3. only a line appears, independent of the browser, which the firefox window itself loses it red, amber and green colored button in the upper left hand corner - they just go clear
Actual Results:
I couldn't get the weird line/window of preference off the desktop or use the firefox screen for anything else.

Expected Results:
I should have been able to navigate around preference and chosen conversion formats, etc..

Brand new version came today. Can you tell me how to un-install DownloadHelper??
