Under view I choose to not use toolbars and no matter what I select they reappear

When launching Firefox 1.5.0.7 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7) I can see the toolbars that I disabled during the previous session. This also occurs during launch of a new window

To re-itterate my process I go to <view> then on to <toolbars> and then deselect
the toolbars I want to disable.

Close firefox then check to verify that it is closed in the task manager
relaunch Firefox and the toolbars reappear a though I never disabled them

I tried rebooting to fix this a well and the same problem exists

additionally though I don't use the bookmark toolbar I have noticed (cause it won't disable) that the bookmark don't appear on the tool bar even if I put new bookmark in the bookmark toolbar folder manually.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.tried several time to disable the to bar under view toolbars
2.rebooted and again tried several time to disable to no avail
3.happens whether relaunching or whether I am just opening a new window

Actual Results:
Just launch Firefox and once launched open a new window

Expected Results:
Toolbars all appear even after being disabled

This wa not happening until Firefox auto updated this morning
Unfortunately I do not have record of what version I wa running
prior to the auto update
