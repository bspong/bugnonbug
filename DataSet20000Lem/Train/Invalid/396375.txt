Firefox restart consumes 100% of CPU for an hour or more.

I restarted Firefox today, and it reloaded the 67+ window with 400+ tabs. Under normal condition I expect the restart to take 15+ minute (because lord knows, the developer don't care about efficiency -- or the concept that the page might be prioritized based on the one which is the forefront window on your desktop). Firefox ha now consumed 1 hour and 11 minute of CPU time. And it may finally be starting to behave normally. So it may "get er done". But it not anything I'd write home about being a positive experience.

The most interesting question is whether the startup process wa delayed by an hour or more due to interaction with NoScript and vendor attempting to shove music down one throat? I will be attaching the transcript from the console to this and I would like people who understand this to explain what is going on. But I would also like to comment that given the typical window user (or even Linux user) who may not have access to the console log -- are clueless about what Firefox may or may not be doing on their machine.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart a complex firefox session, measure the real time and CPU time it takes.

Actual Results:
It can take an hour or more and various shuffling of window to get a functional Firefox.

Expected Results:
Firefox should come up immediately. Any new firefox window should have top priority. It should not take an hour or more to produce a "functional" Firefox. The reason I'm filing this bug report using Epiphany is because I do not know whether Firefox is usable or trustable.
