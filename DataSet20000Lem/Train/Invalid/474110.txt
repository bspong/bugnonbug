When I click on any link that open a new popup window, an extra tab always appears, therefore leading to the "You are about to close 2 tabs. Are you sure..." prompt which is very annoying.

This is a regression bug. This ha happened for at least 5 nightly builds.
This is build 20090116035550.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.wyavtv.org/ or any site that creates some popups
2.Click on the ? button
3.You should see a window with two tabs.
