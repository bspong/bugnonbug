I am trying to get phoenity theme running on firefox on mac.
The problem is that there seems a huge skrewup in the way scrollbars are
rendered...both the main widow scrollbar a well a frame scroll bar and also
aption list scrollbar like the one on this newbug page for... say componnent field.
I am attacing a screenshot of the problem.(btw in the theme list it say
phoenity but not 100% sure if thats the theme installed.. it might be one of the
derivative of phoenity... but most probably it *is* phoenity)

Also on a related note.... I am not able to install all the themes.. can anybody
tell me how to fix that?

Also... a non-reproducible behaviour... after a while even the main toolbar
button will vanish in the newly created windows... I mean the old window will
keep their toolbar button but new window wont have any image on the toolbar
button (though the button seem to be there cause when I hover mouse over that
part of window i see the rising up buttons.. but still no images)

Reproducible: Always
