I upgraded to 1.5RC1 this morning and since then scrollbars do not seem to appear anywhere in the browser, not even a scrollbar to scroll the window vertically. Even on this bug report page, the "Component" region is scrollable with the mouse wheel but there is not a vertical scrollbar anywhere on that window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website (http://slashdot.org)
2. Try to scroll to the bottom of the page using the vertical scrollbar.

Actual Results:
I would have a scrollbar to scroll the pagew with and be able to use it.

Expected Results:
I cannot do it because I do not have a scrollbar.

I currently only have "Customize Google" and "Scrollbar Anywhere" installed, the last only because I cannot scroll quickly without it since I don't have a scrollbar.
