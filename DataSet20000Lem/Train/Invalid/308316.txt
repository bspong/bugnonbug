If you open Firefox 1.5Beta1 you get a tab (Parenttab) here you could call some
Webpages. If you call (with middle click or right mouse open in new tab) a link
in new Tab you could never close the Parenttab. Nothing like CTLR+W, red X, or
Right Mouse close Tab will work. You have to close the new Tab first then you
could also close the Parenttab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Browser
2.Call a page (maybe http://www.google.com)
3.Open link in new Tab
4.Try to close Parent Tab.

Actual Results:
Tab will not close

Expected Results:
Tab should be closed.
