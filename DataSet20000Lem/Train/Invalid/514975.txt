When I go to "Bookmark this page" Firefox automatically make the bookmark in the main folder, no dialog box appears giving me the option of putting the bookmark in another folder. Further more when I click on the filled in "star" in the address bar that denotes the page is bookmarked, again no dialog box appears.

Reproducible: Always
