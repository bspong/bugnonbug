Firefox crash after downloading some extension
My Firefox browser continually crash and the quality feedback agent will not
work a it report it cannot connect to the server (this is happening for more
than two months). This problem really rquries attention a I keep losing info
when the browser crashes. This problem only occurred after downloading some of
your extensions. Which one is the problem if it is. What is a b.m.o. issue????
