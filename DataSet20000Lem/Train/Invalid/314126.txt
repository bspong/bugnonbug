when opening Firefox, I always get a Quicktime icon with a question mark inside,which indicates it is broken, when it is not.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

I have the latest version of FireFox and Quicktime installed. Quicktime v.7.0 work just fine on my computer. Firefox v 1.0.7 work just fine on my system, a Dell Inspiron 8200 with 1G RAM. WinXP Home, Nvidia 64MB 440 Go (latest drivers), PCMCIA Dell 802.11g LAN card, Comcast broadband connection.

Most of the time when I open the URL I use a my home page (MSNBC.com) with Firefox, the two ad just under the MSNBC top of the page blink on and off until the page fully loads. Then, on every page I subsequently open, somewhere on the page a Quicktime icon with a question mark appears. I notice when I use the IE browser I keep for backup, this doesn't occur.

I don't know how to fix this and I don't know why it is happening. Can you explain this to me and help me get rid of this problem? Is there anything more I can tell you that I have not so far?

Many thanks, and much obliged,

There doesn't appear to be any functional loss a a result. I am totally stymied a to why this is happening. This ha only started happening since I successfully installed the latest version of Quicktime (Version 7)a few week ago. I have never had any problem with FireFox working on my Dell Inspiron 8200 laptop.
