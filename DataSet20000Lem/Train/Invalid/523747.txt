We have custom web app(Oracle ADF Fusion) that us a custom extension that listens for when a tab close so that the back end can clean up resources. When a tab is dragged off to create a new window, the TabClose event is triggered. This should not happen since the tab didn't close it wa just moved to a new window. After this happens the page doesn't work any more because the server think the page ha been closed.

In my overlay.js I have this.

var content = document.getElementById('content');
var tab = content.selectedTab.parentNode;

tabs.addEventListener('TabClose', ext.onTabClose, true);

Reproducible: Always
