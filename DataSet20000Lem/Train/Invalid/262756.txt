"Bookmark" folder always appears a the first one in the Add New Bookmark dialog.

I remember that before 1.0PR, when we add a webpage a a bookmark, the drop-menu
of the dialog always show the last 5 folder to which we have added bookmarks,
so this render convenience if we often add bookmark to the same folder lately.
But in 1.0PR, there is an item "Bookmark", which is the root directory of all
the bookmarks, always occupying on the top of the drop-menu, and most of the
time we have to press the little downward arrow to use the drop-menu, or even to
expand the whole tree to select the folder we want. I don't know why the
developer put that "Bookmark" item always on top now? And why is there also a
breaking line between it and the last 5 folders? Is this a preparation for
future functions?

Here's what I recommend: keep 5 most used and 5 last used folder in that
drop-menu, but just don't stick "Bookmark" there, because a lot of people don't
add bookmark to the Bookmark root folder now, they tend to classify them into
different folder at once, and it's a little waste-of-time for them.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a page to the bookmark.
Actual Results:
You'll see "Bookmark" folder always appears in the dialog. If you pull the menu
down, you'll see "Bookmark" and a breaking line on top of the 5 last used
folder's names.

Expected Results:
Before 1.0PR, it's supposed to be the last folder you have used that should be
on top.
