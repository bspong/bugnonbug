As a multi-tasker I come across this quite often. If you are on a slow connection (or high-latency) and submit a post then hit ctrl-tab or shift-ctrl-tab too quickly, it cause a lockup.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Slow connection down so that posting will take 3-5 second
2.Hit submit button
3.Ctrl-Tab or Shift-Ctrl-Tab
Actual Results:
crash

Expected Results:
I should be at the tabbed pane I specified and more importantly, not crash.

Pretty default settings. I believe this started long before I installed any extensions.
