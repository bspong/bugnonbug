One or two of the colums resizeing themselves at random when i visit my website.
Use firefox and visit http://swenews.info by yourself and refresh 5+ time and
you will see that the column IMDB and it neighbour are changing width at random.
Ive tried alot to fix this but no result. The <tr width <td width doesnt seems
to have any effect. Ive managed to use trix to cover the problem .. it wa worse
befor when the table width suddenly could be 10 time the width.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://swenews.info
2. Watch the column width around the IMDB column.
3. Refresh the page several times.

Actual Results:
You will see the column are changing size upon new refresh.

Expected Results:
It should have the same size a i describe in <td width="here"> and not change.
