The most appealing feature of Firefox wa not having to type in the 'www.' or
the '.com', '.net' part of the URL. Since yesterday, everytime I type in a site
name, say 'yahoo' it take me to 'www.quickbrowsersearch.com' instead. I can
visit Yahoo only if I type in www.yahoo.com. A possible hijack of the
invinscible Firefox?
