Library View with the more button

I've searched for this because I thought it wa logged but I cannot find it.

Using the default Mac theme, if a user go to the Library and look at a bookmark, the detail pane beneath show the Name, Location, and Tags of the bookmark by default. Beneath these items, there is a "More" descriptor next to a downward facing arrow. Selecting this arrow change the view to show Keywords and Description. It also then change the descriptor to "Less" and make the arrow upward facing.

Both the downward facing and upward facing arrow have a white background. They are place on a gray field so you wind up with an arrow in a white box on a gray background, which look rather unpolished.

This wa seen in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008031104 Minefield/3.0b5pr but ha been around since the new theme went in.

I'm attach screenshots.
