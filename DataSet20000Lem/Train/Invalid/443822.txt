Built-in search engine may hide custom one for the same site after Firefox update

I deleted built-in search plugin and installed updated version from it website. It wa possible because their name were a bit different. Updated version of Firefox includes updated search plugin (now with the same name), and when I install it this search plugin disappears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 2.0.0.14 (ru-RU localization)
2. Delete Yandex built-in search plugin from the list
3. Go to www.yandex.ru and install search plugin. It appears in the list now
4. Update Firefox to 2.0.0.15

Actual Results:
No error message were shown while updating. Yandex search plugin is not present in the search plugins list. I can't install it from Yandex website because there is no install item in drop-down menu. The only way to reinstall it is to restore all built-in search plugins.

Expected Results:
Maybe some error message should be shown. And at least on of the engine should remain in the list.

In ru-RU localization Yandex and Wikipedia(ru) search engine have different version with different name in Firefox and on the website (the last one support search suggestions). In Firefox they were updated in 2.0.0.15 to the version on the site and have the same name now. After updating their xml file still are in /searchplugins subdir of my profile but engine themselves do not appear.

Think the same may be found with Wikipedia(en) engine and (maybe) another version of Firefox.
