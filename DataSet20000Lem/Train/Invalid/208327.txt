Profile Manager start when link is clicked and browser is already running
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

If Mozilla Firebird is alredy running, clicking on a URL in another application,
such a a word processor document or e-mail, will open the User Profile Manager
and deny you access to your own profile.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mozilla Firebird must be your system's default browser. First launch (but
keep in mind that this problem doesn't happen if you originally launch Firebird
by clicking a link in another app; it happens only when the initial launch is
done by clicking the Firebird icon).

2. Open a program that ha a link in it (e.g, a word processor with a URL in a
document, or an e-mail client in which a message ha a URL in it).

3. Click on the URL.
Actual Results:
The User Profile Manager will open and tell you to select a Phoenix profile. If
you choose your profile you'll be told that it's already in use. This is rather
serious annoyance because it mean if my browser is open I can't follow link
sent to me in e-mail.

Expected Results:
Ideally you should get a redirection to the new URL in your existing browser
session.

Mozilla 1.3 Quick Launch is running in the background, but I don't think it's
doing any harm.
