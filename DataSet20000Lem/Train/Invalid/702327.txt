Performance of Firefox v Chrome on OS X
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:11.0a1) Gecko/20111113 Firefox/11.0a1
Build ID: 20111113031758

Steps to reproduce:

I normally run the nightly build of Firefox on a Mac Pro. However, I've run unto enough performance issue with it lately that I decided to try Chrome. Firefox is better in some areas, but lag significantly in others. Note that on Firefox, I have the following custom setting in about:config.

network.http.pipelining;true
network.http.pipelining.maxrequests;100
network.http.pipelining.ssl;true
network.http.proxy.pipelining;true
nglayout.initialpaint.delay;100


Actual results:

Areas where Chrome is faster or performs better:
-Startup, especially when multiple page are being restored. Chrome assigns a new process to each tab, and process them all in parallel. Firefox tab starve. It can take 1-2 minute to completely load about 10 tabs. Chrome doe it in a few seconds.
-Opening multiple tab simultaneously. (Open all in tabs.) Chrome is much faster at this, for the same reason that startup with multiple tab is faster.
-Scrolling through complex web pages, such a Engadget, is much smoother on Chrome. Page scrolling is jittery on Firefox on complex pages. Even more so if there are other tab open that have video playing, or are doing something complex.
-Memory usage is significantly better on Chrome.
-Instant - Chrome page download before you finish typing what you are looking for.
-OS X integration - Chrome properly support Lion's full screen mode, It also support zooming with an expand gesture (inverse pinch), and rubber banding for scrolling. However, neither fully support the range of gesture that Safari does.
-Dragging tab in and out of a window work better in Chrome.

Where Firefox Nightly is better:
-Single page download and render is faster
-URL bar (awesome bar) history search algorithm is MUCH better
-Pinned tab retain the site I've pinned
-Adblocking can block virtually all ads. Chrome adblock can't
-Firefox interface is better


Expected results:

Changes should be made to Firefox to address the area in which Chrome performs better. Note that without my custom pipelining and initialpaint.delay settings, Chrome would feel significantly faster than Firefox.
