1.Create an html file with the following code snipplet:
<textarea wrap="off" id="arid4" style="top:20; left:66; width:101; height:21; overflow:hidden;" rows=1></textarea>
2. Open the html file using Firefox and type in "this is a super long string to illustrate the problem..."
3. Notice that a you type in more and more text that exceeds the viewable portion of the textbox, it doesn't scroll horizontally to allow you to see what you're typing in
4. Furthermore, you cannot scroll to the end of the text using the right arrow key
