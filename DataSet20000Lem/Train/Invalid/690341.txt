Using the close tab option from the menu open a new tab when dragging a tab
Latest trunk ID: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:10.0a1) Gecko/20110929 Firefox/10.0a1
The issue is visible on Fx branch that have tab animation landed including Beta:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox on a clean profile.
2. Have at least 2 tab open
3. Drag one tab out of the tab strip
4. While still holding the tab hit the alt+f shortcut to bring up the "file" menu and drag the tab on the option "close tab"

Expected result:
In step 4 the selection of the option "close tab" should not overlap the selection of the tab (mouse key hold)

Actual result:
In step 4, a new tab is opened.

*Notes:
-> This issue is present since the landing of the tab animation feature -> bug 455694 which mean it's a regression if not an intended behavior
-> Is this blocking bug 455694? (see comment 304 in bug 455694)?
-> Here is a screen video of the issue:

-> I filed an enhancement bug to ask for disabling keyboard shortcut while tab manipulation. IMO this would solve this bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=689575
