[QAC generated] Page's custom context menu
In this bug I'm referring to the latest version of Minefield, I'm pretty sure that in earlier FINAL release of Firefox this worked a it should. As far a I know all version of FF4(minefield and the betas) have this issue.

Steps to Reproduce
---------------------------------------
1. Go to a site which us a special(their custom) context menu when you right click on an item(like google docs, yahoo mail).
2. In yahoo mail right click on an email, or in google doc on a file or on a folder.
3. Eather both context menu's will apear(the FF one, and the one used by the site), or only the FF's menu will.

What should have happened:
---------------------------------------
Only the page's custom context menu should apear, because that's the way it's intented to. By displaying both menu's it's impossible/impractical to use the page's one.
