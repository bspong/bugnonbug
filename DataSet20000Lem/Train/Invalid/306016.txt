If you click on the "add new item" menu at
http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~cwitte/test.xhtml and then select an item from the
menu, hte menu close but it fails to follow the link. If the page is served a
html instead of application/xhtml+xml, see
http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~cwitte/test.html, the problem disappears. The
xhtml and cs both validate.
Curiously if you use the javascript debugger and put a breakpoint in the
function resetButton(), then the link get followed.

8. menu close and link get followed (nb. the file that is linked to doesn't
exist)
