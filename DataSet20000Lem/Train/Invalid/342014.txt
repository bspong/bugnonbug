2. Press Shift.
3. Click on end of next word. Selection would cover now both words.
4. Now, without releasing Shift, double click.
Actual Results:
Random part of text disappear.

Expected Results:

Very annoying bug. On Intranet we have report system. After temporary report is generated, trying to select large part of it (to copy into clipboard) can be very dangerous operation. And there is no other way to easily select large chunk of text on web pager. ("Mouse down + drag" is too slow. "Click + scroll down + shift click" is much more efficient.)
