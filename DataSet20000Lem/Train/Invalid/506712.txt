This ha been happening to me since version 3, I think. The alt text popups "stick". After viewing the alt text on a link or image in it popup, the text stick and pop up randomly on other webpage I view within Firefox.

This happens both in the original tab where the alt text wa displayed a well a in new tab I've opened. I don't have to be hovering over a link or picture for it to happen; the mouse pointer coming to rest make the text appear.

I have tried clearing all of my history, cooky and cache, but it persists. The only thing which reset it is closing out my browser session and starting fresh. But then it happens again with the first instance of alt text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover over picture or link
2. Alt text pop up
3. That text now pop up when I hover over any link or picture, a well a when I let the mouse pointer rest on any page
Actual Results:
After I performed the above steps, the first instance of alt text "stuck" and kept appearing until I closed and restarted Firefox.

Expected Results:
The text should have disappeared from the screen and not appeared again unless I hovered over that specific link/picture containing the respective alt text again.

Using Aeon Clouds 3.5, but this ha happened with the default theme a well. It ha also happened with previous version of Firefox, going back to at least 3.0, if not earlier. I never found other complaint while searching Google for it, and just never reported it here until today.
