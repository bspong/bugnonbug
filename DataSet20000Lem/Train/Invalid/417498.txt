With FireFox 2, font selection via Preferences see all of the American Typewriter family (regular, condensed, light, etc). But with Firefox 3 beta, it see only one (the "regular"). The Fontbook application show that they all exist in the "computer" collection and are active (and yes, any duplicate have been "resolved").

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.select "Preferences" menu
2.scroll through "Default font" list
3.
Actual Results:
show "American Typewriter" only -- missing the Condensed, Light, Condensed Light, etc

Expected Results:
I expected to see all of the American Typewriter family, not just the "regular"
