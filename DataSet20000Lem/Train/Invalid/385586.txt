Some warning message (e.g. Viewing an encrypted page with unencrypted content) only have an Ok (and maybe a Cancel) button. There is no option to see more information about what is causing the warning, nor is there a Help button to explain to le sophisticated user what the warning means.

The UI guideline for Firefox et al should require these warning message to show more information to the user, and to offer a Help page explaining what is causing the warning.
