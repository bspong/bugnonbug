File -> Exit doesn't exit if Extensions window is open

If the "Extensions" window is open, the "File -> Exit" will close the browser window(s) but not exit Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox.
2. Click Tools -> Extensions. The "Extensions" window opens.
3. Click File -> Exit.

Actual Results:
The (main) browser window closes, but the Extensions window doesn't, until or unless you close it manually, e.g. by mean of it top-right red X button. Memory (RAM and swap) used by Firefox is also not released to the system, and the firefox.exe process is seen (in Task manager) to remain running.

Expected Results:
The Firefox application should close completely, including Extensions, Themes, etc.

This bug doe _not_ apply to Thunderbird. I don't know about Seamonkey.
