I installed the lastest googlebar build over the previous not knowing I
shouldn't and of course now GB will not function at all. I uninstalled GB, then
reinstalled the newest version and it still doe not work. Is it possible to why
the GB install and start fresh. I did it at work one time, but have no idea how
I did it.

Reproducible: Always
