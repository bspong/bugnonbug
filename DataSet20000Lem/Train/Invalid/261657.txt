When visiting http://www.extrasoft.be, the title bar of Firefox (but also
happens with Mozilla 1.7.x) start flickering. Also the entry in the task bar in
KDE or Windows XP start flickering. In KDE, you see that all CPU time is being
used by the firefox-bin, kicker and X process (each using about 33% of CPU
time). The result is that the whole system is becoming very unresponsive and you
are forced to close the browser. If I waited for some time, I even had to kill
the firefox-bin process, which in itself wa even very difficult, because it
took a very long time to log in in a console. For that reason, I have put the
severity to Critical.

Reproducible: Always

1. visit www.extrasoft.be

Actual Results:
title bar and taskbar entry start flickering, system becomes very unresponsive
in Linux

Expected Results:
show the site without excessive CPU usage and without updating the title bar all
the time
