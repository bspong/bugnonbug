DISCLAIMER: I cannot bother to search for the right bug # because this ha
already been reported at least 100 time with different wording so if you think
it is duplicate of a duplicate of a duplicate then delete the other one and
confirm this one because others do not bear any useful info a this one. Thank you.

It happens with other page too but here is the most visible --
http://www.homepages.hetnet.nl/~brianpostma/pc.html -- my 3.0 GHz Pentium 4 with
1GB RAM becomes 90MHz Pentium 1 a I scroll over the page. I have narrowed the
issue down to the transparent GIF background image. Seems that the rendering of
GIF image is broken in Firefox. This issue also affect AMD CPUs. I am not sure
if it ha anything to do with video card make and model (I have nVidia 6600 GT)
and video driver (Forceware 71.89).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just open the page and try to scroll up/down.

Actual Results:
I got CPU usage >50% and the Firefox scrolled the page awfully slow.

Expected Results:
It should scroll fast and smooth without taxing the CPU that much.
