In Ubuntu / Debian and some other form of linux, FF leak memory and block all other process's.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091215 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091215 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.6

OK the first time I raised this issue of Firefox leaving like a seive under Linux, I had two Firefox fan bois wet themselves and say, "OH NOOOOO Firefox ha NO leak etc...."

Well after about 2 or 3 hang up (lock up) leak per day, every day.... where Firefox consumes a few hundred meg of memory and the system BOGS to a halt, sometimes taking 10 minute to flip to a command or a XKILL process.....

The second thing is that this issue of Firefox revving the system gut out and grinding everything to a halt is a real issue for myself and other linux users.

There is ONE reply in one post, that say it's a Ubuntu issue and plenty of post on how to KILL the Firefox process, but there is NOT MUCH AT ALL a to what is causing the actual memory leak in FF that bog down Ubuntu.

There are issue around "Blame Adobe for making such shit flash" and a few other treats.....

But anyway it's a long term outstanding issue - that remains unresolved, so I am copying this post into the Ubuntu forum and seeing what come from this.

So the issue is on getting to the actual root of the problem - Why doe Firefox leak like a sieve under Ubuntu?

And what ha to be done to SOLVE the problem instead of patching the crashes?
