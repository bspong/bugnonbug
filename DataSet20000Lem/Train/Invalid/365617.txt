There is no way for me to access Adobe. Firefox 'hums' for a while and then report that it ha timed out waiting to access.. This fails from Google lookup, direct attempt via Firefox, from within adobe via their 'update' dropdown menu.

I have searched Firefox, Zone Alarm, AVG - NONE of them (as far a I can see) have any mechanism for blocking access to a site.

This MIGHT be a computer problem because I CAN access them from my wife's laptop
