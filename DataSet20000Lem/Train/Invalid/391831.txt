The google and ebay option in the search toolbar send the search request to google.com or ebay.com. Since I'm using the en-GB locale, it would be better to forward the request to google.co.uk/ebay.co.uk, which return different results. In particular, ebay show me product from UK with price in £;the same thing happens if I do a google search and click products. Google also return more appropriate search result when the regional site is used.
