When I attempt to print to the Acrobat 9 Adobe PDF printer, it doe not complete the job. I then have to reinstall Acrobat 9, version 9.3.1 since it will not allow printing from any other program

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a page which you want to print to a PDF.
2. select the Adobe PDF printer from the File, print menu in FireFox
3. the page will start to print, but will lock up the Adobe PDF printer
Actual Results:
I had to close the printer - don't believe the page got to the spooler, but not sure. When I then attempted to print from Word 2007 to the Adobe PDF printer, the same thing happened. To fix the problem, had to reinstall Acrobat 9.

Expected Results:
A PDF file should have been created. This happened in previous version of Firefox.
