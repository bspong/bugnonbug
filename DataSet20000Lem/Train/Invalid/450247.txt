The Typography is same a Arabic but with some change !

we use "Al-Fatemi","Taheri" and "Badri" Fonts which are not supported by Mozilla but IE support these font by default !

our Website is ... www.hawaij.org and thousand of user come to this site daily, but we have to ask them to use IE instead of Firefox or other browsers.

We know that Mozilla is Far better than IE but due to this Font problem, we are bound to use IE.

pls do some thing

i can send u the font if u want !

and show u what is the basic problem and difference between ARABIC and LISAN !
