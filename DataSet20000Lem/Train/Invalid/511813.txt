On Vista startup, suddenly get Vista error box "Firefox ha stopped working. Windows is looking for a solution to this problem." This change after a few second to "Firefox ha stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available." If I click on "close program" this whole process repeat in about 15 seconds. If I minimize the Windows error box, I can continue. I can open a separate instance of FF while this is going on and it work fine.

Reproducible: Always

I uninstalled / reinstalled FF and this eliminated the problem temporarily.
