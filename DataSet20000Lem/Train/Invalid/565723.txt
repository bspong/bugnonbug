When im running Remote Desktop Connection (the one included in Windows) from an other computer in a local network, (and is of cource running Firefox) and then close the connection normaly, and then log into the computer that I connected to, I don't hear any sound when im for example playing a video in YouTube. Im forced to restart Firefox to get the audio working again.

Both computer are running Windows 7 Ultimate, but one is running x86 (32bit) and the other one x64 (64bit), the computer that im connecting to is using the 64bit. But im pretty sure that it's nothing to do with that because it working perfectly.

I have not tested on any other computer(s).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to the 'host' computer by using mstsc.exe (you must allow connection at the Remote tab in 'Advanced system settings' (in the 'host' computer), and it have password.
2. Open up Firefox and go to example YouTube, and select something to play up, and then pause it.
3. Close the connection by just pressing the X button. '(oh really?)'
4. go back to the 'host' computer and login.
5. Resume the video
6. no audio!
Actual Results:
As i said previously, no audio/sound in Firefox.

Expected Results:
I should have had audio!

The only addons im runnig is Java console
