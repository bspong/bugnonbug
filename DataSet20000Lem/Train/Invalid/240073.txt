In the page at
http://www.hkjcfootball.com/hk/english/match_info/team_results.asp, the "Lague"
and "Team" pull-down menu are not working probably. In IE6, after selecting
"League", the "Team" menu change and display the team name coressponse to the
selected league. In Mozilla, the "Team" meanu doe not response to the
selection in "League" Menu. JavaScript Console showed some errors, I am not sure
if it is the mistake of the webpage or the javascript console itself(as I don't
know anything about javascript and the menu is working probably in IE6)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit http://www.hkjcfootball.com/hk/english/match_info/team_results.asp
2.try to select any league from the "League" pull-down menu


Actual Results:
"Team" pull-down menu doe not change to display the team name coresponse to
the league selected

Expected Results:
"Team" pull-down menu should show the coresponding team names. E.g. after
choosing "Premier" in "League" I can find "Arsenal" in "Team"

Javascript Console displayed quite a number of error but I don't know how to
interpret them.
