Everytime I close firefox completely since the recent software upgrade, I then cannot reopen firefox again a it say that firefox is still running and either all window need to be closed or the computer need to be restarted. So I therefore need to log off my window account and sign in again to use firefox. i have noticed this happens on some of my friend computer with the new upgrade a well.
