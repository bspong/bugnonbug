Blue Screen of Deadth

Immediately after an automatic (complete) update from 2.0.0.2 to 2.0.0.3 on 2007-03-22 00:23:00 a blue screen of death came up.

Reportedly an I/O privilege error in the kerio firewall driver.

The (relatively newly setup) system ha run about two week without trouble with firefox 2.0.0.2 and a couple of other module transfering data over the internet.

The crash repeated every time i started firefox, but then only after a few minute up to an hour of surfing. It could be possible, that it occures only after firefox being started and then stopped one time and then started again.

I had not yet the nerve to try it out over and over for verification, because - you know - blue screen of death in window xp may be much more deadly than under earlier version of this os. I wa glad enougth to find a backup of a 2.0.0.2 installation.

After switching back to the earlier version, the blue screen were gone.
At the moment, the system already run again for six hour with starting/stopping firefox every few minute dozen of time the evening without any trouble.

Thus, it look like you have introduced a serious error into the code of the 2.0.0.3 version. The firewall is definitely not the cause of the problem: It is a "good old" kerio personal firewall, working for me and others now for - i thing - 5 year throughout window 98, window nt, window 2000 and window xp on a big range of hardware and every and all applications, including firefox a the preferred browser.

The site i visited are free from complex things, namely "http://www.heise.de".
I use a few addons (noscript, refcontrol, showip).
All this is absolutely unrelated to the error, because these site and module are usable resp. working since age without any trouble.

1. Update Firefox (en) from 2.0.0.2 to 2.0.0.3
2. use it under window xp
