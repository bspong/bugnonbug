I had only three tab appearing in the Tab Bar, but four were listed in the drop-down menu on the right-hand side of the Tab Bar. When I clicked on the tab that wa missing from the Tab Bar, none of the tab in the Tab Bar were selected. This may explain why Firefox 3.5 ha sometimes (uncharacteristically) allowed me to close all open tab while leaving Firefox open (there wa probably one tab still open that wa not displayed in the Tab Bar).

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Don't know. Tends to appear during ordinary use of the browser.
Actual Results:
Tabs are not displayed in the Tab Bar even though they are still active (according to drop-down menu on the right).

Expected Results:
All open tab should be visible in the Tab Bar.

I cannot reproduce this bug on demand, but it ha occured numerous time while I've been using Firefox 3.5. I never had this problem with previous version of Firefox (as far a I can recall). I wa using the default theme when this bug occurred, and had the latest version of Firefox (3.5.1).
