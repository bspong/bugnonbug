I think this process is unusual but the result is critical. If you go to full screen mode when you are in Private Browsing Mode, the display will be broken if you use the short cut to stop Private Browsing Mode. It result in only the Firefox window being displayed. The Firefox menu and Dock disappear. This doe not happen when if you are not in Private Browsing Mode first.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start the Private Browsing mode
2.Start the Full Screen Mode
3.Stop the Private Browsing Mode from keyboard short cut (command+shift+P)
Actual Results:
Display will be broken.
