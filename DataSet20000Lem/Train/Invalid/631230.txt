Closing app tab is not really disabled. Tab close button is just invisible. I close app tab by accident with firegestures addon, which is annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install fire gesture 1.6.1
2. Create app tab
3. Perform close tab gesture
Actual Results:
Tab close

Expected Results:
Nothing happens

It is also possible to type new location in app tabs' location bar. I think location bar should be disabled for app tabs.
