The provided URL cause Firefox 4.0b9 to use all of CPU. Memory usage diverges to the Gb until it go to swap and I have to kill it. Closing the tab stop the CPU load but doe not remove the huge memory usage.

It doe not happen when the javascript is desactivated in Edit/Preferences dialog.

I tested both x86_64 and 32 bit build of Firefox 4.0b9 with no addons.

It doe not happen with Firefox 3.6.13.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the referred URL.
2. use "top" command-line utility to monitor load and memory usage.
3.
