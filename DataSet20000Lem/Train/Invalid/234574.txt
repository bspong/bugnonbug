possible without installer
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

is it somehow possible to run firefox without using this new window installer?
otherwise one ha to be system administrator to install it and run it.

if there is something firefox need in window (plugins?) it might be done on
program start too?
