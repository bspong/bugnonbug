Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I'm using a 1600x1200 resolution

1. Go to http://forums.invisionpower.com/index.php?showforum=296
2. Gradually reduce width of browser window and keep an eye on topic that have multiple pages, indicated by small box with page number to the right of the topic title.

Actual Results:
** The topic page indicator will overlap onto the Replies column before it finally wrap onto the next line.

** Also notice how the menu bar at the top right wrap onto the next line at the right, but overlap the text below.

** Both these problem do not occur on Internet Explorer a it wrap correctly.

Expected Results:
The topic page number indicator should wrap onto the next line before overlapping onto the Replies column.

The menu bar across the top right should wrap correctly by moving the rest of the page below downwards so a not to overlap.

Check out both problem in IE to see how it should behave properly.
