wa recently notified by a customer who obviously used a ff browser to view my site. i know i have issue with some page but the home and almost all main page pas coding inspection. read on the net that 3.0 would be addressing/fixing this issue and it did not - i truly don't want to try hundred of workarounds - i think you need to address this issue promptly a this is a very important concern that could affect the life of those who may come across site like mine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just key in the web address http://www.prom-garters.com using ff browser
2.
3.
Actual Results:
most text flashes, not sure why only some of it doe i have used a dreamweaver template

Expected Results:
would like to see this issue fixed if you intend to expand your browser usability i for now will just recommend they not use firefox a a browser which is not what you want all those having this issue to do, i am sure.
