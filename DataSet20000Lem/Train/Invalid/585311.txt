It seems that when part of the page is loaded, screen lock up along with the keyboard. OS still runs, and I can remotely login to reboot. X us 100% CPU at this time. Sometimes it just throw me out of X and the login screen appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit facebook page
2.Just wait
3.Observe X crashing, or login screen appearing
Actual Results:
Have to reboot. I tried this on two linux box running CentOs 5.4, and In both case the video driver are i810, and in both case X crashed. It is interesting to note that seamonkey doe not crashe on these same page that cause crash in firefox and X.

Expected Results:
Firefox crash should not result in X crashing.
