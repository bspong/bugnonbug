This is to add on to a previously reported bug, where Norton's Identity safe fill in's do not work. Am experiencing that also, but in addition, previous to this the Norton toolbar, wa an option under view toolbars. With the new edition of Mozilla, it is no longer included in the list.

Thanks, Debbie
