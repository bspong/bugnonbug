date format in certificate manager is confusing in multiple setup due locality setting

Date field of certificate manager either DD/MM/YY or MM/DD/YY depending on the locality settings, which is confusing when referring to this field -like delete the oldest certificate- and working with multiple localization of Firefox at the same time.

Having to have the field to be DD Mon YY will be much more clearer
