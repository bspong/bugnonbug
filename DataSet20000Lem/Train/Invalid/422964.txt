Hi,

Sorry, I couldn't figure out how to submit a broken site to Firefox, so I had to use this form.

I tried to go to the following site, but it doesn't seem to load up in beta 4:

https://plesk.americommerce.com:8443/login.php3

I am able to access it just fine in Firefox 2 and (ugh) Internet Exploder.

thanks - Alex
