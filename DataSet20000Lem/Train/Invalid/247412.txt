when firefox is running a root, other user on the same display can gain root privilege
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040617 Firefox/0.9

If you start firefox a a normal user and root is already running a firefox
instance, the firefox started by the normal user gain root privileges.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open an X terminal a normal user
2. type su and login a root
3. start firefox 0.9 a root
4. open another terminal
5. start firefox a normal user

Actual Results:
firefox can read/write with root privilege although startet a normal user.

Expected Results:
firefox should start a new instance of firefox instead of attaching to the
currently running root firefox process.

firefox should never be run a root, but it is much easier to install global
search engine and theme a root. When run a root, another (bad) user could
use this bug to gain root access and to compromise the system.
