Any link of orkut relationshop website provided by google are not loading. When I click on any link (profile, community, scrapbook, etc), first it start wheeling the top bar icon (showing that it loading the site), but then it stop loading and when I'll check the site, it empty, just blue a it is the background of orkut .. So I have to hit F5 (Reload) and them it appears "Loading ..." on the site it own.. Maybe it because of the new feature related to stream video that firefox ha recently added on 3.5.3 .. I don't know what it is, but I tried 2 more browser and only firefox had this problem, other browser are working properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to an Orkut Account
2. Click on any of it link (Configurations, Photos, Scrapbook, Videos, Search Options, Profile pages, ....)
3. Just wait the topbar loading icon disappear (and show orkut icon instead) and see if the page is properly loaded. If it is, try one more time, and it should be enough to see the bug.
Actual Results:
Same thing a always: I had to hit F5 to reload the website.

Expected Results:
Loading the website on the first try I guess, a it's normally done with any other website ? =)
