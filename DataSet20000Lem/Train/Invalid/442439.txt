After you start firefox and start typing address to location bar, it freeze for a couple of second in the middle of typing.

I supposse it is loading history/whatever data for the autocomplete. It is quite annoying, you are not able to enter the address util Firefox decides it is finished with loading of autocomplete data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2. start typing in location bar a soon a possible

Actual Results:
freeze for couple of second in middle of the typing

Expected Results:
let me type my address! :)
