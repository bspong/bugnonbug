The file "spencer_10.jpg.shtml" is a server-side web page. It is NOT an image.
Firefox think it is an image and give the following error.

The image
“http://www.spencerma.info/ourtown/history/jknight/images/spencer_10.jpg.shtml”
cannot be displayed, because it contains errors.

If the file is renamed to "spencer_10.shtml" then the page display correctly.

Apparently, the parsing of the extention to determine file type is not being
done correctly.

This file work with Internet Explorer on a PC and Galeon on a Linux Slackware
environment. I did have trouble with Konqueror.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just click on the URL..
2.
3.

Actual Results:
I get the error message mentioned in Details.



Expected Results:
Displayed an page with an image.
