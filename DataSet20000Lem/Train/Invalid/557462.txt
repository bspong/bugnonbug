When a Java applet start a long running operation it completely block the UI of firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://cecile.nu
2. Click on one of the thumbnail on the left
3. The firefox UI is blocked until the picture is loaded
Actual Results:
Firefox UI is blocked while loading the picture.

Expected Results:
Firefox UI is not blocked.

If you do not experience the same result, make sure it take a while to load the picture, for example by limiting your internet traffic. I put severity major on because I think you can turn this into an exploit by writing a misbehaving applet resulting in a hang of firefox.
