I haven't visited the site in several months, so I don't know when it stopped working. I've tried on both a Win2K SP4 and a WinXP SP2 machine with Firefox 2.0.0.3, with all extension disabled in both cases. The site work fine with IE 6 SP2 on both machines. I can't be any more specific than "Firefox hangs". When I try to close Firefox, Windows say "Firefox is not responding".

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:

I can't think of anything else, but I'll be happy to supply any additional info which is needed.
