HI
I've also reported this problem to roboform, and they gave the download URL above.
I have installed roboform version 6.9.87, but it is not recognised by Firefox 3 beta 2. I have checked the version is correct in Roboform and it show the right version. However when I check the version in the Addons menu for Firefox it show it to be 6.9.86 stating this version is not supported. Do you know the reason for this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I tried reinstalling roboform.
2. I tried rebooting the computer after a new installation.
3.
