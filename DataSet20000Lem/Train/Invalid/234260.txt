JavaScript doe not work a expected: checkbox should check all message but check only one
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.8/FirefoxSetup-0.8.exe

web.de offer the possibility to select all message to be deleted by checking
one checkbox. When using the new version of firefox checking the box only
result in checking the first message.
With older version of Firefox this problem didn't occur.
Best you set up a web.de account and try it out to see what I mean.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to web.de
2. Check message in the "spam" folder
3. Delete message in spam folder -> only the first message is marked for deletion

Actual Results:
Only the 1st message wa checked and could be deleted. Have to check every
message so that it get deleted.

Expected Results:
All message should be checked and then be deleted.
