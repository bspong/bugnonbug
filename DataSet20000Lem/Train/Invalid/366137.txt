Hello,

Since it's very early day in the 80ies I have used Netscape and then the Mozilla Suite. On all my Windows system since Windows V3.1 I always deactivated the Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Now you advise user to change to Firefox. Hence I tried this, but apparently there are inconsistencies, when I installed Firefox in addition to the Mozilla Suite, it never worked properly, e.g. I could not save any HTML-page, and even more surprising, not even single image received ... The question is: Why for god sake do you not provide an advice/warning about this???

As a consequence I uninstalled Firefox, but after that also Mozilla seemed not to work properly anymore and I had to uninstall/reinstall the Mozilla Suite 1.7.13.

Of course the alternative would have been to get rid of the Mozilla Suite and to use a recommended Firefox instead. However, this is not feasible for me, because Firefox ha one very big disadvantage: There is no HTML-editor, which I really need to maintain my homepage and to fit downloaded HTML-pages to my needs. So the question is: Why on earth do you not add an (optional) HTML-editor module to Firefox ???

With best regard
