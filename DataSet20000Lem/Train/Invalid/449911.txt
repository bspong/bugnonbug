I am no CSS expert, but the behaviour that I am seeing on my site when rendering it with firefox 3.0 make me believe I am observing some firefox bug.

My site is regular mediawiki with my custom stylesheet based on original MonoBook. I made it more darker and used some background-images on top of the original CSS files.

The problem I see demonstrates in "navigation" and "toolbox" area on left of the page. Both these area shall have yellow background with rounded top right corner. However the actual rendering of firefox 3.0 is often different. Surprisingly depending on the selected element ("main page", "sources", "dear reader...", "types of api", "api design patterns", etc.) the rendered result is different. This "variance" make me believe this is a bug in firefox, however a I am no expert I am looking forward to your evaluation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://wiki.apidesign.org
2. Click to various link on left "main page", "sources", etc.
3. Observe rendering of the navigation and toolbox area on left
Actual Results:
I'll attach snaphosts.

Expected Results:
I'll attach snaphosts.

Firefox 2.0.x rendered the page acceptably.
