Machines running Firefox 4 hang on black screen when entering standby or hibernate.

Both my Thinkpad X41T and X200 often hang when entering standby. The problem doe not occur if I exit Firefox before closing the lid. The machine configs are the following:

X200 | Core 2 Duo P8400 | 3GB RAM | Intel GM45 chipset | X4500MHD graphic
X41T | Pentium M 758 | 2GB RAM

The X200 run Win7Pro 32-bit, and the X200 run 64-bit. Further detail here: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=2161805&start=15

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Close laptop lid for standby
3.Swear a lot

Actual Results:
Device hang with a black screen, status LEDs and fan still on, completely unresponsive to everything except a hard reset (hold power button until it turn off).

Expected Results:
The device should enter standby smoothly.

Dropbox seems to do this a well. Same symptom, same workaround (exit the program) but not a frequent a Firefox. Happens about 60% of the time on Firefox, and 20% of th etime with Dropbox.

Maybe the two have something in common?

Other browser do not exhibit this behaviour.
