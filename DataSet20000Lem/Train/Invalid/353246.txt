In Yahoo mail and elsewhere, like NYTimes, download of version 1.5.0.7 resulted in loss of label (security label and utton bar in Yahoo mail) or graphic (NYTimes).

This is very similar to event after the previous download; however, that fault self-corrected and this ha not. Very Annoying and cannot do online shopping on many site (LandsEnd.com, jcp.com).
