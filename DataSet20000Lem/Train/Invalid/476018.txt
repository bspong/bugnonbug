After about an hour or so of having Firefox on it begin to type thing backwards and wont let me copy/paste anything or select all text. Then when i exit out of the program it wont let me open it back up some error pop up and say "this program is already open" so i hit CTRL+ALT+DEL and it doesn't appear on there until about the 4th or 5th try. Then i can finally close it and then it will let me open it. Also i noticed after this happens shortly after it crash and pop up with the send error report that never sends because it freeze in the middle of it. Please tell me how to fix this because i really don't want to resort to IE again.
