unable to focus or toggle tree twisties in Preferences
found using 2004101809-0.9+ bit on linux fc2. this wa not a problem with
firefox 1.0PR.

1. open the Preferences (Options) dialog. go to a panel which contains tree
such a Privacy or Advanced.

2. hit the tab key and try to move focus to one of the tree twisties, for example:

* Privacy > History
* Advanced > Accessibility
* etc...

expected: you should be able to move focus to the "History" (or "Accessibility"
or whichever tree twisty).

actual results: focus cannot be moved using the keyboard (tabbing or up/down
arrow keys) to the tree twisties. because of this, I'm also unable to expand or
collapse the twisties using the keyboard (eg, right/left arrow keys).

need to use the mouse to expand/collapse the tree twisties within Preferences.

interestingly, this isn't a problem in the Bookmarks Manager, which also
contains tree twisties: keyboard shortcut to expand/collapse the tree work,
and I can move focus amongst them.
