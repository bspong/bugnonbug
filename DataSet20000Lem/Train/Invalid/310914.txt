Gmail screen get to "loading..." and go no further. Other webmail site
work. Gmail worked fine with Firefox 1.0? (immediately prior to 1.07), work
fine with Internet Explorer 6, work fine with Safari (Mac OS X 10.5), work
fine with Firefox 1.5 beta.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to http://mail.google.com
2. wait for login screen
3. wait for login screen
....
n. wait for login screen


Actual Results:
Nothing. Neither the tab nor Firefox crashed. But the page never loaded.

Expected Results:
The login screen should have appeared.

I emphasize that behavior seems peculiar to Firefox 1.07. Earlier version did
not hang Gmail. Firefox 1.5 beta doe not hang Gmail either. This problem will
go away when version 1.07 go away, presumably this fall. However Gmail is
important to those who use it, so the problem is worth addressing.
