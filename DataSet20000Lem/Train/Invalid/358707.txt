Now the minister of the UK are being urged now to modify copyright law to allow user to legally rip CDs and DVDs! The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) want user to have a "private right to copy" digital content. The IPPR acknowledged that the music and film industry are justified in battling illegal file sharing. But the IPPR argues that making copy for personal use doe not have significant impact on copyright holders.<br /> <br /> Millions of Britons are violating current copyright law by ripping CDs onto their MP3 player and/or PCs. Currently, Britons are violating an outdated 300-year-old law when copying CDs and DVDs. The British Phonographic Institute ha already stated that <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=2792">it will not pursue it right to bring private copying cases</a> against user if the copying truly is for private purpose only.<br /> <br /> An independent research study report that around 59 percent of Britons believe copying CDs and DVDs to other device is legal. The chairman of the culture, medium and sport select committee inquiry admits that he and his child are in violation of the law. <span style="font-style: italic;">"My own view is that the current law are unsatisfactory a it is difficult to say to consumer that this bit of the law matter and this bit doesn't matter,"</span> Conservative MP John Whittingdale wa quoted a saying.<br /> <br /> <img border="0" alt="" class="icon" src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/souricon.gif" /> News source: <a target="_blank" href="http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4735">DailyTech</a><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><a href='http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35887'>Read full story...</a>]]></description><dc:creator>Enan Hawk</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2006 23:31:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35886</guid><title>Scientists Research Brain Implant Chip</title><link>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35886</link><description><![CDATA[University of Washington researcher are working hard on an electronic chip that may help establish new nerve connection in the part of the brain that control movement. This implantable chip strengthens weak connection and may rehabilitate patient with brain injuries, stroke, or paralysis.<br /> <br /> When awake, the brain continuously governs the body's voluntary movements. This is largely done through the activity of nerve cell in the part of the brain called the motor cortex. These nerve cells, or neurons, send signal down to the spinal cord to control the contraction of certain muscles, like those in the arm and legs. The possibility that these neural signal can be recorded directly and used to operate a computer or to control mechanical device outside of the body ha been driving the rapidly expanding field of brain-computer interfaces, often abbreviated BCI. The recent study suggests that the brain's nerve signal can be harnessed to create change within it.<br /> <br /> The researcher tested a miniature, self-contained device with a tiny computer chip. The device were placed on top of the head of monkey who were free to carry out their usual behaviors, including sleep. Called a Neurochip, the brain-computer interface wa developed by Mavoori for his doctoral thesis.<br /> <br /> The researcher said that a likely explanation for these change is the strengthening of pathway within the cortex from the recording to the stimulation site. This strengthening may have been produced by the continuous synchronization of activity at the two sites, generated by the recurrent brain-computer interface. Timing is critical for creating these connections, the researcher said. The conditioning effect occurs only if the delay between the recorded activity and the stimulation is brief enough. The change are produced in a day of continuous conditioning with the recurrent brain-computer interface, but last for many day after the circuit are turned off.<br /> <br /> <img border="0" alt="" class="icon" src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/souricon.gif" /> News source: <a target="_blank" href="http://dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=4709">DailyTech</a><br /> <br /><br /><a href='http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35886'>Read full story...</a>]]></description><dc:creator>Enan Hawk</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2006 23:25:30 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35885</guid><title>Sound Exchange Posts Deadline</title><link>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35885</link><description><![CDATA[For years, it seemed a if SoundExchange, the nonprofit organization that handle royalty payment for musician whose work is streamed over the Internet and broadcast on satellite radio networks, didn't know. The group insists that it tried hard to find the choir and about 9,000 other artist who still hadn't been paid. A few month ago, SoundExchange posted the list on it Web site, giving artist a deadline of Dec. 15 before they lose their money forever.<br /><br />Some people have criticized SoundExchange saying it ha sat on it hands. Who, they ask, doesn't know that the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is in Utah? And how hard can it be to find the Olsen twins? The list ha received a lot of publicity online, and the Olsens, the Mormons and others have been paid, but not without criticism directed at SoundExchange.<br /><br />After a quick glance, the following artist were still on this list:<br />* <b>Clint Mansel</b>, from Requiem For A Dream soundtrack<br />* <b>Coolio</b>, from Gangsta's Paradise fame<br />* <b>Fat Joe</b>, the fat one<br />* <b>Flintstones</b>, Hanna-Barbera Productions might know<br />* <b>'N Sync</b>, Justin Timberlake might know<br />* <b>Run D.M.C.</b>, MTV and/or Aerosmith might know<br />* <b>Sir Mix-a-lot</b>, MTV know where the booty is shaking<br />* <b>Ugly Kid Joe</b>, the Cats In The Cradle robbers<br /><br /><img src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/viewicon.gif" border="0" alt="" /> View: <a href="http://mail.plays.soundexchange.com/jsp/unpaidArtistList.jsp" target="_blank">SoundExchange Unpaid Arist List</a><br /><img src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/souricon.gif" border="0" alt="" /> News source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/28/business/28online.html" target="_blank">New York Times: Anyone Seen the Mormon Choir?</a><br /> <br /><br /><a href='http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35885'>Read full story...</a>]]></description><dc:creator>Nas</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2006 14:48:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35882</guid><title>Mozilla: Firefox reach 2 million downloads in 24 hours</title><link>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35882</link><description><![CDATA[Mozilla recently posted that just <b>24 hours</b> after releasing Firefox 2.0 (reported by Neowin <a href="http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&id=35802" target="_blank">here</a>) to the public on 24th October, <b>2 million</b> people downloaded it - that is 30 downloads a second.

An appeal court had already ruled that Microsoft had infringed on an AT&amp;T patent and Microsoft ha already admitted liability for domestic sale of Windows.<br /><br />The Supreme Court will hear whether or not Microsoft will be liable for international sales. A judgment in AT&amp;T&#39;s favour could cost Microsoft up to &#036;1 billion U.S. dollars.<br /><br />The crux of the case come down to whether or not the court of the United States have the jurisdiction to extend U.S. patent protection to overseas transactions. Some worry that such a ruling could drive software development out of the country.<br /><br />Needless to say, AT&amp;T ha another opinion: &quot;Congress&#39;s congressional authority is to protect the right of U.S. inventors, not U.S. infringers.&quot; <br /><br />Chief Justice John Roberts took no part in the court&#39;s decision to hear the case. The court offered no explanation, but Roberts&#39; most recent financial disclosure show that he owns between &#036;100,000 and &#036;250,000 in Microsoft stock.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/souricon.gif" border="0" alt="" /> News source: <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;pubid=968163964505&amp;cid=1161943027487&amp;col=968705923364&amp;call_page=TS_Business&amp;call_pageid=968350072197&amp;call_pagepath=Business/News" target="_blank">The Toronto Star</a> <br /><br /><a href='http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35879'>Read full story...</a>]]></description><dc:creator>fred666</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2006 16:31:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35878</guid><title>Will Vista RTM be Build 6000?</title><link>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35878</link><description><![CDATA[<b>With the way previous build number have stacked up, I don't see why this would not happen.

A plume of smoke rose 1000 meter high and nearby village were covered in ash. Fearing a major eruption, local authority began evacuating 40,000 people. UN officials, meanwhile, issued a call for help: Volcanologists should begin monitoring Talang at once.<br /><br />Little did they know, high above Earth, a small satellite wa already watching the volcano. No one told it to. EO-1 (short for Earth Observing 1) noticed the warning sign and started monitoring Talang on it own. Indeed, by the time many volcanologists were reading their email from the UN, "EO-1 already had data," say Steve Chien, leader of JPL's Artificial Intelligence Group.<br /><br />EO-1 is a new breed of satellite that can think for itself. "We programmed it to notice thing that change (like the plume of a volcano) and take appropriate action," Chien explains. EO-1 can re-organize it own priority to study volcanic eruptions, flash-floods, forest fires, disintegrating sea-ice-in short, anything unexpected. <br /><br />Is this real intelligence? "Absolutely," he says. EO-1 pass the basic test: "If you put the system in a box and look at it from the outside, without knowing how the decision are made, would you say the system is intelligent?" Chien think so.<br /><br />And now the intelligence is growing. "We're teaching EO-1 to use sensor on other satellites." Examples: Terra and Aqua, two NASA satellite which fly over every part of Earth twice a day. Each ha a sensor onboard named MODIS. It's an infrared spectrometer able to sense heat from forest fire and volcanoes-just the sort of thing EO-1 like to study. "We make MODIS data available to EO-1," say Chien, "so when Terra or Aqua see something interesting, EO-1 can respond."<br /><br /><img src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/viewicon.gif" border="0" alt="" /> View: <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/26oct_sensorweb.htm?list27315" target="_blank">The full story</a><br /><img src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/souricon.gif" border="0" alt="" /> News source: <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA</a> <br /><br /><a href='http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35877'>Read full story...</a>]]></description><dc:creator>Tim Davis</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2006 22:25:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35876</guid><title>Blue Jean Dye Kills Cancer Cells</title><link>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35876</link><description><![CDATA[The dye in your blue jean could soon be used to kill cancer cells, say scientists.<br /><br />UK researcher are employing tiny gold "nanoparticles", 1/5000th the thickness of a human hair, to deliver the chemical compound directly into cancer cells, tearing them apart instantly. The common dye found in blue jean and ballpoint pen is called phthalocyanine and is a light-activated, or photosensitive, agent with cell-destroying properties.<br /><br />This ha been known for at least 15 year but, until now, scientist have not been able to successfully deliver it into cells; hence there's no harm in wearing blue jeans. The University of East Anglia (UEA) team used the gold particle a "trojan horses". Their small size enables them to easily enter cells, and the phthalocyanine is taken up along with them.<br /><br />When pulsed with laser light, the compound produce a highly reactive form of oxygen which cause the cancer cell to commit suicide. UEA's Dr David Russell explained: "Because this compound doe not dissolve in water, it is difficult to get it into cells. But this 'fat soluble' property is precisely what make it a great potential therapy. "We have shown using nanotechnology that we can get phthalocyanine into the cancer cell where it bind and, on activation, cause substantial cell death," he told the British Association's Science Festival. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/souricon.gif" border="0" alt="" /> News source: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5323704.stm" target="_blank">BBC News</a> <br /><br /><a href='http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35876'>Read full story...</a>]]></description><dc:creator>Tim Davis</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2006 22:20:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><guid>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35875</guid><title>Underage BitTorrent Admins Fined &#3660,000 Each</title><link>http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35875</link><description><![CDATA[Four out of eight administrator of the Finnish BitTorrent tracker "Finreactor" have been declared guilty in court and have to pay damage totaling 60,000 dollar each.<br /><br />The lawsuit against Finreactor ha just come to a close. This is believed to be only the first of many filed against the site.<br />Three of the four administrator found guilty are under the age of 18. It is unclear how they are going to scrape together enough money to pay their fines.<br /><br />With a little help from Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (Keskusrikospoliisi), the Finnish equivalent of the RIAA shut down Finreactor in late 2004. It was, at the time, possibly the largest Finnish BitTorrent tracker with more than 37,000 registered members.<br /><br />The Keskusrikospoliisi, after getting the go-ahead from Teosto, raided the administrators' home and seized computer and hard drives.

There wa considerable exposure apparently, with some user responding positively and others critical of the spots.<br /><br />Even though these spot may have been clever, edgy or entertaining, they're effectively video spam because they were put there by an ad agency on behalf of Wendy's. Get ready, there's going to be a lot more of this once marketer clue in to how effective (and cheap) YouTube and online video site are a an alternative to conventional TV advertising.<br /><br />What's the danger, what's the opportunity?<br /><br />The opportunity is pretty clear for marketers, unless they kill the goose. But rather than flooding site like YouTube with TV-like spots, they should create video campaign elsewhere that build a fan base. And then let the fan upload those commercial to YouTube. Then it's not spam but viral marketing.<br /><br />The danger are pretty obvious for YouTube (and Google). If YouTube doesn't police commercial video spam, user will be alienated. Google, for it part, will lose part of the revenue opportunity it bought YouTube to capture - brand marketing via online video. But policing this will be challenging.<br /><br /><img src="http://www.neowin.net/images/icons/souricon.gif" border="0" alt="" /> News source: <a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/?p=3950" target="_blank">Search Engine Journal</a> <br /><br /><a href='http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&amp;id=35874'>Read full story...</a>]]></description><dc:creator>Tim Davis</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Oct 2006 20:33:06 +0000</pubDate></item>
