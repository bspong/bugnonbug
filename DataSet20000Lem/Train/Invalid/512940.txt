When you add a new bookmark a window pop up where you can choose a name and location. If you click the little arrow next to 'Folder' (to display the full folder list) Firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the Bookmarks menu and choose Bookmark this page.
2. Click the right-most button on the field named "Folder:"
3. Crash
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, and always say "well this is embarrassing" when reloading

Expected Results:
The list of bookmark folder appears, like previous version

No crash logging software seems to be installed, and I can't find instruction on how to install 'Breakpad'
