Smart keyword for tab search
I like having my open tab in the awesomebar results, but many time I *only* want to search my open tabs. My preferred interface would be a search keyword, since that's how I select all my search these day (which would be a week after I first learned about the search keyword feature.)

I'd want to be able to choose the keyword myself, to make it fit into my own naming scheme.

Of course, open tab is just the main additional type of search. Others are history, bookmarks, and other computers' tabs. I've never personally needed any of those, though.
