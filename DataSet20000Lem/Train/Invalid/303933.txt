file handling type error on php upload
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.4; Linux) KHTML/3.4.0 (like Gecko)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/1.0.6

I have a php uploader that only allows public to upload "text/plain" files.
The code is:

if($fupload_type != "text/plain"){
echo "text file only!"
exit();
} else {
echo "upload successful!"
}

from firefox 1.0.6 on windoz xp "text file only!" is always displayed, even
though an "echo $fupload_type" produce "text/plain".

This work fine in firefox on Linux.

And also work fine on internet explorer.

I had to use alternative code:

if(substr($fupload_name, -3, 3) != "txt")...

to get windoz firefox to work appropriately.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. build an uploader using code listed above
2. upload a text file
3. see that it doesn't work

Actual Results:
"text file only!"

Expected Results:
"upload successful!"
