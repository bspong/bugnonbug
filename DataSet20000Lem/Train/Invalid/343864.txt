Softex Biopod not compatible with Firefox - can't detect password field
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

I purchased a Biopod from APC. The software is designed to look for password field within web page and then automatically enter your password in conjunction with a fingerprint reader. Works fine with IE, but the password field in Firefox may lack some feature or marker which the Softex Omni Pass software is looking for. Renders the product useless with Firefox which is my preferred browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install biopod and load software
2.Attempt to "remember password" and click on the password field
3.Omni Pass responds with an error that it can't identify the field a being a "password field"

Actual Results:
Omni Pass can't find a descriptor/identifier within Firefox that indicates the selected field is a "password".

Expected Results:
Fails to record a password
