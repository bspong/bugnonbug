I have a HUGE bookmark menu. Most of the bookmark have favicons (those custom icon to the left of the web address). When I open the bookmark menu after I launch Firefox or after it ha been sitting idle for a while, the bookmark menu freeze a Firefox get all the favicons, which can take anywhere from 10 second to 1 minute at the outside. This happens even if you're just running your mouse along the menu bar with the mouse button down, going from, say, the Window menu to the History menu by way of the Bookmarks menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a huge bookmark menu, none of it in folders. By huge I mean at least 200 or 300 files.
2. Launch Firefox.
3. Open the Bookmarks menu. And wait.
Actual Results:
The bookmark menu opened, Firefox froze for about 20 or 30 second fetching all of the favicons, the icon appeared next to the bookmark names, Firefox unfroze.

Expected Results:
The bookmark menu opened immediately, with all of the icon in place, Firefox having saved the icon along with the bookmark and (if necessary) updating it when I next visited the website the bookmark wa referring to.
