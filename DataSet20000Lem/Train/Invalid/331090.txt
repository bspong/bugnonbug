In addition to restricting cooky a emanating only from host Web URLs, I set the cookies.txt file (in Firefox latest) to read-only so I am not swamped with ad tracking. Unfortunately, when I do this, Firefox start generating new files: cookies1.txt, cookies2.txt etc. How can I prevent this overridie of my cookie-block?

Reproducible: Always
