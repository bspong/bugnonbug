I just upgraded to FF1.5, and have FF set a my default browser in Windows.

Now every time I try to use Google desktop search (build 0050818-en) my Windows Explorer crashes, and then Dr Watson crash immediately after.

Crash seems to happen a Google desktop is populating a FF tab with search results.

FF remains active, a do any other open programs, but the Windows taskbar, start menu etc lock up and becomes inoperable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type search term into Google Desktop search panel in taskbar
2. hit return


Actual Results:
Windows Explorer crash - this only started happening after inastall of FF1.5

Expected Results:
FF to load desktop search result page
