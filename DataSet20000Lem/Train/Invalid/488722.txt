I'll do my best to describe this. Open Firefox 3.5b4pre, press ctrl-t to open a blank tab. Drag that tab down into the window and let go and Firefox open 2 new instance of Firefox in the taskbar. However, that's not all because if you close those two new window and then go back to the first window and press ctrl-t, you get 2 tabs. but if you close one of those tabs, all of your tab disappear until you press ctrl-t again. This behavior disappears when you close all instance of Firefox, but come back if you start the process over.
