Hi, I love the add on firebug unfortunately I am unable use in on my mac, I am unable to see the comments. Everything read a little squares.
I also installed it on my window computer and it work fine, but on my mac in firefox 2.0.0.3 it doe not render correctly. I tried changing the font in the preference but it doe not help. I have also noticed that any website that is designed with the default font georgia render the same way - a bunch of squares.
