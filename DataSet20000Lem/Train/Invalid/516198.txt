Well, almost. Type a single character and you get your matches. Type the second one and the dropdown clear itself out and resizes correctly. It actually populates correctly and immediately clear out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ctrl-A in address bar
2. Type a single character. Ok here.
3. Type the second one. The list populates and then is empty.
