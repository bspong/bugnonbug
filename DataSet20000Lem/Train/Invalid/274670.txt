Firefox doesn't properly assign the remaining 100%
Can you explain why Firefox doesn't properly assign the remaining 100% of a
layer?

For example, put one layer alongside other item inside an outer layer with an
assigned static width. Set the inner layer to take the remaining 100% of space
left inside this outer layer.

Instead of doing this properly a Internet Explorer does, Firefox make the
inner DIV ignore the other item that are along side it, and simply set it's
width to the exact same a the assigned width of the outer layer. This result
in stretching because there are other item inside the outer layer taking up
space.

Shows the specific error. Open it in Internet Explorer, and then open it in
FireFox.
