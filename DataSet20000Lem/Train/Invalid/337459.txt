Sometime when I have multiple firefox session open one ore more will disappear from the window taskbar but will still be running. No it is not the fact that there is too many for the taskbar to display. if I close on the other may reappear. I have to go into the task manager to see if it is still running at times. I dont think this is a win XP issue because it ha never happend when I have mult win apps opened that are not firefox.

Thanks Chris
