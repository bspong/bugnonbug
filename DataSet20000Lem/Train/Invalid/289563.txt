I updated a .js file and downloaded it to a web server running GoAhead. One of
the page used the .js for entry validation. I found that the old .js file wa
still being used to validate the page. In addition, the new .js file wa being
used IN ADDITION TO and AFTER the old one. Both new and old file had the same
name. Going to Tools/Options and clearing the cache fixed this problem.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Test validating .js file by deliberately entering invalid data.
2. Update the existing .js file on web server running GoAhead
3. Re-test, and old .js file still runs.

Actual Results:
The error message in the replaced .js file showed up.

Expected Results:
Should have shown the error message in the new .js file.
