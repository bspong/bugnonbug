After doing a clean install of Windows 7 on the corporate network Firefox fails to configure the proxy using the WPAD configuration which is reachable by http://wpad.domain.com/wpad.dat

When using Firefox on Windows XP 32 bit or Windows 2003 Server 32 or 64 bit the wpad configuration is automatically picked up.

Firefox is running using the PowerUser priviledges on the domain user account.

The existing network ha ~150 workstation and laptop that succesfully configure the proxy using the wpad.dat file with either IE or Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Windows 7 64 bit and install Firefox 3.5 (32 bit untested).
2. Configure a WPAD host using wpad.domain.com with a wpad.dat file
3. Set the proxy configuration in FF to autodetect the proxy configuration
4. Firefox fails to autoconfigure the proxy and fails into the black hole called the corporate firewall.
Actual Results:
1. Set the proxy configuration in Firefox to "autodetect"
2. Surf to http://www.cuteoverload.com

Expected Results:
Firefox fails to reach the website and return a Connection timed out error.

Did I mention that pfSense is a great open source firewall ;-)

this is quite possible a very subtle issue, we also have window vista 64 bit station which I have not tested personally. But I have heard no personal complaint from the developer either. Which lead me to believe that Windows Vista 64 bit works.
