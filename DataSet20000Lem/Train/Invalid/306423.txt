Whenever I start Firefox on my machine it reloads the last visited website I
had been too. I believe this had something to do with some registry setting
since the symptom don't exist on the admionistrator account. Furthermore,
uninstalling Firefox doesn't remove everything (if it remove anything at all)
it writes on the Windows Registry, making this problem carried on on upgrades. I
uninstalled my prev version (1.04) before installing 1.06. Infact I still have
my bookmarks. I used to try manually deleting every Firefox related key on the
registry before reinstalling. I believe I missed one. Maybe a "clean"
uninstall or an option to delete setting created by the user could solve this.

Thank You,
even with this bug, iexplore still suck :)
