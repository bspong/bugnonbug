I have downloaded Firefox Version 3.6 on 3 separate occassions, saved it to my application folder, and opened the application directly from my application folder. When I visit website such a myspace or youtube, I am prompted to upload Version 3.6 and told that my version of Firefox is no longer supported.

I am not computer savvy enough to know what's going on.

Think you can help fix this? Thank you.
