a is for any other CSS property, I would expect that a node inside another one with -moz-user-select property assigned can re-assign the property itself a is for color, background, and others. Unfortunately, this doe not happen even inline or with !important flag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
<div style="-moz-user-select:none;">
<div style="-moz-user-select:text !important;">
abc def
</div>
</div>
Actual Results:
It is not possible to select the text. To make it possible it is necessary find each parent, verify if it ha the property -moz-user-select set a no then change it and go on up to documentElement.

Expected Results:
redefined property should have more relevance than parent one a is for color, font, background, border, width, etc etc

Specially with third part framework, this problem could be a massive waist of time/resources because a soon a a container ha this property for labels, tabs, other purposes, every nested element will be affected without possibility to simply select a text (createRange work a expected though)
