About 3 day ago, Google Reader started running ridiculously slow with Firefox. I've tried uninstalling Google Gears and other add-ins, but nothing ha sped it back up to normal. When I click on a new blog to read on the left-hand side, it take 30-60 second to load the new blog, and then the title start to appear one at a time, every 5 second or so. The entire page with 40+ title used to load in about 2 seconds, and now it take minutes!

I checked the page in IE, and it's running fine there, so it's not a problem with the Google servers, a it is unique to Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to Google Reader
2.Click on a blog that ha at least a few post to display
3.Watch how slow it load (up to 60 seconds)
Actual Results:
The page responds very slowly.

Expected Results:
The page should load in 2-3 second instead of minutes.
