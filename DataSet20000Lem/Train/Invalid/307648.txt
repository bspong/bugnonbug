International/accented character support for extensions/JavaScript is broken
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

The international character support for extension and/or JavaScript is somehow
broken between Deer Park Alpha 2 and Firefox 1.4 (1.5). Extensions using
international char in inline JS-constants can display these string (messages)
using for ex. an alert() call properly in Firefox 1.0.x and Deer Park alpha 2
versions, but in FF 1.4/1.5b1 the browser display question mark in place of
the accented/non-US-ASCII characters. The problem seems to affected JS-constant
string only - string hardcoded inside XUL form seem to display correctly,
though. If you try to display the same string in a plain HTML page using alert
() (and not from inside an extenions), it also work correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install the extension specified at the homepage URL
2. Press the rightmost button (labeled "Belépés")
3. Check the content of the displayed messagebox

Actual Results:
In FF 1.4/1.5b1 "?" character are displayed where some accented char should
be shown. US-ASCII char are displayed correctly, though.

Expected Results:
Display accented/international character correctly

The problem is present in the newest FF 1.5b1 (which ha 1.4 in it's user-agent
string a version) in the US-EN version (no other version available now), but
I've also tested it previously with yesterday 1.4 nightly build in HU-hu
(hungarian) language version, which had the bug, too. Previous FF version
(1.0.x, DPa2) display the international string correctly in both EN-us and HU-
hu language versions.
