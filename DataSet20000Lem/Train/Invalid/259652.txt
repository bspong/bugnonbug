When you login to your GMail account and click on Contacts, you get a message
saying a popup blocker is blocking the Contacts window.
So I added http://gmail.google.com to my exception list and now when I try it
the spinning beachball come up and stay there. I have to force quit Firefox.

1. Login into GMail
2. After gmail.google.com is a popup blocker exception click on Contacts
3.

Actual Results:
The browser lock up

Expected Results:
Whatever it's supposed to do :)
