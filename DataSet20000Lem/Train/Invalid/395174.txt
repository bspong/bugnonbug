Identity pop-up should disappear a soon a I start typing in the location bar
Steps to reproduce:

- Click on the favicon in the URLbar in order to select the field, the identity popup will appear
- Start typing, several history autocomplete pop-up will appear and overlap the indentity popup
- When the autocompletes stop appearing you'll still see the identity pop-up of the site you planned to leave and that's illogical

Maybe one would say: don't click on the favicon if you want to leave, but it is the only way that ALWAYS selects the location bar field.
