Steps to reproduce:

- in Tools > Options uncheck "Remember visited page for the last 600 days"
- Go to a site
- Restart Firefox
- Check the same option again and change it to 300 day again (necessary because it ha changed to 9 days)
- Visit a site
- In the sidebar you'll see this a the only visited page in month
- Close Firefox
