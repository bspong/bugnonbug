Supposing I have not accessed a bookmark in a really long time. But it ha been tagged, now if I enter the tag into the location bar the bookmarked page doe not show up. However this doe not happen with all the tag for that book-marked page. Eg if a page ha the tags, mobile and telephone. When I type mobile, the page doe not show up, but telephone give me the page.

This may be because the number of page i have visited in the past have 'mobile' keyword a lot and the location bar only display limited number of links. However, page which match the keyword 'telephone' are not many so the bookmarked page show up.

The location bar should ALWAYS show your bookmarked pages, no matter how OLD they are. but this doe not seem to be the defining behavior

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Tag a really old bookmark a google using the bookmark library window.
2.Save the bookmark and the tag (it is done by default)
3.type google in the location bar, lot of history page show up, but the page tagged google which is a bookmark doe not show up
Actual Results:
The bookmarked page did not show up

Expected Results:
Showed the bookmark tagged a google
