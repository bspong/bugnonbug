After upgrading to Firefox 3.6.7 on my *PortableApps* version of Firefox and restarting, all of my add-on were disabled. They are still listed in the Add-Ons tab and act a if enabled, yet the icon are missing from the right. None of them require updates, and I do not get the typical "This add-on is not compatible with this version" message.

Add-ons I am using are Firebug (1.5.4), FireFTP (1.0.9), Flashblock (1.5.13), Gmail Notifier (0.6.4.1), Java Quick Starter (1.0), Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant (1.2.1) and Web Developer (1.1.8)

Please let me know if you need further details.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox Portable from PortableApps.com
2. Upgrade to 3.6.7 and restart
3. Go to Tools > Add-Ons, or try to use installed add-on
Actual Results:
See detail

Expected Results:
Add-ons should have either worked, or thrown an error stating version incompatibility
