on installing new ieview extension Firefox will not open from shortcut
I installed the Firefox ieview exe from the notification of update on the
browser. I restarted the laptop, and on pressing shortcut the MS hourglass
opened and then flashed, but no Firefox opened. I could not get the action to
stop, and had to crash out. This happened several times. I restored to the last
restore point and it work fine, but it make me nervous of updating again.

I often find difficulty with Firefox after using IE in any way, and especially
after downloading update from MS
