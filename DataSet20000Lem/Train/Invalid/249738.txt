Enabling XFT neutralizes FreeType2 (when both are enabled in the build)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040629 Firefox/0.9.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040629 Firefox/0.9.1

I normally use Mozilla and Firefox with direct-FreeType2 font (i.e. via the
font.FreeType2.enable pref), a this give me more legible text than XFT.
Between Firefox 0.8 and 0.9, XFT became part of the standard release
configuration; a of 0.9, the release version rendered everything with XFT, even
though my prefs had not changed. No amount of fiddling would get the FreeType2
interface working again.

Which led me to suspect that perhaps the release configuration now specified
--disable-freetype2 a well. So I built Firefox myself, with both XFT and
FreeType2 enabled. Start her up, and... everything is XFT. No evidence that
FreeType2 is working; no TrueType font scan, no ~/.mozilla/firefox/fonts/
directory created, no FT2-generated name in the font configuration dialog, and
no FT2 fonts.

The only way I could get FreeType2 working wa by disabling XFT altogether.
Which gave me nice font on rendered pages, and non-antialiased one in the UI.
That in itself wasn't so bad, however, a the fact that now, I have to compile
Firefox myself if I want FT2 font rendering at all.

Why do I want to use FreeType2 directly, instead of XFT? Through what is
probably an accident of the implementation, FT2 draw text with darker, more
legible strokes. It apparently is using a different gamma adjustment in it
antialiasing, with pleasing results. Text drawn with XFT look lighter, more
washed-out, and the effect is Not Nice (particularly on a standard-issue #FFFFFF
background). There ha been discussion to add gamma-correction to XFT, which
would address this problem, but the feature is still some way from being
implemented.

Not only that, XFT also munges the stroke width on certain character quite
badly, such a the right half of a capital D from Microsoft's Times New Roman
font. (Note: I can submit screenshots of this admittedly peripheral problem, if
anyone would find them of interest.)

The ideal outcome would be the ability to simultaneously use direct-FreeType2
for rendering Web pages, and XFT for the UI (as it doe quite a fine job there).
Failing that, I would just like to be able to use FreeType2 with the XFT-enabled
release builds, when the appropriate pref is set.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build Firefox with --enable-freetype2 --disable-xft.
2. Run, and configure the font.FreeType2.enable set of prefs to get Gecko
rendering with font provided by the direct-FreeType2 code.
3. Do another build of Firefox, with --enable-freetype2 --enable-xft.
4. Run, and wonder if the configure script interpreted that a
--disable-freetype2 --enable-xft.
Actual Results:
After step 2: Web page rendered with FreeType2, UI rendered with monochrome
bitmap font (most likely through the standard X11 mechanism)

After step 4: Web page and UI rendered with XFT, despite font.FreeType2.enable
still being set.

Expected Results:
After step 4: Web page should be rendered with FreeType2 fonts, and the UI
should be rendered with XFT or FreeType2 font (depending on how well the two
play together).
