Just started using version 4. In the old version there wa a small tab immediately to the right of the left-right (forward page-back page) arrows. I can't find a way to activate this via 'view', 'toolbars' or any other way. In the past I could immediately jump back any number of page (I think up to about 8). I can't believe this highly useful tool wa designed-out...it wa an incredible time saver. Why isn't the pull-down showing?
