I can't opet any site while BitComet (a torrent client) is opened. No matter if I open BitComet of Firefox first.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

When BitComet is running, and I start Firefox, I can't open any page. The Firefox just say "Looking up www.example.com". Or, when Firefox is running, and I open BitComet, the same thing happens in Firefox...
