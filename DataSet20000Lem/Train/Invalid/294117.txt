http load speed (internet explorer is pwning firefox this need to be fixed)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: firefox

i wa using firefox on linux and i noticed webpage loaded much faster then
they do on my window firefox (on the same computer/connection) so i wa
tweaking my network setting on window and nothing wa working.. then i went
to a few page in internet explorer and it loaded them insanely quicker than
firefox... what could be causing this? (its rather disturbing having to use
internet explorer)

Reproducible: Always
