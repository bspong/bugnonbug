The other day, while I wa adding an “extension” to Firefox 3.0, I’ve accidentally closed the session in the middle of it download. When I retry the update again, it didn’t really download anything, instead it wa trying to retrieve the file from it cache. Since I know the download did not completed successfully, I didn’t really trust the content from it cache, so I manually deleted the partially completed download. However, I did not delete any of it cache index and mapping because they were still in use.

When I retry the download again, it wa giving me a new message stating that the target file cannot be found. Because of the cache index and mapping were not deleted, it wa still trying to access the file directly from it local drive rather than from the Internet source. I think this is a software bug since if the target file doe not exist even though it mapping and index still do, it should automatically retrieve a fresh copy from it original source. In order to recover, I had to terminate the Firefox process and then do a manual deletion of the cache indexes/mappings and everything wa working again.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.perform partial download + uninstall the new extension
2.manual delete partial download file from the local cache, but NOT the indexes/mappings.
3.retry to update the new extension.
Actual Results:
File not found message.

Expected Results:
Should have retrieve file from the Internet source.
