The font became bigger and bold on a page I wa browsing. I viewed the same page
in internet explorer and the font looked normal(not bigger and bold). I viewed
the source html from the page in firefox and there were <tbody> tag on all
table where the font wa different. I viewed the source in IE and the <tbody>
tag weren't there. I did a google search about this, in firefox. The result
from the search came back big and bold. I view the source of the google search
page and <tbody> tag where added to all of the table on that page. Did the
same google search in IE and the <tbody> tag were not there. I had 8 or 9 tab
open in firefox at the time so I viewed various page in each tab and the same
thing wa happenning on all of them, tag were added and the font wa bigger and
bold. I close firefox and started it again. I went to the same page and the
tag were no longer being added and the font wasn't bigger and bold anymore.
