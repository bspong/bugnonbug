Bloglines Toolkit permanently reporting 'No unread items'
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008051706 Minefield/3.0pre ID:2008051706

The well-known blog aggregator service 'Bloglines' ha an extension for Mozilla browser called 'Bloglines Toolkit' (http://www.bloglines.com/about/notifier/#moz).
Its most noticeable feature is a "B" icon in the lower-right part of the browser which feature an additional red dot when there are unread blog entries. In the 'unread posts' state, one can click on it to be taken to bloglines.com, in the "no unread posts' state, clicking trigger it to check again whether there are new posts.

In the last few nightly build (ca. the last 7 days, though I didn't check), this extension is no longer working, a in, it always behaves a if there were no unread post (despite there being).

Can anyone confirm this and doe anyone know whether a recent change in Firefox trunk code caused this?

Using Bloglines version 1.7.0, re-install did not work.
