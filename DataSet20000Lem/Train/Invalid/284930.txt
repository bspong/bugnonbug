At the website https://practicum-web.aii.avans.nl/rvdwestela/compressie/ you see
a rendered HTML page (the server is secure btw). It wa rendered from a PDF
file. As PDF document are created for printing purpose I find reading it (the
HTML one) in FireFox not preferred. But when opening this site in IE, you will
see that there is a spacing between the two PNG background images, so they tend
to look like pages, which I find much nicer to read from. I don't know if it is
desireable to change this (as it can affect other element in the browser) but
if it can change, it would please me.
