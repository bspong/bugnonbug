"connection wa interrupted" on unsupported SSL cypher

If I set Firefox to only allow certain SSL cypher (such a only allowing AES 128 or 256) and then try to view a HTTPS site that only support RC4, I get a 'The connection to que.campuscu.com wa interrupted while the page wa loading.' There is no indication that my SSL cypher limit are causing the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Only allow AES128/256 encryption
2. Visit a site that ha (max) RC4128
3. Witness vague error message
Actual Results:
Firefox give a 'The connection wa interrupted' page

Expected Results:
A error page that explains the SSL cypher isn't compatible, and maybe an easy way to turn on the strongest-supported cypher that the site supports.

I disabled all non-AES SSL cypher in order to test this behavior.
