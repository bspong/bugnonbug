Windows 2000 crash when using Firefox 1.0.4
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

This is suspicious but hard to prove. I hadn't rebooted Windows 2000 in over a
week; it ha proven surprisingly stable. I upgraded from Firefox 1.0.2 to 1.0.4
yesterday because of the security issue. It worked fine. But after an hour or
so, the computer crashed *very* suddenly. I wa just scrolling a common web
site and the screen went blank, I heard a click, and it hard-rebooted. Funny
coincidence... Then today, I wa again looking at ordinary sites, scrolled with
the mouse, and <click> the system rebooted. I am getting more suspicious. I
never had this happen with earlier versions.

I doubt there's a log (it didn't have time to leave one), but if there's a place
to look please tell me.

FWIW this same computer cannot run Mozilla Seamonkey 1.7 (I used 1.8 beta5
before switching to Firefox) and Java in Firefox won't run inside web pages,
even though I repeatedly installed Sun's J2RE 1.5.0_02.
