I am using Windows 2000 5.00.2195, SP4 with AMD Athlon XP 3000+. I checked my system event viewer and it recorded a bugcheck 0x00000050 (0xe4a0bb08, 0x00000000, 0xa0039f44, 0x00000001). I have the following extension installed to Firefox 1.5, NoScript 1.1.3.5 , IE Tab 1.0.7, Tab X 0.9.2, MediaPlayerConnectivity 0.4.9.4, and SmoothWheel 0.44.7.20050605. After several reboots, I reloaded Firefox 1.5 by uninstalling the software using control panel/install/uninstall software then, downloading 1.5 from modzilla web site using IE 6.0.2800.1106, SP1 (128-bit) and installing it after it downloaded. I also disabled the NoScript extension. This did not change the result. Please note when printing a web page from www.msnbc.com, I wa able to print a page using the web pages' "print this" excutable which pop up a RTF or TXT version of the web page . I did get this window to print out.
