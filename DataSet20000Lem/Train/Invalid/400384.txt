This happened on my PC a while ago, and then just happened this morning. I have been using the Yahoo! Companion for year and store all my bookmark there so that I'll have access to them all from home or the office. I wa using them still yesterday even. But a of today, they don't show up on my Mac either! All I have is the first few option on the Yahoo! toolbar but when I go to select additional button (like my bookmarks, calendar, mail, etc. and hit Finished, those button never appear). I rely on those bookmark to get to all the various site I go to throughout the day; I'm a web developer. I don't understand how they can work fine one day and then not the next. I tried uninstalling the Yahoo! extension and re-installing but the button are still gone and I can't add them back. The Yahoo Companion still work fine w/ IE on my PC. Any ideas?
