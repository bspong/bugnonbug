I have successfully loaded PDF file using the Adobe Reader plugin for Firefox,
but the full version of Acrobat 6 Professional doe not seem to work correctly
with the Firefox plugin. The program launches, but then firefox.exe take all
the CPU cycle and nothing happens. I have to kill it with the task manager.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any page with a PDF file
2. Click on the file link to try to download it
3. Watch the Acrobat 6 Pro startup screen, then, when nothing happens, start
Task Manager
4. Click on "Processes" tab
5. Observe "firefox.exe" utilizing 100% of CPU (except what taskmgr.exe needs)

Actual Results:
I had to kill the process with Task Manager

Expected Results:
I expect Firefox to launch Acrobat and pas the PDF to it, or for a Firefox
window to open with the Acrobat plugin, like on IE.
