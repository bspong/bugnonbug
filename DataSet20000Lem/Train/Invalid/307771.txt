always freeze computer when trying to view medium player file - begin showing
file, but freeze after just a second or so, freezing thw whole system. cannot
move mouse (stuck) and ctrl+alt+del doe not release system.

i have loaded/reloaded IE6setup.exe a couple different time trying to eliminate
the problem - unsuccessful. i have the 'mozilla update' a my homepage, to
download the update for this software (media player), and this also doesn't
correct the problem.

i have encountered this with medium in email mailed to me, a well a in
mozilla. the ONLY thing that is different is that i had just loaded mozilla a
my default browser. the system used to work fine w/ IE a browser.

thanks so much.
