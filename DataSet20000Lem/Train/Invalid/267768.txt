I have the latest version of Firefox and Logitech Mouseware.
When i click my middle mousebutton to get the fourdirection arrow, with which
you can scroll over the page by moving the mouse, I get nothing.
It doesn't show up and I can't scroll my just moving my mouse.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Own Logitech Mouse
2. Download Latest Mouseware
3. Try it in IE by clicking your scrollwheel. You'll see a round thing with 4
arrow appear and when you move the mouse, it scroll over the page
4. Try it in Firefox and it doesn't work

Actual Results:
It simply didn't show up.

Expected Results:
You should see a round thing with 4 arrow appear and when you move the mouse,
it should scroll over the page

It didn't crash or anything, it's just not compatible I guess, but I wouldn't
know why not.
