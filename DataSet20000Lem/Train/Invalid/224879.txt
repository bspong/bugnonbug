Seems there exists already a bug (166807) for the derstandard.at - page. The
reason why I neverthelss open the bug, is that I have the problem the link in
above Frameset are not accessible, ie. could be click, but NO result is shown in
the lower frameset.

And a far a I understand, this is not addressed in the previous Bug.
