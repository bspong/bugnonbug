calling advanceSelectedTab(1) to go to the next tab always move the visible area to the end, leaving the possibly selected tab in the front invisible.
advanceSelectedTab(-1) to go to the previous tab always move the visible area to the beginning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a lot of tab with at least 2 of them out of the visible area
2. select the first tab
3. call advanceSelectedTab(1) (through a tabscroll extension or other means)
Actual Results:
notice that the 2nd tab is not visible due to the visible area being on the right side (end)

Expected Results:
tab overflow should work correctly when calling advanceSelectedTab
