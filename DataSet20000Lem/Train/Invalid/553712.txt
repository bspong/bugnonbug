Hello,

happened to me a mishap.
I accidentally right after typing a user name written on a page with my login password and press enter.
Now I have the problem, that the username is stored there, including password.
in the latest firefox version 3.6, there is, so far I have seen that no extra function with which one could remove it.
A small button in the next version would be very helpful, because unfortunately I have to reinstall my firefox now complete and all lesezeichen, add addons, etc. individually. : (

yours sincerely Malte Schmidt

Reproducible: Always
