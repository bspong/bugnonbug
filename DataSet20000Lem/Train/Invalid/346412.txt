On http://arzy.net/new.php this page fade the current div out, dynamically load content from an external url, and fade it back. Somewhere in the process firefox, both 1.5 and bon echo, get greatly confused. If you click on home twice you will see that only part of the dynamic content is faded. No where that I even know of that it possible. The service link doe not fade at all. FireFox seems to have issue with fading divs with heavy content. This is assumed to be a style.MozOpacity issue. If you load the page in IE it sadly works.

The div also loses it width property, and even if set later through javascript it can not find a way to change widths.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Home
2. Click Services


Actual Results:
See that no fading occurs, and page width is lost.

Expected Results:
Page should fade in and out. View in IE for successfull results.
