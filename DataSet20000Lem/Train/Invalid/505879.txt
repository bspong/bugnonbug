firefox 3.5 is segfaulting on certain sites.

Firefox drop a core on both RHEL and Fedora 11 when I go to this site:

http://www.cinematical.com/2009/07/22/first-alice-in-wondeland-trailer-now-online/

Sometimes I have to hit reload or go to it in 2 windows. But most of the time just simply going to the site make it drop a core.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.cinematical.com/2009/07/22/first-alice-in-wondeland-trailer-now-online/
2. If that doesn't do it, hit reload.
3.
Actual Results:
A shiney new core file.

Expected Results:
To watch the trailer?! That movie look awesome.



Actually we are having issue with random core drop that arn't related to this site, so we are hoping that whatever is on that site that's causing it, can be fixed for the other unknown core drops.
