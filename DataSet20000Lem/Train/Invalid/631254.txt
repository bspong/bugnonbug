Using Google Desktop 2.9.1005.12335 FF would work for much of the day, then just go into not responding, I'd force it quit, then I could not re-open, it would crash again, right when I opened it

I tried everything in the FF trouble shooting, even upgrading to the new beta, but nothing helped. I finally tried closing Google desktop, then all of the sudden firefox loaded and worked perfectly.
(happened with both the new beta and the previous 3.x version)

Once upgraded to the new FF beta, I uninstalled Google Desktop and re-installed it. Now it appears to be working fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use Firefox with google desktop installed, suddenly during the day, with no web site in particular seeming it set it off, it crashes.
2. End task and Re-open
3. Try to load any page and it crash again, no error just not responding
Actual Results:
Went to not-responding

Expected Results:
To be able to access web pages.

Note, I marked it a critical, a it wa crashing / non-responding. However, I don't know how widespread or how reproducible this will be, I still felt you should know about it.
