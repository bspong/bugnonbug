Firefox crash upon opening [@ RoboForm!DllUnregisterServer+0x2e300]
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; Tablet PC 2.0; InfoPath.2; MAXTHON 2.0)
Build Identifier: 3.1b2 (also I have the same bug in all the 3.0 version of Firefox)

After you install Firefox 3.0 (in any version) or the 3.1b2 firefox crash suddenly!!!

I had already installed in my computer Firefox 2.0 with several complements.

After the installation Firefox begin to search for the complement I have already installed and crash suddenly.

The only way to avoid the crash is excuting Firefox a Administrator, going directly to:

C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox 3.1 Beta 2

And doing right click on the: firefox.exe

And selecting in the menu Execute a Administrator

In that case Firefox 3.1b2 work fine.

But if you excute the program normally, crash immediately.

I tried to execute firefox a administrator, and then uninstall every add on. Even so, the program still crashing and it's impossible to use it!!!

The crash is so sudden, that is impossible the crash reporter come to ask for what happened and send the report to Mozilla.

This is frustrating
This is annoying
This don't happens in firefox 2 and yes in firefox 3
Someone screwed it up with the new version and it's impossible to use it!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the firefox direct access on the desktop
2. Immediately the program crash after a few second before to load any webpage
3.
Actual Results:
Just executing the program, immediately fails. This happens only when you have a last version of Firefox a the Firefox 2 in the computer.

Windows say that Firefox is not working anymore, and looking for available solution for the problem.

I have a laptop that never had firefox, installed the 3rd version of firefox and work fine, the problem is when you are using the 3.1b2 or any version of firefox 3.0 in a computer that had installed firefox 2 before.

Expected Results:
Just that the firefox work fine, a the 2nd version did.
