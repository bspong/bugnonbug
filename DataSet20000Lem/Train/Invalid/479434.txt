I like to clean out my cooky to get rid of crud from advertising site and generally keep thing nice.

However doing this requires I have to log back into facebook and reset other cooky that I didn't particular want to clear.

I suggest implementing a list of perma-cookies that allow for certain cooky to be kept by default (unless you tick the clear perma-cookies box in delete private info).



Why not simply use the white list that already exists, I hear you cry. Well that mean a major inconvenience whenever I visit other site that require cooky to use. I have to manually add these site of the list or disable my preferences. A list of perma cooky would allow for this a it doesn't affect day to day cookie collecting

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get annoyed at load of cooky
2. Clear cooky
3. Get annoyed at useful cooky being cleared
