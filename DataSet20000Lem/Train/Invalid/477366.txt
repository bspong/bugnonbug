I'm not sure if this is related to bug 462379. If it is, please excuse the dup.

When calling nsINavBookmarksService.createFolder or nsINavBookmarksService.insertBookmark from a worker thread, the following message is dumped to the error console: -

[JavaScript Error: "uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED) [nsIObserverService.notifyObservers]" nsresult: "0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED)" location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox%203.1%20Beta%202/components/nsPlacesDBFlush.js :: DBFlush_handleCompletion :: line 198" data: no]"]

The problem seems to occur intermittently. After a fresh restart, everything work fine, but after running the code a few times, the error start to occur.

I have experimented with and without runInBatchMode. Using runInBatchMode seems to generate le errors, but error are still dumped to the console.

The most worrying part is that Firefox abends after a while.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a worker that add a few folder and bookmark using nsINavBookmarksService.createFolder and nsINavBookmarksService.insertBookmark
Actual Results:
Dumps error to console and sometimes cause Firefox to abend

Expected Results:
Folders and bookmark should be added without error being dumped or Firefox abending.
