Firefox ha a serious dent when it come to loading webpages! Firefox need
to load webpage much more organized. By organized I mean that it should load
data(navigation bar and ads) at the margin that it is supposed to be in.

For example, if I load www.timesofindia.com, the navigation bar and ad
adjusts atleast 5X before it is completly settled. This doesn't happen in IE.

This bug play a Vital role for efficiency. Since the webpage are constantly
loading and readjusting no one can click the link because by the time you do,
it move somewhere else.
Although site like yahoo.com load corectly, there are countless others that
don't www.timesofindia.com and site with lot of navigation bar and side ad

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto www.timesfoindia.com
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The text and link move constantly before settling down

Expected Results:
All the frames, navigation bar and side ad load at the properspot (like in IE)

Only some website load this way ( i can't think of more website right now but
will update them soon) but you can try www.newgrounds.com but it's the most
appropiate site
