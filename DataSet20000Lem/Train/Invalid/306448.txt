wrongly interprets JavaScript code when page ha dos/windows end of line
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050822 Firefox/1.0.6 (Debian package 1.0.6-3)

Please compare these two sites:
http://skawina.eu.org/
http://jabba.uaznia.net/fenio
There are very similar and the only difference (except content) is that second
one is generated from some blogging software and end of line are crlf instead
of lf a in the Unix world. As you can see on the first page Google Ads don't
work. *Seems* that problem is related to the end of lines. Mozilla and Firefox
can't interpret this code properly. IE/Mozilla work fine with it.
The problem occures on Windows and Linux. I chose ALL for OS, but haven't had
opportunity to check MAC but I suppose that can be reproduced there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open http://jabba.uaznia.net/fenio
2.check JavaScript console
3.compare with http://skawina.eu.org/ which is almost identical site (xhtml/css)

Actual Results:
Google Ads (some JavaScript code) don't work on first step, but work on third.

Expected Results:
It should display ad in both cases.

I checked newly installed Mozilla-Suite, Mozilla Firefox from Debian packages.
To ensure problem isn't Debian related I also checked some version from your page.
The same problem occures on Windows98 + Firefox.
