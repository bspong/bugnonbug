Javascript - use of MaxLong ()constant generates syntax error.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I tried defining a maxlong value to see what number I would get (as double cannot hold the entire precision of a Java MaxLong). I
//var max_long = 9223372036854775807l;
var almost_max_long = 92233720368547758070 ;
var bigger_max_long = 92233720368547758072 ;

If I un-comment-out the max_long definition above, the javascript engine cannot parse the code. The number one above (almost_max_long) and below (bigger_max_long) can be parsed.

I tried using the value a a value in an object, and it too generated a syntax error.

For those keeping score at home, the bigger_max_long and almost_max_long turn into 92233720368547760000.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create javascript code containing the number 9223372036854775807l
2. try to run the code in firefox
3. see the syntax error
Actual Results:
Without firebug or equivalent, the javascript just will not parse or execute.

Expected Results:
i would expect that the max_long value would be handled without a syntax error. I understand rounding would occur, presumably yielding a number value such a 92233720368547760000. Actually, I would prefer if the number returned wa smaller than MaxLong - but I understand that is quibbling.
