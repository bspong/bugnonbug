I use a utility app called OnyX. After cleaning the internet cache or any related internet temp file or after a update of the Firefox 4 Beta, the browser will place icon for bookmarked website and RSS feed next to the wrong website. For example in my bookmark bar I'll see that Facebook ha the icon for Last.fm or my RSS feed for Hipsters United is displaying the icon for Mint.com instead of the default WordPress icon a usual.

1. Cleaning internet temp file or cache from external app or updating Firefox 4 Beta.

Actual Results:
Icons are appearing next to the wrong website.

Displayed different icons.
