bookmark created a child of the "All Bookmarks" folder do not appear in the "Recently Bookmarked" query

step to reproduce:

1) create a new profile
2) go to http://www.google.com
3) click the star
4) in the personal toolbar, under "Smart Bookmarks", verify that "Google" bookmark is under "Recently Bookmarked"
5) open the place organizer
6) cut and paste (since dnd doesn't work, see bug #405198) that bookmark from unfiled to under "all bookmarks".

expected results:

"Google" should appear in the personal toolbar, under "Smart Bookmarks", verify that "Google" bookmark is under "Recently Bookmarked"

actual results:

"Google" no longer appears in the personal toolbar, under "Smart Bookmarks", verify that "Google" bookmark is under "Recently Bookmarked"

alternatively, you could have just created a bookmark manually under the "All Bookmarks" folder.
