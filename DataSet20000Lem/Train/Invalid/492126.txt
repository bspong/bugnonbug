When the Tab Preference option "Open new window in a new tab instead" is set, any site that open a popup window will open it within the existing window a a new tab (instead of a popup).

The main firefox window will also be re-sized to the width and height of the popup, if one is specified. (causes a very disruptive browsing experience).

Started in Firefox 3.5b4

Reproducible: Always
