The FreeNAS project is hosted on SourceForge. They operate a phpbb forum.

Attempting to click on either the NewTopic button to start a new thread, or the PostReply button to reply in an existing thread, Aurora and Firefox 4.0 pop the redirect loop message.

I hit this first on Firefox 4. When I installed Aurora on a fresh profile the problem did not occur until after Aurora wa synced with my other browsers.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into SourceForge
2.Browse to the FreeNas Forum (url above).
3.Attempt to start a new thread, or reply to an existing thread.
Actual Results:
Redirect Warning Message

Expected Results:
A web form to post a comment.
