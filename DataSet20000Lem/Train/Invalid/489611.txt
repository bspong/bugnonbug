i find that when the pop up blocker and redirection blocker are enabled which is usually a good thing it slows down site such a logmein.com or other site that redirect you often also the password remember feature seems to work only half of the time and even then it won't show the change option when you type a new password in

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use log me on and do remete connection compare this load time to Safari 4 and it is pathetic firefox actually want to crash sometimes
2.
3.
Actual Results:
most of the time it take about 10 sec. to load, it ha crashed twice in the last week

Expected Results:
it should allow you to pick specific page not the whole site to allow redirection and pop ups

not a bug per say besides the crash but very annoying please try and at least tweak it
