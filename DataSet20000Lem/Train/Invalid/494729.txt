Problem 1) Shortly after I start Mozilla I get several "application changed, do
you wish to allow" message from windows. Happening for a few day

Problem 2) When I go from my home page (myembarq...) to the Embarq mail site Mozilla stop and go away; I must restart each time after I'm done with email. I changed the communication channel on my wireless router, and this started. Maybe coincidental?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.(Mail problem) start Mozilla
2.login to email
3.click "check mail"
Actual Results:
Mozilla stopped working and went away (no tag at bottom of screen to recall it)

Expected Results:
Mozilla should remain "in the background" with a tag at the bottom of the screen to call it up

The "application changed" message occurs several time right after I start Mozilla, and intermittently afterward. When it occurs, the message come up 2-3 time usually. It's been happening for a few days.
