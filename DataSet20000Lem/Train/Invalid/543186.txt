Firefox 3.6 unresponsive and unusable after leaving open and running java for long period caused by yahoo toolbar with message "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding..."

I have searched the bug already listed and there are some similarity but not anything that appears the same a what I see in 3.6.

Loading and using it is fine a start up. I use primarily Yahoo Mail and Facebook applications/games which are all fairly java heavy.

The issue occur when I leave the browser running for any length of time, it will throw a script unresposive message and then the rainbow busy cursor start and I then have to force quit Firefox.

I have reverted to 3.5 which doe not exhibit these issues.

I am just a user so any additonal information I need to provide, plesase let me know?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start browser
2.Go into Facebook, start Mousehunt, click to invoke a hunt, (java script?), leave browser running for 2 to 4 hours. (page refresh happens regularly) Get script error.
3.Firefox unresponsive and unrecoverable after waiting long period after either clicking both option (Continue or stop)
Actual Results:
Starting browser again it is responsive and work but seems slower (Page load etc) than intial start after booting iMac.

Expected Results:
A usable browser, having to continually force quit and restart is unacceptable, this make 3.6 unusable for me.
