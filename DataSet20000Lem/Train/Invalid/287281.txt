I could not just type a path in the widget you use for file selection.
I have to walk thru the stupid file tree doing a lot of scrolling and
mousclicking. Short of ditching gtk2 could you fix that menutil?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to some mail site like mail.yahoo.com or gmail.com
2. Compose a message
3. Attach a file: you have to do a lot of clicking a scrolling to get to the
right directory.

Actual Results:
I got really pissed after performing these step repeatedly

Expected Results:
I should be able to type in directory name and the freaking widget is supposed
to validate the path I typed. Or not.

Could you ditch gtk2 in favor of something that is
1. Fast
2. Is not annoying
3. Polished (Tk?)

Just look at the sheer number of gtk2 bug you have.
