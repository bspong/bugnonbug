When I downloaded the eBay toolbar and installed it, it installed only on I.E.;
it dod not install on my beloved Firefox. I need this on Firefox because FF

... eBay Toolbar is currently only compatible with Internet Explorer version
5.01 and above.

As eBay Toolbar is a browser helper object, it can only run in browser
that support this feature, which currently is just Internet Explorer.
Some browser are based upon Internet Explorer, such a the MSN
browser,but these still do not support the browser helper object feature and
assuch we are not able to create a version compatible with them....
...If you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reply to this email
and let u know.
