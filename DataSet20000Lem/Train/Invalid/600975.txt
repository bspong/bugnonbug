Update current exe manifest to include window 7 compatibility
Digging around in our manifest for firefox and the plugin container today, and noticed we don't have window 7 compat support set up. According to this msdn article

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd371711%28VS.85%29.aspx

this can effect various services, including:

RPC Default Thread Pool
DirectDraw Lock
DirectDraw Bit Block Transfer (Blt) to Primary without Clipping Window
GetOverlappedResult API
Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA)

(I think there's a bug on that last one filed someplace.)

We need to decide if we want to add win7 compat to our manifests.
