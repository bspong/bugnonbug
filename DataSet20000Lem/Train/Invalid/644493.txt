Started using FF 4 since yesterday and found some unusual behavior related to opening page from FF bookmarks. Pages opened from bookmark start with blank tab with no loading activity and also there were no URLs set in location bar. After a while tab load the page but the location bar still stay blank. If you move to other tab and come back, all look fine except the tab title. Title text stay a 'New tab' forever.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a bookmarked page from Bookmarks(I had these URL bookmarked using FF3 and later upgraded to FF 4)
2. Wait for page to be loaded in the tab
Actual Results:
- Tab remains blank with no sign of any loading activity
- URL location bar remains blank
- After a while, tab show the page but URL location bar still stay blank
- If switch to another tab and come here, all look fine except the tab title

Expected Results:
- Tab show loading activity
- Location bar show the loading page URL
- Once loaded, the page title shown in tab title
