This happens more with the Bookmarks menu and sometimes with the View menu where
you can click 2-4 time until you get a response(but it ha happened with other
menu a well). Then when you get a response it will cascade through the
command several time by highlighting the menu tab a many time a you clickd
the menu button until it finally open on the last clicked command. This also
seems to happen on link in web page from time to time needing to be clicked
twice in order to go to the linked page. The browser indicates that it's going
yet nothing is happening and then clicking the link again will make the page
load a it should. It's a if there is a delayed command issue somehwhere in
the works. Plus I've tried a few different mouse and there is no difference.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just through normal browsing every day
2.
3.



Expected Results:
Opened the menu tab or gone to the clicked upon link on the first command.
