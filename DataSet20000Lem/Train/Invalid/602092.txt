AeroPeek combine multiple instance of Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b6) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b6

I run two version of Firefox using a duplicate program folder and the -no-remote flag. This allows me to update them separately and make Windows 7 show them a two different taskbar items.

When I hover over either one, a combination of tab from both instance are shown instead of just the tab from that instance. Really it shouldn't even require a copy of the program folder. Just using -no-remote should give you two different list when using AeroPeek.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open Firefox using -no-remote
3. View AeroPeek on the Windows 7 taskbar.
Actual Results:
Tabs from the two instance are combined and appear in both AeroPeek menus.

Expected Results:
Only tab from that instance appear in the corresponding AeroPeek menu.
