No way to permanently disable the prompt to install a plugin (e.g. flash)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040402 Firefox/0.8

Thanks for the great browser.

Firefox (and since Phoenix) doe not allow one to permanently ignore plugins of
a certain type. I don't want flash on this system. When I visit a page with
flash functionality (e.g. http://www.lemond.fr), firefox pop open a dialog that
states:

******************************************************************************
This page contains information of a type (application/x-shockwave-flash) that
can only be viewed with the appropriate Plug-in.

Click OK to download Plugin

[CANCEL] [OK]
*********************************************************************************

so I spend a lot of my time clicking on these [CANCEL] boxes. I would like the
preference to remember that I never want to deal with flash so I can avoid
these popups.

This ha been bugging me for a long time but I figured you had more important
issues. Firefox is now so fantastic that I'm willing to burden you with this
enhancement request.

thanks again for your great work,
adrian


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Remove any flash plugin
2. Restart firefox
3. Visit http://www.lemonde.fr
=> a dialog will pop-up
There is no way to prevent this dialog from opening by telling firefox to ignore
all flash annimations (the way image can be blocked from certain sites)

Actual Results:
A dialog openned with no way to disable it without downloading the software

Expected Results:
Either a checkbox on the dialog (ignore all content of this type) or a
preference to set that same setting
