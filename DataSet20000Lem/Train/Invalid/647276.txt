I use yahoo and today it said to download a new version of Mozilla. After going thru the download it pop up saying it's not compatible with my security Kaspersky's http search protection. Had to re-download an earlier version of Mozilla to fix.

Reproducible: Didn't try




Every form of Mozilla should be completely compatible with Kaspersky for security reasons. I have happily used Mozilla for year now with no problems. This to me is a serious issue because it affect my computer security protection.
