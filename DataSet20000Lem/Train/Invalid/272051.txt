Whenever I open firefox, it freezes. I cannot use the browser anymore

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The browser freezes. After restarting the computer, restarting firefox,
uninstalling and reinstalling firefox, it still doe not work

Expected Results:
Fix the problem of the browser freezing so I can use firefox again. This
problem ha never occured before.

One of the most noticeable difference in the browser before I click any
button is that my searchbox size adjuster extension is not there anymore and
the size of the searchbox is the same size a without the extension. The
adblock icon is no longer there also. The toolbar button and the location bar
is also frozen. The crashing first started a a very rare occasion. However,
it ha gotten to the point that I cannot use it at all anymore.
