Important! This issue is aurora (firefox5) specific. I don't know about the beta.

I tried libflashplayer.so version 10.0 and 10.3
turned off every other extension and addon
deleted all the cooky (of this site)
with no effect whatsoever

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install aurora and flashplayer on your xfce linux machine
2.open aurora and get to ted.com
3.try playing a talk

Actual Results:
the flash appliction on the main page remained blank white
on a page with a talk in it I got the flash player not istalled
message

Expected Results:
on the main page should be a fancy display of the latest talk
on a talk page should be TED's own video player

Work flawlessly a in firefox4, etc.
