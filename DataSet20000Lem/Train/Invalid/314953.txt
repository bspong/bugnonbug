I've got Firefox set to open all new window in tabs. When I click on a sponsored link in GMail, a new tab open but fails to load anything. It also won't allow me to close the tab or quit the program normally. I'm forced to open a terminal window and do a kill on the process. This is in 1.5rc1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open gmail and select a message.
2. Click on one of the sponsored links.
Actual Results:
A non-responsive tab opens.

Expected Results:
A usable tab should open.

I've not yet upgraded Firefox on my window machine, I'll give that a go and see if it's a mac-specific problem.
