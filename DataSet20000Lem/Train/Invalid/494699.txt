http://www.mainz05.de/ crash on load if javascript is enabled. More precisely, the only mean I found to /not/ make the page crash wa to disable js, which however result in a page with not much content, so it possible that the cause for the crash is something other than j (i.e. post-loaded with Ajax).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.mainz05.de/
2. FF dy



1. FF say no crash dump wa created, and there wa no other indication of what precisely caused the crash.
2. Page cause FF to crash no matter regardless of whether the URL wa typed in, or a link from another page.
3. The website appears in the restore list. If not unchecked there, FF will immediately crash again.

Apologies for not being more precise than this. Its all I could figure out.
