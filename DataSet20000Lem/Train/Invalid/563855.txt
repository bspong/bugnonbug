I had just install a new Linux O/S and Firefox. No personalization were done yet at both. I wa browsing Ubuntu Foruns, when soon appeared a new window that looked like a "genuine" system security warning about a security issue, and asking to click a buttom for a system survey.
I disconnected my modem, and pressed ok. Then, a new Firefox window tab opened, showing graphical activity, similar to a virus scan.
I took a screenshot and hard disconnected the pc.
Next time I logged in, Firefox wa unable to get started.

Reproducible: Didn't try




Please note that together with being using a just installed linux o/s I wa visiting site that I use to visit, by routine, since I use Linux/Firefox (1 year). Never ever before, anywhere, anything (even far) similar, had happened.

So, this look like a vulnerability at Firefox, by the apparent easy manner how I wa targeted with the referred window while using a safe (Ubuntu Forum) site, and also because, even after disconnecting the net, Firefox opened a new window tab, showing graphical activity.

As it happened on a just installed system, I cannot information about loss of information.

The reason why Firefox did not start at next boot, may have been caused by the hard shut down or by the malware. Everything else, system wise, look ok.

For this reason I'll classify this a a security issue, with normal severity, that should be fixed.
