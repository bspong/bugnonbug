when i enabled script on this page(no other page normally have script enabled) gnome-settings daemon crashed
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b9) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b9

My display setting fell back to the default debian settings.

Reproducible: Didn't try




It basically crashed it all, i'm going to go back and check it upon a restart to see if it's done again. Also firefox is using 80% cpu currently and seems to be dying.
