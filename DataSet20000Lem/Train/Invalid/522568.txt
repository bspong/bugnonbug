I create a keyboard shortcut in the MacOS 10.4.11 Keyboard system preference for Page Setup... (shift-command-P). This is by default the Firefox shortcut for "Start Private Browsing".
When loaded, Firefox show the new shortcut next to "Page Setup..." but still try to Start Private Browsing when pressed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add "shift-command-P" to "All Applications" in System Preferences for the keyboard shortcut to "Page Setup..."
2. Load Firefox and look at File menu to see if the new shortcut is shown for Page Setup...
3. Try shift-command-P and verify that it try to start private browsing instead of Page Setup
Actual Results:
"Start Private Browsing" start instead

Expected Results:
"Page Setup..." should have been selected
