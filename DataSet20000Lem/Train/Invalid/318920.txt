Browser is extremely slow loading or downloading pics/files since upgrade to v.1.5
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Once I installed v.1.5 over the previous version the browser ha been dog slow. I can pull up same site in IE and see no problem. Downloading file or viewing picture is extremely slow anywhere you go. If I completely uninstall (thank you very much for the hassle of how it mess up my bookmark - causing me to spend considerable time rearranging them - thanks for nothing!), reinstall the previous version, everything is ok again. Install the latest again, problem come back. You really screwed this version up!!! And no, I'm NOT going to create another profile - you people should have been professional enough to make this work right the first time!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install v.1.5 - that's all you have to do - it's a dog!
2.
3.



Expected Results:
I expect the Firefox browser to work like before if not better than before when I install the latest version - duh!
