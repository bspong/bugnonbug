When using private browsing mode I am noticing the download history is showing in IE. What I am doing is when I see a "save as" link I right click and choose "open in new tab" which launch Windows Media player. The video plays, Windows Media Player is not showing the history however I check IE 7 and the site which I do download from are showing in the history. If I do not choose the "open in new tab" feature the history doe not show up. If the link launch IE7 the history show up a well (compared to playing it in the browser).
