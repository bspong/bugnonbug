BODY style='text-align: center' is honoured by inner text but not inner elements.

In fact I notice that text-align: center appears not to be honoured at all on
element (only on inner text) - is this intentional?

My reading of the W3C CSS spec is that this behaviour is wrong.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
</head>

<!-- Center entire content of page -->
<body style='text-align: center;'>

Some sample text

<table>
<caption>Table Centered in IE, Left aligned in Firefox</caption>
<tr>
<td>Cell 1</td><td>Cell 2</td>
</tr>
</table>

<!--
To quote part the W3C spec for 5.4.6 'text-align'

Example:

DIV.center { text-align: center }

Since 'text-align' inherits, all block-level element inside the 'DIV'
element with
'CLASS=center' will be centered. Note that alignment are relative to the
width of the element,
not the canvas.

Since the 'Some sample text' is centered across the page (in both browsers) the
width of the BODY tag
must be the window or canvas width, which mean the table should also be
centered and not left aligned.

</body>
