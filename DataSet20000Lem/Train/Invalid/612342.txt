Cross-origin window break the JSTerm Sandbox's ability to access property
From mrbkap in bug 611401:

> However, ddahl, I realized after our discussion on IRC that the reason this is
> failing is that we've decided that this window is cross-origin to the sandbox.
> Do you know why that would happen? Once this bug is fixed, I think that we'll
> see a bunch of stuff not work from the sandbox since the window is cross-origin
> and the sandbox won't be able to access most of the property on it. You might
> want to open a separate bug on that.
