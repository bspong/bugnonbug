By element with margins, I mean such thing a Blockquotes and Lists, each of which have a left margin. If these element were inline and made to wrap around a floating block, the margin would get ignored -- effectively, they would render no differently than any other plain text -- the margin (and bullets, in the case of Lists) would get overlapped by the floating block.

Reproducible: Always
