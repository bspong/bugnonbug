I tried to upload a video to Facebook using Firefox. When the window opened to select the video file I wanted to upload off of my computer, Firefox instantly crashed. I tested several thing and narrowed it down to having a large video file (bluray rip 15+GB) present. Chrome crash also under the same circumstances, but IE9 doe not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I went to http://www.facebook.com/video/?upload and selected upload.
2.When I view my "Videos" library in Windows 7 64bit and I have a large bluray rip (15+GB), Firefox instantly crashes.
3.If I remove the file, Firefox and the upload work fine.
Actual Results:
Instant crash

Expected Results:
Being able to select and upload a video.
