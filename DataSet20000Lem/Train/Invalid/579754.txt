Firefox 3.6.6 too slow

I am using Firefox since many year and I like it. Since a few week it becomes more and more a pain waiting for FF to display pages. This happens on nearly every page. For example ot take about 5-10 second between resolving the address and trying to connect. Name resolution work fine and fast on my machine.
I have a fast DSL line and Chrome display the same page very much faster.
I even set up a new profile in FF and used this without any improvement.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just go to the URL and wait
2.
3.


Expected Results:
I would expect the same spped a some time ago.

This problem may not necessarily be a bug but it is that annoying, that for the first time I downloaded another browser, Chrome did the job in normal speed.
