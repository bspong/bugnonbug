And also when I go to a previous page, I still can't use the "next page"-button.

1.open new tab
-there will be a green (but not working) "previous page"-button
2.visit a few webpage
3.click on the "previous page"-button
-the "next page"-button stay gray
Actual Results:
the "next page"- and "previous page"-buttons don't work

Expected Results:
at first display a gray "previous page"-button
and at last, the "next page"-button should turn green when a next page is available

I'm just using the default theme
