English word that have an "s" instead of the US "z", such a realise, not realize, and load more! appear a error and BritishEnglish dictionary AddOn suggests the American spelling to correct them.
Or, perhaps I have downloaded BritishEnglish dictionary dictionary AddOn and it doe not work?
There is no way I can see what AddOns are actually working or not working in FireFix, and I ought to be able to Enable and/or Disable any AddOns, oughtn't (?) I?

3.See resultant duff error message? Or, find out how to tell what AddOns are actually running at the time, and loaded with FireFox?

Expected Results:
No error in BritishEnglish dictionary / Spellchecker
ps, none of the language dictionary / spell checker seem to be able to cope with word from other languages, even though the other dictionary appear to be loaded: why is there not an option to spellcheck against a group of dictionaries, this is really needed for European user who tend to use several language quite often..unlike the USofA, the EU ha load and load of different languages!

There is no workaround for this, it can be a real pain.
