I've already reported this to PCT and it ha been forwarded to the people in the trench but when you run their DM clean operation it wipe out Firefox's customized toolbar settings. It would be nice to know what file those are in so that perhaps I could avoid cleaning that file.

Its more aggravating than anything because I clean every day.
