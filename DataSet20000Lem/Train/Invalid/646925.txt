Maximising the window totally break the UI

Maximising the Firefox window doesn't change anything at the UI layout. But when restarting Firefox in that state, the tab on top reach out of the window and are partly invisible. This is only reverted when the Firefox window is restored again and then restarted. As I'm on a notebook with an XGA display, I use application in fullscreen mode most of the time here.

Please tell me whether you need screenshots for this.

Reproducible: Always
