I only started experiencing this after upgrading to 3.0.4 build. Essentially, it seems that for all flash objects, the hover event is no longer being triggered. The easiest example of it is on youtube.com (any video really). Upon loading the page, hover over any of the button on the control bar. They won't respond. As a result, you cannot click pause because the player only allows you to do so when you hover it (which never get triggered).

I'm able to reproduce this in other flash object a well. In particular, the flash video player for my own company ha a control bar that show upon hover. This is no longer working (http://involver.com/).

Lastly, I should say the hover event is being triggered fine in other browser (Safari, Opera).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any YouTube video (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXaS2EQrX7Q)
2. Hover over anything in the control bar (e.g. pause button, volume, full screen button)
Actual Results:
None of the button respond at all to mouse hover.

Expected Results:
The control bar button should be responding to hovers. e.g:
- mouse change to a hand and button change to red color when hovering over the pause button
- volume control show when hovering over volume button
- full screen button animates and becomes red on hover

I am using the default theme. I test flash player many time a day (in particular my own), and I can safely say I only started to notice this bug right after Firefox updated itself to 3.0.4
