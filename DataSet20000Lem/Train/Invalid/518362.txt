A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: chrome://studioldfaceliftbasic/content/script-compiler.js:894

with two buttons: Continue script or Stop Script

when i click either stop or continue, the message box appears again and again until I close the tab of Facebook Home

Reproducible: Always
