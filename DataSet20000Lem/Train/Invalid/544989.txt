I updated to Image Zoom 0.4.3 today, and I'm having a few little problem with it.
First, the Firebug Button and also the lock symbol(don't know what that stand for) are vanishing.
Secondly, there is a grey line just above the bottom bar. You can click on it, hold the mouse button and drag it upward to hide the site you're looking at. Disabling Image Zoom solves this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Image Zoom 0.4.3 (and Firefox 3.6? Don't know for sure)
2.Open up Firefox

Actual Results:
As explained above, the button and symbol at the bottom right corner are vanishing and there is that movable grey line.
