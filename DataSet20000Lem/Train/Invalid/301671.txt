Text size and table alignement incorrect compared to IE6

At http://www.wtatour.com , if you look down on "MORE STORIES", the headline
look obviously larger than it "should be". In IE6, the text size blend in well.
I have to reduce text size three time to see the correct text size.

If you look here there's something wrong obviously. The table of ranking should
be aligned to the left and the number above the table
"1-100 101-200 201-300 301-400" etc.....

So far for this week, these are the only problem I've encountered.

OTHER THAN THAT, you guy rule! :)
IE6 sucks. Period. I hate it. You all know why.

Reproducible: Didn't try
