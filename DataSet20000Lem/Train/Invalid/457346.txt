if history is disabled we don't expire onAddURI
if we have expired history we stop doing partial expiration onAddURI because we return earlier in AddURI, instead we kick expiration in OnExpirationChanged.
What happens if the partial expiration is interrupted (browser close)? on browser restart the partial expiration will probably not kick in.

not a big deal though, especially if we move expiration to a background thread. But filing bug a a reminder.
