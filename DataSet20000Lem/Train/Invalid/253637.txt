firefoxsetup-0.9.2.exe possibly compromised, firefox installation caught listening to port
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: firefoxsetup-0.9.2.exe

The Firefox installation generated by file firefoxsetup-0.9.2.exe ha been
caught listening to port 2011, 2021, 2025, and 2030 (as reported by ZoneAlarm
Pro) the port listened to increment each time the browser is started. At
first I one of the add ons might have caused it. I isolated the test system
from the network, formatted the system partition, did a virgin install of
window 2k pro and ran firefoxsetup-0.9.2.exe and found it listening to ports.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.have software installed that can detect port listening
2.run the firefoxsetup-0.9.2.exe
3.run firefox

Actual Results:
firefox is shown to be listening to port 2011 on first run, terminate firefox
and upon restart listening to 2021, terminate/restart 2025, and
terminate/restart 2030. I assume it will keep increasing the port number on
each restart.

Expected Results:
Not be listening to ports!

NOTE THAT THUNDERBIRD-0.7.2.EXE INSTALLATION OF THUNDERBIRD WAS ALSO LISTENING
TO PORTS (However, I did not check it on a clean install)

I would suspect the installer a multiple package are involved.
