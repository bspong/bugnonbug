Certain RSS feed title using special character show up improperly

There are certain RSS feed (one in particular is http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/atom.xml) that cause Firefox to display some of the title improperly. This seems to occur when the title contains character such a an ampersand, single quote, double quote, etc... For example, there wa a recent title called "Great black & white, New York at night, & more" and it showed up in the RSS live bookmark a "Great black &amp; white, New York at night, &amp; more". I also see thing like &quot; in title that use quotes.

These HTML encoding should be auto converted to the appropriate character in the RSS live bookmark when it is displayed in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add an RSS feed a a live bookmark (you can use the following, where I've seen the issue occur: http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/atom.xml)
2. Look for a title within the feed that ha &amp; or &quot;

Actual Results:
Instead of seeing the actual character (i.e. &, ", '), I see the HTML encoding instead.

Expected Results:
I expect that these special character are AUTO converted to the correct character in the title that is displayed within Firefox instead of the HTML encoded version.

PLEASE FIX THIS! :-)
