The music player is displaced on the Myspace page when using Firefox but is positioned correctly in Internet Explorer. I am seeing this on more and more Myspace pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to your myspace account
2.Click on friend Tailgunner Joe and the Earls of Slander
3.See music player in the upper left-hand corner and black empty space where it should be.
Actual Results:
I tried this on several computer to see if it wa something unique to my computer. It is not. Firefox wa the only constant.

Expected Results:
The software should show an accurate presentation of the page. It doe not. At first I saw this only on this particular Myspace page but a I began exploring I started seeing it on several pages.

My computer ha been configured the same way for a year so don't think it ha anything to do with configuration. I can't remember when the latest Firefox update wa so can't say with certainty that it is related to that, though it could be.

I will answer below that it's a problem that should be fixed (normal) but I imagine to the people whose page are messed up, it's a pretty big deal.
