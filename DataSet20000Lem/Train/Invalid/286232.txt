popup link on the betanews.com site do not work correctly. (I have set my
prefs to allow popups from *.betanews.com).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.betanews.com
2. following down the right side of the screen, you will see a "View Changes",
"watch", and "ignore" icon next to the software titles. Click on one of these
links.
3.

Actual Results:
The popup show up in the original window a if it wa a normal link. This is
an issue because it doe not allow me to use the intended functionality. For
example, when clicking on "watch", I want to add the respective file to my watch
list. However, when the link is clicked, the new window doe not reflect my
"watched" software.

Expected Results:
Link should be displayed in a popup window.
