Send Link ... truncates URL at question mark character (emailing via Eudora)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Using File/Send Link ... on a page that contains a question mark in it URL
result in a mail message with a truncated URL. The truncation occurs at the
question mark. Many ASP or other actively-created page contain a question mark
a the delimiter for the page-specific data in the URL. I am using Eudora 6.2. I
have no other mail program to try it on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page with a '?' in it URL, such a
http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=170700839
2. Use File/Send Link ... to create an email message with the URL of the page.

Actual Results:
The URL in the message is truncated to
http://www.informationweek.com/showArticle.jhtml


Expected Results:
Put the entire URL into the message.

If this turn out to be a problem in Eudora and not Firefox, please let me know
at mscullin@htva.net so I can inform Qualcomm. Sorry I have no way to test othe
mailers.
I can work around this by Copying the URL to the clipboard, then using Send Link
to create a message, then replacing the short URL with the Copied one. If I
remember to check for a question mark.
