Having Adblock extension and filter rule for it updated by filterset.G updater extension cause a problem with firefox UI, or rather, OS resource depletion by it.

filterset.G updater extension keep up to date a huge list of blockable url pattern for Adblock extension.
With it installed, Adblock ha a pretty large list of filters.
All these are stored in a single pref line (in prefs.js). This line is really really very long.

involing about:config (to edit prefs) in Firefox having this setup cause OS crash.

What happens is that firefox open the config UI and try to create the imensely huge single line with all the filter for Adblock. This put too much strain on Win98 GUI resource and follows a OS crash, just good for the reset button. The resource meter app show resource going down to zero.

Happens every time on Win98SE. Not tested however on other OS.
