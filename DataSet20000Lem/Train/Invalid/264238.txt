I have had firefox on my computer for about two week with no problems. Last
night I cleaned out all the unused file from the computer using Smartbuster. I
then downloaded the latest update for AVG and spybot-S&D and ran those. After
that I ran scandisc in the thurough mode and defraged using power defrag. I went
to PC pitstop and ran system check there. Other than running a dated system
everything wa fine. This morning I turned it on checked my email accounts, read
my horoscope and in general surfed around a bit. I got out of the browser, got
off line and played a CD while in the shower. Got back on line used Thunderbird
to write two email then switched back to Firefox. I had to log on a a new user
and I couldn't get into the default area. Note I have been having problem with
IE6 not being able to download the latest update and replying to message in MSN
groups. I have also started using MSN,Yahoo and ICQ instant messenger with
trillian to control them.
