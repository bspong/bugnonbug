unable to shift-click to select item in Bookmarks sidebar
found using 2004-07-15-09-0.9 (branch) on Mac OS X 10.3.4. I can shift-click to
select a range of item in the History Sidebar, but I cannot do the same in the
Bookmarks Sidebar. not sure if this is expected behavior, but couldn't find an
existing bug on it.

found while running http://testrunner.mozilla.org/test.cgi#725

1. make sure you have more than three bookmark listed in the Bookmarks Sidebar.

2. click one (it'll load in the page).

3. shift-click another.

expected: the range between the item clicked in step 2 and 3 are selected.

actual results: the second point at which you shift-click (at step 3) just load
that second item in the web content.
