Firefox recently updated to version 3.6. Since then, it will not load any pages. It remains white usually, but sometimes give the "unable to connect" page. I tested my connection on google chrome, and it work fine.

Reproducible: Always




i have restarted Firefox, and my computer. I have also re-installed Firefox. i still receive this problem.
