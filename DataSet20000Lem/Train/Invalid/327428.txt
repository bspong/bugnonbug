i.e. on www.hifi-regler.de go to a product page and click on one of the linked icon that say "testsieger". a popup window open with additional information. unfortunately the window ha the wrong size and the text is unreadable, so i have to use IE6 instead :(



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

2. click on "see larger image".

Actual Results:
The popup window ha the wrong size, page get truncated(only half of the picture is visible). fortunately manual resizing is enabled here (but not always), so you can compensate manually to see the rest of the page.

popup window should have the right size, obviously ;-)
