Even though I have "Warn me when closing with multiple tab open", it doe not and FF doe not restore previous session when opening again. Used to work, now it hasn't for about 10 - 14 days.

Reproducible: Always

1. Open several tabs.
2. Close FF, it doe not ask to save.
3. Reopen FF and tab are not restored.
