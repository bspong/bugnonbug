Hi guys,

I understand there's a negotiate auth. patch, for firefox to look into apache
with kerberos ticket (either on win2k or on linux - or any other kerberos
platform). I've got modgssapache.sf.net installed in my apache, and it work
(with an MS AD a backend) on IE. Unfortunately firefox won't play - but I
understand there's a patch, that freebsd and Ubunto hoary ha integrated - and I
wa wondering what the plan are for including it in an official firefox release?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install modgssapache.sf.net and setup/config it.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
login not supported by firefox

Expected Results:
forwarding of kerberos ticket (to intranet servers).
See here for detail a how it works: http://www.onlamp.com/lpt/a/4171
