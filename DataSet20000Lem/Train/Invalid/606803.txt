add action indicator when dragging tab
since Bug 483776 wa wont fixed. i am opening a new bug with my comment from there.
when dragging tabs, usability and discoverability dictate that we should have visual feedback for the possible action and outcomes:
1. indication when the dragging operation is in action (possibly bug 455694, 485105)
2. "+" sign when using ctrl to clone tab
3. relevant indication for special drop zones:
a. disallowed (or no action) zone
b. when dropping on a button (e.g. home) it should get highlighted
c. dropping on a window folder should not highlight it, a it doe now
