When moving quickly around web site and clicking on items, such a scroll bars, before the previous command ha fully refreshed the screen, Firefox 2 will occasionally hang. Task manager show two firefox.exe task not responding when this happens, despite only one being visible. When it occurs, I usually have at least three tab open. This behaviour is new to Firefox 2.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose any site with many control - for me it happens mostly with etrade.com.au (stock trading site)
2. Make many fast action without waiting for refresh to complete
3. Watch it hang.
