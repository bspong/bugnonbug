I installed firefox-3.0 on my Ubuntu Gutsy (from the repos). When starting the new version, it copy the old ~/.mozilla/firefox directory to firefox-3 directory.

But my bookmark didn't convert over. Everything is blank. The sqlite file appears to be fine a I wa able to open it and view the schema, but no data.

I'll attach my bookmarks.html file

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.copy firefox-2 profile folder (~/.mozilla/firefox/ to new profile folder (~/.mozilla/firefox-3)
2. start firefox-3.0 from command line -- give notice it is converting old profile
3. once open, no bookmark
Actual Results:
No bookmark are converted

Expected Results:
Convert bookmark to new places.sqlite database

I'm not sure if this is an Ubuntu packaging problem or not, but it seems like all the Ubuntu stuff doe is copy the folder.
