Firefox ver 1.5.0.7 truncates java applet window at pogo.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060921 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060921 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.7

I just downloaded Firefox 1.5.0.7 on 9/23/2006 via Ubuntu Dapper apt-get
and via Firefox aut-notify on Windows a few day before.
That is when the symptom (truncated java applet screens) began on both machine at the same time. This is 100% repeatable in both environments. Nearly every applet at pogo.com is affected.

This symptom wa not present in version 1.5.0.6 in both environments.

Note that both Windows and Linux are kept up to date.
The Java version (Sun JDK 1.5.0_06-b05) is the same on both environment and hasn't changed in a few months.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to pogo.com
2. Register a a free user.
3. Try to play Dominoes with Firefox 1.5.0.7.

Play with an older version of Firefox or M$ IE and the symptom doe not appear.

Actual Results:
Truncated applet screen

Expected Results:
Normal applet screen which you can see using Firefox 1.5.0.6
