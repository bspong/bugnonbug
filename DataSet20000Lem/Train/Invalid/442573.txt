Before you say, 'this is a website problem', or 'this is a flash problem', I am not getting this bug on IE6, IE7, Firefox 2.0 on OS X, Safari, Webkit, or Opera.

I created the flash content myself, so if it is deemed relevant I shall include the source code of that, although I have noticed this bug on other players, most notable is http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_FLV_Player
