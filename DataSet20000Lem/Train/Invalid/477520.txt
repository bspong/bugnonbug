CSS import no longer working for file other than .css

version 1 and version 2 of firefox allow this:
<style type="text/css">@import url(styles.css);</style>
<style type="text/css">@import url(stylesscript.aspx);</style>

however version 3 doesnt no longer allow
<style type="text/css">@import url(stylesscript.aspx);</style>
doesnt allow displaying of style from file other than .css

All other browsers, opera, safari, IE, chrome work using both methods. What ha changed between version 2 and 3? This is logical usage a the stylesheet may change dynamically depending on time of day which is the best example of usage i can provide.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
should pull in style sheet which is printed by the aspx or other scripting.
