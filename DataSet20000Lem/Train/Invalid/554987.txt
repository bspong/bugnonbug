Layout size is not the same for identical page hosted at 2 other URLs

I am preparing a new blog entry at the public URL above. I have two copies, called "sandboxes", on different URLs, which are private and I cannot share. I have 3 different size layout for what should be the same page, assuring that the window are all the same size. The font size and a banner at the top of the page are all proportional, but different scales. The text break are different among the three pages. Page editing for size and layout is all but impossible.
If I open the same three page with Safari in identically sized windows, all three page are identical in size and breaks.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Post identical page on different URLs with varying text size and perhaps a banner.
2. Open all page from the different URLs, and size the window the same.
3. Observe that the apparent font size, banner size, text breaks, and line spacing are proportioinal, but not the same.
Actual Results:
Identical page on different Firefox window have different scales. This not true with Safari.

Expected Results:
For most users, this is a trivial problem, so I reported it a "normal". For doing layout, however, it make Firefox unsuitable.
