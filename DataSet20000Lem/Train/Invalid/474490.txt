No icon for Firefox application

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011912 Firefox/3.0.6

During smoketests I recognized that the Firefox application icon is not shown, when having a Finder window open and doing a D&D of the Firefox icon to the Application icon inside the dmg file.

Steps:
1. Open a Finder window and go to Applications
2. Open the dmg image
3. D&D the Firefox icon to the application icon within the open dmg window
4. Wait until copying ha been finished

After step 4 you will notice that the Firefox application icon is not shown inside the Finder window. See the attached screenshot too. You can close the Finder window and open a new one, which won't help. I wasn't able to show up the icon.

This bug doesn't happen if no Finder window is open or at least the application folder is not selected.

So I think this is probably an OS X bug a some bogus behavior on our side.
