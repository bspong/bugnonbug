Just installed Firefox 4.0 on my Windows 7 system. When i load it, it ha 2 tab preload and when it opens, on the taskbar, it is showing a if i had opened 2 Firefox Browsers opened at the same time, which would make people think they have extra browser opening and try to close it down, a one would assume it is using memory. Previous version 3.6, just would show one browser open even if 5 tab were open in that browser.
Just helping out this beta.
Regards.
