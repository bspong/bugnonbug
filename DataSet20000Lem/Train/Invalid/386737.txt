i had about 10 tab open and clicked on a link on the last tab. instead of opening the link in a new tab it went to tab number 2 or 3 and opened the link there. to work around i went to that tab and hit the back button and then went back to link and right clicked and chose open in new tab. it worked correctly at that time.
