Good Day

I accumulated about twenty TalkBack report that I submitted a crash bugs. Two were not associated with the majority:

TB14934551M
TB15052528Q

The information that I received was:

" please file a new bug for that pair signature for that pair is: libgamin-1.so.0 + 0xfd8 (0x4285dfd8) ..
nsGNOMERegistry::GetFromType() "

I apologise but I am out of my depth knowing what the above means.

Hope they help.
