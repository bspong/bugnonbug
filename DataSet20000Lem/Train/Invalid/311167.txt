table border tag handled inconsistently; sometimes an ="0" is 0, sometimes an ="0" show up a a black outline.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla 5.0 v. 1.0.7

Again, the inconsistency is such, that sometimes a table with "0" tablespacing
will show up normally, and sometimes it will have a thick black outline around
each cell in the table. The black outline doe NOT appear in MS IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a page with table
2. sometimes they are okay (when the cell are filled in with color)
3. sometimes there are thick black outline ignoring the tablespacing ="0" code.

Actual Results:
thick black line around the cell in a table.

Expected Results:
followed the code, which clearly stated tablespacing="0"

This doesn't appear to be a "standards" issue, a the code is correct, and
appears properly in both Netscape and IE.
