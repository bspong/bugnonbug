I am not able to add the German, secure.wikimedia.org version of Wikipedia to my search bar. OpenSearch is present and it work using Firefox 3.6, but not Firefox 4. For some reason this only happens with the German version of Wikipedia.

Important: There is a known problem, which cause similar behaviour. You can't add the secure version of Wikipedia, if you already have added the non-secure version. The reason seems to be a naming overlap. Maybe this should also be fixed, but I guess an other bug report should be opened for this.

I don't know about the inner workings, but is it possible that the entry somehow stay present, but get hidden (for the reset option to work for example)? This could cause the name overlap to still be present.

I also tried this on GNU/Linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Maybe one should use the German version of Firefox (and Wikipedia) for this, I haven't tried it with others yet. It could be possible that it only occurs if both the Firefox and Wikipedia are the same language.

1. Load https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/wiki/Wikipedia:Hauptseite
2. Remove the original Wikipedia entry from the search bar
Actual Results:
No 'Wikipedia (de) hinzufügen' is present.

Expected Results:
'Wikipedia (de) hinzufügen' should be present.
