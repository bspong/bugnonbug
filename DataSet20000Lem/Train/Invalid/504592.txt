View source window simply say '<window id="viewSource" ^' for the source of any website.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5

When I try to view the source of any website (from the right-click dropdown menu or View -> Page Source) All I see is a window that say

<window id="viewSource"
^

The window that that message display in is narrower than the message itself and there is a box that the message is in. All the text and the box itself are red.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click on a page
2. Select View Source
Actual Results:
I see

<window id="viewSource"
^

in a box with a red border

Expected Results:
The source of the page should have appeared.

My Add-ons are
DownloadThemAll 1.1.4,
Firebug 1.4.0b7,
Ubiquity 0.5, and
User Agent Switcher 0.7.2

When I try to view the source with Firebug's HTML pane, it simply stay blank.
