I have been using Firefox browser v3.0.5 for the last year on my Desk-top PC running Windows XP Profesional. However I have now purchased a Lap-top that run Windows Vista and the software wa operating smoothly until I installed the latest McAfee Security Centre application (not on my Desk-top)where every time I type in a new web address an ERROR MESSAGE is produced saying 'Javascript Application on Lookup Failed 551', before it crashes.
When I use other browser on this Lap-top such a Chrome, Safari & WIExplorer they all function ok.
ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS BUG AND DO YOU HAVE A FIX YOU CAN E-MAIL ME?
