Error report on start up, every time. Sometimes repeat - see below.

Each time I start Firefox I get the following error report:

"getPlusPlus_Adobe_reg_bootstrap.exe ha encountered a problem and need to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience."

I will also get this on other occasions, such a when I open a Yahoo! video via "http://ca.yahoo.com/" and then offer to send/not send error report to Microsoft.

The browser open and seems to function okay . . . this is more of an annoyance than anything.

As I don't have this issue with IE, I presume there is some form of incompatibility with Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Browser
2.Open Yahoo! Videos

I have the same result with different theme and have not made any recent significant reconfigurations to my computer. However, installing Adobe Flash Player 10 wa a hassle in both IE and Firefox and it seems to me that the issue began after the install. The Adobe website wa unresponsive at time and seemed to be set up to direct me to overview a variety of their other software program before allowing me to upgrade Flash Player.

I perform daily scan for spyware & viruses, with low level tracking cooky being all that show up.
