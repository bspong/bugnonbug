By default, Firefox disable online website to reach local files. But there is
some non-evil website providing "Skin pack": the user download all the skin
files, and the website try to load them with a <img
src="file:///c/website/skin/pic.jpg" />. It's better for the server and the user...
So there is the security.checkloadURI pref to enable this feature, but it
doesn't work when it's set to false (disabling security protection).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In about:config or prefs.js, set the security.checkloadURI value to false
2. Subscribe to a online-game (like ogame.de or ogame.fr, sorry I don't know
english equivalent) wich provide some "Skin packs" or upload a HTML containing
the code in "Additional Information" (if you do this, you have to put a pic.jpg
file in c:\test\)
3. Load the webpage
Actual Results:
Firefox doesn't show local pic

Expected Results:
Firefox should show these when security.checkloadURI is set to false
