After installing Speed Dial, it failed to work when I tried to synchronize a laptop with a PC
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Under Bookmarks there is an option to select a Speed Dial # (1-9) to the site that is up, but no option for retrieving any of the selection associated with the numbers. Also the key command (ctrl i, for instance) toggle between the full window for Firefox and the window with the bookmark on the left, instead of bringing up the bookmark and number (1-9) window.

Reproducible: Always
