Crash when using DOM against an event containing multiple line of Javascript
We have encountered a situation that result in consistent crash in all
current Mozilla based browsers. This issue appears to be occuring when we use
the DOM level 2 manipulation function against a tag that ha an event
containing Javascript that ha newlines in it - therefore spanning multiple lines.

It would be my guess that this non-standard Javascript implementation is not
being handled properly by the parser and the visible result is in a hung page
request resulting in a browser crash after some small period of time.
