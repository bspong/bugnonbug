Hi,
I am using "User Agent switcher" & "Web Developer" add-in's, they work fine when they are run individually,
but when i activate my user agent with some phone and then try to use the "web Developer" for more details, the system doesn't respond to "web Dev" add-in.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install "User Agent switcher" & "Web Developer" add-in's
2.select any phone model with "User Agent switcher" and browse
3.try selecting any component from "Web Developer" add-in, it doesn't work
