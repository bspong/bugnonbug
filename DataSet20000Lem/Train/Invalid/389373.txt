flickering in the urlbar after typing URLs without protocol
Be sure browser.urlbar.hideProtocols is set to http.

Steps:

1. type a url without protocol like mozilla.org
2. watch the completion of it to http://www.mozilla.org/
3. http:// vanishes afterwards due to the pref

This is very distracting and the visible completion to http://www.mozilla.org/ should be skipped, when it's clear that the protocol isn't shown anyway.
