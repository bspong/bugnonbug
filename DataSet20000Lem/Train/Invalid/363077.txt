Hi folks, I recently upgraded to 2.0 on Windows XP and Linux (Debian). On both operating system I have the problem that Firefox show a great delay when I change, open or close tabs. It just stop working for ca. two to five second until it reacts again to user input. This happens with only two open tab a well a more then ten or more.

Thx and cheers, Markus

Reproducible: Always
