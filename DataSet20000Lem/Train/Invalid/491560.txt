On the mac platform, command backtick should cycle though open windows. In 3.5 beta 4, it will bring the main window forward, but stop cycling after that. It can't be used to get back to other window (like the download window). This is true whethe the second window is a download window, or just another browser window...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.5 beta 4 on a Mac
2. Press Command-J to bring up the download window
3. Press Command-` to cycle to the main window
4. Press Command-` to cycle back to the download window
Actual Results:
The download window remains stuck behind the main window.

Expected Results:
After step four, the download window should be in front.

This is a regression.
