I am the extension author of HTML Validator
> http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/

One of my feature is not working. And I am looking for help or to get a fix.
In short the XHTML transformed in HTML inside Firefox memory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the extension here
http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/download.html
Restart Firefox
2. Go to this page
http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/sample/jsample4.html
It is a sample page with Javascript creating a tag.
3. Do view Page Source, you will see the original page ha no error
4. Come back to the browser and right click on the icon of the extension in the toolbar and choose Advanced / Validate Now.
You can also do CTRL+SHIFT+A
Actual Results:
The page is in XHTML originally
What you see is that all <br/> are transformed to <br>
in memory (doc.innerHTML)



Expected Results:
1. Is it normal and I should correct my extension to understand that the innerHTML is in HTML 4.0.1
2. Or is it a bug ?

Thanks
