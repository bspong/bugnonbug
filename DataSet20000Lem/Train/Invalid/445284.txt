Loaded up Vista, browsed site with built in IE. Noticed much faster than FF3. So a general improvement need to be made by Firefox folks, on SPEED optimizations. I know the variable - cache size, Operating system used (my FF is on XP), add-on in FF slowing down operation etc. But noticed even with multiple tab opened in IE, it wa faster in page rendition than FF3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start window Vista
2.open IE
3.browse to a site
4.Open Firefox, browse to same site, notice speed. Maybe le noticeable on very fast computers/hard drives. On my 1.3Ghz it noticeable. Flush cache, turn off plug-ins.



General speed improvement in Firefox would be appreciated. Code Optimization specialist needed to be consulted.
