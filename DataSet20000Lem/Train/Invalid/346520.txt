continuo hard-disc access if firefox is loaded

Since the last version (1.5.0.5) i have a continuo hard-disk access to the profile directory caused by firefox.exe. (The HDD-led is flashing all the time)

Closing firefox doe not help, because the process firefox.exe remains still in the taskmanager. Killing this process solves the problem.


Reproducible: Always
