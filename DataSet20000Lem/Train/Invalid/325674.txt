Began last week. First occurred when trying to go to a secure site, https: segment of a bank url. Disappeared the next day and I had no further problems. Today, however, I cannot connect with any site. www.netscape.com is the homepage. Bookmarks don't connect. On each I get the same error message: Server not found













Firefox can't find the server at www.netscape.com.








* Check the address for typing error such a
ww.example.com instead of
www.example.com

* If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
connection.

* If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Try Again button. Same result.
2. Click on bookmark for another url. Same result
3. Restart computer and attempt to connect. Same result

Actual Results:
Server not found













Firefox can't find the server at www.netscape.com.

that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

Expected Results:
That I would connect to the url I'm trying to reach.

I didn't install any new hardware or software. When it "crashed" completely today, I had just been prompted to install the new update, a I have that feature checked in my preferences. It "crashed" during installation in that it wa directing itself to a url and could not connect. Same error message again appeared: Server not found













Firefox can't find the server at www.netscape.com.

So, then I used another browser to access the Mozilla site and download the 1.5.0.1 installation file. Downloaded that and installed it. Attempted to use the browser and it still doe not work. Still get the exact same error message. Shut down the computer and tried again. Same result. Something appears to be blocking the browser's ability to access the internet. Only blocking Firefox a the Microsoft IE that I also have installed on my computer work fine. That is the brolwser I'm using to file this report.
