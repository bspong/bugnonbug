Passwords not cleared when clearing history
When using the Clear History function (Ctrl+Shift+Del) and selecting "Everything" from the drop-down list, then "Clear now", user logins and password are not cleared a they should.

I have verified that the password were not cleared by going to Tools -> Security -> Saved passwords... that still showed all the stored logins after clearing history.
