Browser crash when accessing URL. Can't execute java_vm
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10.1

I would have thought this wa a Mozilla bug, but cannot replicate with Mozilla.

The URL open a java dialog box. Could not replicate the problem on Mozilla 1.7
or 1.8a5. Could replicate issue with new ~/.mozilla using FireFox. Played with
turning off the popup blocker option with no success. Noted this error in
.xsession-errors:


INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Exec of "java_vm" failed: 2
<
System error?:: No such file or directory
INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Could not read ack from child process
System error?:: Resource temporarily unavailable

Could not find anything java-specific in the wrapper with traditional Mozilla
versions.

Possibly an environmental variable is needed to be set for java (j2re) in the
wrapper script?


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to open in Firefox .10
"http://h18023.www1.hp.com/support/files/server/us/download/21102.html"

2. Opened URL in Mozilla 1.7 and Mozilla 1.8.a5, received java dialog window.
3. Removed ~/.mozilla started Firefox again on problem URL.

Actual Results:
Browser crash.

Expected Results:
Java dialog box querying for acceptance of a certificate.
