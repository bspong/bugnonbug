When a DTD is present (HTML 4.01 Transitional or XHTML 1.0) Firefox reports:
Error in parsing value for property 'left'. Declaration dropped.
Error in parsing value for property 'top'. Declaration dropped.
If DTD omitted, no error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load page
2. click small icon at bottom of a concept symbol
Actual Results:
popup always appears in upper left corner of window

Expected Results:
popup appears at cursor location where icon wa clicked

1. Works a expected if DTD is removed from the page.
See: <URL: http://www.enfolded.info/cmaps/maps/ue_fig_01.htm >.
2. Works with DTD correctly in Opera 9.23
3. FWIW, in IE7 popup appears offset from expected location by amount of scroll
