This is a typical "base href" comment, found in the <head> element:

<!-- base href="http://www.foo.bar/" -->

When the base-href comment is broken, such as:

<!-- base -- href = "http://www.foo.bar/" -->

Firefox ignores the "<!--" and render the comment a part of the page (usually
displayed at the top of all page content)

You can work around it by putting something infront of the "base" keyword, it
seems Firefox look for "<!-- base" in HTML documents, so by breaking this, it
doesn't appear

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create any old HTML document (I used XHTML1.1)
2. Put "<!-- base href="http://www.foo.bar/" -->" in your <head> to tell the UA
what the default base to truncated HREF'd URIs are
3. Render... it look fine
4. Replace the comment with "<!-- base -- href = "http://www.foo.bar/" -->"
5. Render....you'll notice that "-- base -- href = "http://www.foo.bar/" -->"
appear at the top of the page

Actual Results:
The string "-- base -- href = "http://www.foo.bar/" -->" appear at the top of
the page

Expected Results:
Firefox is supposed to treat it a a comment if the string is broken or poorly
formed, rather than rendering it
