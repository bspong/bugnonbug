Saying that installing to a wrong path
When I start the installer (./firefox-installer), I made rapidely next next...
and I realized that I wa installing in a wrong folder. So I clicked back, I
changed the folder and I click next... And it is written Setup will
install......... in the following location : "/first/path/to/install/"
So it writes the first path I have selected, and not the new one !
