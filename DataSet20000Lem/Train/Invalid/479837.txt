The ambiguity of a Selected folder and/or subfolders and the ability to choose either should be cleared up, suggest making the following change to the scope selection that appears only after first making a Library search:
Search: Selected Folder (only), Selected Folder & all subfolders, All Bookmarks, History

The selected folder(s) on the left should remain in view without having to scroll the left side to see what it was. Sometimes the indication even disappears.

Also the item count summary at the bottom should make thing clear, especially when/whether subfolders are included. When subfolders are included the the second line would also be shown.
3 folders, 29 non folder in selected folder
13 folders, 839 non folder in selected folder and subfolders

The current summary would show 32 items, I expect that after bug 451151 is fixed it would show 852 (either way you would not know how many are bookmarks)

Unless you display the "Parent folder" column in the library listing it is very difficult to tell what you are actually finding. "Show Parent Folder" - https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/7372



Reproducible: Always




bug 451151 attempt to resolve scope of search, but don't think it would provide user with information about the actual scope of the search. There is no F1 - Help so no way to even see what the intent is. User may want to search only the selected folder, or may want to selected folder and all subfolders.
