I pulled a tab to create a window and the content of the tab stayed on my screen afterwards
Created attachment 349969
pulled tab can be still be seen

I cannot reproduce again but I was:
1) looking at a tinderbox log that wa still loading
2) pulled unintentionally the tab
3) it showed the content of the tab a I wa dragging it around
4) when I let it go, it became a new window
5) the mini-viewing of the content of the tab wa left on my screen
6) this wa fixed by pulling another tab and therefore the browser had to redraw the content
