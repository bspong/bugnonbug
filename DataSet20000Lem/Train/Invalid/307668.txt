Firefox PPC in Mac OS X not optimized at all

It is ha been shown that the new Apple developer computer based on INtel chip
run Tiger with an emulator called Rosetta for PPC coded softwares. This
emulator run the software natively in the system and translate PPC code into
x86 code on the fly, so there is a loss of speed of around 20-30 %.

But with Firefox running via Rosetta it is faster than directly under PPC ! So
it is really clear that the Mac OS X PPC version of Firefox it is really not
optimized at all.

Reproducible: Always
