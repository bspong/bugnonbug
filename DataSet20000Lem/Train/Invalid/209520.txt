strange behaviour when selecting a previously visited URL from the address bar's drop-down
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030611 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

When I select a URL from the drop-down list of previously visited sites,
occasionally a new tab will be opened without me requesting one. Instead of
opening the page that I wanted to view (in either the new tab or the original
one), the new tab will instead go to http://download.statsurfing.com - a site
that I had never visited until Firebird starting opening it randomly!

This behaviour doesn't manifest everytime I select from the drop-down, nor doe
it happen with any specific URL that I want to visit.
