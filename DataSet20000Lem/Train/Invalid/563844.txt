Hello,
Why you can not block some site to be displayed on your browser, I mean that, the only option I found on the Mozilla Firefox Configuration Dialog about block sites, Is to block site reported a attackers, First question that come to me is that How doe it work?, Is there any company looking for attacker Websites or What, and Second and more important, Who are them and why them can decide which page can I display and which not, and on the other hand why I'm unable to do it (I mean to block site such a foken yahoo) if I want, Don't you think you're forgetting the old principle of the free software? Make Software which give the people freedom to make what they want to do and not to subjugate people to what a company or whoever is behind this real threat, want to do or will be capable of do.
Cheers.
