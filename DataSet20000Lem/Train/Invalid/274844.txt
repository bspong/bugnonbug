Proxy setting default to localhost:8080. Changing to manual work until browser
is shut down, then it reverts to localhost:8080 when started again.

Upgraded to 1.0 and reinstalled switch proxy extension. Would not come up with
correct proxy on startup so removed extension. Still will not come back the way
it wa shut down.

With both proxy disabled, browser come up with a manual configuration. I have
tried deleting the entry and setting the port to 0 before switching to direct
connection, but it doesn't work. I have tried my second proxy which us port
8999, but when the browser is started again it default to localhost:8080.

This occurs on two PCs, both running XP SP2. One is an English PC the other one
Korean. This also sometimes happens on my Mac OS X, but is not fully
duplicatable like it is on the PC.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browser, get message cannot find page with selected browser.
2. Open configuration and change from default manual configuration (localhost:8080)
3. Browser work fine during session
4. Close browser.
5. Open browser and it repeat the same error.
6. Check configuration, ha reverted to manual localhost:8080

Actual Results:
Unable to access web until I manually turn off proxy configuration, or change
port to 8999.

Expected Results:
It shoud keep the configuration I set before closing browser

Using default theme with SpoofStick and ViewCookies extension installed.
