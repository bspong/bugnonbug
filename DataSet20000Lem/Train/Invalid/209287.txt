Scrolling when using the page down key should be a clean crisp one page down.
However it is choppy with a delay in between. This result in getting a bit dizzy
LOL

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.just hit the page down key, (my mouse is also set to do a page down)(Intellimouse)
2.
3.



Expected Results:
Just cleaning go down one page with no chop delays. So the page just flick to
the next position. click flick. click flick. :-)
