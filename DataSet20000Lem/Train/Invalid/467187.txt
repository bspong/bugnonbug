I opened 6 tab with different webpage and waited for them to all finish loading. Left browser sitting for over an hour to let it just idle. Opened the same webpages, in the same order, in Internet Explorer 6.0, and waited a similar amount of time. Peak Memory Usage in FireFox is TWICE that of Internet Explorer, which is horrendous considering how old that browser is. Also, idle (current) memory usage is almost 25% higher between the two.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the following URLs (in Safe Mode), one in each Tab, in this order:
http://www.myspace.com/
http://www.head-fi.org/
http://www.gmail.com/
http://www.discover.com/
http://www.capitalone.com/
https://www.bankofamerica.com/

2. Wait for all page to finish loading, paying attention to active content (Java etc) to make sure those are done loading a well.

3. Do the same in any other browser (testing in this caase wa done via Internet Explorer 6.0) -- notable difference is each webpage wa loaded in a different WINDOW, a IE 6.x doesn't support Tabbed Browsing, however a stated the order in which the page were opened wa the same.

3. View memory usage in Windows Task Manager or other similar application, noting difference(s) between the two browser
Actual Results:
Watch memory usage climb well above that of IE 6.x loading the same page in same order

Expected Results:
Memory usage should be much lower than this a browser a outdated and inefficient a IE 6.x
