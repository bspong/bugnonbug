When running Firefox 3.0.2 with DownThemAll 1.0.3 and a download dialog box pop up, some of the content in the box get cut off since the dialog box doe not get to expand. When running in safe mode, there is no issue, which I assume is because there is no extra content/options added to the box. Since DownThemAll add one or two extra option to the download dialog box, the Ok and Cancel button can either be cut off or missing entirely, depending on the type of file that is being downloaded.

This did not happen in Firefox 3.0.1 and before, since the dialog box would resize itself to fit the content added to it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install DownThemAll! 1.0.3
2. Download a file
3. Observe part or all of the Ok and Cancel button being missing from the download dialog box
Actual Results:
The expected result of partially missing (cut off) Ok and Cancel button on the download dialog box.

Expected Results:
The dialog box to resize to accommodate the added option in the dialog box.
