"Send Link" doe not work-Causes cascading IE error message

The "Send Link" tab used to always work to with Outlook but suddenly doe not any longer. I have always been able to hit send link and a hypertext link would appear in an Outlook dialogue email page ready for me to input "To" and "Subject" info so that I could email the link. Now, when I use the "Send Link" tab it freeze the page whose URL link I wish to send via Outlook and open up a cascading IE tab on the bottom tool bar referencing a number of IE error messages. I uninstalled latest 2.0 version and reinstalled 2.0 with no success. I uninstalled 2.0 and reinstalled 1.5 with no success. I've read on the forum similar problem but there are no discussion of fixes.

Would appreciate your reply and a fix.

I love Firefox. I have used it solely for quite some time.

Keep up the good work.
