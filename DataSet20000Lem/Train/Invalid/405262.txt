Firefox fails to consider certain font
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; ; Linux i686; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko Epiphany/2.20
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071004 Iceweasel/2.0.0.8 (Debian-2.0.0.8-1)

Firefox doesn't seem to be able to use
certain fonts, including "times new roman", "nimbus roman no9 l" and
"nimbus mono l".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I have attached a test case that should demonstrate the problem--open
it, scroll down and check out the text flagged in red.
Actual Results:
Note that the font that the text is rendered in is the same a the default 'serif'
fallback font. I'll attach a screenshot too.

Expected Results:
The correct font should have been chosen.
