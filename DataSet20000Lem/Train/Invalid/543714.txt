When I write a link in the addressbar, I can't click enter to go to the site, have to click on the blue arrow with the mouse.
When I use the dropdown, to go to website I use often, I again have to click on the blue arrow, a firefox dosn't load the site when I click the link in the dropdown menu.
Firefox just began running that way when I turned on my computer today, yesterday it worked fine.
