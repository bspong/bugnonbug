Fail to locate or load image if the folder name contains an underscore
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I'm a developer for a website on a Linux server, and I had to load a 1x1 pixel on repeat to use a a background. I also had to load other pictures.


Actual results:

When I declared in my cs file

background-image: url("/images/ad_gallery/image.jpg");

the background failed to show up. It worked when using IE9, Chrome, and Opera. Additionally, other picture in the same folder also failed to display.


Expected results:

The picture should have displayed. When using Firebug, Firebug say there wa no issue locating the image(s). However, the image failed to display in Firefox. Recreating/renaming the folder to "images/adgallery/image.jpg" resolved the issue.
