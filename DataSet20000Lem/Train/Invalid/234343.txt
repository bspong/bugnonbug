Buttons in dialog strangely alinged under linux

Pre firefox 0.8. It used to be the case if you would popup an alert dialog box
in javascript like alert('hello i'm a alert dialog box') that the OK and Cancel
button would be centered now they are aligned to the right.

This is very inconvenient and in my opinion also more ugly. For example if you
install an extension usually multiple alert dialog popup after another, which
you all have to "OK". When the OK button wa in the middle this wa very easy.
Now you have to move your mouse every time.

Other example are the dialog that appears when you close firefox and there are
still downloads or when you want to save a password.
