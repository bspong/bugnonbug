I have the following error:

I created java applet with some public function i.e. setParams()

When I execute javascript like document.applet1.setParams() it doesn't work.
Javascript console report that 'document.applet1.setParams() is not a function'.

Everything work fine when the page and applet class are on the local machine.
When I'm trying to access the same document on the remote server I get this error.

I've tried to change various configuration option to no avail.

1. create java applet with some public function
2. try to access it from javascript
3.

Actual Results:
got 'document.applet1.setParams() is not a function' error

Expected Results:
