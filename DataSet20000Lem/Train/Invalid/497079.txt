Hello,
i update my mozilla firefox to newest version (3.5b99). And I saw page what's new so I read it and want to go to the page ""Whatch a video" n your browser without needing any plugins or external medium players." I click whatch a video and there wa a 502 Bad Gateway.

Mayby it isn't firefox bug but it really look bad that some official page is not working.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
Repair the page
