Make Subscriptions Work Better
- add a post-date annotation for every entry in a feed folder
- set the expiry of this any any other related annotation to no more than the lifetime of the item (i.e. before the next livemark refresh) - prevents the annotation table from bloating
- implement a sortingAnnotation property on nsINavHistoryQueryOptions, and add a SORT_BY_ANNOTATION_DESCENDING/ASCENDING to the set of sortingMode options, that can sort the result set based on annotation content.
- finish the attached prototype patch, which implement a special tree view for subscription so that unread item can be displayed etc.
