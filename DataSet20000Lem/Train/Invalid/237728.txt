Firefox crippled after displaying certain sites...
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Hi!

There are two site I am currently having trouble with:
http://www.msx.org/ and http://map.tni.nl/

It's really weird, Firefox (0.8) basically just say 'Waiting for response' or
'Transferring data', or something similar for infinitely long. It usually load
the title (the titlebar changes), and sometimes it show the blue background of
msx.org, but after that... nothing happens.

This didn't happen before - I don't know why it doe now. I tried
un/reinstalling Firefox, doing the same for all related applications, recreating
the profile, disabling IPv6... Nothing works, it still happens. On my sister's
computer on the same LAN Firefox work ok.

Ok, some more on this, which I found out after experimenting a little. If I
mid-click on any link to http://www.msx.org/ (open in new tab) it load
perfectly fine! But, this only work a long a I haven't viewed the site - if I
select the tab, then go back a tab, and try to open it again in a new tab, it fails.

So, apparantly something go wrong when it start rendering the page.
http://map.tni.nl/ now display fine the first time, but any subsequent browsing
in the page doesn't work. It could well be that the loading-time of the page
fall within the page display timeout before it start rendering (this would
also explain why I could see the page title and sometimes a blue background on
msx.org).

Maybe there is some way I could capture and view the http header within
Firefox? Because that might be where thing start going wrong...

Some more odd note about this:
- Mozilla ('seamonkey') 1.7a ha no trouble at all with these pages. Nor ha IE.
- An exact copy of the map.tni.nl page (it is my own site :)) also resides on my
local web server (KFWeb), and I can browse it there without any problem at all
(on 127.0.0.1:81).
- It disables and slows down my other Firefox windows. After this happens, when
I open a new window, I have to wait about 10 second before I can use it,
instead of the usual almost instant appearance. And after that, it still pretty
much doesn't work.
- These two page are site I frequent quite often. So far I haven't encountered
this on any other site.

I can't make head or tail of it.

Seems like a serious bug! And only occuring in a certain environment (what
exactly cause this problem I ofcourse don't know) in combination with certain
pages(/http headers?) because it doesn't happen on my sister's computer. And
when I try it from another user login on this PC, the problem is still there, so
it doesn't seem to be a problem with my window user profile.

Anyways, a long a I haven't found out the cause, I guess it would be hard to
reproduce. However, I have the Firefox source on my PC, and it build ok (latest
cv still ha these trouble btw). So if anyone want me to perform some kind of
tests, like profiling or so (although I don't know how to do that), I could
research it for a bit if someone would direct me a little...

p.s. the problem persists in the latest CVS.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup your system in a similar manner a mine... (how? where?)
2. Go to either http://www.msx.org/ or http://map.tni.nl/
Actual Results:
Browser load page fine until first-time display, after that doesn't load any
page anymore, not in other browser instance either. After closing all
instances, thing work well again. Opening a new instance after visiting one of
those site take about 10 second instead of the usual almost-instant appearance.

Expected Results:
Just work normally.

Windows XP, Athlon XP 1500+, 1GB RAM, um, dunno what else would be useful
information.
