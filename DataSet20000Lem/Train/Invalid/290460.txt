Two image ("Search Now" and "Cancel") near the bottom of the page are not
displayed, although the relevant link are active on mouseover.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to http://www.zuji.com
2. Select "Hong Kong" link in right column (unnecessary after cookie is saved)
3. Select "MORE SEARCH OPTIONS" link

Actual Results:
Two image ("Search Now" and "Cancel") near the bottom of the page are not
displayed, although the relevant link are active on mouseover. After searching
for a flight (by entering field and selecting the invisible link on the left
side) subsequent page fail to display any "Select" images, yet these link are
also active.

Expected Results:
The image should be displayed. Mozilla 1.7.6 and Safari 1.2.4 display the
image correctly.

Default theme is used. I am reporting this under Firefox rather than Gecko since
Mozilla 1.7.6 doe display the page correctly.
