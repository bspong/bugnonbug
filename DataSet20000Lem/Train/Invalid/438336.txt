The website linked above display event that occur in the flash object. Failure is indicated by "No event!" being displayed. Success is any other text. You'll see it change if you interact with the flash application.

It used to work for me with firefox 2. It stopped working after upgrading to firefox 3. I tested another firefox 3 on linux and that doesn't work either. I've had other people test on firefox 2 and it work for most (windows, mac, and linux), but I have one report of it not working on linux.
