Firefox doe not respond while it is working in task manager and load page
Created attachment 564075
the dump file made by Windows error reporting.

Opened a couple of tabs, started a small download from a reputable site, tried to open Gmail.
While the page wa loading and the download still working, Firefox froze and would not respond to any command, like change tabs, minimize, etc. Windows task manager show that it is running and the CPU usage is fine and under 5%. On any mouse click on the window it produce a "ding" sound, representative of a Windows non responsive error. But I can see it working. In fact it even finished the download in time. But since it would not close, I had to end the task using task manager. I have had this problem since version 6. Hoped it would get fixed in version 7 but it ha not.
I am enclosing a file generated by Dr. Watson. The problem occurs more than occasionally. Since firefox doe not "crash" in the usual sense, the crash report never pop up so I can not get a stacktrace. If I leave it alone, it continues "working" by itself and will not cause a system crash but will not respond at all. My window XP system ha Service Pack 3 with all update installed.
