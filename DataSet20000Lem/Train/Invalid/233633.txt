firebird bookmark lost on updating to firefox 0.8
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

after updating to mozilla firefox 0.8 via window installer, the old bookmark
of firebird were lost. I think this may be because the old profile (at document
and settings>application data>..) wa updated to a new profile. not sure because
I didn't check it before updating, and I don't remember the random name of the
.slt folder.
