Hello,

I checked your other bug regarding bookmark disappearing but they did not
solve my problem. Basically, last night, I closed Phoenix and shut down my
computer. This morning I started my computer and Phoenix and none of my
bookmark remain. I tried closing the program and rebooting but it did not help.

Reproducible: Always
