Whenever I access my statcounter page, the page display appears broken. At
first, the view wa ok, then upon load completion, all of sudden the formatting
seems to break up. The link doesn't work a well (reports: the requested URL
wa not found). When I tested in IE though, it seems to be working fine.

I checked the JavaScript console and it report the following:

Error: illegal character
