Just did a clean install of Win2kSp4, unzipped fb 0.7 release version and used
it only to find that (with no extension installed):

if i clicked within a page and tried to scroll up and down with the up/down
arrow on my keyboard it acted like the current page i wa viewing wa edittable
ie: a blinking cursor moved along the page in that direction (up/down).

opening a new tab allowed up/down nav with keyboard unless i clicked within the
site at which point that pesky blinking cursor returned :-(

since i have a form of Rsi that make mouse use uncomfortable, i tend to use use
up/down arrow key to smootholy scroll up/down a page and this bug is driving me
nut

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click within a page
2. try to scroll up and down with the up/down arrow on keyboard

Actual Results:
firebird act like current page is edittable in a word doc ie: a blinking cursor
move along the page in the direction of keyboard key pressed (up/down).

Expected Results:
scroll smoothly up and down page if keyboard up/down key pressed after clicking
on particular spot of page

i thought the bug might be to do with "type ahead find" so i put:

// Find As You Type Configuration:
// Set this pref to false to disable Find As You Type:
user_pref("accessibility.typeaheadfind", false);

into my all.js & user.js in the firebird profile. this did successfully disable
type ahead find, but the problem remained
