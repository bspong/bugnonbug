sec_error_unknown_issuer error from https://www.fido.ca/
I seem to be getting a sec_error_unknown_issuer error from https://www.fido.ca/ in FF4.0b7, but it load okay in Safari.

The english is:

www.fido.ca us an invalid security certificate.
The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain wa provided.
(Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)

if that helps.

Thanks,
Blake.
