Don't start Firefox after install, if root
Appearantly, the Installer launch Firefox after the installation completed,
even if the Installer ran a root, resulting in a Firefox running a root.

That's a very bad idea security-wise, application should never (not even once)
run a root. This basically lead or even train the user to cut himself.

Compare bug 247412.

It's also reason for user confusion, because the profile probably is being
created under root's home, not the user's home, so all configuration during the
first run (where people typically configure the app) is practically lost after
the user restarts the computer.

Suggested fix:
- If Installer run a root, don't start Firefox automatically.
- If that's too complicated, don't start Firefox automatically after
installation at all.
