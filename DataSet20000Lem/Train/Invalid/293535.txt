I have a mozilla.cfg file that point to a web server which configures the
proxy setting and default home page. The config file/web server file
configure the Firefox 1.03 browser perfectly but it you update the web server
config file the update doe not happen to the browser's users's pref.js file.

I can delete the failover.jsc and the pref.js file in the user profile and the
correct setting will come down.

What are the correct setting to make the firefox browser look at that site
each time the browser load (or even more frequently)?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.prepare a cfg file (modify all.js to point to the config file), that point
to a webserver location with the j script file (that modifies the proxy and
homepage settings).
2. launch firefox and close firefox. look at the pref.js file in user profile.
3. change the web server j file to point to another homepage or proxy.
launch firefox and close firefox. look at the pref.js file.

Actual Results:
the file wa not change (and firefox used the old settings).

Expected Results:
changed to the new proxy or new homepage.


Delete the failover.jsc and prefs.js (or proxy info in the pref) and it will
reevaluate.
