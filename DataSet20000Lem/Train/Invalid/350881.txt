For some unknown reason, FireFox seems to believe Quicktime is the proper way to play all MP3 file from ytmnd.com. This is NOT a sever-side issue because this work properly for WMP in both Opera and Internet Explorer. FireFox is the ONLY browser thus far to suggest that QT or anything BESIDES window medium player is to be used for this page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit page

Actual Results:
FireFox suggests I download Quicktime :(

Expected Results:
FireFox should make due with Windows Media Player.

fresh installation, nothing installed yet except for this and my sound card driver so I doubt this is a residual of QT floating around somewhere.
