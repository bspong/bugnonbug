The Resizer's target area is too narrow in Customize Toolbar mode: Half the time, I remove an adjacent element instead, undoing all my careful resizing in the process. (I say "careful" because I'm the strange sort of guy who take comfort in the Search field being exactly 200 pixel wide, or some other nice "round" number.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View -> Toolbars -> Customize...
2. Add the Resizer to the toolbar.
3. Try removing it.
Actual Results:
Over half the time, an adjacent item is removed instead, undoing your careful resizing.

Expected Results:
The Resizer should be easy to consistently remove.
