Drag and drop is very dangerous operation in Mozilla. I's always been ever since the beginning so I only use it accidentally when I forget about the risks.

Most of the time dragging a tab or bookmark creates a nice bookmark icon and then lock up Firefox. The icon stay there no matter what unless Firefox is killed. Last time I tried Firefox even grabbed the X input so I had to kill it from outside X.

There are some safe combination (iirc dragging the bokmark from the url bar to the bookmark toolbar). But leaving the bookmark elsewhere or taking it elsewhere easily lock up Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run Firefox
2. try to play with DnD

Actual Results:
lockup

Expected Results:
DnD should not lock up Firefox

probably Linux specific
