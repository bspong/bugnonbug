Excite.com hijack Firefox and only option is to reboot Firefox to continue internet search. Also following tracking cooky always imbedded in Firefox and always have to be deleted- why doesn't firefox block them ??
thanks Gus.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Searching internet
2.instead of required link, Excite.com come up and block everything
3.freezes firefox,
Actual Results:
I have to reboot Firefox and start again !!

Expected Results:
Connected me to correct link instead of hijack

I cannot get back to google search to retrieve URL, it appears that something in Firefox take over and connects to imbedded virus eg Excite.com.
Tracking cooky for Overture, 2o7.net, and tacoda.net constantly attach themselves to Firefox and need to be removed every day !!
