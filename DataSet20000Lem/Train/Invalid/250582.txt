Installer take over IE icon
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

I installed Firefox and it installed it own icon in the quick launch toolbar,
and additionally took over the IE icon. While I'm all for Microsoft dying a
quick and painful death, I don't think that pissing off user who might not
know how to change that back is a good idea. Even though I will use firefox
for most of my browsing, I still need IE because unfortunately that's life
right now. I put back an IE icon, but for future installs, not doing that
might be a better idea for those who don't know how. Last thing you want is
for people to think you're worse than Microsoft.
