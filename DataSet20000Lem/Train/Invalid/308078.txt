Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to above web site
2. hit tab key once, focus go to "MGC/Username" entry field
3. hit tab key again, focus go to "Password" entry field
4. hit tab key again, focus go to "logon" button
5. hit tab key again, focus go to "Public Computer" radiobutton
6. hit tab one last time, focus doe not go to "Private Computer" radiobutton

Actual Results:
The focus did not go to the "Private Computer" radiobutton.

Expected Results:
The focus should go to the "Private Computer" radiobutton,
at which point, the "space" key can be used to select that option.

This work correctly on Mozilla/Netscape, but not on Firefox.

It appears that the focus never go to the unselected item(s) in
a radiobutton object (when using the tab key). The focus tab to
the currently selected button only. If you use the mouse to select
the "Private Computer" radiobutton, then tab through the item again,
this time it will not put focus on the "Public Computer" button.

Again, this problem doe not occur when using Mozilla or Netscape browser.
