Bug appears similar to bug 469491 found by nobody@mozilla.org

On opening Firefox page several error message are presented (piled on top of each other). They read "Java Script Application" "onLookup Failed 55 1". The number od identical message varies from a few to a dozen or so. I do not know the reason for varying number of message --- possibly it is relaated to the number of image on the paage. The message box can be closed using their "OK" button or the "X" in the upper right corner. When the box have been closed sometimes use of Firefox can proceed, sometimes the program crash without leaving a crash dump. When Firefox proceeds and another web page is opened, the series of error message is again encountered.

On opening, Firefox noted that QuickJava 0,4,2,1 is incompatible with the version of Firefox and wa disabled by Firefox. A compatible version of Java wa not found.
