Mozilla Firefox`s FTP doesn't downloads a file, but Windows doe
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-ES; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

If I try to download this file:
ftp://ftp2.ngamexp.com/ngamexp9/eathena/eAthena-SVN-7800-stable-TXT.rar
A few second later down in the status bar appears this "Transacción finalizada" (I have the spanish version and I don't know the exact translation)
and doesn't do nothing, but in IE7, I can download the file.
