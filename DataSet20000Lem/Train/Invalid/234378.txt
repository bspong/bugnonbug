cannot set Firefox a default browser using Windows XP Set Program Access and Defaults
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Even though Firefox can be set a the default browser via it Preferences, this
option doe not propagate to Windows XP's _Set Program Access and Defaults_
menu. After having previously made Firefox the default browser, visiting the
SPAD applet show the default a

[X] Use my current web browser
[ ] Firefox [X] Enable Access to this program
[ ] Internet Explorer [X] Enable Access to this program

Choosing Firefox a the default, then pressing 'OK' yield the message "Setting
default browser" and then open Firefox. After closing Firefox, then revisiting
the SPAD page, the option remains unchanged.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start -> Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs -> Set Program Access and
Defaults
2. Custom area -> Choose Firefox a default browser
3. Click OK.

Actual Results:
Firefox opens, but the option in SPAD remains unchanged.

Expected Results:
Firefox should not? open, and the option in SPAD should change to reflect that
Firefox is now the default browser for Windows. As a side note, maybe this
option should change in Windows when Firefox is made the default using the
option in it Preferences dialog :)
