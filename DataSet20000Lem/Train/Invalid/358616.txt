Layer Layout issue

Take a look at the page provided. The layer do not appear a they do in IE. Scroll down, you will notice that the black background of the layer cut off and then it is just clear.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
Now take a look in I.E. Everything is nicely aligned and background work a it should.

It's really hard on me, and a fair few other people i have talked to, it would be appriciated to be fixed ASAP.
