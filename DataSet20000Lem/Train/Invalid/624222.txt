Script stopped responding

This is the error message I get when in Yahoo mail or trying to exit from it:

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script:
file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Steve/Application%20Data/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/7c7ta326.default/extensions/%7B635abd67-4fe9-1b23-4f01-e679fa7484c1%7D/components/nsYahooFileIO.js:26

from time to time this happens with other website too, but usually only when Firefox is using over a gig of memory according to the Windows Task Manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get into a yahoo mail account.
2. Read mail for a considerable period of time or just leave the mail account open for several hour or until Firefox is using between .5GB and 1GB of memory.
3. Either error message will appear while Firefox is minimized or while trying to exit the e-mail account.
Actual Results:
I usually click on the "Stop Script" button. That allows me to exit the e-mail account, but going into any other yahoo e-mail account will cause the problem to reoccur. As the memory Firefox is utilizing increases, the occurrence of the problem appears to increase.

Expected Results:
I can continue working once I click on the "Stop Script" button. Otherwise, Firefox is shown a non-responding in the Windows Task Manager. This shouldn't be happening, but then again, why doe Firefox continue to grab more and more memory the longer it runs?

Firefox doesn't actually crash because once it hit the 1GB memory usage mark, I restart it. If I don't, it will hang. I noticed that there are 868 other bug in Bugzilla that in one way or another appear to be related to this one, but are not exactly the same. I am hoping that the information that I am providing will aid in finally identifying and eliminating the bug.
