In FF 2.0.0.10 source code you can find "LAST_VISIT" in

\browser\components\bookmarks\src\nsBookmarksService.cpp

This tag ha disappeared in FF 3.6 source code in

\browser\components\places\src\nsPlacesImportExportService.cpp

I noticed this bug since FF 3.0 release. I have tried to correct it but I don't understand how it works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Export bookmark that have a last visit date in HTML File
