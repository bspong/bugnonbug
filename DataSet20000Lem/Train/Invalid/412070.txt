adding exception is very hard now - we must to search in preference window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open site with wrong ssl certificate
2. try to add exception without opening preference window - impossible
3. open preference and try to find "the button" :> - it's hard
Actual Results:
there's a must to open preference window

Expected Results:
there should be no reason to open preference window
