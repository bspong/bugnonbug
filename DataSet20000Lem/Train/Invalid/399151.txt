"Bookmark this link" -- found through CTRL-click on the MacBookPro -- save directly to the main bookmark list if other text is highlighted. If text is not highlighted, a dialog is popped up which asks what the bookmark should be called and into which bookmark folder the new bookmark should be saved.

I prefer the latter, but either way, the behavior should be fixed so that it is the same for both.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. highlight some text on a webpage
2. ctrl-click on a link

Actual Results:
The link is quietly saved to the main bookmark list

Expected Results:
The dialog should pop up, just like it doe when no text is highlighted
