Fails to start if 'developer's tools' is selected for installation
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: firefox-0.8-win32-enGB-installer.exe

Using the firefox-0.8-win32-enGB-installer.exe package, if I select to install
developer's tools, the app will not start after what appears to be a successful
installation. I get a short hourglass, then nothing - despite repeated tries. I
have tried removing the profile directory prior to an install, but no
difference. Also, the app doe not show an install size in 'add/remove
programs' - I don't know if this might be significant, or a completely separate
issue.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delete/uninstall any previous Firefox installations, including profile dirs
2. Install from firefox-0.8-win32-enGB-installer.exe
3. Select to install developer tool

Actual Results:
The app won't fire up.

Expected Results:
:-)
