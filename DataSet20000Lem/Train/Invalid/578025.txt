Required changes:
1. Move Star Button to the left and replace favicon by it.
2. Make drop arrow bigger and "empty".
3. Attach combined Stop/Go/Refresh button to the Location Bar.
4. Show SSL protected site in colorful rectangle:
4.1. If site's name and it's SSL certificate are the same, show only one of them in rectangle.
4.2. If site's name and it's SSL certificate are different, show site's name separately in bold text next to SSL certificate.
4.3. OS-specific styling:
4.3.1. Vista/7/Mac: Green rectangle with white text for SSL and green text for site's name.
4.3.2. XP: Blue rectangle with white text for SSL and blue text for site's name.
4.3.3. Linux: White rectangle with black text for SSL and black text for site's name.
5. Display Progress line inside bar at the bottom when page on active tab is loading.

See attached mockups.

Note: Point 4 is a my guess according to availible mockups. Someone from UX team should clarify this.

Reproducible: Always
