I recently upgraded to Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5 from previous version.

I recently noticed that the browser continues to let the little circle in the top right corner of the window run long after all content ha been received. (apparently)

I have tried several website with the same results.

The type of action make me concerned about visiting web page with this browser since I'm not expecting to see the "downloading/busy/data transfer" continually running.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up web browser to any home page - continues to run
2. Change URL - continues to run
3. Start browser in Safe Mode - busy indicator stop when network traffic stops.
Actual Results:
transfer indicator continues to run

Expected Results:
transfer indicator stop when page ha loaded
