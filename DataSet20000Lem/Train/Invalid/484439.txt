Is it safe to turn off private browsing while in autostart mode?
This came up in a few bugs, and it seems that this need to be guarded against. IMHO it shouldn't be possible to turn off pb while in autostart mode a the user ha made an explicit choice to have it always on.

However, if it should be possible (which it is now) this must be guarded against, detail of some minor bug encountered to follow.
