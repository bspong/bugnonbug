I just started up Firefox, and all my bookmark are gone (even the actual
bookmarks.html is restored to the default), and all my saved password (which
were protected with a master password) and history is gone. My custom formatting
where I only keep the menu bar and address bar wa gone and replaced with the
default look and feel. The only thing remaining is my default home page (which
wa set to Google).

I didn't install or un-install any new application or reboot or anything. All I
did wa lock my computer and go for lunch, before which it wa working a normal.

this suddenly disappearing out of the blue destroys the product's credibility.
