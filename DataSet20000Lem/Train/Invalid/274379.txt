Closing Firefox reboots computer (bugcheck)
After using firefox for a significant amount of time (a few hours), if I close
it, my entire machine reboots.

Looking in the Event Viewer, there is this message:

The computer ha rebooted from a bugcheck. The bugcheck was: 0x000000d1
(0xbfd80fd5, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0xbfd80fd5). Microsoft Windows 2000
[v15.2195]. A dump wa saved in: C:\WINNT\Minidump\Mini121304-01.dmp.

I will attach the dmp file.

Firefox doesn't crash if I close it after viewing just a few pages, but after a
heavy session of internet browsing it is almost certain to reboot. My machine is
otherwise pretty stable, I have no reason to suspect bad memory or similar (I
replaced my powersupply after I noticed the reboots, but it ha had no effect).

I have 4 extension installed, the only one that may possibly have anything to
do with this is Chatzilla, but I doubt it (will uninstall it and see if that
make any difference).
