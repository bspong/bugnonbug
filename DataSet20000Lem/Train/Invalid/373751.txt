Live bookmark middle click open in tab
Before the patch for bug 253698 wa entered, middle-clicking a live bookmark would have opened the primary site of that live bookmark. This allowed for easy access to the site in general if many of the item were interesting.

After the patch wa landed, middle-clicking on a live bookmark try to open all of the article in tabs, which although is consistent with regular folders, loses some functionality that wa available before.

The "Open All in Tabs" option can stay for the case where one really want to open all live bookmark but still allow fast access to the commonly used opening of the primary site.
