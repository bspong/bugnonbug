Mailto: URL handling; Javascript registerProtocolHandler doesn't strip the "mailto:"

Fortunately I wa able to set up FF 3 to handle mailto link to open a page IN FireFox (opposed to IE) using by typing into the URL bar:

javascript:window.navigator.registerProtocolHandler("mailto","http://bl116w.blu116.mail.live.com/mail/EditMessageLight.aspx?n=584168459&To=%s","Hotmail")

The unfortunate side effect is that upon loading the Mail Edit window the "mailto:" component of the link wa not stripped and Hotmail will not send an email without that being removed. I have so far been unable to find any other method besides a direct copying of the email address and going into a new message and pasting it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.javascript:window.navigator.registerProtocolHandler("mailto","http://bl116w.blu116.mail.live.com/mail/EditMessageLight.aspx?n=584168459&To=%s","Hotmail")
2.Add application
3.Click an email link on a webpage
Actual Results:
To: line of the email message contains "mailto:xyz@abc.com"

Expected Results:
To: line of the email message contains "xyz@abc.com"
