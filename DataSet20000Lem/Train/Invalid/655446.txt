You are unable to click the autocomplete suggested text on a form input text field when the browser is expanded beyond the width of the desktop. You able to select the autocomplete text with the keyboard, but you cannot select it from the mouse.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I haven't tested other variations, but this is one method to reproduce the problem:

1. Connect a larger external monitor to a Macbook.
2. Make the larger external monitor the primary monitor.
3. Open Firefox on the external monitor and maximize the window to fill the screen.
4. Disconnect the external monitor and Firefox should show up on the Macbook.
5. Verify that the width of Firefox is set beyond the width of the Macbook and leave it expanded beyond the width of the desktop.
6. Visit a page with an input text box that ha a previous autocomplete entered.
7. Start to type the previously entered text so Firefox show you suggest autocomplete text.
8. Try clicking one of the suggested text items. (you shouldn't be able to)
9. Maximize Firefox to the width of the desktop and verify that you are now able to click the suggested autocomplete.

I have not been able to test these step on a PC nor have I try this same method when two monitor are connected and the browser span the width of the screens.



I will do some additional testing to determine if I can reproduce the same problem under different situations. I will update this bug with what I find out.
