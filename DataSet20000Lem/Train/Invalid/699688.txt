SECURITY THREAT: Firefox allows hijacking of copy function
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

Press Control+C


Actual results:

JavaScript event handler got called. Contents of clipboard were read and sent to a third-party IP address not even related to website being viewed. Contents of clipboard were altered.


Expected results:

Under ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES should JavaScript code be allowed to hook onto a copy-to-clipboard event OR to alter the clipboard OR to open a socket to a third-party domain/IP like tcr.tynt.com. This is a CRITICAL SECURITY HOLE and it is happening in just about every website nowadays. Example: www.dailymail.co.uk

This is such a scary thing that it might actually make me reconsider using Firefox. Imagine if the content of the clipboard weren't altered. This could easily have gone undetected. Sensitive information like passwords, secret questions, credit card numbers, and bank account routing number are all subject to being stolen due to this vulnerability. Really, what developer thought of putting a copy event handler hook in JavaScript and WTF wa he thinking?

Copy-n-paste is a function of the OS and the content of the clipboard and copy or paste event should NEVER be public to web servers. If a web site ha a legitimate reason to alter copy-n-paste functionality they can do so without hook into the OS clipboard. They can use a hidden field and a mouse down event on an image to do custom copy-n-paste.

Many user can be harmed by this security problem, but it is already being exploited like crazy. Keeping it hidden doe more harm than good. For now, all I can suggest is disabling JavaScript and adding the following line to hosts/.hosts files:
127.0.0.1 tynt.com
127.0.0.1 tcr.tynt.com
