Almost every time I try to open Microsoft Word while Firefox is running, Firefox lock up, "Not Responding". I have to CTRL Alt DEL to the Windows task manager and do an End Process on Firefox.exe. After Firefox close I can open Firefox again and restore the session and it work fine.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox.exe
2. Open any web site
3. Open Microsoft Word 2000 (9.0.3821 SR-1)

Actual Results:
Firefox say "Not Responding" and us 100 % of CPU

Expected Results:
Firefox should not lock up my computer.

Instead of going into a "Not Responding" state and using 100% of the CPU, Firefox should just shut down.
