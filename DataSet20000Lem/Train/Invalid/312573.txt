When I go into Google and ask for Images, only the blue frame come up, no
image. The word are below it a are the sized but the image is blank. There
is no problem with Google search in general. Just images.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the net via Foxfire
2.Type search criterion into Google
3.click Images
4.Search image
5. Blue box come up that should contain images.
6. Boxes are blank.
7.

Actual Results:
I get a page of result but the box that should hold the image are blank.
The writing beneath each one is there but no image.

Expected Results:
Produced a page (or more) of image that result from the search I entered in Google.

I downloaded Foxfire again and got no change in the Google Image problem.
I can get into Google Images through Explorer but I prefer to use Mozilla.

About the comment below on severity: I chose the most correct answer but I
don't WANT to stop using Mozilla. Just thought you'd want to know.
