'restore defaults' in column picker in places/library doe not restore default column
STRs:
- open places/library
- add a column of your choice using the picker *and/or* remove one of the default column
- try to restore default using the picker with 'restore defaults'

result: nothing happens

expected: column 'name', 'tags' and 'location' to be restored (in this order), so any manually added, non-default column(s) to be dropped and any manually removed default-column(s) to be re-added.

a far a i see 'restore defaults' is actually working only to restore the default column order ( with manually added column(s) moved to the very right of the default ones) after dragging column around.

-> intended?

unsure who added the restore option but CCing Marco to comment/investigate because of his work on Bug 405010 and Bug 405017 ....
