Hi,

I'm not sure what is going on, but when ever I try to view www.yahoo.com with MOZILLA FIREFOX, it is blocked and the following error is returned:

Web Site Blocked by NETGEAR Firewall

The problem is:

1) I don't have ANY netgear device or software attached to my computer.
2) Internet Explorer doe not present such an message when I load the website.

Does anyone know what is going on?

Emails to both my ISP & "Netgear" have not given me any answers.

Also --- I cannot even load yahoo! through a proxy! It still block it!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on to yahoo.com
