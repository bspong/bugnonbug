When using an horizontal scrollbar firefox crash and Ubuntu too. It happens when viewing large image or website specifically designed to have an horizontal scrollbar. It also happen when using the "view source code" (there is often an horizontal scrollbar in this view).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. find a large webpage (example : http://xkcd.com/802_large/ )
2. scroll with the horizontal scrollbar (I don't click on arrow but the "block" in the bar)

Actual Results:
Actually my computer screen turn to sleep mode and cannot be awaken. I assume Ubuntu crashed. The machine can be pinged.
After a hard reboot of the machine Firefox restart and ask me if I want to reload my previously open tabs.

Expected Results:
No crash. Using the horizontal scrollbar should display the text hidden on the right of the window.

Default installation of Ubuntu Lucid.
Does not happen every day since Horizontal scrollbars doe not appear often.
Since it make Ubuntu crash, I lose data each time it happens.
