javascript: wrong evaluation of == operator when reading data from <select> in event handler
I've accidentally crafted a piece of code in which the == operator inside an if() statement is evaluated wrongly. (It look a bit like over-zealous optimisation to me.)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Visit web page.
2. Bring focus to the select.
3. Hit shift key twice.
4. Output will be: A != A

Expected output: A == A

The script is accessing the active <option> of a <select> using mootools' $(id).getSelected().get('value') and comparing it against the stored "last value" of that <select>. The comparison always report old != new, even if the value is unchanged. Thinking this could have to do something with pre-computation/caching/optimisation of that if() statement, I tried to add the result of Date().getMilliseconds() to both operand in order to force a re-evaluation of the statement. With that trick, the if() work a expected. I have observed this issue with Firefox 3 (Windows), Firefox 3 (Linux) and Firefox 3.5b4 (Linux).
