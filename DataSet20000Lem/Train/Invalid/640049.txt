Sometimes I loss all my opened tabs. I don't know exactly the reason but I saw when my wife opened a new window (new instance) of Mozilla Firefox while my window stayed opened. So she closed my window (previous window), she did works, and soon closed the her window too. One day later, when I opened Firefox, all the tab of my wife came in. I lost all my tab and this wa a big pain of head. I suggest the creation a new button on top of window (or menu item) where the user can save all the tab opened (links) and to give a name to this saved session (the system will save the link in a file, for example). This way, since the previous user cause the lost of all the tab of previous session, I can click in other menu item where appears all the saved session by name and choose one. Immediatly the Firefox will open all the link from that session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an new instance of Firefox (window)
2. Open several link
3. Open a new instance
4. Open several link
5. Close the first window
6. Open more some link in second window
7. Close the second (last) window
Actual Results:
When I open a new window I loss all my tab previously opened (in first window mentioned above)

Expected Results:
Allow save all the link in a file named by user to restore later.
