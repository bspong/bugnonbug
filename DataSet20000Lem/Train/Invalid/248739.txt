I tried to copy the bookmarks.html into the two place I found this original
file under defaults\profile and defaults\profile\US. However, it ignores these
bookmark and us it own. I rebooted, and checked that my list wa still there.
This worked fine with Mozilla 1.7 copying those from Netscape.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. copy other bookmark into these directory
2.
3.

Actual Results:
it still used it own default bookmark

Expected Results:
used the one I inserted
