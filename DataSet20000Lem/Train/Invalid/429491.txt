Hello,

The majority of time I close firefox and start it up again I find I have been signed out of iGoogle, even though i have told it to remember me. Sometimes it doe remember me, however.

atm I accept all cooky until I close firefox but I have made an exception to always remember google cookies.

This problem ha happened to me for ages, even with firefox2. Also, my mate ha the same trouble.

Thanks!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:
sometimes i find that google hasn't remembered me

Expected Results:
