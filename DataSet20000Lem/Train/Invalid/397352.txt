Unfortunately, I cannot paste a screen print of the file but I have been uncovering .MOZ file in my C:\RECYCLER\NPROTECT folder....they are reflected in my spyware/malware scan and I am concerned a to how they got there......there are ten of thousand of them intermixed with some .sql and .txt file but most are .moz files......are these in any way related to your processes?
I am running Mozilla Firefox and am completely up to date......
Thanks for your efforts,
Blazer
