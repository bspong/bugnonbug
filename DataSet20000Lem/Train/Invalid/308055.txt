If you have two page element that you want to visibly toggle via javascript you
need 2 line of code. One line turn one element off by setting display="none"
and the second line turn the other element on by setting display="block".
Previously, this wa working fine. Under 1.5beta (on Mac at the minimum), the
page seems to refresh in between the two line so that you get a flicker with
either both element displayed or both element invisible depending on the order
of your javascript. See the listed url for an example.

pseudoJScode:

element1.display="none";
**page draw should NOT happen here**
element2.display="block";
**page draw should happen here**
