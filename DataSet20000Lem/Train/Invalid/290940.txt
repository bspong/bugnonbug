Failure to restart window 98 SE, loss of video adapter display setting after update to 1.0.3
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

Update feature suggested I update to 1.0.3, which I did by carefully following
all instructions. On restart, window 98 SE failed, requiring a forced
resetting. On subsequent attempt, PC shut down unexpectedly during reboot. Next
attempt required safe mode, and all setting for display adapter had to be
re-done. Process took over 30 minutes.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Received suggestion to update.
2. Closed all other window application
3. Installed update
4. Restarted Windows 98 SE - Failed - needed resetting
5. Restarted Windows - Failed - system powered itself off
6. Restarted Windows - Safe Mode.
7. Had to re-enter all video card setting etc.
8. Firefox appears to be working

Actual Results:
System appears to be working, for the moment. Video setting still require
tweaking, but I'll get over it.

Expected Results:
Presumably it messed in some way with registry or something? Who knows?

Hopefully I'll be the only person with this one!
