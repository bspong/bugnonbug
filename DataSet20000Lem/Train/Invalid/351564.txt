Every time I open a web page using Firefox it automatically change to:

http://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/conversion/1069001133/?random=1157561391734&value=1&label=PURCHASE&hl=en&gl=US&fmt=1&bg=666666

I ran a "hijack" detection program and cannot find anything added to my startup or other configuration settings. I ran adaware and Norton Antivirus (I ran a full virus scan of my system).

I am not having this problem with Internet explorer.

I am not having this problem on my home computer.

The problem is not related to one particular website but anytime I open a new page.

Reproducible: Always
