Under some case table are rendered wrong. Tested on every Firefox 3 version, even nightly build. It worked nice on Firefox 2 and previous verions.

Attached file show it. On a row in a table some cell in a row are not rendered, and the rest of cell in the same row are misplaced. Previous and later row are rendered right. It happens on some row but when it happens, it happens every time with that code.

Always I've observed this behaviour always when a CSS td:hover is present.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse attached HTML

Actual Results:
Table is rendered wrong. Two cell on the seventh row (not counting header) are not rendered and the rest of cell on row are misplaced.

Expected Results:
A table with all cell rendered.
