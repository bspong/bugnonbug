I would be useful to have a non-modal stored cooky dialog when developing a Web application or hacking on a Web site. With a modal dialog, one must act on the Web page, then open the cooky dialog (which take several steps), then close it, then start again. A non-modal dialog that would react instantly to any cookie change would increase productivity.

Reproducible: Always
