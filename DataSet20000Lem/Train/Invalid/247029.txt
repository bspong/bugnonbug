The add bookmark [by pressing Ctrl + D] dialog ha a drop down box for adding
bookmark within folder already made. This can contain only 5 entry at most.
Is this deliberate. by clicking the expand button on the side the whole list
and bookmark is shown. I suppose the box should show all the folder the user
had created earlier.

Also it should remember the status that user left this dialog earlier. If he
expanded the dialog to it full, then the next time when the user want to add a
bookmark it should open up so.
