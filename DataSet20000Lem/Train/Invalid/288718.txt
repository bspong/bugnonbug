Yes is too easy to press on prompt on some malicious site
A lot of malicious site have scripts, etc that bring up popup windows. It's too
easy to press "Yes" on these windows. I suggest making people click a checkbox
that say "I understand these warnings, blah blah". Only a hidden pref should
turn that checkbox off, otherwise it'll be unchecked by default.

My assumption is that applet can do harm to the system since they run locally.

It's way too easy to press "Yes" on the popup asking if you trust Integrated
Search Technologies.
