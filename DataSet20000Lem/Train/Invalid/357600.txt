Environment: Windows XP Home SP-2, Firefox 1.5.0.7, Word Press 2.0.4., Google toolbar 2.1.

Description: Word Press using an HTML form for text entry for blogs. It composes HTML behind the scene for various reasons.

When using Google's toolbar to check the spelling of the entered text, the subsequent HTML get changed. Most commonly the position of paragraph tag <p> are moved causing the break to appear after the first word of the subsequent paragraph. Often text attribute like bold and italic get screwed up too, though I have not found a universal form of corruption.

Note that using IE 6.0.2900 doe not cause this problem using Google toolbar 4.0.1020. Thus it is either a problem with the Firefox version of the Google toolbar, Firefox (or le likely with Word Press).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add two or more paragraph of text with at least one misspelling.
2. Click on "Check" on the Google toolbar.
