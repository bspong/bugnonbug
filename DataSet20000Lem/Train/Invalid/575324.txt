I have never noticed this issue until making the jump to Firefox 3.6.4 build 7.

When I login to my content management system, the logo it is to display is called "cms.png"

But in my webserver, it is actually called "CMS.png"

So, Firefox failed to display the image. When I corrected the case, it wa fine!

I have had no problem before with this until this build of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Go to a page that call an image in this format <img src="http://www.example.com/abc.png" alt="abc">, but the image is actually located at http://www.example.com/ABC.png

Actual Results:
Image doe not load.

Expected Results:
Image loads.

I feel that this is a major issue, a it ha the potential to break the UIs of many websites.
