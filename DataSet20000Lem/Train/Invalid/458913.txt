I had no problem with 3.0.3 which I downloaded a few week ago, until I also added Flashblock from your website two day ago. Now I cannot access any unsecured website such a airline, search engines, hotels, Google, etc. Only those site which are secured are accessible. Since I downloaded Flashblock which wa supposed to make my PC run quicker I haven't been able to access any unsecured site, which is totally unacceptable. All of the secured site I tried to access are still accessible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to access an unsecured site.
2. "working message" say "connecting to ..."
3. I then get a "timed out" message which effectively block the website from me.
4. If I try to access a secured site, the "working message" say "connected to ..." and take me to the secured website
Actual Results:
Type in the URL or use a bookmark - in either case if it is an unsecured website, I get the working message "connecting to ..." which then time out.

Expected Results:
I should be able to access whichever website I choose, not just the secured websites.

It should not have blocked the unsecured websites. Please advise what step I must take to enable my computer to access other websites, a it did prior to the installation of your Flashblock. Thank you. William Pollak Pollak500@cs.com
