Firefox 0.8 win32 on Windows 2000 Pro with service pack 5 and all recent window
updates, priority browser is Firefox, various internet security program being
used are Protowall v1.42, Zonealarm (Freeversion), and Norton Antivirus 2004. I
have found that whenever i log into Hotmail using the checkbox for a secure
login, the next time i go to login Firefox seems to have remembered my login
detail which i do not want a i am using a shared computer. Could this be a
problem with cookies? Or is it just MS not supporting other browsers?
