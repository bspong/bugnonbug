In Session manager i can not save current session & it will not give me the previous session or restored session when i restart Firefox. The only time the save session work is if i try to save right after i start Firefox. After that i lose what ever i have been working on or browsing. If Firefox crash's the only session it restores is from when i first started that day. Also i noticed that when i come to log back in to my computer that if i check the task manager there is still a Firefox exe running.

Expected Results:
My current session should be saved

I had been running a older version of both program from last year not sure what version. Then i updated to Session manager 0.6.8.3 & updated Firefox to 3.6.8
just recently. That's when the problem started

All add-on except session manager have been disabled.
I'm using the default theme in Firefox 3.6.8
I uninstalled Session Manager & went back to version 0.6.8pre20091226
this version still cause same error

The other thing i have noticed is that after running for a while my cpu usage run all the way up to a 100% & everything slows down.
Also Firefox will no longer create a crash log to send in when it doe crash.
