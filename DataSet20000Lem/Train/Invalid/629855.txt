Firefox 4 should prompt first time user that they are quitting their session

In the past before Firefox beta pre 10, Firefox always ask whether you would want to save your session before you close Firefox. However, recently with the removal of the prompt, I cannot find the replacement option for implementing that.

Reproducible: Always
