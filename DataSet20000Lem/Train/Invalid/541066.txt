It used to be until recently that when visiting a web page that I've been to before and have filled in value on before, that double-clicking the input box would offer up the list of previously entered values.

However, now *sometimes* (depends which web page it is) you have to type the first character before it offer what wa remembered beginning with that character. A sample page where this happens is http://www.travelinescotland.com/timetableplanner/serviceSelect.do and instruction to replicate are listed below.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.travelinescotland.com/timetableplanner/serviceSelect.do
2. Enter 191 in the service number (could be any number but I know this one exists)
3. Click "Look up timetable".
4. This list several bus routes. Now simply click "New Timetable..."
5. Double-click in the Service Number input box. Nothing happens. Now enter 1 into that box. 191 appears.


Actual Results:
Nothing happens on the double-click

Expected Results:
previously entered item should appear without having to resort to keyboard presses, like it doe normally.

Not sure why this site cause this effect, but it is not the only site. There are many others like it.
