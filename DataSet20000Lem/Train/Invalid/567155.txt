Firefox stop responding during download of big files. The last time it froze wa when I tried to download a 1.7 GB file at 9.0 MB/s. It freeze most of the time at the end of the download, something around 80 to 90%.

Sometimes Firefox stay frozen definitively. Sometimes it "unfreezes". In this last case, the temporary file is removed and the downloaded file remains. In this case, this file ha some data (probably the data downloaded before it wa frozen), but not all the data.

Firefox ha the same behavior when downloading many small file (small, here, is 100 to 300 MB) at 100 KB/s.

Very small file are ok. It seems that big file from very slow server are ok too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a 100 Mbps connection.
2. Download a big file. For example http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=696DD665-9F76-4177-A811-39C26D3B3B34&displaylang=en
Actual Results:
The application (both Firefox window and Downloads window) is frozen and cannot be used for a long time. Downloads are corrupted.

Expected Results:
Firefox wa expected to finish the download.

Did not tried to reproduce this with all add-on disabled.

Many add-on are installed, but no add-on directly related to download process.
