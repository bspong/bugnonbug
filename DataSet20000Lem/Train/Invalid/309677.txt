The new automatic update are great, but on several occasion they download
almost completely unusable browser. A couple of week ago the frame rendering
wa completely broken, and now (with the today's update) the tab can not be
closed, and CPU go to 100% after few minute of work.

It would be good if at least some most basic test are done before automatic
update are pushed out - otherwise the testng turn out to be quite unpleasant task.
