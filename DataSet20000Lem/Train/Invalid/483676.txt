Possibly related to Bug 452193, Bug 431558 and others.

I use firefox with NFS home directories. Sometimes network connectivity is lost for the session, or firefox crashes.

The result is
1. that firefox will never run again without severe intervention
2. it loos all settings.

The non-trivial intervention may be reduced to:
rm -f .mozilla/*/lock .mozilla/*/.parentlock

and then it starts, but all the setting are missing, page navigation doesn't work properly and bookmark are missing.

The better fix is:

mv .mozilla/firefox .mozilla/firefox.old
then start firefox and import the bookmark from .mozilla/firefox.old/*/bookmarkbackups

which just leaf the case of all other preference and certificate missing.

I've had this problem ever since sqlite wa used for storing configuration and now I'm fed up with it.

It seems like sqlite is only suitable for local storage.

If firefox insists on using it, I wish it would be more robust, my family are gnashing their teeth over it and so am I

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have a merry browsing session with NFS home directory
2. pull out the network cable and ctrl-alt-sysreq-b
3. reboot and try and use firefox
Actual Results:
Claims firefox is already running.
It's bad enough that the lock file is a symlink to something a uselss as:
127.0.1.1:+27801
- a hostname would be more useful - or perhaps a combination of hostname's IP and hostname - but thats not the real problem

Expected Results:
Firefox might work or tell me something useful about where it is supposedly running.
Deleting the lock file should not result in missing bookmark and broken toolbar button requiring a new firefox profile.
