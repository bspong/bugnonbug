If I type in a single word without period for a location URL (i.e., "foo", or even "http://foo"), and that location is not accessible (for example, because I'm not on the right intranet), I'd like to be able to just get the message that the page cannot be displayed. However, Firefox (wrongly, a far a I'm concerned) attempt to resolve the URL by appending ".com", "www.", etc. (This is after I disabled keyword searching.) As likely a not, this just end up at some junk adhosting site. There should be an option to disable this kind of URL expansion entirely, the way IE doe it if "do not search from address bar" preference is selected. Didn't this only use to be done on Ctrl-Enter?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter "http://foo" (as long a host "foo" doe not exist on your local network)


Actual Results:
End up at "http://www.yeah.com/"

Expected Results:
Get an error about non-existent host if URL expansion is disabled.
