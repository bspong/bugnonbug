When the greasemonkey extension is enabled, toolbar customizations (such a adding a "new tab" button or "print" button to the navigation toolbar) only last for one session. After closing firefox (3b5) and re-opening, toolbar is reset to the default set (forward, back, refresh, stop, home) only.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Greasemonkey version 0.7.20080121.0 (the version compatible with Firefox 3b5) and enable.
2. Once Greasemonkey is enabled, view - toolbars - customize and customize the toolbar by adding additional button (such a new tab, print or bookmark buttons, doesn't matter which button are added)
3. Close Firefox program and re-open. All customizations are lost.
Actual Results:
All tool bar customizations are lost, the default set of button is restored to toolbar.

Expected Results:
Toolbar customizations should be remembered across sessions.

Tried the following step also:
Deleted the localstore.rdf file, no change in the problem.
When into safe mode and reset toolbars, no change in the problem.
I am using the default theme for firefox.
