I wanted to update/upgrade my CD-Rom - a Samsung hardware item.
I entered Samsung.com
Then I entered Products -> Office -> CD-Rom -> LiveUpdate Program
Then I clicked the blue icon for a full download of the Firmware program.

After 2 hour of "downloading" I felt I had to shut down the downloading process manually.

After that I can´t complete the download and I can´t get rid of the Samsung Firmware program. I have tried several options. The red lamp on the computer is lit up all the time . meaning that my computer is working like crazy - all the time.

Why isn´t Firefox capable of handling Samsungs Firmware?
What action do I need to take to get rid of this Firmware?

Please help me.

Oh - and by the way - I had a hard time finding this page where I couls submit my thoughts. I think it should be better exposed.
