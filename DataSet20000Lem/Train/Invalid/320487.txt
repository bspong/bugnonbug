Whenever I try to run my anti-spy program that come with my Yahoo toolbar, another window opens, and I am told to download the latest version of the Anti-Spy ware. I have the latest anti-spy ware, and when I did download the anti spy ware one time, a new download window open, and told me I had the latest version, and that the version I had just downloaded, wa an old version.

When I run the anti-spy program on IE, it work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on the anti-spy graphic.
2.click "Run Anti-Spy"
3.a new window open for me at least.




The anti-spy page should have come up, and you should be able to press the "Start Scan" botton.
