I would like some more tabbed browsing options, like those found in Galeon.

One that is very useful is an option to open new tab from link just to the
right of the current tab rather than at the end of the row. New tab opened
manually should not be affected by this option. This allows me to do the following:

Open http://www.groklaw.net/ and http://www.slashdot.org/ in two tabs. When I
middle-click on each headline on both sites, the news article for each site are
kept along the headline page for that site. In the current behaviour, the
article are opened at the end of the row, which separate them from the main
headline page. This also extends to link on the article pages, since with this
new behaviour, link would be opened just to the right of the article tab, which
improves usability and reduces clutter.

Another useful feature, although somewhat lower priority (in my opinion at
least), would be to allow tab to be rearranged with the mouse. If I want to
move a tab to some other position in the row, I should be able to just drag it
there.

Both these feature were implemented in Galeon 1.3.13, and it would be very nice
to have them here too.


Reproducible: Always
