Massive leak problem with Firefox 3.0.1 on Mac
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070206 Firefox/3.0.1

Ever since installing Firefox 3 release version (and after updating to 3.0.1), launch is unusually slow, 115 second from commencement to drawing of the initial untitled window.

In addition, the Console.app log is filled with line (takes up 10 page when pasted into a word processor) like this:

2008-07-16 17:49:00.128 firefox-bin[304] *** _NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x11504b0 of class NSCFString autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking

In the place of "NSCFString" in other line can be found "NSPathStore2" or "NSConcreteData" or "NSCFDictionary" or "NSIdEnumerator" and each of the hundred of line like this have a different offset, from 0x11504b0 to 0x11568f0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. launch Firefox
2. count time to drawing initial browser window (roughly same each time, 115 seconds)
3. check Macintosh Console.app log, same/similar entry exist
Actual Results:
100% reproducible

Expected Results:
Should have launched expeditiously without these myriad leak error
