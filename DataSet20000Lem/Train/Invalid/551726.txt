Debug build still trip bug 546909 - Firefox should not load chrome URLs dragged from plugins
Bug 546909 - Firefox should not load chrome URLs dragged from plugins wa just fixed for all branch but it turn out that on 1.9.0 and 1.9.1, the bug is still tripped in debug builds. The retail build are fine but someone should investigate why the debug build are still susceptible since it is an SG:Critical bug.

The testcase is in bug 546909.
