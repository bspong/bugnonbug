Currently smart bookmark name is too long on the limited space I have for bookmark toolbar.

I propose we rename Smart Bookmarks to Smartmarks. This would also bring parity with the Livemarks name we give to live bookmark and free up much need real estate on bookmark toolbar.

Also I propose we should have an icon, such a a star a current generic folder is very ugly on a toolbar full of favicons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Look at bookmark toolbar
2.See folder smart bookmarks.
3.
Actual Results:
Smart Bookmarks on bookmark toolbar.

Expected Results:
Should be called Smartmarks and have an icon
