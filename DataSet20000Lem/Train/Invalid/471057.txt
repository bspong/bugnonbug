On numerous web site the printed Web link information is printed on top of other Web link information. Makes it extremely difficult to read and select the desired link.

On the same websites, Internet Explorer doe not overlay this information. I know the website developer should fix this problem. It would be nice if Firefox fixed because my effort to date with the website ha resulted in nothing happening. Thanks, Glenn
