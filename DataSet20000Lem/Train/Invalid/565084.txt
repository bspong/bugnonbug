Clear History on Site Preferences clear cooky exception list. This is unexpected.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

It appears that I have found a bug in Firefox 3.6.3. Clearing Site Preferences wipe out my cooky exception list. This happens regardless of whether I have the setting to accept or reject cooky in general.

It might be argued that it is not a bug since it is documented with:
"Site Preferences: Site-specific preferences, including the saved zoom level for sites, character encoding, and the permission for site described in the Page Info window."

My argument is that the quoted material is not much for documentation, and that the behaviour violates the Law of Least Astonishment. Note that the first value have more to do with presentation. I think that this is a documentation bug. It is misleading since cooky are an entry in the clearing form. I think that clearing the cooky exception list should be a separate entry from clearing site preferences. I lost a few dozen entry because of this.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the cooky exception list. If there is nothing there, put at least one entry there.
2. Clear History specifying Site Preferences only.
3. Check the cooky exception list.
Actual Results:
After step 1, there will be at least one entry in the cooky exception list.
After step 2, there will be no entry in the cooky exception list which will be seen to be so in step 3.


Expected Results:
Cookies exception list should not be emptied.
