This issue is hardware and version related. Is present in version 3, also in latest one (20090216021015), but is not present in version 2.0.0.20 (1.8.20081.21709). Is not present on some newer hardware (Sempron, Core2Duo), but is present on a Pentium 3. My hardware is a dual CPU P3-933MHz, Via Apollo, 1GB RAM, Radeon 9800XL running XP SP3. The issue is also present in Win98 compatibility mode. The same site are loading without problem on IE6 and Firefox2.
During loading of the pages, I can see how the page loads, but at some point the system crashes, completely frozen and need a reset. It can also crash during scrolling of a fully loaded page. I have tried many option (clean install, no add-ons, new version, different video card on clean XP) and is not working. My conclusion is that Firefox 3 ha some issue with my older CPU on some sites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter address.
2. Wait for the crash.
3.



Hardware related on a P3-933MHz, crash with FF3, not with IE6 nor FF2.
