While browsing website Firefox became odd whenever i used the middle mouse click, it would go fullscreen, blank white. Sometimes my monitor would go black asif it not receieving images. this happened 3-4 time which i ignored.

Finally firefox started to produce pixel over itself, the whole window would be fine on a fresh run at start after a few second pixel start forming, the more you used firefox the worse the pixeling effect was.

i'm unaware if there ha been any other side effects.

I've tried reinstalling, to no avail. aswell a Disabling All add-ons&extensions.

i usually block all cooky but while visiting "www.modthesims.info/" i allowed a few unknown cookies. not sure if it helps. but i believe firefox ran fine until i visited it.

correction: pixelation doesn't seem to affect the window's title, and the, min/maximize/close part of the title.
