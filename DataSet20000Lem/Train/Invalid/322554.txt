Proxy is setup correctly. Firefox asks for username and password for domain. i supply correct username and Password. But Firefox keep asking but never log onto Net with information. Now When on the same System, same Proxy info, Konqueror accepts the same username and password for proxy. Then a well other People can log in with there username and Password and it will work. So now I want to know is there something in my PC or is it something in the Proxy Server

Reproducible: Always
