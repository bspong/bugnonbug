I closed a number of tabs, however when closing the last one it reopened to the left of a blank tab and I could close neither of them, a if it thought that the blank tab wa the only one.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open tab (different page differentiates between which tab is open)
2. Close them all
Actual Results:
A phantom tab of the last page you closed appears to the left of the expected blank tab and neither are closable.

Expected Results:
The tab should close and leave a blank (closable) tab.
