Today after working fine in Firefox in the am in the afternoon my (Hotmail)
mail.live.com account began to display only a blank page in Firefox 3.0.10. I
found the same result in Opera 9.64. Both the Google and Internet Explorer
browser display normally and using IE Tab it display in Firefox qua IE.

the inbox stay blank until I switch out of Firefox into IE.
http://next.my.msn.com/ open normally and report any new Hotmail emails, but
the link to the inbox result in a blank page.Thunderbird log in and download
using Webmail-Hotmail 1.2.22 is not affected and behaves a before.

This is a new instance of hotmail declining to support firefox, It is not a webmail problem--the same thing happens when the url is typed into the location window.
