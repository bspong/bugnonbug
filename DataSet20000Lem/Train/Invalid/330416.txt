please do not immediately mark this a a duplicate, a it is a request that an entire class of bug receives higher priority.

about 90% of the time, in both 1.0.7 and 1.5.0.1, the keyboard stop working for scrolling and switching tabs. it can only be restored by finding an area in the foreground tab that (you hope) is not active and clicking it once or (if you are le lucky) twice. then, after a ctrl-pgdn or a c-w, the same thing is necessary again. and again. thus, the entire point of keyboard shortcut is destroyed by the need to use the mouse.

this ha been a problem for years. i note many bug on this general topic going back to 2002, but the problem in general persists.

there are probably several different bug at work here, involving aspect of firefox internals that i know nothing about. i cannot possibly do the work to tell you which set of internals is responsible this time, or which set of circumstance trigger the bug this time, because it keep changing and it is very hard work for a disabled person to track down all this and fight with bugzilla (which seems to forget my session on almost every click despite using cooky and clicking the appropriate checkboxes) each time.

i can only conclude that keyboard focus stealing and the "ok, where are my keystroke going THIS TIME?" problem in general are extremely low priority for firefox developers.

i fully understand that firefox is complicated, but i do not fully understand why it should be necessary to use the mouse to enable using the keyboard every single time you want to use the keyboard -- year after the problem started.

because of the low priority of these bugs, i use w3m for all browsing that doe not absolutely require firefox. i'll bet i'm not the only one who stopped using firefox for this reason.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
i put happens every time because it happens every time i try to use firefox.
i am not referring to a specific set of triggering condition for the above reasons.



happens in safe mode, with tab mix plus, with 1.0.7, with 1.5.0.1, etc. in other words, always.
