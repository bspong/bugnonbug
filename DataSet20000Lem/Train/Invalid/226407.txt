Tp and TXul increase of 200ms between 11/20 & 11/21
Not sure if this is critical but I couldn't see such an increase on SeaMonkey so
I'm opening it in Firebird: Phoenix tinderbox 'redwood' show a 40ms increase in
pageload and 40ms in xulwinopen between 11/20 and 11/21.

Possible culprit: bug 222157, checkin mention 'Hook up the "find in page"
functionality in the toolkit, by adding the method find(), findAgain() and
findPrevious() and the property canFindAgain to the widget browser.xml and
tabbrowser.xml'

I understand the new feature ha a necessary pay off but an optimization can
perhaps be done ?

btw, the 40ms decrease in Tp on 11/21 seems to be due to bug 223813 comment 10.
