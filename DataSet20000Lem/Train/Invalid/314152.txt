i can't copy and paste with a mouse or my keyboard all the text on this page outside the window. Inside the windows, like all the different build window above the summary and above the URL, the Build Identifier window allowed me to copy and paste, but if i want to copy where it say Bad Example it wont' let me. It will say Copy all etc...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I can't copy and paste with keyboard or right clicking on 100 percent of the text on a page, in this window right now, I CAN copy and Paste, outside this window, I can't.
2. I've pretty much summed up my problem
3. Please fix it now.

Actual Results:
Let's say, I highlight the above sentence beginning with the word, "Describe how" after being highlighted, let's say I right click the mouse, the option given to me are a follows: Copy, then under that Select All then under that, Search web for "Describe how" and under that Selection Source. Now let's say I highlight the first word of this sentence, "Now" I am given the traditional option like Undo and below that Cut, Copy, Paste, Delete and Select All.

That is the problem in pain staking detail.

FIX IT NOW I HATE OPERA!

Expected Results:
Shit doesn't work

FUCKING WORKED FUCK!
