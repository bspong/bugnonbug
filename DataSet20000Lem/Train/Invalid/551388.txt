Firefox open multiple loopback ports. Does not close them when program is closed. Also 100% CPU Usage/Freezing.

I am certain I saw this, maybe 4 year back?

When checking for possible resource in use, that may be increasing CPU usage, or something that ha Firefox taking more then needed (since last 2 upgrades). I noticed Firefox ha multiple loopback port open. A that time there were 6 pairs. Closing the port only resulted in them being open again, however, usually just one pair is being re-initiated when they are closed.

There is no reason, at least none I can think of, for this to be opened/ing. And should be resolved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Execute Firefox.
(All that is needed)
Actual Results:
Firefox is opening a loopback, without a reason to do so, and maintaining/reopening it, when it is closed.

Expected Results:
When closed, it should remain closed. However, Firefox continues to re-open the loopback.

Appears this ha been called a 'non-issue' and not resolved for some time.

I am not certain if this problem is the cause of the hanging I have had, or the slowness. However, this time, I am certain it is not my ISP, and their fiddling (Has been before).

I am tired of being told that I have to upgrade this or that, which is already upgraded, or should not otherwise be an issue before.

If this is the cause of the CPU usage, and the hanging, then my only question is why wa it left unsolved?

Confidential? Not sure. Seems it ha been, and ignored/misplaced/forgotten.

It's NOT normal. I wouldn't say Critical, and it is not minor. Although I do not belive afeature is broken, I chose Major. Somewhat between.
