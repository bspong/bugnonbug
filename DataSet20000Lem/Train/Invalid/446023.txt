When we are submitting a file to our online database (via ColdFusion) to upload and render on our website, the code is checking to find the filename for the file. It doe this by searching the string for the last forward slash "/". In IE this work because it submits the full file path. In Firefox it only submits the filename being uploaded, not the full path, so there is no "/" to find. This throw an error when trying to upload in Firefox.


Error: Parameter 2 of function Left which is now -1 must be a positive integer

This is our code string:
17 : <cfset revPDF = #Reverse(form.thePDF)#>
18 : <cfset findSlash = #Find("\",revPDF)#>
19 : <cfset pdfTemp = #Left(revPDF, findSlash -1)#>
20 : <cfset pdfTemp = #Reverse(pdfTemp)#>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Source the file in "browse"
2. Click "Save"
3. Renders error - "Parameter 2 of function Left which is now -1 must be a positive integer"
Actual Results:
It cannot determine the name of the file because it cannot locate the root directory.

Expected Results:
It should have uploaded the file to our database.

I am marking this a a security risk because portion of our file uploading code have been included.
