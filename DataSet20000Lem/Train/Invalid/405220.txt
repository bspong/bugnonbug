I've observed a strang behaviour happening to me multiple time during one session. When browsing with multiple tabs, upon closing tab, a website wa shown that I had beviously visisted, however without the corresponding tab (see screenshot- remaining inactive tab and content shown do not match).
At that point, when entering a new URL in the location bar and hitting ENTER, nothing happens either.
