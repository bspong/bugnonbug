I have found this bug twice on two different sites, it seems that Gecko is
corrupting some fragment of the page with random bytes. The page can look ok,
then in the middle it start to show random bytes, aprox. 2-4 KB a I see it,
and then again page show ok. Show source also show the corruption. Refreshing
the page corrects the problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I cannot reproduce it, it seems to happen at random.
