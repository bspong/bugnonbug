Closing a tab sometimes doe not update window to show new document
Reproducible: No, happens rarely.

STR: Browse normally. Close a tab with ctrl+w.

Expected results: The currently-open tab should close and the browser should show one of the other, adjacent tabs.

Actual results: The tab disappears from the UI, but the window still display the old page. The window title (at the very top of the FF window) change to the new page's title. As I moved my mouse around the screen, various element from the new page which changed their appearance in response to hovering showed through the old page. I tried to take a screenshot, but pressing printscreen refreshed the display and made it correct.

I've seen this at least three time on trunk over the past two or three weeks. This may be happening because I'm running Tab Kit, but I wanted to file a bug in case other people are experiencing this issue.
