Computer freeze repetitively when using Firefox 3

Since upgrading to Firefox 3 earlier this week, my computer freeze repetitively. The freezing is initiated by a mouse click which render both mouse and keyboard inoperative.

This happens on any website including Firefox home site.

When I tried IE7, I had no problem with freezing. Right now I've switched back to Firefox 2 and all seems to be ok.

I notice the same problem being reported by other user on a number of online forums.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox to access the internet
2. Usually freeze within 2-3 minutes.
3.
