Link in history bar should also be affected by tab preference
1. History-> Show in Sidebar
2. Edit-> Preferences-> Tabs, make sure 'When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately' is UN-CHECKED
3. Right click one link from the history bar, select 'Open in New Tab'

Actually result:
The new tab will be opened, will switch to it immediately

Expected result:
The new tab will be opened, but still stay on the current tab. Should have the same behavior a open link from web page. The tab preference should also work with history links.
