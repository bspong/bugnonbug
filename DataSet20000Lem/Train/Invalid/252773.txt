Cannot enable loading tab from external URI's, installing extension cripple brower

This may encompass two issues, apologies, this is my first use of the system.

Recently installed 0.9.1 for Mac, replacing 0.8. In 0.8 clicking an external
URI (Slashdock, Thoth, Eudora) would load URI in new tab in existing window, or
open a new window if none wa available and load all subsequent URI's there.

In 0.9 the default is to open a new window.

Thought that the solution would be to install an extension to enable this
functionality. Installed Single Window 1.0, restarted. Bookmarks toolbar came
up blank, all bookmark item under the menu had disappeared, and right mouse
clicking on the tab bar produced a blank square. Restarted. Same thing.
Unistalled extension, restarted, everything returned to normal.

Tried a different extension (Tabbrowser Preferences 0.6.5), same thing happened
again. Uninstalling the extension brought the browser back to normal.

Uninstalled the theme that I had installed, went back to the default theme and
tried again. Same thing happened. Reinstalled Orbit Grey theme and tried
again, same behavior.

I have screen shot of the browser window appearance, in .png, if that would help.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install extension for tabbed browsing, both over the wire or locally by drag
and drop.
2.Restart


Actual Results:
Browser window present abnormally, no bookmarks, no tabs, funny tiny empty
square under mouse pointer on right click.

Expected Results:
Allowed me to open URI's in new tab, in existing window.
