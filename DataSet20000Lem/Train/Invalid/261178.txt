In Options: "Allow web site to instal software" trigger out virus

This option allowed to install on my PC melicious virus keylogger.trojan when
accessed the affected web site (can't remember url). In my opinion this option
should be removed or at least turned off to let turn it on manually when it's
needed.
Why I think it is caused by this browser?
1. I'm currently using only Mozilla Firefox (I'm not using other browsers)
2. I didn't open any attachments, I didn't click "ok" in any popups, etc.
4. The virus ha been existing since 2002 and I got it straight after I've
installed the Mozilla browser

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the web site that spread the virus (unfortunately can't remember the rl)
2.
3.

Actual Results:
the virus instals itself on the PC under different file names, I've found it in
dc1.exe, issas32.exe, lol.dll
