Private browsing is tagged, this will untag the "remember" tags, but the "accept cooky from sites" stay tagged.

This will give the idea that cooky are accepted, but they are not. In that case the tag should be untagged in the same way with the "remember" tags. If I'm on Google I get a warning, but the tag for accepting cooky is on, also the tag for private browsing is on.

Now you can say private is private, but there are a lot of thing handled with that private. Cookies and password might still be needed during browsing and it should ask if I want to set the cookie just for the time I visit the site. Same for password. When you go to another site, by link or by typing in an other url then your back again in private browsing. Now you have to go back to your option page in order to set or reset private browsing.

Solution might be to add a few new tag in private browsing option which will deal with cooky and passwords.
