Pages don't load correctly in Firefox 3.0pre, when GDATA InternetSecurity 2008 is installed
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008032705 Minefield/3.0pre

Since I installed GDATA InternetSecurity 2008 some page don't load correctly in Firefox 3.0pre. Mostly some graphic are missing or said to be broken. In some cases, like the example-URL the page is not fully loaded and the loading start all over again just before the statusbar reach 100 percent. The reloading doesn't stop.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install GDATA InternetSecurity 2008
2. Start Firefox 3.0pre
3. Open http://forums-de.ubi.com/eve/forums/a/frm/f/3451082194
Actual Results:
The loading doesn't finish and start again and again. The page appeares all broken. The background-graphics are missing, the text-format is wrong, the page-layout is wrong.

Expected Results:
The page should load fully once and the layout should look quite different.

This problem is not solved by switching off GDATA InternetSecurities webfilter and webcontent-controls. Firefox 2.0.0.13, Opera and Internet Explorer display the same page that are problematic for Firefox 3.0pre without a problem. I used Norton InternetSecurity before and Firefox 3.0pre had no problem loading pages. I have also tried disabling all installed extension without success.
