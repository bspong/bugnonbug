Would not open this page, my very own website.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

When trying to open my website I get a message which say "You have chosen to
open [IE icon] home.html which is a: Hypertext Document from:
http://homepage.mac.com
What should Firefox do with this file?" 'Save to disk' is checked, and I can
either cancel or save, but I can't open the page.

I have the same problem with Camino except it automatically open the page with
Internet Explorer. (My default browser is Safari) I've tried it several time
with both browser and have now trashed several copy of the home page off my
desktop.

I have five browser available so I can check my website with each one. I'm
hoping to completely eliminate Internet Explorer, but I need Firefox and/or
Camino first.
