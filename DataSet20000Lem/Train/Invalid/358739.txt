If one manually deletes page from history, but view a page with link to those pages, the link are (sometimes) still highlighted a visited links.

The assumption is that URLs manually deleted from history somehow still remain there, even though they are not visible.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear history
2. Visit a site
3. In history side panel, manually delete all reference to that site
4. Exit Firefox and restart
5. Visit a page that link to the site (e.g. Google a term where that site show up)

Actual Results:
Often (but not always) the page is highlighted a having been visited, even though the entry for that page ha been manually cleared from history.



Expected Results:
The page should not show up a having been visited
