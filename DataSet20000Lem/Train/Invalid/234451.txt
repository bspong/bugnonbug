System crash

after a while running firefox becomes very slow, and with it the whole system.
The disk becomes very noisy, and if I am not quick enough to kill firefox, the
whole system crashes.

My theory is that it is a memory leak. Perhaps it happens only when java and/or
flashplayer wa active - but I am not sure.
