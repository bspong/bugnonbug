Star button is a pixel too tall, thus it doesn't line up with the location bar

just open the browser and take a look at the Star button on Mac. I think it is one, maybe two, pixel too tall. It should line up neatly with the top of the location bar.

a aside; should that same button's edge be style more softly? like the go button? There need to be consistency in styling with these "location bar related buttons" see 395248 for Larry button problems.
