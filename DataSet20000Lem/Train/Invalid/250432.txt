Within digitallyimported.com there are 2 sections, one provides free streams,
the other provides a "Premium Section". When telling firefox to always use
winamp with the free stream it doe so and never asks which application to use.
In the premium section of the site, even though audio/x-scpls is set to always
use winamp, it will always ask.
I've been granted permission to use their premium section for the purpose of
tracking down this particular bug. To maintain their security, I have collected
the HTTP header for the .pls file for both section and will attach them. The
header are different for each section (mainly in term of content-disposition).
It may be that the header are in error, but none the less, it is odd that
mozilla will ask anyway, since it correctly identifies the content-type.
