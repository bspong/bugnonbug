When launching FF3 for the first time after fresh computer restart it work fine. Then if you close all tabs, and try to reenter FF3, the browser border will show up with no home page or anything else at all etc. You have to go to your process manager where firefox.exe is running and listed many times, close them all then restarting FF3 will work fine a normal. I found that the Skype addon that wa enabled wa causing this but have no idea why. I have disabled it and FF3 run a normal now.
