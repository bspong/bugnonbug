When using the search bar the default google search is in German for Irish Users. All result are from .de and not .ie

I have tested this on several Windows PCs and Mac OsX machine runing XP / OsX 10.4

My regional setting on the machine are set to English (Ireland). I have edited the individual search config file on the mac/pc to correct the problem

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Region to English (ireland)
2. Run Firefox
3. Search using searchbar default
Actual Results:
Results in German
http://www.google.de/search?q=firefox&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a

Expected Results:
Results in English but Irish version of Google firefox

Result should have been this:
