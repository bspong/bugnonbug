Consistent memory leak & eventual crash, even in safe mode with all add-on & plug-in disabled

I am running WinXP SP3, with Firefox 3.09 at this time. The only extension is Java QuickStarter, but I have a number of plug-ins. Firefox keep crashing on me, and nothing seems to make any difference, even disabling all add-ons, extensions, & plug-ins, or even starting in "Safe" mode.

These are the problem I've been having:

- Firefox ha a severe memory leak problem that seems related to the number of page (tabs) that you have open at any one time, but even occurs with only a single blank tab.
- With many tab open, CPU utilization go to 100% and stay there until it crashes. This is not always the case, especially if only a few tab are open.
- Problems with crashing have been happening consistently since v3.0 came out, and is still a problem with v3.10. It may have existed before, but I never noticed it.
- The Crash Report utility doesn't come up most of the time when Firefox crashes.
- The Crash Report utility couldn't send crash report when it DID come up (it say something about how it encountered a problem sending the report). This seemed to change only once I had created a Bugzilla account (I can't verify this because the Crash Report utility ha only tried to send a report once since then).
- Crashes continue even with all extension disabled, or starting in "Safe" mode.
- Complete removal and reinstallation make no difference; it still develops the memory leak and crashes.
- Monitoring my system using the "Windows Task Manager", I can see the Page File continually increasing in size, and with "Process Explorer" I can see an ever increasing number of Page Faults. This is all while there doe not appear to be any read/write activity (either to the hard drive or the Internet). "Process Explorer" also report an ever increasing number of "context switches" (until, of course, when it crashes).
- This problem in repeatable EVERY time I run Firefox, on my main system or on either of 2 other computer (1 with XP Home SP3, the other with XP MCE SP3)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Windows Task Manager
2. Open Firefox. It doesn't matter if you have only a single blank tab or not, but the more tab open the faster the memory leak.
3. Windows Task Manager can be used to watch how memory usage increase continually. This applies to the Page File usage a well. Usage continues until it can't handle it any more, then it crashes.
Actual Results:
Many time when it had crashed in the past, I got a pop-up with the following error message:

Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library
X Runtime Error!
Program: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

This application ha requested the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way.
Please contact the application's support team for more information.



Expected Results:
It will ALWAYS crash. It's only a matter of how fast.
