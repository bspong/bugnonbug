I Have used firefox for quite sometime. I updated the firefox to the new 1.5.0.4. and it worked for a couple week then just stopped working at all. I uninstalled then re installed and still no luck. When I uninstalled it did say firefox wa open and if I clicked here it would close all firefox running. Before doing my un install I did ck for virus and and cleaned out my computer ran my defrag for regular maint. then I moved on to the uninstall because none of that worked. even when re installing firefox is not opening or working at all.
Thanks
Vicki
