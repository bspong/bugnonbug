The related URL using the latest nightly build sucked up all my memory when I first opened it up.

I closed the tab and reopened it to see how it would react though it did not use up nearly a much memory a it did initially (testing may require to disable cache?)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL.
2. Clear your cache and visit the URL.
Actual Results:
With virtual memory disabled since I have 2GB of system memory I received a virtual memory notice about running low on memory. Had to close tab to watch memory usage the second time I loaded the page since I could not open the task manager. I'm only using about 733MB before I opened the page.

Expected Results:
Well the page should only use a much memory a the content that exists on it. That mean a 60MB page should only add 60MB to Firefox though if that isn't the case it definitely should NOT soak up over a gigabyte!
