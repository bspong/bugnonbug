1. I have already discussed deletion of Close Tabs function deleted from File Pulldown Menu, deleting an important capability.

2. Also deleted wa Bookmark Pulldown Menu Listing called "Manage Bookmarks" which wa a very useful function which opened a separate page where the bookmark entry could be organized into folders, etc in a passive environment.

3. This ha been deleted, and now there is just the bookmark pulldown list comprising both bookmarks, and subfolders which can be added to the list and named. But it is very difficult to drag bookmark into these sub folders, without some other bookmark on the way being unintentionally selected. When that happens of course the corresponding page opens, closing the bookmark pulldown, and leaving the bookmark that wa being dragged. back in it original place.

4. Also, when selecting a folder entry in Bookmarks, it is not then possible to select a subfolder by eg r-click - you can only open a single level, and then open the sub-folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Bookmark list to long.
2.Add (sub)folder in bookmark list to reduce length of list.
3. Try to drag bookmark into subfolder.
4. In the process, unintentionally select bookmark being dragged over.
5. Corresponding (unwanted page opens) aborting process of Bookmark management.

Actual Results:
Can't organize bookmark into efficient tree.

Expected Results:
Expect Firefox to work like v 3.5.

Make v 3.5 available for those who don't appreciate "efficiencies" made by deleting important function like "Close Tab" and "Manage Bookmarks", etc.

Enhance Firefox by restoring deleted functions, eg by reverting to superior previous version.
