Is there a way to change the order on the right click menu?
I am used to it having open link in new tab ON TOP since I have been using
netscape 7 for a long time and mostly browse tabbing dozen of page at a time
I find the switch in firefox very clumsy and irritating. the order is flipped
having open NEW window on top. I thought tabbed browsing wa the rave now you have
seperate windowed browsing more preferred on that menu. I tend to browse the web
using one hand and my center mouse button is set to double click in windows.
