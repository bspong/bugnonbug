I have been running trunk build since last year, and lately firefox ha started to become extremely slow in closing down. To the point where it take around 3-4 second after you've hit the 'X' or File->Quit before it actually close down. I've found that if you remove your profile folder and start fresh, firefox close instantly again. However over time it slowly take longer and longer to close. I'm not seeing this behavior with firefox 3b5 on my winxp partition, so it might be Linux only.

Reproducible: Always
