I have a cv build (two build in a row)
that ha done this behavior...

autoscroll 1.0r3

also: I turned off middle mouse paste in the background (it's in about:config)
I wa sick of having wrong URLs load when I middle mouse clicked in the background

anyway, if I middle click to paste something from the X clip board, the
autoscroll icon come up.

Another possible fix to this issue is better X and clipboard integration... I
don't know how that would work because I hate hight=paste because I highlight to
delete.. and paste over what is highlighted (but that is digressing)

I also have it so that I can middle click on a tab and have it go away (I think
it wa the same option that fixed that)

oh, that option need to be off by default (middle mouse button click open new url)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install autoscroll
2.turn
3.

Actual Results:
no paste, had to work arround by opening a page with a text field to paste into
then highight and copy using Mozilla's clipboard
