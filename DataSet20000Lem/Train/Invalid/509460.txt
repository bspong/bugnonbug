If you try to open a website that ha php installed it will come up with the index.php save a or open dialog, if you click save a and click do this automaticlly it will open 200+ window or tab in every firefox browser you have open. This will make you lose all your window and work a it cant save anything because it a buffer over run.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a site with the index.php file my site (nerdcustoms.com)
2.firefox will ask to save a or open
3.click the check box that say do this automatically every time and click open
Actual Results:
it crash firefox by buffer over flow with window of 200+

Expected Results:
should have opened my website like it used to.

Please let me know what caused this or how to patch it. I have been told that I should submit a bug to the web so others can know, however I find that to be a complete unethical thing to do considering it would give the problem maker something to crash others with.
