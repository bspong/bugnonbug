An HTML page reference an external CSS file. The first style is ignored. We had to add a dummy style for a tag that we don't use.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Expand attached archive.
2. File/Open test.html.
Actual Results:
Font is serif and small.

Expected Results:
CSS say BODY style should be sans-serif and 200%.

Remove the comment char from around the Q style and retest. The font of the page will change to sans-serif and 200% a expected.

I chose Q because we don't use it. Any tag not used in the HTML would work a well. Also, you can specify the first style for the P tag instead of BODY. It ha the same effect, so the issue is not specific to the Q or BODY styles.
