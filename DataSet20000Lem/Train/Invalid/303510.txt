Upon accepting firefox update, can no longer connect to any website
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

Having to use IE to report this problem (blah) because I accepted the Firefox
1.0.6 update. Any URL report URL could not be found. Have checked and no
configuration setting are changed and am also using the default setting (no
proxy etc.) The only thing that I can think that might be different from
most user is that I have a local lan at home and the PC (this one) is the one
I updated and it provides the dial-up to the internet. (Standard internal
modem and window configured for share this device.). I suspect that Firefox
1.0.6 is going to eth0 to do the DNS lookup and I have no DNS on my local lan.

?Maybe?
