There is an issue with the Proto theme (OS X Leopard/3.0b2) that involves an extra, out-of-place UI element in the location bar on non-secured pages.

Look at the location bar in the picture. Notice something up? There is an extra UI element that should not be there in the Proto theme, 3.0b2. Said UI element show up only on non-secured pages, so I do not see it on page such a the bug report one or some login page for website services.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The theme issue is shown at all time when the page in the location bar doe not have security; page such a the Report a Bug page on Bugzilla show up fine.
Actual Results:
(Not applicable: this issue show up all the time)

Expected Results:
The UI element should not be there on such non-secured pages.

The bug only occurs in the Proto theme on Firefox 3.0b2 (not a nightly build). Running a MacBook with Leopard and a Core 2 Duo (2.2GhZ) processor, a well a Firefox, Adium, Adobe CS3, and a wireless network connection via AirPort.
