Vertical scrollbar work incorrect new tab opened.
How to reach error: open new page in new window where is a lot of data inside
(vertical scrollbar is shown). Then open next page in new tab (Ctrl+T, tab is
opened in same window, that's right). Return back to 1st tab and all page is
shifted down by tabbar height and can't be scrolled till the end. I solve this
now by resizing all window manually.
