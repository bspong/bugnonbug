build id can go into Info.plist on Mac build
The Info.plist file in the application's main bundle on a Mac is just an arbitrary dictionary. It would be useful to include a "Build ID" key-value pair in there.

For one thing, this might help on the problem that occurs when the user ha more than one version of the browser and double-clicks on an HTML file. One can play launchservices bingo, or we can allow launchservices to make a smarter choice by checking the application's build id. Unless the build id is not available to the system.

Also, one would not have to launch an application to find it build id.

Actually, I am not sure what can be done. It is an enabling feature, so it enables stuff we might not think of right now.
