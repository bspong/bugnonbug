Build Identifier: Firefox Setup 2.0.0.14.exe

Firefox wa working a advertised until SP3 for XP wa downloaded from MS and installed. Then Firefox would not start/open. Specifically, after clicking on Firefox the hourglass appears briefly and then disappears. Checked task manager, nothing happening. Waited 5 minute and checked task manage again, nothing happening.

Uninstalled Firefox. Downloaded and installed a clean version of Firefox Setup 2.0.0.14.exe from Mozilla website. Firefox will not open.

Checked the MS website for issue with XP SP3, found a note that only IE7 work with XP SP3, earlier version of IE will not work. Perhaps that is the issue with Firefox.

Went to Control Panel (on my PC), then to Set Program Access and Defaults. Mozilla Firefox is listed, but not checked. So I checked it. Upon clicking OK the selection default back to Use Default Browzer. Firefox will not open/start.

Back to Control Panel (on my PC), then to Set Program Access and Defaults. Removed access to IE. Upon clicking OK, selection default back to permitting access to IE.

This PC is part of a 2 PC network. The other PC OS remains XP SP2 and Firefox work without issue.
