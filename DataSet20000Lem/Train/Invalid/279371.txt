I have popup blocking enabled. However, about once every few days, I will see a
popup. Thinking the site must somehow be on my popup whitelist, I open
Tools->Options->Web Features. But before I get to the whitelist, I can see that
the checkbox for "Block Popup Windows" is unchecked. So I recheck it and
everything is fine again. But later in the week it will happen again, and a
quick check of the option will confirm that it's disabled again.
