Mistyped bookmark keywords are being sent to external site when match not found

I have keywords set up for my most frequently used bookmarks. However, when I
mistype a keyword I end up being sent to randomly selected sites. If FireBird
cannot find a match for a keyword it should *stop* and say so - it should *not*
be sending me to unrelated site - especially not to porn sites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up a keyword for a bookmark.
2. Go to the address bar and deliberately mistype the keyword.
3.

Actual Results:
In one very annoying case, I managed to mistype "ebbs" (for ESPN BaseBall
Scores) and ended up being sent to Google - which prompty redirected me to a
porn site.

In another case, I typed "ca" instead of "caa" (for Canadian Automobile Assoc)
and ended up being sent to www.cai.com.

Expected Results:
FireBird should have searched my bookmark for a match to the mistyped keyword
and when no match wa found it should have *stopped* and told me so.
