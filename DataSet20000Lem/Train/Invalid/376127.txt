Firefox doesn't disassociate an html file that is clicked when trying to save a web page even if you rename it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save a website.
2. Save a website and click the previous website you saved to your computer.
3. Rename the website title in your dialog box.
4. Click a blank space in the dialog box.
5. Try to save the website without overwriting the previous one.
Actual Results:
I have to move up a level (or you could go into another folder in the dialog box) and then go back to the same folder so that firefox doesn't try to overwrite the other file I clicked.

Expected Results:
To be able to rename a file and not be asked if I want to overwrite the file I clicked on but took the focus off and which ha a different title.

I do that a a quick way of making a website have a similar title so I don't have to retype it all. I forgot I could just click the down button in the title field of the dialog box to get the previous name of the last file I mentioned, but that won't always work if you didn't just save a similarly named website, so the annoyance remains. Regardless it shouldn't be asking me if I want to overwrite a file that doesn't have the same name, at the very least not more then once.
