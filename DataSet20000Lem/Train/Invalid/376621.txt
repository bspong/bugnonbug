Long time FF user, had latest 1.5 (1.5.0.11), upgraded to latest 2.0 (2.0.0.3). Immediately, upon mouse-over on any link in any page, the entire pulldown menu text appears overlaid on the open tab (the tab themselves), obscuring the tab label. Right-clicking the tab toolbar bringing up it context menu, the tab appear normal again.
This did not occur on my test virtual machine(s), but doe on my laptop, screen resolution 1600x1200. Add-on theme that modify tab appearance doe not change the anomaly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open one or more tabs, or at least have the tab toolbar visible
2. Mouse over any link
3. One way to restore to normal is right-click on the tab toolbar, bringing up it context menu. As soon a I do, the tab appear normal again. Minimizing the FF window and restoring seems to restore the tab also. Activating any portion of the pulldown menuing system doe not restore normal.
CTRL+T to open a new tab restores to normal, clicking the X to close that last opened tab reverts back to garbled tab text again.
Actual Results:
I have saved a screenshot if that helps. Describing, I have three tab open (including this one). Each tab, a well a it's tab text (I.E. "Enter A Bug"), also ha jumbled with it "File Edit View History Bookm" - the main pulldown menu. The last "m" is cut off where the tab width run out of space.

Expected Results:
The tab should remain with their own text of course.

Dell Inspiron 8200 @ 1600x1200. Video adapter say it a GeForce2 Go. FF 1.x.x always worked fine (througout 1.5, and long before). I have extension that might be relevent: Duplicate Tab, IT Tab (report to be fine in 2.x), Google toolbar.
Windows 2000 SP4, latest update (as of yesterday, 4/4/07). Computer otherwise very solid, no other bugs.
I almost want to say this is a major problem, a it effectively remove the advantage of having tab (I noticed it within second of trying the new version), but wanted to reserve "major" for a little worse than this.
Contact for screenshots or whatever.
