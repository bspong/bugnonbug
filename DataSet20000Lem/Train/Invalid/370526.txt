adt.xpi ha bad version of DOM Inspector
Not sure where this goes.

I went to install adt.xpi from:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5.0.9/win32/xpi

Since we don't deliver the dev tool with the IBM Firefox.

The version in the install.rdf in this package are wrong, so the DOM Inspector doesn't work.

The version all have "pre" after them.
