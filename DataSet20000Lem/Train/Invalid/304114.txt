The dhtml game on this page (and all others on this site) monitor key event
for control. In this build of Deerpark Alpha 2, the keyboard seems to
get 'stuck' while playing the game. At a certain point, the keyboard stop
responding to new key presses, and will not recognize key being released.
This is the first build that I have noticed this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load dhtml JS on page www.def-logic.com/swarm/swarm.html
2. press Z key to start game. Navigate ship around using IJKL and fire with Z
key.
3. Continue to move around the screen for about 15 second until keyboard
lock up.

Actual Results:
The keyboard lock up. Deerpark doe not recognize new key events, and will
not release current key event.

Expected Results:
When the game control key are released, Deerpark should not continue
triggering a key event.
