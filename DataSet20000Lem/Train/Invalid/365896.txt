parens and bracket are properly mirrored, but double and single curly quote are not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. write web page with hebrew in dir=rtl
2. surround text with curly quote
3. observe how they're not mirrored per http://unicode.org/reports/tr9/#Mirroring
Actual Results:
quotation mark not mirrored

Expected Results:
quotation mark mirrored

this fails on the PC and succeeds on OSX.
