The GIF image created with the Davis Instruments Weatherlink 5.5 program appear
to be in GIF 87a format. The wind direction image is currently not displaying in
Firefox 1.0 (was also a problem in 0.9.3). Viewing these image with Internet
Explorer 6 display them correctly.

Other GIF image in GIF 89a format appear correctly in Firefox.

I accept there may be an issue with the creation of these images, but I cannot
understand why 3 out of 4 appear OK in Firefox and all appear OK in IE6.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just view the page, any time.
2.
3.
