Inconsistent button appearance in default Firefox theme
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

The basic navigation button in Firefox (Prev/Next/Reload/Stop/etc) appear a
black-symbol-surrounded-by-a-black-box.

The other buttons, such a Bookmarks, Downloads, New Tab, etc, appear a
colorful icon without any surrounding black box.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 0.8
2. Click View > Toolbars > Customize
3. Drag the Bookmarks, Downloads and New Tab button to the toolbar
4. Click OK

Actual Results:
Two completely different button type appear in the toolbar, looking very
mis-matched.

Expected Results:
Consistent button appearances. The basic nav button seem to be vaguely based on
those found in Mac OS X Help Viewer, and to a lesser extent, Safari. However, a
much better role-model would be Mac OS X Mail, Disk Utility, Camino, etc, which
use a very recognisable Cocoa look-and-feel (ie: keep the color buttons, replace
the black one and make it look more like a Cocoa application). Also note that
the Safari-style button appear on Metal/"textured" appearance applications,
such a Address Book, Safari, 10.3's Finder, not "white" Aqua applications.
