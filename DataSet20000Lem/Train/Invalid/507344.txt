FireFTP explorer display wrong icon for file in the local explorer everytime the name of the file itself or the name of it parent directory contains special character (like we do in French). It give the icon of a directory instead of icon of the type of file defined by the extension of the filename.
Nevertheless, this doe not affect the process of publishing or downloading files, which work properly with filename containing special character – providing everything is in Unicode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use FireFTP
2. Have filename and foldernames with special charactes (like français or dépliant)
3. Observe the icon at the left of filename in the local explorer



This doe not affect the function of the programm
