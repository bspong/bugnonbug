I have both firefox 3.5 and minefield since last update to firefox i can not run both at the same time, whichever one is started first it will cuttoff the other from starting. ie. start minefield first FFicon pull up minefield and vise versa.
I tried to restart both but to no avail. If i restart my OS and pick one i can start it but then the other is blocked.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
I believe it wa working fine before last update to FF, but could be wrong a i dont use FF everyday. I tend to try to use minefield more.

I have not found a workaround, nor have i gotten any error message regarding the issue.
