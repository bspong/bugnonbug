I downloaded Firefox 3.0b4 to replace my v2.x browser. When I first started the beta, Smart Bookmarks wa where it should be: at the extreme left of my bookmark toolbar. I then quit Firefox and restarted it. Now Smart Bookmarks wa missing! Restarting Firefox did not bring it back. Reinstalling the beta also did not restore Smart Bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Replace an older version of Firefox with 3.0b4 and leave all profile preference file untouched.
2. Start 3.0b4. Smart Bookmarks should be present.
3. Quit then restart 3.0b4.
Actual Results:
Upon restarting 3.0b4, Smart Bookmarks is missing.

Expected Results:
Smart Bookmarks is still present at the extreme left of the bookmark toolbar.
