I am noticing that when a JPEG image is out of the visible window range, the image won't be displayed until AFTER the scroll bar move down to that point in the page, even though the entire page is done loading. To see what I mean, load the above page and SLOWLY scroll the page down, watching the Actor/Actress image at the top of the page and the Movie Recommendations flash before being completely drawn on the page.

Reproducible: Always
