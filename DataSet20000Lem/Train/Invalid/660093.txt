There is a lot of website in the list, that I've never visited. I suspect it's something that Spybot - Seach & Destroy does, or Advanced System Care 4, about protecting the user from malicious sites, that includes these entries.

And the loading of thousand of website give me the warning.
(I'm on a very old system - Pentium 4, 3GHz)

Could the Firefox Team find out which program is, and find out if it's something that can be fixed on your side, or contact the other developer to fix it on their end?


Reproducible: Always
