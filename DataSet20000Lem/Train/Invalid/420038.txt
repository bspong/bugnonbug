Since the Sun Java 1.6.0_03, applet not able to connect to host server. It's generally occured when the network connection is created in a Javascript call to the applet (LiveConnect). The problem doe not occure if url use IP, but occurs when url use domaine name.
The problem never occured with Internet Explorer 6 or 7, it's why I post the bug here.

It's a really important problem, because of many application on the web, which are using Java Applet doe not work anymore when browsing with FireFox.

It's not the same bug a the old one :
