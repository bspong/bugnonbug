Fire fox cannot work without an internet connection present.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

If there is no internet at start of opening firefox it freezes.

If the internet connection is shut down during a firefox session but then is reconnected afterwards, firefox crash requiring a shutdown by mean of task manager.

Firefox doe not handle no-internet exception properly - almost like it doe not know what to do with the exception.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox with internet connection avialable
2. Turn off internet connection
3. Try to browse local html file stored on PC's hard-drive
4. The browser will freeze and be unresponsive ( usually necessitating a restart)
5. Also if trying to start firefox without internet connection present, browser freezes.

Actual Results:
1. Browser freeze in almost all cases, causing the screen to blank out if the mouse is used to try to persist to recover.

Expected Results:
The browser should never freeze if an internet connection is not present - it should within 30 second come back with an error message if necessary stating that no internet connection. Users should be able to view downloaded html file located on their computer without having to have an internet connection. ( I understand that the browser (intelligent browser ) will try to make a connection to the internet on being started at first ( maybe 15 to 30 sec should be enough) but afterwards it should accept that there is no internet connection and allow the browser to be used locally on file on the PC's harddrive.

Internet Explorer doe not cause this problem.

I first noticed this problem with firefox 4 but not under firefox 3.

Also firefox update recently keep trying to update my computer but nothing happens except a dialog box keep running for hour stating that it is updating ???
