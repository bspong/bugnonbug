Steps to reproduce:

Steps to replicate:
1. Set up multi-monitor set up, a follows:
Monitor A is Windows' main monitor (i.e. ha the taskbar), and ha a LOWER RESOLUTION than Monitor B.
Monitor B ha a HIGHER RESOLUTION than Monitor A, and is located on the RIGHT, with the bottom edge of the two monitor aligned, such that Monitor B extends above the top of the primary monitor (due to it's higher resolution).
2. Launch Firefox and maximize it on Monitor B.
3. Launch the Add-ons Manager window.


Actual results:

The Add-ons Manager window open on Monitor A, non-maximized, but too big for the screen, such that the title-bar is not visible (it is past the top of the screen).

It seems to be opening at a size that would fill Monitor B - however, because Monitor A is lower resolution, it doesn't fit, and part of the window are cut off.


Expected results:

- The Add-ons Manager window should open on Monitor B (the same monitor a the Firefox window from which it wa launched)
- The Add-ons Manager window should open maximized -OR- the code that determines initial size need to be more rigously tested to work approriately in the circumstance outlined above. i.e. the window should always launch entirely visible within the constraint of the monitor's resolution.
