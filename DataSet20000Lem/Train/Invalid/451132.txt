After different proxy are entered for HTTPS, FTP, SSL, GOPHER and SOCKS, re-opening the Connection Settings dialog doe not populate the proxy textboxes with the exception of the HTTP Proxy textbox.

This doe not stop the proxy setting from working, they appear to simply not be loading into the Proxy field after being set and the dialog reopened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox, click Tools, Options, Advanced, Network, Settings
2. Specify a proxy server and untick 'Use this proxy server for all protocols'
3. Specify a different proxy for HTTPS or any of the other protocol
4. Click OK
5. Click Settings again
Actual Results:
HTTPS Proxy, FTP Proxy, SSL Proxy, GOPHER Proxy and SOCKS Host textboxes are empty

Expected Results:
Proxy textboxes should be populated with the proxy and port number entered in step 2-3.

Occurs in firefox-3.1a2pre a well.

Seems to be a similar issue to Bug 321807, but that didn't occur in 3.0.1
