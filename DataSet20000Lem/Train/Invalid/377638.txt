firefox hang in waitpid system call if java_vm is running

Sometimes firefox hangs, and I strace it, getting:
waitpid(-1, ...

Which mean it is waiting for all child to exit. This would all be fine, except when a Java applet is running, java_vm is a child process of Firefox. That mean that instead of the waitpid call taking a fraction of a second waiting for some worker program I assume, it just hangs. This could concievably be a problem if any plugin or extension ha generated a child program attached to firefox-bin, so I don't think it's a Java's fault.

I thought I could "fix" it by killing java_vm, but that just made firefox crash.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
I really am not sure what cause it. Java need to be running.



I will get a stack trace next time the bug occurs, and maybe do some poking.
