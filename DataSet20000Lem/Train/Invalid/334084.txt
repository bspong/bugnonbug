When the : ' key is pressed, when not typing in a form/just browsing, the Find Function (the same one accessed from the Ctrl + F command) appears. Doesn't seem to be a way to disable this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure not in a form or address bar, in normal page browsing
2. Press the : ' key which on my keyboard is also the: @ key when shift is pressed.
3. The find bar should appear like Ctrl + F is pressed

Actual Results:
Find function appears.

Expected Results:
Nothing, unless the key is somehow allocated a another find shortcut.

Occurs with any key and happens to a few other user I have spoken to on a separate forum.
