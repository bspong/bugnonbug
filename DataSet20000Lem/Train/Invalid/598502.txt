Bookmark (star) icon and RSS icon obscured by link info
The bookmark (star) icon and RSS icon are covered by the new link URL info pop-up. This is okay normally, but when a link ha focus, this make it impossible to access these two function without first clicking away from the link. This happens when tabbing to links, and even more commonly, when opening link in new tabs/windows using the middle click. These icon should not be obscured.
