The bookmarks.html got overwrtitten with a new one containing only the Personal
toolbar folder (in finnish "Kirjanmerkkipalkin kirjanmerkkikansio") after
upgrading Firefox. The original version of Firefox wa 1.0 Finnish language
version, the upgrade version wa 1.0.1 Finnish version.


Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
This is about the sequence I executed

1. Install Firefox 1.0 Finnish language version a root to directory /opt/firefox
2. Use firefox for few months, add some extensions, save bookmarks, change
various setting
3. Stop firefox :)
4. Empty the directory where firefox wa installed (in this case /opt/firefox)
5. Run firefox 1.0.1 installer with sudo: "sudo ./firefox-installer" and install
again to /opt/firefox
6. Launch firefox a normal user right after installation dialog disappears,
before installation ha launched firefox
7. Choose to start the browser a Default User when the "profile chooser" appears.
8. Close the complaint dialog about profile being in use already and all firefox
window
9. Restart firefox

Actual Results:
Bookmarks and bookmark toolbar were empty. The bookmarks.html file only
contained the folder for Personal toolbar, but no bookmark at all.

Expected Results:
Bookmarks should have remained untouched after upgrade.

The OS version wa SuSE Linux Professional 9.2 with default KDE desktop.

The following Firefox extension were installed: Adblock v.5 d2 nightly 39, FLST
0.8.1, ReloadEvery 0.5, TabScroller 0.6, LastTab 1.0.5,

Default theme wa used.

I'm not sure if the problem is related to the actual upgrade or if launching the
browser right after installation dialog did something nasty. Anyway the
bookmark are gone, but luckily everything else in the profile seems to be OK
including settings, extension and home page. I tried to reproduce the bug a
another user but of course I wa unable to reproduce it.

The bookmarks.html originally inlcuded link in several directories, few RSS
feed and couple of bookmarklets.
