When you highlight something on any web page and right mouse click, the option for "Copy Plain Text" (that I used religiously) no longer appears in the new version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Highlight text on any web page
2. Right mouse click

Actual Results:
Only the "Copy" option exists.

Expected Results:
In previous version of Firefox, there wa both the "Copy" option AND a "Copy Plain Text" option.

Please bring this feature back! It's one of the main reason I use Firefox.
