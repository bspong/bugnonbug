Temporary file on OS X are no longer deleted on shutdown with browser.helperApps.deleteTempFileonExit set to true

With the patch on bug 302433 we have a pref (browser.helperApps.deleteTempFileonExit) which control if temporary file will be deleted on shutdown of Firefox. Lately I've noticed that this will not happen anymore with a trunk build.

Steps:
1. Open about:config, create a new boolean value with the name browser.helperApps.deleteTempFileonExit and give it the value true
2. Search on Google for a PDF file
3. Open this PDF file with an external helper application
4. Close the helper application
5. Close Firefox

As you can see the temporary file which wa downloaded to the Desktop doesn't get removed.

We have to check, when this regressed. I'll try to get the regression range in the next days.
