Ever since downloading version 2.0.0.3, Firefox hang (hourglass and no arrow) at random and frequently making it impossible to use the browser for more than a few second or a few minutes. The only thing that can be done is close the browser and reopen it only to have the problem arise again soon thereafter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser.
2. Occurs at random.
Actual Results:
Browser must be closed and restarted.

Expected Results:
Not hang.

This occurs with the default theme.
