Apple website load first few item (no graphics) and then stops. I know it is
not my network, because IE6 running on the same machine load Apple's site
without hitch. I have had this problem with no other site, which suggests
something wrong with the HTTP transaction specifically related to Firefox and
Apple. I have disabled AdBlock, to no effect. The page suddenly appears after 1
minute approx but Firefox still doe not download any images.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/
2. Wait 1 minute. "Waiting for images.apple.com"
3. Rest of page finally loads. Still no images.



Expected Results:
Apple should load instanteously (I have a broadband connection). IE6 ha no problem.
