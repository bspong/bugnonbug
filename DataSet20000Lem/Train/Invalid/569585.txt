In Fx3.7a4/Linux (tested just here), item in toolbars whose place have been customized or habe been added or removed are reset in _new windows_ (and not at restart like in bug 319196).

At restart, in the first window, item are right at the chosen place.

1. Open MozillaDeveloperPreview/3.7a4. Firefox is opened, and the first window is great, all is where it wa customized for.
2. Open a new Firefox window.

The layout of all the new window should be the same than the first one, with item in toolbars like the user have defined them.

If you close all window and restart Firefox, no problem, the first window is right.
