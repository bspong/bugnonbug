I noticed this in Fire fox 2 and now in 3. I am not sure if it is just a software bug in the Wireless mouse software or in the browser, but it doesn't happen in IE that I can tell. After half an hour or more of scrolling with a scroll wheel the page start to stick to the top of the page. WHen I try to scroll down either with the wheel or the sidebar scroll handle the page zoom up to the top again. Only after restarting firefox doe it go away, but then it will come back again after 20 ot 30 minute of surfing. Occurs in firefox 2 but not a often. Using Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0 Model 1008

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Scroll with wireless mouse scroll wheel
2. Surf and scroll continuously for 30 minute
3. You might get lucky and it come into action but I can't tell what the trigger action is
Actual Results:
The problem come back, a described above. Restart fix it. If I don't use the scroll wheel and use only the sidebar scroll I have no problem.
