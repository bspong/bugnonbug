1. Firefox is run, used for a while.
2. I do something else (play piano, etc.)
3. Come back to use it - it's in memory (seen in Task Manager), but no screen, no tab, nothing can be found!
4. Exit Firefox via Task Manager, start all over again.

Another instance of "disappearing screen" when I exited G-Mail. Logged out and poof, no Firefox.

Don't know how long needed to wait. Last time it wa about 6 hour (during the night).

Am reporting, but am not certain these step create problem -- maybe it's an add-on issue?

Expected Results:
Should be displayed a I left it.

Am having input problem too; Typing a URL take a while because program seems to be freezing. Letters appear slowly. Could this be AVG security suite? Don't know, but it's really annoying. Getting anything done take too much time.

At this moment, however, thing seem normal (no slow downs).
