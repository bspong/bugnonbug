The new version ha really messed up the Sage RSS reader. The main problem is when a website is unavailable for any reason, the reader "sticks" trying to access that site and won't move on. This mean I can't read any site in the RSS list lower than the site that is down.

In addition, the new post don't light up after clicking "check feeds" until I mouse over them. Why is that? Also, the option to only show new feed (ie feed I haven't already read) is gone - now I see the whole list including site that haven't updated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.From within Sage, click "check feeds"
2.
3.
Actual Results:
See "details"

Expected Results:
See "details"

Why did I upgrade? It wa working fine before.
