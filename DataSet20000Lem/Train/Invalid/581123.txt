When accessing directly a personal page, for example: http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/pages/Haier/68476763398?ref=s
Once initiated the process starts.
change to:
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Haier/68476763398?ref=s
change to:
http://www.facebook.com/Haieramerica?ref=s

Once this process is completed the website go to a done status and doe not come up.

I have tried this to business and personal page from many on my list and the same occurs every time.

I am one of the IT Administrators for Haier America and one of our user reported the issues, in this case for our own company's Face book profile and the result in the investigation came to be a Firefox specific issue. Internet explorer for example in this respect pull up the link successfully.

Please advise and assist if possible.
Thank you for all of your hard work to make Firefox our browser of choice.

3. Status go to done and doe not come up.
Actual Results:
Status go to done and doe not come up.


Expected Results:
To hit the website I requested.

Have provided insight to the issue and created a log file of the occurrence with an option to send this to Mozilla if the result wa a Firefox software problem a it ha turned out to be in this case.

Given the popularity of Face book with it's 500 million users, I would say this is a serious issue and people will point to alternative browser for use in this respect. This issue could potentially cause harm to personal computer everywhere a people who use Firefox neglect to ever turn on another browser and the alternative in the majority is IE. IE a we both know is horrible and a serious security risk to giving the user spy ware and other potential hazardous code.
