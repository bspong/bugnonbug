New feature needed to allow launching firefox with all window and tab loaded.

On launch, firefox prompt with a dialog whether to load new, or with the previous window and tabs.

I'd like to launch firefox in ~/.xprofile to bring it up automatically with all the window and tab pre-loaded. Currently it requires hitting one of the button on the dialog. I'd like command line option to specify which of the two option to select.
