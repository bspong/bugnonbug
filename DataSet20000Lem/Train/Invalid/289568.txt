Firefox doesn't seem to like XHTML (style="margin-left:200" doesn't work - amongst other things.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-GB; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050321 Firefox/1.0.2

I have created a simple strict xhtml document that demonstrates this problem -
I've checked that this is valid using the w3c validator (and have included it's
source at the end of these details).

Initially I started with this source in a local file called "su.xhtml" and
opened it using Firefox. When I do so the top paragraph should be indented by
200 pixel (the paragraph ha an attribute of style="margin-left:200;" ... it
isn't (checked and work in IE by the way).

So then I renamed the file a "su.html" and the margin still did not work.

I then additionally removed the top two line (the "<?xml ...." and the "<!
DOCTYPE ... " lines.

Then the left margin wa applied correctly by firefox.

As I said this is a simple test document I created because of a similar problem
I wa getting in a much more complex document. In the more complex document I
wa also getting various other problems, including the fact that Java script
function called from the onclick action of an image failed to be called if I
pas the id of the img tag a a parameter to the function (again, this worked
fine if the file extension wa .html and I removed the <?xml and <!DOCTYPE
line from the top of the document).

It is possible that I've missed something in the header that firefox requires;
not sure why but for some reason firefox understands the margin's an <img id's
passing to java function if the file is NOT xhtml but doe not behave
correctly if the file is properly declared a XHTML.

Anyway, hope someone can help before I lose any more hair :O)
Here's the source for my su.xhtml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0
Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title>Testcase for bug 277480</title>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-
8" />
</head>
<body>
<p style="margin-left:200;">This text should have<br />a margin
of 200 pixels!<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>W3C Validate this XHTML file...</p>
<p>
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">
<img src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-
xhtml10" alt="Valid XHTML 1.0!" height="31" width="88" />
</a>
</p>

</body>
</html>








Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Save the xhtml from source to a local file called "su.xhtml"
2.Open this file in fire fox. The top paragraph should be indented by 200
pixels... it isn't.
3.Change the file extension to .html and remove the top 2 line (the <?xml and
<!DOCTYPE lines) and load that into firefox - the top maragraph is indented
correctly because the margin ha been applied.


Actual Results:
As described above.

Expected Results:
As the original su.xhtml is valid (according to the w3c standard validator) I
think that it should have rendered correctly without having to remove the <?xml
and <!DOCTYPE declaration and changing the extension to html.
