High CPU / memory leak over short period of time on scrub cast page

Firefox crashed before I wa able to track down what wa causing the slowdown
the first time around, so I submitted a talkback form and reloaded firefox, back
to my surfing - same thing happened, so I figured it had to be scrubs. (I would
have noticed slashdot imdb etc earlier)


Visiting the cast URL, no problems.

Viewing one cast member page - nothing happens to memory usage, but firefox
begin to idle around 8-9% cpu usage.

Open another in a tab, idle cpu usage now ha a new floor. And so on. I wa
unlucky and opened all the cast bios in new tabs, hoping to read them all. By
the time I got through firefox wa using 198mb (starting at 70) of ram, 200mb
swap, and 93-97% cpu usage).

Opening all the cast bio page in firefox 1.5 beta 1 lead to insane memory/cpu
usage over a short time - and a crash if you wait long enough.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://http://www.scrubs-tv.com/cast.html
2. Open each cast member page in a new tab
3. Wait

Note: I had 2-3 other tab open at this time, but closing the scrub page
caused the slowdown to go away and memory to be freed.

Actual Results:
Firefox idle at, and this is a floor, 60%
Sometimes up to 97% idle, no image still loading, everything is done - but 90%
cpu usage.

Expected Results:
Live long enough to let me read the cast bios! :P

Sorry no Talkback ID, but it's in there somewhere :|
brian@duality.ca I believe I used.
