(a) When Firefox crash and you open it again you are given the option to restore all the page that were open at the time of the crash. It would be very useful for that dialog to also offer to instead bookmark the crashed page under an appropriately titled bookmark folder ("Restore", maybe?). If a particular webpage is causing Firefox to crash, this would enable you to isolate it. Also, if you only want to keep a few of the page you had open you wouldn't have to open all of them only to close most again.

(b) It would similarly be really handy to have the option on Exiting to bookmark all currently open page to an appropriately titled bookmark folder ("OnExit", maybe?).

P.S. I'm not sure if this is one request or two. I suspect it's the same functionality, but please separate it if it's really two requests.
