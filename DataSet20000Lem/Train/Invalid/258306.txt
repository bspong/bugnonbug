There is a comment in the "meat" of this article on ESPN's site. The comment is
only a couple dozen character long, but the engine fails to recognize the end
tag of the comment ("-->") and considers a huge chunk of the article and html
code following it to be part of the comment. There are two dash next to each
other ("--") a part of the text in the comment, and it appears that this is
what's throwing the engine off (allthough I really don't know). It considers
the comment "closed" hundred of character later when it find a greater-than
symbol sitting by itself, rather than when it find the intended end-comment tag.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to
http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/preview04/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&id=1875674
2. View the incorrectly rendered HTML.
3. Be sad.

Actual Results:
I saw the incorrectly rendered HTML and wa sad.

Expected Results:
The engine should have parsed the comment correctly and not gotten confused
about where it ended. The page would then have been rendered correctly and I
would not have had to open IE to view the rest of the article (bleah).
