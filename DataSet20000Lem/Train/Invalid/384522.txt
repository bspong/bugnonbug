When firefox updated to version 2.0.0.4, I always get the message "Can't locate server". This happens with both the full version and the portable apps version. As soon a I revert to firefox version 2.0.0.2 (full version) or firefox version 2.0.0.3 (portable version), everything work fine.
I have uninstalled and reinstalled a few times, but the same thing happens. Even edited all reference to firefox/mozilla from the registry; upon reinstall of firefox (or 'automatic' update), firefox again cannot connect with the internet.
I am able to send this a I am using version 2.0.0.2 on my dektop at present.
I hope version 2.0.0.5 come soon!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download version 2.0.0.4
2.Try to connect to internet
3."Cannot locate server"
Actual Results:
There is nothing special re setups. As soon a I have version 2.0.0.4 on the computer, I am unable to connect to the internet. Earlier build such a 2.0.0.2 and 2.0.0.3 work fine.

Expected Results:
I expect version 2.0.0.4 will connect to the internet, but it doesn't.

I do not believe the problem is related to firewall setting nor themes. There is no crash a such, it just doe not connect to the internet, the earlier build (as noted above) do so every time.
