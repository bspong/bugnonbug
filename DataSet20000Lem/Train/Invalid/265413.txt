.tabs-closebutton class should be globally defined in toolbarbutton.css (put class back on #find-closebutton)

The find toolbar wa recently given it's own stylesheet in global, but the close
button lost the .tabs-closebutton class, i assume because it wa only defined in
browser/browser.css. That class is still useful on that button for defining the
source image and hover and active states, which are the same for the tab bar,
side bar, message bars, and find toolbar. The only thing that change are
borders, and padding, which are easily handled on a per-case basis by using IDs.

If the .tabs-closebutton is moved to global/toolbarbutton.css, then it can be
picked up anywhere it need to be used.

So the two thing i'm asking for:
1. Move the basic style to global
2. Return the .tabs-closebutton class to #find-closebutton, and use it on any
other close button in the future.

I'll be honest and admit that part of why i'm requesting this is because it
needlessly break my theme. But it's also just a logical, more efficient and
consistent use of code.

Patch on the way...
