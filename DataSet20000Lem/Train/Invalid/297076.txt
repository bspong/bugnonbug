Firefox fails CSS1 test of absolute length unit with regard to font-size
Using: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050526
Firefox/1.0+

According to CSS1 specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1#length-units),
browser should support absolute length unit such a inch and centimeters.

Please note that for the following tests, your computer must be set so it
internal ruler reflects 'real-world'lengths, a described in the prologue to
these tests, at http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec01.htm, in the
section entitled "Units and Monitor Testing."

All test explain what behavior is expected according to CSS1 specifications.

Firefox pass test involving absolute length unit with regard to
text-indent, @ http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec547.htm, and
margin(bottom and top)and padding (bottom and top), @
http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec411.htm.

However, Firefox fails when it come to font size, a demonstrated in the
font-size test, http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS1/current/sec526.htm. The
one cm and ten mm font-size wa actually about 7 mm, the half-inch wa about 3/8
in., and point wa about 3/16 in. instead of 1/4 in. (one point = 1/72 inches).
