Firefox slows down opening of other progs. while it's running.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; es-ES; rv:1.9.2b5) Gecko/20091204 Firefox/3.6b5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Hello everyone, I just found a bug in FF (3.5.6 and 3.6b5).
The thing is that If Firefox is running, then when I try to open another program, the opening is delayed for about two to three secs. If I close firefox, then the other progs open immediately. Tested it SEVERAL times, same result every time.
It seems to happen only with 32 bit apps.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox
2.Open another app
3.
Actual Results:
The second app take an additional 2 to 3 sec to open

Expected Results:
should open right away

Running on Xp-64. Athlon X2 5200+, 4 GB RAM.
I beleive this didn't happen with winxp 32 bit.
