Since the 2.0.0.11 release of Firefox, the export feature of the Bookmark organizer doe not work. When the export command are entered, Firefox seems to ignore the command and no backup file is exported. No window pop up to choose location at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Bookmark Organizer through Bookmarks >> Organize Bookmarks
2.Attempt Export of Bookmarks through File >> Export...
3.When nothing at all happens, repeat until frustrated.
Actual Results:
Nothing. Using File >> Export... result in absolutely nothing happening at all. No prompt to choose a location, no indication that a file is saving... nothing.

Expected Results:
The execution of the Export command should have at least prompted for the user to choose a location to save the file. Then it would have saved to that location, and perhaps indicated with a confirmation of some sort.

No error pop up, and no crash occur when attempting to export.
