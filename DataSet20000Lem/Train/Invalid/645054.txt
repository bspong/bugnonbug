Pink-Bee pop-up blocker isn't a pop-up blocker at all.

In Firefox 4.0, using Pink-Bee theme 2.7.2, what appears to be the pop-up blocker icon is actually the toolbar drop-down menu. If you run your mouse over the icon (which appears in the URL bar), it say "Change pop-up blocking setting for this web site".

If you left click the icon, nothing happens. If you right click it, you get the toolbar drop-down menu.

I also noticed that other Firefox 4.0 themes, inlcuding the default theme, do not have a pop-up blocker icon at all. That ha left me wondering if the entire presence of the icon in the Pink-Bee theme is a mistake, and it simply need to be deleted.

I would like to have a pop-up blocker icon in my browser. However, if it is now a thing of the past, someone need to tell the creator of the Pink-Bee theme to remove it.
