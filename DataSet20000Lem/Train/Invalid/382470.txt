1. Create a new profile
2. Type http://hindu.com in URL (This is website of a BEST NEWSPAPER in India - not a religious site)
3. Browser crashes.

If I run "firefox" from a terminal the following is the error message when it crashes:
-----------------------------
Flash Player: Warning: environment variable G_FILENAME_ENCODING is set and is not UTF-8
Flash Player: Warning: environment variable G_FILENAME_ENCODING is set and is not UTF-8

Many thanks
