I wa reading a blog and I noticed some interesting banner, so I clicked it. It opened a new site, but the address bar didn't change, not did the title bar. Status bar doe change thou. When I open site in new tab, everything is fine...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site - http://tzombix.blog.hr/
2. Click the banner on the right it should open - http://www.fiuhost.com/
3. Notice the address and title bar

Actual Results:
New site opened, showing the address of the previous one. Address bar and title bar haven't changed.

Expected Results:
New site ha opened, that's OK, but it's not OK to show different address, nor to show different title bar. I think it's a major security flaw.
