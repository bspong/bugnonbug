misplaced text and combobox autoupdate doe not work!
The rendering of the page is totallt incorrect.
Also when changing value of comboxboxes the page ha to be refreshed and the
content of the comboboxes beneath them ha to be updated which is not the case
when using firefox.

I got this error on Firefox 1.0 final edition.

Iguess the first bug should be a rendering issue and the second one a java
script issue.

regards.
