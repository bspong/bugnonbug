There is a service in MSN protocol that can login you into e-mail acount with you pas if you are loged in MSN/WLM AND Miranda MSN Protocol. FF is the default browser so when i click on "Hotmail" service in Miranda MSN, FF try to log in with long url in addres bar but it constantly asking me for password even if i'm loged into MSN. Cheking "Remember my username and password" don;t work on this page but it remember my acount name. This is NOT Miranda bug - i think that FF can't handle MSN long login links.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set FF a default browser.
2.Login into you MSN account in Miranda.
3.Click "Show my Hotmail"

Actual Results:
FF load a page where you must enter again you pass.

Expected Results:
FF should load Hotmail page like, without asking abut pas if i'm loged into MSN IE do after clicking "Hotmail" in WLM.
