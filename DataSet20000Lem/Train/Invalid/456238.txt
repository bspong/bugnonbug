URL redirects incorrectly to multiple port of the same DNS/IP name.

If you try to host a new website on your webserver on a different port and then try to connect to your webserver using the ":" to go to a different port, you will be redirected to the last saved URL for that host. You can see my example url for details. Try to connect to the first one and then the second. Sucks that it keep redirecting you to the first one doesn't it? Took me way too long to debug my web server because of this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a website that is on normal port 80
2.Try to go to another port on that website by <address>:<port>
3.Be amazed that you can't reach it because firefox redirects you to port 80
Actual Results:
Firefox suxed it up.

Expected Results:
Epic failz.

It should have redirected me to the second website I wa hosting on my webserver on the different port I specified using standard convention that opera, netscape, internet explorer, safari, and others understand.
