Nominating a blocking since this _is_ a regression.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open attachment in a new tab.
2. Zoom in, so you can see the hole image 1:1.
3. Go back to this tab.
4. Go back to the image tab.

The zoom is no longer the same the image had before changing tabs. And one ha to click the image two time to get 1:1.
