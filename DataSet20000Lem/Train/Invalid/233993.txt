When the cursor hovered over a link and the new bubble pop up that show the
name of the link in bold text and then the URL it go to shows, anything typed
in the address bar doe not show up until the bubble go away. Sometimes the
first letter will show up and other time it doesn't, but I havent had any text
show up after that.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put the focus on the address bar (click on it and make sure it can be typed
in, specifically. Doesn't have to be cleared).
2. Hover your mouse over a link until the new popup box show (the one with the
bold text and where the link go to (I don't know the technical name of it)).
3. Type anything into the address bar. I haven't had anything show up.

Actual Results:
No URL or text show up.

Expected Results:
Visable text.
