My spouse last night installed Firefox Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051107 Firefox/1.5, 1.5R2, while logged onto his Windows XP user account, which is not the main user account on our PC. He had no problem. But when I logged onto my account and opened Firefox, I discovered that the following text always appears at the bottom of the screen, below the Firefox status line: ____<menuitem label="&gp.options.popup;" oncommand="GP_Options() ;"/> This text appears continuously while Firefox is open under my Windows XP user account. It doesn't appear to be related to a particular website. This text doe not appear when my spouse open Firefox under his Windows XP user account.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log onto my Windows XP user account.
2.Open AOL 9.0 SE.
3.Open Firefox 1.5R2.

Actual Results:
The offending text display at the bottom of the screen, below the Firefox status line. There are one or two line of blank space above and below the text, so that I am robbed of several line worth of space from the actual display window.


My PC run Windows XP SP2 home edition and AOL 9.0 SE. The following are always running the background under my XP user account: Norton SystemWorks2005 (including Norton AntiVirus), Microsoft AntiSpyware (beta), Roxio Drag-to-Disc, Microsoft ActiveSync (for PocketPC), and ZoneAlarm Pro 5.5.
