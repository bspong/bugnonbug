Prior to the 3.6.10 update, NIS 2010 Identity Safe would autofill my logon credential at any of my Norton-remembered web sites. Now it won't autofill or manually fill any credential on any web site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install NIS 2010 with all of the default settings.
2. Open Firefox and navigate to a web page that requires a login and let Norton remember the credentials.
3. Navigate away from that web site and then return to it.
Actual Results:
NIS 2010 doe not autofill the credential field on the web page. Prior to Firefox version 3.6.10, NIS 2010 *did* fill in the credentials.

Expected Results:
Version 3.6.10 should let Norton autofill the login credentials.
