When using a non-English (eg, traditional Chinese) Windows XP and non-English Firefox 1.5, it fails to install the english package pack (en-US.xpi). The error message is "Reason: read only" (translated from Chinese).

If I try to install the english version of Firefox 1.5 directly, it will fail near the end of the install when it's trying to install the language pack.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you're using a non-English (eg, traditional Chinese) Windows XP and non-English Firefox 1.5.
2. Download http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5/win32/xpi/en-US.xpi
3. In Firefox, browse to open en-US.xpi just downloaded.
4. Click "Install".
5. It pop up a dialog saying it fails to install the file. The reason is "read only".
