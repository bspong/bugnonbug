Open search result in foreground
See bug 600244 comment #3 and following:

IMHO, opening tab from the UI is different from opening them from a web page in that you are not reading content when issuing the page load from the UI, and so opening a search from the search bar should not make the result page hidden in the background but open it in the foreground instead.

The patch for this is easy, but I think it might need UX input.
