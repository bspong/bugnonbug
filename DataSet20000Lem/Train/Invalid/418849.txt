Actual Results:
Note that the South Park is NOT across from the map pin a it should be. [In fact, the map pin location is on the corner property owned by a neighborhood church. The map pin should be one lot farther west.] Your map of the area show the South Park a occupying a space 1 block East of it's actual location and covering an area extending North to Washington Av. The space from Washington Av. on the North to 2nd Av. on the South is the former site of the Hutchinson Public School. The building still stand and there are play ground there. It is NOT part of the South Park.

Expected Results:
The correct map is displayed with the South Park shown a being located 1 block the East of it's actual location. The park is also shown a being twice the length a it actually is.

Severity: There is no 'work around', but most folk arrining on the location would get to the correct place.

This forum make no allowance for me to display the map a it should be. Please check my fact and your map.
