the address bar auto fill feature will show sensitive information from secure website such a email subject line and urls.

This could compromise CC numbers, confirmation codes, extra marital affairs, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. log into gmail (or any secure website) and open an email message
2. log out and go to another page
3. start typing gmail into the address bar - your email subject line will be revealed along with the url.
Actual Results:
sensitive information from secure site (in this case, email subject lines) is revealed in the address bar drop down list of previously visited websites.

Expected Results:
secure website address should not be shown in this list. especially link from within the sites.

I haven't tried to log into my bank account online yet, but I'm assuming that some information that I wouldn't want others to know might be revealed in that drop down list if I do.
