Can't download installer for MacOSX Jaguar
I am running a G4 iMac with OS version 10.2.8 (Build 6R73, Darwin kernel 6.8,
800MHz). When I try to download firefox installer with IE 5.2.3 for Mac (build
5815.1) any english version (US & British), the 8.6Mb file begin to download -
showing the stuffit icon for the download.mozilla.org file on the desktop - then
once all data is received the icon change to a TextEdit icon and opening it
produce only garbage text but no application installer. I have downloaded both
english version to Windows 2000 & XP and no problems.
