Borders and padding render outside the bounding tag, or cause misalignment of content.

Hi.

Firstly, using "border" style cause the border to be rendered *outside" the
bounding DIV or TD tags, not *inside*, a should be the case. This cause
bordered content to be shifted and misaligned. The behaviour of border style
should be changed so that they render *inside* the bound of the surrounding tag.

Please see the site www.kerbjournal.com - the active menu item us a black
"border-left" style, which a you will see cause content of that menu item to
be shifted to the right. You will notice a you mouse-over the menu.

Secondly, the "padding" style doe the same thing. Padding should not cause
content to be moved beyond the bound of the containing tag, but create a space
between the tag's content and it boundary.

These are the two major rendering error which cause Firefox to render page
differently to other browsers.

Thanks for your time!


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Please refer to the URL provided to see the HTML and style used. The problem
is fairly simple.
Actual Results:
Content with a border is shifted by the number of pixel of the border, because
the border are rendered *outside* a tag's bounds.

Expected Results:
Borders should be rendered *inside* a tag's bounds, not causing the tag's size
to be changed. It affect TD tags, therefore cell in a table cause content
misalignments.
