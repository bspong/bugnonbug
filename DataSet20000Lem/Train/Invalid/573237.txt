Address Bar latch "Bad" URLs, unable to correct URL (must exit tab)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100423 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.3

Different issue than "Address bar not working correctly" (540329)

My company's exchange server is located at https://owa.example.com/exchange. The company doe not redirect, so the following *will* time out:
* owa.example.com
* http://owa.example.com
* http://owa.example.com/exchange
* https://owa.example.com

Being lazy, I often just type owa.example.com, a I did in FF. While Firefox wa spinning waiting for the connection, I corrected my mistake by prepending https:// and appending exchange in the address bar. The address bar allowed me to type the corrections, and displayed the new URL during corrections.

I then pressed ENTER. After some time, the connection timed out. Next, I placed the insertion cursor in the address bar (at the end of the URL) and hit ENTER again. Another time out. Finally, I clicked the green GO triangle and timed out again.

I then closed the "timed out tab" and opened a new tab. I entered the site address correctly and FF connected with no issues.

It seems that the Firefox tab is latching the first incorrect entry that wa entered in the address bar and ignoring my corrections. Use of the bad URL continued after I updated the URL while the tab wa attempting to connect, and after the time out when I pressed ENTER or clicked GO.

This is clearly undesired behaviour.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a bad URL which cause a time out
2. Correct the URL
3. Press ENTER or click GO in an attempt to use the corrected URL
Actual Results:
Firefox appears to be latching a bad URL by re-attempting to connect to the bad URL, despite the fact that the URL ha been updated and corrected.

Expected Results:
Process the current URL when ENTER is pressed or GO is clicked.
