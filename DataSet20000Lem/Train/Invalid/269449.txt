Find As You Type should always be done in the current tab

Very often when I try to use Find As You Type in the new Firefox 1.0, it doe
it in a different tab. I would type the text of a link, and it would (invisibly
to me) select another link with that text in some other tab that is not the
current one.

Even clicking on the window doe not fix this. Pressing Ctrl+L then Tab
sometimes does, but not always.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
Unfortunately not reliably reproducible, but with luck you might be able to
reproduce it by:
* opening a number of tab with similar web page in them (e.g. different
thread from the same discussion forum) so that they are likely to have link
with the same text
* switch around the tab using the mouse a bit
* start typing the text of one of the links, see if it doe it in the right tab



Maybe I should mention that I have the Tab Browser Extension installed
(http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_tabextensions.html.en). (However, please don't
just assume that it must be a bug in that extension if the bug doe not occur
without it.)
