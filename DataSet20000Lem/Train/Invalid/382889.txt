Javascript keyword bookmark do not work correctly with Tab Mix Plus extension from Firefox version 2.0.0.1 onwards
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

With Tab Mix Plus extension installed, and set to open tab from bookmarks, keyword bookmark which use javascript to handle multiple parameter do not work correctly.

The most recent version of Firefox which did not have this problem wa 2.0.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Tab Mix Plus extension, available from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122 - most recent version at time of writing wa 0.3.5.2

2. In the Tab Mix Plus options, go to Events > Tab Opening > Open tab from ... make sure that Open tab from Bookmarks is checked, then click Apply.

3. Create a javascript bookmark - open the bookmark manager, go to File > New Bookmark, and in the location field, enter some javascript code. Here's an example of a javascript bookmark I prepared for Google Sets, for which you can use any number of parameters. I have split the code onto several line to aid readability, however, you'll need to remove line ending and enter it all in the location box a one line.

javascript:l=0;c=1;
x="http://labs.google.com/sets?q";
s=decodeURI("%s");
p=s.indexOf(" ");
while(p!=-1)
{x=x+c+"="+encodeURI(s.substring(l,p))+"&q";l=p+1;
p=s.indexOf(" ",l);c++;
};
x=x+c+"="+encodeURI(s.substring(l,s.length));
location.href=x;

Once you have entered this code into the location field, put a keyword (eg "sets") in the keyword field, and give your bookmark a name (eg "sets"). Then click OK.

4. Call your new Javascript bookmark from the location bar - for example:

set phoebe monica rachel

Actual Results:
A new tab opens, however, instead of loading the URL that ha been calculated by the javascript code, it merely display the URL by itself in the top left hand corner of the tab - for the example given, this will be:

http://labs.google.com/sets?q1=phoebe&q2=monica&q3=rachel


Expected Results:
I would expect it to actually load the page at http://labs.google.com/sets?q1=phoebe&q2=monica&q3=rachel in the new tab that had just been opened - not merely display the URL.


Javascript keyword bookmark will open correctly in the current tab if Tab Mix Plus is not set to open bookmark in new tabs, or if the Tab Mix Plus extension is disabled.

Keyword bookmark that don't use javascript appear to open correctly in a new tab.

The most recent version of Firefox in which it wa possible to get javascript keyword bookmark to open correctly in a new tab with Tab Mix Plus, and where following the above step will actually get the expected results, wa Firefox 2.0. From 2.0.0.1 up to 2.0.0.4, it doesn't appear to work any more. I seem to remember the same problem existing with version of Tab Mix Plus before 0.3.5.2 but I haven't thoroughly checked this yet.
