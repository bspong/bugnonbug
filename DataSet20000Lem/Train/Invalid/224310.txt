XHTML 1.1 doe not include the name attribute for <a>; it is deprecated in
favour of id. (see http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/changes.html#a_changes )

When an XHTML 1.1 page is rendered in standards-compliance mode, <a name="">
anchor are still recognised.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://texturizer.net/firebird/extensions/#ctc

Actual Results:
Firebird show the page with the "anchor" at the top of the screen

Expected Results:
Firebird should show the top of the page

I've emailed David Tenser to point out his (incorrect) use of name=, so the page
may soon use id= instead.
