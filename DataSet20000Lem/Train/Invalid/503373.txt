this ha happened on other site - but most recently on the USPS website. I clicked on the "go"button that should have taken me to the window to calculate postage. Got a message saying Firefox won't open this page. I'm having to use Safari more and more frequently because of this problem - and because Firefox is freezing and crashing at least 3 - 4 time a day.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to usps website
2.go to 'calculate postage'
3.click on button on "domestic postage" that say "go"
Actual Results:
blank window with a small banner at the top that say "firefox won't open this window"

Expected Results:
the window to calculate domestic postage should have opened so I could calculate domestic postage. Instead, I got a blank window.

This is the first time I'm reporting it, but I've had this happen on other sites. I also use Safari, and have been simply switching to Safari instead - but at some point Mozilla ha to get this fixed!
