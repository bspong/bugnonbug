28-Nov 2010 the link "email support" doe not work in last 2 nightly builds. Works in
ie9
and chrome on this page. Windows 7, using WIndows Live Mail

Anyone else seeing this? Anything unusual with this page link?

Looks just like a simple mailto:

<b>Contact by e-mail</b><br>
<br>
<a href="mailto:support@editplus.com">support@editplus.com</a><br>
<br></span>
<hr>

Further info:

Minefield doe recognise the link is clicked, I see a flicker on the URL
bar, then the destination of the link showing in the URL bar disappears, but
Minefield doe not actually do anything.

Same happens in safe mode for me.

Two other user on dev-apps-Firefox list have confirmed mailto link are not working for them either - (in one case looked like linux and Thnunderbird were not opening new email window.)
