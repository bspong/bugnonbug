Querying bookmark menu for "Get Bookmark Add-ons" detail fails
Created attachment 375550
Testcase (chrome privilegies)

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b5pre) Gecko/20090427 Shiretoko/3.5b5pre ID:20090427031112

When you try to query the detail for the "Get Bookmark Add-ons" entry inside the bookmark menu it fails silently and successive menu item aren't listed anymore.

Steps:
1. Start Firefox with a fresh profile
2. Open and start the testcase (download it locally first)
3. Check and compare the item which are listed for the bookmark menu

As you can see all successive menu item of the "Get Bookmark Add-ons" item aren't listed anymore. No error or exception is visible inside the error console. But enclosing the menu code inside a try/catch block fix the problem locally for me. At one time I have seen a warning at the following line and _result not defined:

No idea, what cause this problem but calling detail for this special item should not silently fail.
