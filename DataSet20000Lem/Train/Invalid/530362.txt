In 3.4 the Realplayer download this video tab would come up in youtube for most videos. Now that I have upgraded to 3.5.5 it won't open and I can't download any of these video at all. I have realplayer SP, their latest version, and all pertinent enabling is done. I can download the video in Internet Explorer 8.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. As far a I can tell the new version of firefox simply won't allow it.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
no ability to download the video

Expected Results:
A right click onthe video should have an option to download the video with realplayer. Or a "download this video" tab should pop up on the top of the video box.
