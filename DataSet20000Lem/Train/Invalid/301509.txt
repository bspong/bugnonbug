I am using a smartcard reader with a software suite called Chipdrive SmartCard
Office. One package of it is called "Password Manager" which doe nearly the
same a the integrated "Password Manager" in FF - but it save the password on
a chipcard. After installing FF 1.0.3 or 1.0.4 the problem occured that when i
finished entering the credential for a page (eg. Username/Password for
Bugzilla) the "Writing to chipcard" popup came up und after writing it again and
again writes the credential to that card until the whole application "SCO
Password Manager" crashes.

I called their support and the know the problem - it is something wrong with the
interaction between FF and the Smartcard Office Suite which cannot be solved by
them because it is a FF issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a webpage which ha Username/Password form
2. After clicking "Submit" the Password Manager writes the combination to card
3. Again and again until crash

Actual Results:
Smartcard Office Suite - Password Manager Services crash

Expected Results:
After Step 2 the password manager should go in idle until a new
Username/Password form is visited
