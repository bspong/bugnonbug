Firefox open a new tab every five minutes. I am running win xp pro sp2 with all the update and the latest version of firefox with callingid and google extetions.
it doesent matter what site I am on the problem keep ocurring.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start the browser
2.begin surfing
3.wait a few minute

Actual Results:
Blank tab were opened automatically every few minutes. I've restarted firefox and the system but the problem persists.

Expected Results:
firefox should wait until I click on new tab to open a tab. I don't accidently hit control t either.

even when I am running only a window without a menu or toolbars a new window pop up with a blank tab and keep on adding tabs. It maximizes the window automatically whenever a tab is created and open a new window if there is only an untabbed window running.
