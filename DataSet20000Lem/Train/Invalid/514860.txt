Memory Leaks with DeviantArt

This generally happens with DeviantArt using FF 3.5.2, but I'm sure it can reproduced with many other site which use a lot of javascript. The problem is that memory usage often go above 1 gig, or Firefox crash if certain condition happen.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to DeviantArt
2.Open about 8 picture in tab
3.Either leave the browser open for a few hours, or run something else that's memory intensive like a video game while leaving Firefox open.
Actual Results:
Eventually the CPU usage from Firefox will start to build up, that it will either be really slow, or crash without a chance of recovering any of the tabs.

Expected Results:
Not crash or really slow down. But instead kept memory usage to a reasonable level. I think there need to be some better garbage collection.
