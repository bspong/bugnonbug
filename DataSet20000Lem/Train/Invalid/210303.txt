Often I click a link that ha target="_blank" or somesuch thing that cause the
link to load in a new window, but since I don't know beforehand that the author
intended it to be a new window, if I'm not watching the tabbar it's often easy
to miss the new tab showing up - it look like the link just did nothing. It
would be nice to have some sort of indication that the link wa loading in a new
tab, for example the link animating up to the tabbar (or far le annoying, a
different cursor, like the one that show up when you put a CD into a drive in
WinXP).
