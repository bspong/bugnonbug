Hi,

I am not sure if this is a security violation, and it appears IE7 and Safari both allow this behaviour. I would like to use it, but it strike me it could be used a an exploit for a cross-site security vulnerability. Therefore I'd like the devs to confirm this is expected behaviour.

Issue:

A page "http://site1/page.htm" ha a frameset. It ha two frames, "one" that is set to point to http://site1/subpage1.htm and "two" is set to point to http://site2/page.htm

http://site2/page.htm executes the javascript:

window.parent.frame["one"].location = "http://site1/subpage2.htm";

This is allowed a long a the page it navigates to is in http://site1 on Firefox and Safari, and seems to be allowed to be anywhere on IE7 - eg "http://site3/another.html".

I would like to use this behaviour to pas data between two domains, using the query string on that redirect, and navigating to a page that can process that data. In my instance it benign - I am trying to pas data between two page on two site I have created, but it occurs to me that if you were able to navigate a subframe to a malicious site, that frame could make call to the server using the session cooky etc.

Is this behaviour by design and will it likely continue into the future? I am trying to avoid using a mechanism that will suddenly stop working.

Kind regards,

Alex

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
As above
Actual Results:
Works

Expected Results:
Not sure, but probably a security violation when the frame is redirected from http://site2
