my third problem with nsIExtensionManager

When I wa developing a Firefox addon called Site Compare, I selected my addon folder with nsIExtensionManager, then opened a file there, then read it line-by-line, but each line didn't have a charAt method, then I took a path which I didn't use nsIExtensionManager to develop my addon and now it works.

When I wa installing a bookmark extension called MyBookmarks, it wouldn't install, because of an error -203, then I double-clicked it in the Error Console and it wa coming from nsIExtensionManager. (That error doesn't exist any longer, because I can use MyBookmarks.)

*Now, I created a profile, then opened it, then installed Extension Developer's Extension, then enabled debugging, then tried to create two xpi file with it, one from the source code of an addon that I'm developing and one from the source code of Site Compare v0.87, an addon that is in Mozilla Addons, that works, but in both situation I opened the Error Console, then I got lot of error messages, then I double-clicked one of them and it wa a small method that used nsIExtensionManager.*

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create an empty profile
2. open it
2. install Extension Developer's Extension in it
3. enable debugging in the Extension Developer's menu item
4. try to create a xpi file from the Site Compare v0.87 source code ( http://www.2shared.com/file/12648556/7e7d6d6b/sitecompare_v087.html ) or the Missing Alert source code ( http://www.2shared.com/file/12648571/d22f9a4a/missing_alert.html )
Actual Results:
In the Error Console, there are lot of error messages.

Expected Results:
The xpi file would be created.
