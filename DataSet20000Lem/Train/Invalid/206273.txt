User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

When Firebird is first installed, the Bookmarks toolbar contains three entries.
If you close Firebird and overwrite the bookmarks.html file in your profile
with a pre-existing bookmarks.html file, the Bookmarks toolbar cease to
function. If you create a new Bookamrks toolbar, URLs cannot be dragged to it,
and if bookamrks are added in Bookmarks -> Manage boommarks, they appear in the
Bookmarks manager view, but not on the Bookmarks toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firebird.
2. Exit Firebird
3. Copy a pre-existing bookmark file to your profile.
4. Create a new folder and designate it a the bookmark toolbar.
4. Try to drag and drop URLs to it.

Actual Results:
The new bookmark toolbar refuse to accept URLs.

Expected Results:
The URLs should have appeared on the Bookmarks toolbar.

The only workaround is to exit Firebird, nuke the entire profile directory,
restart and import the pre-existing bookmark file.
