I have tried two day in a row to correct the oversize page and text by going in and selecting under Mozilla safe mode "to reset the toolbar". It doesn't work I still have a page and text way too big. If it can't be fixed how can I reload the previous version of Mozilla?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I went to the support forum and found my problem.
2.I followed the instruction of going in and resetting the tool bar.
3.It doesn't work and I'm getting frustrated not getting "real" help.
Actual Results:
My page is still TOO BIG!!!

Expected Results:
I still have the problem

According to your direction for correcting the problem. When I restarted Mozilla 3.03, the page and text should have been normal sized but it wasn't.
