All JARs normally would be aligned vertically on the right side in a column.

Instead of alignment, some are only 50% visible, and some are not even near the right side.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
The layout is incorrect when rendering text and paragraphs. Clicking on any of the JARs will make it fully visible.

Expected Results:
Text should display correctly and the JARs should be a column on the right edge.
