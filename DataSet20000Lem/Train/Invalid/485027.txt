I run Skype 3.8 or so, text message daily with son who YESTERDAY EVENING upgraded to new Skype 4.0. My text inputs, under my up-to-date-Firefox, do not show in my aggregating Skype conversation window. HE see them, and IE handle this "different version of Skype, in text-messaging mode" without difficulty at both end of the Skype conversation. TIMING OF THIS SUDDEN CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR suggests that something in Firefox's passing on the data is now incompatible with how IE on the other end is passing it to, or displaying it in conjunction with, Skype 4.0.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
Shut down machine, cold start, same behavior. My wife is chatting with him, identical setup except she is using IE, right next to me, all is fine.
