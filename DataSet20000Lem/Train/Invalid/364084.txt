Using IBM laptop equipped with TrackPoint, scrolling is by pressing the middle button and apply force on the TrackPoint by default. In this mode, Firefox and extension do not recognize any middle button clicking.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
No response to middle click.

Expected Results:
e.g. Middle click on link open in new tab.

Anybody know how to report this to IBM too? I guess their TrackPoint driver screw thing up, but without it other window cannot be scrolled.
