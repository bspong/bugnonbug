Mailto link are controlled by GNOME prefs, even in KDE

Clicking on a mailto: link ought to open my default mail client under KDE.

It doesn't. Fortunately, I guessed that the answer is to open the
gnome-control-center from the command line, even though I don't use gnome.

A newbie could never fix this, especially since Mandrake hide GNOME-specific
item from the KDE menu.

Expected Results:
It should detect that I'm running KDE and use KDE's mailto handler.

Also, firefox should have a preference setting to control this (even if the
preference setting simply say "this us the system-wide config in
gnome-control center")

Ideally, I'd like a config option to choose between:

Applications: Thunderbird,
Mozilla Mail
Evolution
Kmail

GUI defaults: GNOME
KDE

Command line [ /usr/local/bin/mymailclient %s ]

In this case, firefox make 2 mistakes.

* It doesn't follow the principle of least surprise.

* The control isn't in the obvious place (Edit->Preferences)
