I downloaded 13.3.6 by MFF Request @ my computer had a immediate crash upon reboot. For a day - every time I turned on my Symatic Anti-virus - it turned off. My Planar PX212M constantly freeze and refreshes. I restored my driver and the anti-virus began working. I ran 2 full scan over 3 day and found no incursions. I down loaded an earlier version of MFF - that didn't help. I tried repairing my OS by first using Windows to go back to a older profile 4 week ago. no go. I tired System Restore. I tired using my last XP CD with Service Packs rolled up in them - but it would fail with that disk and older bootable disk a I get the error: Can't find NVRAID.sys. I am stuck - I hope this crashed ha more to do with my Planar than my system.

Reproducible: Always




my sys - or flat screen ha frozen and refreshed 14 time in this query - I stop here to summit - bmm
