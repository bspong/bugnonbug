Fix GROUP_BY_FOLDER in query system
The current query system doesn't do anything with GROUP_BY_FOLDER. It just assumes for bookmark query that you want folders, and for history query you don't. The only thing this option would help is for nested tag if you want all item in the folder and it's descendent to appear in a flat list. Apparently we aren't supporting this, so we can remove this flag.
