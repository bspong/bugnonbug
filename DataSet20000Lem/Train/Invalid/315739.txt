The attached XHTML 1.0 document (valid, no CSS) is incorrectly rendered. The A element inside the DD is shown in a separate line from the previous text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the given document
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The rendered page is shown as:
...
Another DT
This text contains a
[link], which is shown in a separate line. It shouldn't

Expected Results:
The rendered page should look like:
...
Another DT
This text contains a [link], which is shown in a separate line. It shouldn't


The bug happens with or without CSS style information. The problem is not visible in every DL; it even disappears in the above example when removing the first div. I think it might even be a parsing error instead of a rendering problem.
