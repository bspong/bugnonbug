Multiple preference issue after upgrade from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 upon opening FireFox every other time
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

This is similar to a few other bug I've seen with the new 1.0.3 build. Every
other time I open Firefox, the menu option do not work, my bookmark link are
gone, my homepage doesn't contain a url and the program is basically
unresponsive. If I close and reopen the widow, everything is fine the second
time. It ha been consistently every other execution of the program. I've also
noticed that I cannot run 2 windows. This may have something to do with the
combination of the new build and the Tabbrowser Preferences (1.2.4) Extension I
have installed.
