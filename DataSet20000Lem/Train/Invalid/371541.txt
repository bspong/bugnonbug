If I have two browser window open and I make a Google search in the first one and click one of the result the result open in a new tab in this first window (I have set Google preference so that it will open result in a new window and the Firefox setting so that new window is actually opened a a new tab). Then I change to second browser window and make Google search also in that. But when I click one of the search result in the second window the page will be opened in the tab in the first window.
