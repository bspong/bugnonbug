Going into the same web page from different door should still take user to the same landing page. when the user already joined the FF4 page, they should be recognized by the system every time the return.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) From your account go to Profile->Activities and Interests->Firefox4 --> you get to the FF4 page, on the top of the page there is not "like" or "go to app" button.
2) Choose a badge and post to wall.
3) Go to wall and click on the "via Firefox4" link at the bottom of the post text (part of the "posted X second ago via Firefox4" text).
Actual Results:
Get to the FF4 page, but at the top of the page there is a "like" option and "go to app" link. Since the user already liked the page, these setting should be saved and recognized. See attached video.

Expected Results:
Getting to the FF4 page like I did before.
