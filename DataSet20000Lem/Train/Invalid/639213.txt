When opening Firefox Beta 4.0, I get an error.

When I open up firefox 4.0 Beta, I get an error for the "4chan firefox extension."

What this extension doe is allows me to access 4chan.org, with a simple left click. With this error in firefox 4.0 beta, I cannot use this extension.

The error is applied right when I double click on firefox to open the web browser. It reads:
TypeError: Components.classes['@4chan.wrathfilledhate.net/menu/manager-object;1'] is undefined

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox 4.0 beta, with the 4chan extension.
2.Before 4.0 Beta open up, and error window appears.
3.exit out of the error window.
Actual Results:
When right clicking on any page in the web browser, the 4chan add on appears, but it doe not work.

Expected Results:
When right clicking on any page, you should be able to quickly go on any board on the website "4chan.org"

The error read

TypeError: Components.classes['@4chan.wrathfilledhate.net/menu/manager-object;1'] is undefined

This error also appears when i click on the "Licensing Information" link on the about page of firefox 4.0

I am reporting here it here, because it doe not fit on the "sad" page of the feedback button on firefox 4.0 beta.
