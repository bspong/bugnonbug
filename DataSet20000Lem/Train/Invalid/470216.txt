User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

When I opened Firefox to do some work it upgraded itself to v 3.0.5. The file containing bookmark wa deleted in the upgrade. I am unable to create new bookmarks. Also (should this be a separate report?), while I have set the option for Firefox to open to my homepage, the new version doe not, I have to manually click on the homepage icon on the toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Starting Firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox open to a blank window and there are no bookmarks. Pressing Ctrl-D to create bookmark doe nothing. Using the menu to try to create a bookmark doe nothing.

Expected Results:
I expected to be able to use my carefully stored research link and be able to create new bookmarks, but I am unable to do so.

Yeah, I know I probably should have backed up the bookmark file...

There go 5 month of research. Oh, well, I still have my notes...
