Within the forum of a daily-frequented website (www.medialine.com), the image
(photos) and animated gifs are no longer visible with Firefox. When I switched
to Safari, they came up.

After my last previous online session, I went into Firefox/Preferences/Privacy
to clean out browser and encountered a prominent window stuck behind the
Preferences window that read "Powered by Z...." (cannot remember full name and
web address), and it only disappeared after I quit Firefox and checked again.
