I wa wondering if Firebird could have a feature like Opera, where you can make
your own custom search built into MFirebird. That wa poorly worded, sorry, so
I'll give an example.

All search engine use querys. So could there be a feature where you could
program in a keyword into a query? For instance:

If I typed in "google" in the URL bar then a space and told Mozilla beforehand
that if "google" wa the first thing in the address bar, it would append what
came after it to http://www.google.com/search?&q= (and parse it a necessary)
and go there. This ha been done in Firebird already, but only with Google and
Dictionary.com (and some others, such a Amazon). But sometimes there are other
site where I would like Firebird to be able to do this for a well, so it would
be nice if there wa some interface where the user could define these keywords.

I know I posted this in the Mozilla section, but I think it could be used in
Firebird a well.
