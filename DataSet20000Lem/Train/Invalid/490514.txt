I am running Norton Internet Security 4.0 on my Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.11 Yesterday I wa notified by you of the Firefox 3.0.10 update and did the update. Now I get a warning flag that state that Norton Confidential doe not work with this version of Firefox. That it only work with version 1.5 or newer, well this is a newer version of Firefox but it still won't load Norton Confidential to work with Firefox. I tried reloading the Norton security software and it actually put Firefox in the trash when I restarted the system, I had to retrieve it. There is something different in this version that is not recognized that wa in the older version of software. Have not had any problem with older version of Firefox. Thanks for any assistance that you can provide.
