Rendering work ok in IE, however when rendering it by FireFox the middle part
of the page (content) somehow display PART of the background picture of a cell
that wa part of ANOTHER table in the left pane table cell.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I have put a test page in the provided URL
2. Point your browser to http://www.coralys.com/Test/default.html using IE 6
3. Do the same with FireFox 1.0

Actual Results:
OK on IE, On FireFox it display an image from a DIFFERENT table cell somewhere
else on the page a well a the place where it wa supposed to be

Expected Results:
Not display the background image for that cell, after all there is no background
image specification on that cell (See HTML code, the part marked in HTML
comment a "Middle Pane")
