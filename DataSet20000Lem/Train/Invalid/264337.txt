I wa developing a application with popups and I needed to pas a value from the
popup to the opener window. I made it like I always had done, with
opener.document.getElementByID() and it worked in IE. Then I tested it in
firefox and the Javascript Console say opener have no properties.
I checked the O'Reilly reference in DreamWeaver and it say opener should be
supported since IE3 and NS3.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use a window.open to open a popup
2.In popup try to use opener.document or any other property


Actual Results:
No error visible to the use that do not open Javascript Console

Expected Results:
The opener should expose all the property of the window where window.open wa
called.
