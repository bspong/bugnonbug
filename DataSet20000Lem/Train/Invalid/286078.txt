When Firefox turbo mode is used, eg launch with the -turbo flag, Firefox is
started in background and stay in systray. But if you select the option "open a
new window in a new tab", when no firefox is launched, the next time you will
click on a link outside firefox, it will close systray.

5. Click on an URL (like a link in a mail)
