Since I installed Firefox 3.6, I have a 80% chance that firefox.exe will still be running after I close all of the Firefox windows. I have actually closed Firefox down and tried to open Firefox hour later and I will get the message that Firefox is still running and I can not open a new window. The only way to stop firefox is with the task window. This is a problem since 2 other member of my household do not understand how to do that and are afraid to use the task manager.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just open firefox
2.Close firefox
3.Open firefox
Actual Results:
Window will pop up telling you the firefox is already running and it need to be close down to continue.

Expected Results:
Firefox should run. Version 3.5 and earlier did nit have this problem.
