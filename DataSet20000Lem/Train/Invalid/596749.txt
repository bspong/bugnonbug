At the above URL, the <HR> in this code show display two "Navy" HR, despite that the source displayed in fox, and the original source show "Green" for the second one:

<HR COLOR="Navy" SIZE=4 NOSHADE>

<HR COLOR="Green" SIZE=4 NOSHADE>

This code is at the bottom of the page. IE display it a expected. The local variant on my laptop display a expected.

Quite quirky.

Firebug show off Green, a expected, in the Dom

But -- for the Style -- I have a cs which set HR a Navy. I would expect the explicit declaration a green to overcome that; but Firebug say no....

What am I missing? Do <HR> cs declaration become absolute, unlike other element declaration that can be declared in css, but whose inheritance is topped by explicit declarations?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to URL shown, and examine the two horizontal rule at the bottom. One is Green and the other is Navy in HTML, but both display a navy.
