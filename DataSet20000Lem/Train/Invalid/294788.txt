When I clicked on Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks, the screen that display my
bookmark displayed in an unusual fashion. First, every other row appeared
selected (for my setup, alternating row had a blue background). If I switched
to another application and returned, the background on the alternating row
disappeared but those same row now appear with text "on top" of them.
Sometimes the text overlaying the alternate row is "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder"
but other time ha been a portion of the text from the preceding row.

If I click on the row showing the overlaying text, the description clear up.
If I click on a row under the "overlayed" row, the problem disappears for the
overlayed row. However, if my next action is to select a link above that row,
the problem reappears on the overlayed row.
