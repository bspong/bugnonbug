Since upgrade to 3.0pre5, Gmail Manager extension doesn't remember password even if Remember Password is checked. I have tried using Tools->Clear Private Data with no luck. I'm reporting it here because I can't tell if 3.0pre5 broke Gmail Manager or if it broke the password manager.

Reproducible: Always
