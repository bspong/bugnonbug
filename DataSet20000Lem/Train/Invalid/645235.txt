When opening URLs from external programs, Firefox 4 open new tab but doesn't open site
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Since Firefox is my default browser, and I've recently upgraded to version 4.0, other program try to open web site in it when I select a URL there. Since I normally already have a browser window open, the new site try to open a a new tab in it. That's fine, but (unlike how it worked in the old Firefox 3, where the new tab would actually have the site I just tried to open in it), the new tab is empty, and no site load in it. However, the URL of the site I'm trying to open is in the address bar, and if I focus there and hit Enter, the site then loads.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have Firefox 4.0 open.
2.Follow a link in a non-Firefox program that is set up to use the system default browser to open websites; for instance, the news item in the Google toolbar or a URL in an e-mail message viewed in Pegasus Mail. (Yeah, that's the mail program I use; I have no idea what other program like Thunderbird or M$ Outhouse would do.)
3.Notice a tab ha opened in Firefox, but it's blank.
3.Click on the address bar and note that a URL is there.
4.Hit Enter.
5.The website now displays.
6.PROFIT!!!!! (I've read too much Slashdot.)
Actual Results:
An empty tab open with the URL of the site I want in the address bar, but the site doesn't load until I press Enter.

Expected Results:
The site load right away when I follow the link in the other program.
