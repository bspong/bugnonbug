Okay, I do not care about any technical info to get you to fix the POS you AUTOMATICALLY installed! ALL I want it to be able to undo it!!!!!!!!

3.6.4 IS MOST DEFINITELY a POS, and you ALREADY know that. Now, how about putting that junk on hold and tell u HOW to undo the lousy, Microsoft-like junk you just inflicted on us?

ALL we want is for you to ALLOW u to UNDO the ABSOLUTE CRAP you just killed u with!!! Yes, I can download and re-install 3.6.2 to get rid of 3.6.4, but ALL of my BOOKMARKS are GONE, the google-search bar is disabled and NOTHING work like it used to! Thanks a lot. You have a bright future with MS. I will now DISABLE any update from you and THOROUGHLY research ALL CRAP you come out with next.

Good job, NOT!!!!!

Umm... it would be nice if 3.6.4 actually worked a well a ANY prior version, or at least not have crashed! I mean really, you tout "crash protection" but mean "crash assurance".
