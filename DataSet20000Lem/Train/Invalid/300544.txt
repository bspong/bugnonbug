Invalid or corrupt jarfile C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\chrome\toolkit.jar
(filename is an example, happens with all files)

N/A

This only just began a few day ago. I had installed an extension and then,
since I didn't like it, uninstalled it shortly thereafter. This issue may have
started just after that, but I can't be 100% certain.
