Can't focus XUL element
Created attachment 382974
testcase - focus on vbox

With Minefield (I'm on Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090612 Minefield/3.6a1pre), focus on XUL element is spotty.

The attached testcase focus the red vbox from code in the onload handler, then alert the active element (should be 'vbox' but is 'window'). Also when you click on the red vbox, it alert the active element (should be 'vbox' but is 'window'). And to show it's not just activeElement, a keypress handler is added to the vbox (clicking on the vbox and pressing a key should bring up an alert, but it doe not). All of this work in build prior to 06/11.
