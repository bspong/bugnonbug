GTK1 and 2 Build
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8

I wa just wondering if Mozilla could provide offical build of recent Firefox
and Mozilla browser for both GTK1 and GTK2, I understand that GTK1 is desirable
since it will run smoothly on older Linux distributions, but it would be nice if
a GTK2 build wa also provided, so people with newer distribution can take
advantage of the much nicer fonts. This would be esp. helpful with a product
like Firefox where distributor are not yet providing thier own binary package
(where they often compile against GTK2 for new releases.)
