In the new i6 Firefox Menu implementation. Various margin are off.

Between the top and bottom of the menu, there is missing about a 2px space beween the bottom and the menu item highlight compared to native menus.

Also, submenu do not overlay properly. There should be about a 5px overlay between the highlight edge and the arrow.

I'll upload a few screenshots to illustrate the problem.

Reproducible: Always
