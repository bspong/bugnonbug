Googlebar Lite 4.6.8 search history missing under Firefox 3.0.4

When FF update to version 3.0.4, most of my Googlebar Lite search history disappear. In addition, new search are not stored in the 4.6.8 pull down menu. The stored history in Firefox is not affected.

When I reinstall FF 3.0.3 - all of the missing Googlebar Lite are restored and new search are also saved.

It appears that this is a bug in FF 3.0.4.
