I am running Win 7 Ultimate 32 bit on one computer - with Firefox 3.6.
Problem: And I am one of many with the same "Website Redirect" problem. This just started. I have run Norton 360, SuperAntispyware Pro, Unhack Me and a host of others to locate the Malware. Please help. Even when I Google "Firefox Redirect Problem" and get the site that address this problem, I Cannot Access Them Because I am Redirected to Some Affiliate Site. Please don't make me use IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on Google result - Taken to an Affiliate Page, marketing something I don't need or worse to a "Forbidden Site"
2. --OR-- Double click on Google Result (anyone on the page) -- Page jump and reloads: The Same Page
3. With either of the above: Firefox slows to a snail pace or lock up completely, refusing even to close.



Yep, this is caused by Malware that attack Firefox. I read a lot, enough at least, to know that Firefox is a attractive a target for malware a MS. I'm just hoping you folk will know where I can go in the Registry to delete the problem-causing malware.
