After installing the skype firefox add-on FireFox very frequently firefox is frozen when trying to load certain pages.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

Occurred daily and multiple time per session. Certain page (opened a tabs) would cause FFox to freeze. Only solution wa to terminate FF using task manager. Tried uninstalling varios Add-ons (I use very few - le than 5 anyway) but when I realized Skype wa the last thing I installed before this started occuring, I uninstalled the Skype FFox add-on. Immediate solution - same tabs/pages that had caused the freeze (every time for those pages) now cause no problem. FYI the page involved were common everyday news kind of page - perhaps with embodied ad software etc - but nothing unusual at all.

Great job on the product though guys!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Had Skype FFox add on installed
2. Try opening various page a tab
3. Can't tell you an example - but I wa opening page from Google News the last it occurred. Same page caused the freeze each time.



not freeze and fail :)

Happens multiple time a session guy - this is not the "lost in the haystack" kind of bug
