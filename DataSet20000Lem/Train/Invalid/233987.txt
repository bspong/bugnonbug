extension cannot be installed in $HOME
User-Agent:

I'm working on a Debian box and I'm regularly *pi....* when there's a new
upgrade for mozilla/firefox. This is because the only place where to install
extension seems to be the system directories. So each time I get an upgrade my
extension are silently gone.

I'd vote for an option to install extension under $HOME.

Additional note: why in god's name is tabbed browsing not integrated? is anybody
*not* using it?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install a new version
