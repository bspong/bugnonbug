Web page take very long time to load through proxy server
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0.1 and Firefox/1.0

Firefox take a long time to display the website when configured to run
through our corporate proxy server. The proxy server is MailMarshall 6. The
platform I have tested on are Windows XP and 2000. The version I have tested
are 1.0 and 1.0.1. Firefox in 1.0 released the ability to pas through user
name and password to network proxy for seamless web browsing. Typically a
website will take 1-2 minute loading. I can provide edited network traces.

I then tested with IE and the browser performs a expected - loading webpage
on demand. I am wondering if there is a problem with the NTLSSM Firefox
integrated authentication. I do not have another NT based authentication proxy
server to test the connection with. Firefox doe not consume more than 30
percent CPU at any given time. There is a lot of http traffic generated at
interval and what look like reset connections.

In order for Firefox to be accepted in Corporate network it must be
compatible with all proxys.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure browser to point to NT authentication based proxy (Webmarshall)
configured port 8080.
2. Try to browse webpage
3. Wait 2 minute to load each page

Actual Results:
Waited about 2 minute for each page to load - page doe eventually load.

Expected Results:
Web page should load right away.

Network trace can be obtained on request. (IP address will be changed)

Samples of Network output:
HTTP HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Access Denied (text/html)
HTTP HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Access Denied, NTLMSSP_CHALLENGE

What I don't understand is why these message show up in the trace but firefox
doesn't stop trying/send an error message but keep trying till it get
through.
