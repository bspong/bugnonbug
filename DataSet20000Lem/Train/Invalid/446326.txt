There is an issue with the intagration extension with Download Accelerator Plus.
I contacted the maker witch is speedbit about the issue and they found the issue. Currenty the speedbit development team is diligently working to correct the issue. So it is on there end not your end. Just thaught I would let everybody know that the bug is not in FireFox. So we will just have to wate intell speedbit corrects the issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.It only happens in FireFox version 3.0.1 and above
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Download the speedbit accelerator plus from the website from the FireFox browser. Follow the on screen promt directions. then after computer restarta and fully load connect back to the internet and open up the browser.

Expected Results:
It say not compatable with Mozilla FireFox 3.0.1 and I tryed using the new Gran Paradiso Browser 3.0.2 to see if that would work and get the same error.

The software should of integrated itself into Mozilla Fire Fox and Gran Paradiso. Then worked fine. Its a pain to have to keep trying to reinstall extension to see if that will make them work in your new browser versions. When I upgrade my Mazilla FireFox Browser or Gran Paradiso browser then the extension should automaticaly work in the browser with the hassle and heartake of reinstalling and knowing that may not even fix the problim. When upgrading FireFox and Gran Paradiso. The upgrade program should automaticaly udate the extension to work in your browser then we dont have to go through this.
