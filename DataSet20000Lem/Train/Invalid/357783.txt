Before the current build, I wa using Tab Mix Plus. When many tab were opened, the tab shrunk in width until only the page icon (or downloading throbber, if the page wa still downloading) wa visible. I'd like the option to allow tab to get that small in the current build, a the default minimum tab width is far too wide for my preference.

Reproducible: Always
