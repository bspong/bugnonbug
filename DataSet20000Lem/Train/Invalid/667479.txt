Installer auto-setting browser a Default and auto-pins to taskbar in win7
Not sure when this started and so far unable to find any regression window because all .exe installers back to 1st of June at least are behaving the same.

I suppose it could be something gone wrong in win7 or my win7 profile/registry or something ?

I have always used .exe installers when testing over the yr and today when I grabbed the latest hourly, this is when I first noticed, that when installing there 'was' a window that had a check-box (which defaulted to checked) that set Firefox a your 'default' browser. I have always un-checked that box. However now the check-box is missing giving no chance to unset the browser during install a the default, and the install is getting auto-pinned to the taskbar, which is normal behavior I believe when the browser is set at default.

I have tried different profile - no change
I have restart window - no change
I just now deleted everything related to Mozilla in the known directory locations, save for places.sqlite (didn't want to lose ton of history) - no change, still auto-defaults and set a prime browser and auto-pins to taskbar.

If this is a registry setting stuck on my system, I'm clueless a where to look, maybe someone could point to the registry setting to change ?
