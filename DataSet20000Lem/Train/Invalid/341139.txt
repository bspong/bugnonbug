Hallo!

I have a very big problem about one of the new change in firefox 1.5. When you right click on an image a popup menu come up even if you have set onContextMenu="return false;" in the IMG tag.

This is very probelmatic becouse i am making commersial game that are using right click for input. If a distrubing popup menu come up on every right click on an image my game will not be playable in Firefox anymore.

Have a look at an example at http://www.framegame.net and you will see.

onContextMenu work in Internet Explorer and it have worked in Firefox perfectly until the latest version of Firefox.

If this dosn't change back so that firefox once again follow the W3C standard i will have to recommend my custumers to use Internet Explorer instead :/

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on the gameboard on http://www.framegame.net
Actual Results:
A very disturbing popup menu come up that make the game impossible to play

Expected Results:
No popup menu. A javascript shoult handle the right click and send it to the server.
