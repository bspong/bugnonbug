After playing with the Zoom utility I left the Zoom Window (Which appears when you double click your mouse to read very small text) at the top of the Firefox window (an area between the Window Title (Example: "Enter A Bug - Mozilla Firefox" and TAB ("www.google.com","www.vg.no","www.mozilla.org") i noticed that when switching to another TAB, and then going back to the original TAB window which the Zoom utility wa active you will be unable to move the zoom window box onto the text you want to zoom in, and i will stay in the specific area.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double click
2. Move the zoom utility above the "TAB" bar.
3. Switch to another TAB you already have open or create a new one.
4. Then switch back and try to move the zoom utility "window box" from the TAB bar and zoom in on some random text.

Actual Results:
1. Unable to move the TAB back down onto the text. It is locked to the TAB bar.

Expected Results:
You will be unable to move the TAB back down onto the text. It is locked to the TAB bar.

1. It should have zoomed in on text on the website you are browsing instead of beeing "locked" in the TAB bar.
