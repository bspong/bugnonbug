When I visit the above site, a popup zoom from the top of the screen and
obscures the web page. It may not be a 'window' to the operating system but it
is certainly a popup, and popup blocking ought to stop it being shown.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit the URL above.

Actual Results:
A popup appeared, even though popup blocking is on.

Expected Results:
Firebird should have not displayed the popup but put an 'i' icon in the corner
to explain that it had been blocked.
