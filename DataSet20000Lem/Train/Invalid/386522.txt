Tabs do not close, do not load their pages, and open when a link is clicked that creates a new window

There are several feature relating to tab which do not work for me in the new version of Firefox. First, the close button for tab doe not do anything. Neither do the 'Close Tab' and 'Close Other Tabs' buttons. Secondly, no tab load it page, even though the URL is displayed on the tab; instead, the first tab load all page typed into subsequent tabs. Lastly, when I click on a link that is supposed to open a new window, the window open properly, but a new tab is created on the window containing the link.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create tab
2.Attempt to close it
3.Attempt to use the address bar to go to a website; note that the first tab (left-most) load the page instead.
4.Find and select link that open a new window; tab is opened on original window.


Expected Results:
Tabs should be closeable; the right-click menu for the tab should also work when attempting to close the tab or close all other tabs. 'New Tab' and all of the other option DO work. Address bar should correspond to the tab that is selected; the selected tab should load what is typed into the address bar, not a different tab. And lastly, tab should not be opening when clicking on link that open new windows.

The bug happens with the vanilla Firefox; I have not installed any themes, or even any plugins, other than what it came with.
