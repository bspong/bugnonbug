Dragging a URI icon to the desktop to make a shortcut when the shortcut already exists cause the dialog box to be unreachable without using alt+tab.

When the url icon is drag to desktop, or elsewhere, if a shortcut with the same
name exists, then a dialog pop up with "Overwite yes/n0", BUT it is hidden
behind FireFox, not brought to top, there is nothing in the task bar, and all
FireFox window appear locked !

Alt-Tab is the only way to reach it !

Appart from fixing this, you also really need to give a "Rename" option, to save
a a different name, or do an auto-rename, a is done with downloads of the same
file (quite neat - but an option of a warning would be nice)

Also, when the window is full screen, saving shortcut is a pain - can you not
provide a "Save Shortcut to current page" either on the right-click/context
menu, or on the File menu ?

Thanks (just downloaded full 1.0 release, but doesn't fix this issue)


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto any URL, drag the icon prefix to the url to the desktop, and release -
save shortcut
2. Repeat this - all Firfox window now appear to lock up !
3. In fact there is a window "Overwrite this file" box, but it is hidden behind
Firfox
4. Must use Alt-Tab to get to it.
5. There is not even a rename option, either overwrite, or don't save !




Anyone not a serious window user is going to think that Firefox ha died - it
took me a while to realise what had happened the first time.
