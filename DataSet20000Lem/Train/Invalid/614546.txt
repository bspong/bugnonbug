Bumptop program (said it had bought Google????) download :: subpack in download - pcmedkit :: began to erase C++ programming ... 'bout a week or two
ago. Browsers began to act up :: get white page, but not asking for permission
... "windows need your permission...etc"; that white page but doesn't ask for permission ... so basically, browser not working properly, can't access anything on either mozilla foxfire nor explorer.
Tried to download another browser ... new one ... forget ... new browser download went semi-opaque white screen. Then message about C++ failure on compute ... ha something to do with graphics, right...? never got into C++

If I repeat browser window from the menu....after about 12 browser starts, the browser work.

Reproducible: Always

1.open browser window
2.open another browser window

when closing, box open close ? wait ? waited once :: several hours; notting happened.

software - bumptop is a 3D desktop - pcmedkit is supposed to reload and correct window - like a virus program but correcting program errors.
