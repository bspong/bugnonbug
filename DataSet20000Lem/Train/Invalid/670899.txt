Autocomplete doesn't work properly [caused by Google Toolbar Plugin]

Steps to reproduce:

I just open a page with (sign in) forms.


Actual results:

When I click on the login field, there are no item (previously entered) showed (but not always).


Expected results:

I should open the list of item entered previously.

When I'm entering a login, it's doing nothing. After then, when I click "Tab" to set focus for password field, it fill in the password.
But normally, it should suggest me my login data while I type it or show all possible variant when I click on the login field.
As I told, it work well sometimes.
