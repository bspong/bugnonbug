Whenever you hover over an object with Alt text that alt text will display anytime your cursor stop moving for a second. It doesn't matter where the cursor is, it can be over whitespace or on another tab, but the last Alt text will display if you stop moving the cursor. Can be really annoying if the Alt text is long to have it popping up every time you move your mouse a little.
