The background-color style for a textarea control in a form (INPUT TYPE="text") appears to fail under very specific circumstances: namely when the control is in the 2nd column of a table, the word "email" appears in the first column and the textarea control is named "q". If all are true, it set the background area to yellow (#FFFFA0).

The style work fine if the control ha any other name; it also work for text other than "email" in column 1. "email" break the style if other text is present, provided that there is space around it: "email", "email me" and "Please email me" are all broken; "emails", "emai" and emaix" work correctly.

For the style to be broken, the word "email" and the control do not actually need to be in the first & second columns; they just need to be adjacent or with one or more blank column between them. If there is any text in the intervening columns, the background appears correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the following file into the browser:

<html><head></head><body>

<table><tr>
<td>email</td>
<td>
<FORM method="GET">
<INPUT TYPE="text" name="q" maxlength="255" value="" style="background-color: pink;"><p>
</FORM>

</td></tr></table>

</body></html>

Actual Results:
Background to Textarea control is yellow.

Expected Results:
It should be pink.

Using default theme in Firefox, Windows Classic theme in XP.
The code work correctly in IE 7.0.5730.11

This doe seem a bizarrely unlikely bug, but I have reproduced it on another machine.
