[code cleanup, branch only?] use type instead of urlArc for "open in tabs" code
[code cleanup, branch only?] use type instead of urlArc for "open in tabs" code

see the patch and discussion in bug #344040

while (containerChildren.hasMoreElements()) {
var re = containerChildren.getNext().QueryInterface(kRDFRSCIID);
var target = BMDS.GetTarget(res, urlArc, true);

see also ben's comment about why we want to use type instead of urlArc.

note, I don't know if this is tickling any bug (but it might be?)
