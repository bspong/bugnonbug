This is about using Duplicate Tabs > Merge Windows
--------------------------------------------------
1) "Merge Windows" doe not always keep toolbars. When one of the Firefox window
to be merged doe not have toolbar, the merged window doe not have toolbar
neither. In such case, the toolbars that exist before the merge desappear when
the "Merge Windows" is done. In such a case, the unique merged window doe have
multiple tabs, but the tab label are not presented. Therefore the only way to
go from one tab to another is then to use the keyboard shortcut CTRL-TAB.
2) On an HMI point of view, the "Merge Windows" menu should not be under
"Duplicate Tab". It should be presented under the "View" menu of the main
Firefox toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open at least one Firefox window having toolbars and tabs.
2. Open at leat one Firefox window without toolbar.
3. For one of the tab of the first window, do "Duplicate Tab" > "Merge Windows"

Actual Results:
There is only one Firefox window with many tabs, but no toolbar and no tab label.

Expected Results:
The toolbars must be kept, even is one of the original window doe not have toolbar.

This bug is a major one, because when it happens, the best solution is to close
Firefox, reload all browser windows, and keep them separate (not merged).

The "Merge Windows" action should not be presented under "Duplicate Tab".
New user will never look under "Duplicate Tab" in order to "Merge Windows".
"Merge Windows" is an important feature.
It should be presented in the "View" menu of the main toolbar.
