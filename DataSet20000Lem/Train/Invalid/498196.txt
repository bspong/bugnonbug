Firefox automatically updated on 6/10/2009. When I opened the download manager, the list had been cleared. Now it behaves differently. The download manager seems to automatically clear when my current file is finished. Thus, the "clear list" button is kind of obsolete. I don't see any option to control this behavior. In the past, the file stay in the list until I clear them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Note: Steps 1-3 may not be necessary
1. Revert to version 3.0.10

5. Watch the download manager window.

Actual Results:
When the download is finished, the entry will disappear without prompting. The list is clear.

The file should stay in the list until cleared by the user.
