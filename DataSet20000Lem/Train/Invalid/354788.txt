I can delete all link from "Links" toolbar, but cannot delete the blank, useless toolbar itself... Why can't I just delete/hide it?

Why can't "Links" be just another folder in Bookmarks and/or Favorites?

I REALLY NEED the screen space wasted by this unnecessary/useless feature...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Delete all content of "Links" Toolbar...
2.Try to "Delete" Links Toolbar... (No Luck)
3.Try to "Hide" Links Toolbar... (No Luck)
4.Try to "Move" Linls Toolbar to "Bookmarks"... (No Luck)
5.Try to "Cut" Links Toolbar... (No Luck)
I hate "Links".
"Links" just waste dsesktop space.
"Links" was/is/(will always be) buggy anyway.
I just use "Bookmarks"...
Why isn't "Links" simply another folder in "Bookmarks"???

Should have a button/dropdown or other control under File, Edit, View...

(You know, where one would expect a feature called delete/cut/move/hide, etc...)

No such luck/no button available for expected functionality...

Useless/buggy link toolbar sitting empty just wasting space on my screen.
