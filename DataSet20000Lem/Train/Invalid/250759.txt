I created jump menu that I use in a few spot on this site. The go button doe
not work for the first listed item in the menu. If you scroll down to any other
item and click on that item, the menu will connect you to the highlighted page
link. I used Dreamweaver MX to create these menus. Not sure what to look at or
what to fix. These menu do work fine in IE.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:
Software should connect you to the first item in the jump menu box when clicking
on the go button.
