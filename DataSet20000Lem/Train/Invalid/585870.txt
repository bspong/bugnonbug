When entering a common term in the awesomebar and it jump directly to a website, there is no easy way to go 'back' to just the google search of that term. Instead, one ha to re-type the search term in the search bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. New tab in Firefox
2. Type a search term such a 'Facebook' into the awesomebar ('Facebook' work on my computer, you might have to find a different one)
3. Press enter
Actual Results:
You will now be at the Facebook webpage, but there is no easy way to get to the google result of 'Facebook'. You either have to go to the google search page, or use the search toolbar in Firefox. Both of these require typing the search term again (and remembering them!) which get more bothersome a the length of the serach term increase.

Expected Results:
I would expect the awesomebar to work exactly the same way, but with one change. When at the 'I'm feeling Lucky' result (facebook.com in the example above), I want to press the back button in the browser to go 'back' to the google search. I don't want to actually go to the google search at any point, unless I don't like the 'I'm feeling Lucky' and have pressed the back button.

Not a technical bug. Nothing crashes. But it's a real pain.
