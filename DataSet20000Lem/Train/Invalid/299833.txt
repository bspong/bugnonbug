I recently installed 'deer park alpha1' whilst also continuing to use a recent
build of firefox.

I repeatedly tried to set deer park a the default web browser.
however the preference which are inside 'safari' continuously reset to firefox.

The only solution I found wa to place firefox in the trash.

Reproducible: Always
