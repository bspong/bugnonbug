set a tooltip for the preview image in the place organizer

currently, we'll show "Preview" in the the thumbnail if we don't have a preview.

For accessbility, I think we need to specify some sort of alt tag for the canvas element that match the text ("Preview") or match the image ("Preview of <url>")

<!ENTITY detailsPane.noPreviewAvailable.label "Preview">

(Shouldn't that be "No Preview Available"?)

see _updateThumbnail()
