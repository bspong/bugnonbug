When I try to write an email or answer an email it happens roughly 50-75% that the screen get stuck with 'sending' at the top after I clicked the SEND button. This screen will not change unless I reload the page. When I look into SENT folder I see the mail ha been sent though.
I don't know if this problem occured with the beta 3 or 4.
