Have 3 display running; 2 off Video Card (Nvidia GeForce 8600GT), 1 off eVGA UV 16 Plus (DisplayLink technology). Bringing up Firefox under these circmstances consistently lead to a BSOD in NVLDDLKM.SYS - Page Fault In Non Paged Area. Proof: 1) Disconnecting device eliminates problem. 2) IE7 work just fine.Have latest driver for eVGA and 8600GT. Unfortunately, this render the product unusable and requires uninstall to avoid continuing and serious problems. (I don't always use the 3rd display for power saving purpose but then when I fire it up, forgetting the nasty BSOD, I certainly remember I should have made sure Firefox wa down.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Boot with eVGA device on OR
2.Turn on eVGA device after boot
3.AND invoke Firefox
Actual Results:
BSOD

Expected Results:
Normal ops.
