Autoscroll should use ns-resize and ew-resize

Autoscroll currently us the n-resize and e-resize cursor for page that scroll vertically and horizontally, respectively. In some operating systems/window managers, this result in a bidirectional arrow in the proper direction; for others this result in a unidirectional arrow/resize cursor. Since Mozilla support the ns-resize and ew-resize cursors, we should use those to provide a bidirectional arrow on all systems.

Reproducible: Always
