Firefox & latest alpha version fals over when using Ebay Turbo Lister.
Ebay have just recently brought out a new version of a program called "Turbo
Lister" that doe not seem to be compatible with Mozilla.
With 1.8a4 The program just fall over:
"Tl.exe ha generated error and will be closed by Windows. ... etc."
Firefox behaves similarly!
I am an ebay seller in the Uk and I switched to Mozilla during the recent
Microsoft fiasco regarding security etc.
Up until now everything ha actually worked fine using firefox 1.7. I have also
installed your 1.8 alpha version and I am getting similar results.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load Turbo Lister
2.Click on Item Inventory
3.Dialoge box is then displayed a follows - "Tl.exe ha generated error and
will be closed by Windows. ... etc."

Actual Results:
Turbo lister shuts down.


Expected Results:
Displayed all my auctions.

I know TL.exe (supplied by ebay) is a stand alone app but if I set my default
browser back to MS IE it work ok!
Seems to be compatability problem with TL.ex & firefox.
