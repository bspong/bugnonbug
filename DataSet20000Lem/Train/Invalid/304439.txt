Sorry, would be very difficult to explain, see Steps to Reproduce. Perheps it
better fit in OS Integration or Toolbars, but I wasn't sure.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a local HTML file with a link in it. (you can copy from here: <a
href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>)
2. Start Firefox. (Firefox must be running, but even a Downloads or Bookmark
Manager window will do)
3. Open the file by double-clicking it in Explorer/Total Commander. (Firefox
must be set a your default browser.)
4. A second Firefox window is opened with the previously created file. Click on
the link.
Actual Results:
There is no possibility to go back, the back button is grayed out.

Expected Results:
There is a possibility to go back, the back button isn't grayed out. :-)
