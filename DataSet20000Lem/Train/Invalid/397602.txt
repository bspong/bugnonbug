To be most presice, I will provide an example. I open Mozilla Firefox, loading my home page http://www.google.com. Shortly afterwards I load the page http://www.facebook.com. After logging in to facebook, the webpage freezes. If I try and load any more pages, the status on the lower left hand part of the window say "Stopped". No more page will load, although my internet connection is still up and running (evident in my able usage of Internet Explorer). After I close Mozilla Firefox, I can still find a copy of firefox.exe running in my Windows Task Manager processes. If I repeat the afore mentioned process, multiple firefox.exe's will be running at the same time, although Firefox wa closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load Mozilla Firefox
2.Load a few webpage (either one or more tab can be open)
3.Status on the lower left read "Stopped"
4.No other web page will load, status on lower left remains unchanged
Actual Results:
I wa forced to close Mozilla Firefox, since no web page could load. A copy of firefox.exe must be ended in the Task Manager's processes.

Expected Results:
The software should have continued loading web page a I changed from page to page. After closing Mozilla Firefox, the application's process (i.e. firefox.exe) should close a well.

I tried re-installing the application, in an effort to eliminate this bug, but to no avail.
