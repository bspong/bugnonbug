I always used http://us.mcafee.com/root/speedometer/test_0150.asp url to check
wht bandwidth I am getting.I never found any problem with Internet Explorer.But
This page doe not get loaded properly in Mozilla 1.0 I installed the flash and
shockwave plugins for mozilla also. Still the page doe not work for me in
mozilla where a it is working in Internet explorer.

On the top of the window in right hand side just above the "Internet connection
speedometer logo" I see this error code that might be usefull for u

if flashInstalled) alert("Flash is Installed"); else alert("No Flash");

More over the Bandwidth calculation part of the ASP script doesnot work in mozilla.
I hope u fix this bug soon.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just open this page in Internet explorer
http://us.mcafee.com/root/speedometer/test_0150.asp
2. Then open the same page in Mozilla.
3. Then compare Both page u will not see th espeedometer image in mozilla where
a it is there in Internet explorer.

Actual Results:
Basically it a flash file shown in internet explorer but not in Mozilla. And
not even the calculation for the bandwidth test are done a the page is in ASP
format so I think there is some problem in mozilla with ASP pages,

Expected Results:
The mozilla Browser must have shown me the flash file just a it is shown in
internet explorer. And the calculation too must be done by Mozilla.

The problem is persisting with default theme also.
