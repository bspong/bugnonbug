Hi,
I just note that because my main language is Arabic, sometimes when I need to write English in post form in any forum using vBulletin forum software.

When I use "Switch test Direction" the WYSIWYG box got like disabled, the page go to top, and when I try to write any text, I can't see typing cursor and the keyboard action like (Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V / Ctrl+X / Ctrl+A / ... etc) not working, and these action (copy/past/cut/select all... etc) not working in context menu too, it look like it disabled.

And all button in WYSIWYG box disabled.

I need to refresh the post page to return to normal with WYSIWYG.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Post page (post subject/post replay/PM) in any forum using vBulletin software (must support WYSIWYG ).
2. Write or don't anything, but you can type anything to try and see that Copy/Past and another action not working.
3. Right click inside WYSIWYG and then select "Switch Test Direction"..
Actual Results:
As I said, the page going to top then WYSIWYG Box is totally corrupted with it button and keyboard shortcut and Context menu not working anymore.

Expected Results:
Must working like what wa in FF 3.x.x

I test that in many forum with different version (vB 3.6.x / vB 3.8.x / vB 4.x)

and with forum using VBSEO and with that doe not using it, the problem i sthe same at all.
