hidden network traffic while showing search result on google

I noticed a strange behavior with google searches: The browser invisibly request the URL of the top hit - thia traffic is *not* shown in the firebug extension.

I noticed this behavior in different version and on different plattforms and I wa not able to trace this back to a specific add on or setting.

Here is a list of installation I tested:

version____plattform____occurs
===============================
3.5.2______OSX 10.4_____yes
3.6________OSX 10.5_____yes
3.6.2______OSX 10.6_____yes
3.6.3______OSX 10.6_____yes
3.5.3______Win7 64______no
3.5.7______Win XP_______yes
3.5.9______Win XP_______yes
3.6________Win7 64______yes
3.6.3______Win XP_______yes
3.6.3______Win7 64______no

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. google "thomas sabo"
2. view search results, thomassabo.com is top hit
3. view network traffic or just monitor the session cookie for thomassabo.com - you will see, that firefox open thomassabo.com in the backgroun
Actual Results:
Firefox invisibly request thomassabo.com and even accepts the session cookie.

nb: On affected system this behavior is not limited to thomassabo.com, but occurs with the top hit of any google search.

Expected Results:
I see no reason for this behavior.

Is it a bug or a feature? Is it a strange google feature? A strange add on? We are quite suprised by this behavior and coudnt find anything about it in google or the bug list...
