After using Mozilla for a while page stop rendering properly

I often browse online for hour at a time. I'm working on my website, doing research for it or something. After many hour (say 5 or so) or if I happen to leave Firefox open overnight, page stop rendering. Eventually all page show up blank, though the status bar report "Done." It 'feels' like a resource leak of some kind. For instance, I can stave it off by, if I have many window or tab open, closing a few of them. Then the remaining tabs/windows will render properly for a while, but eventually they too begin to show the same behavior. I can empty the cache, and that will stave it off for a little longer, but eventually, I have only one window left and I've just cleared the cache, and even that window show a blank page and "Done." If I restart Firefox, it doesn't help. However, I do not need to restart the computer. Oddly, all I have to do is log myself out, and then log in again, and the leaky resource have been reclaimed, and all is well and good again, until it start to happen again. Anyone ever seen "The Never-Ending Story?" I feel like I'm fighting the "Nothing"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox under my configuration for many hours, or maybe just browse to thousand of different web pages.
2. See what happens

Actual Results:
Pages no longer render properly. Fonts, Forms, tables, panel appear wrongly, often a if the browser no longer supported them, or can't allocate the resource it need to render them properly. Eventually nothing render and all page are displayed a blank.

Expected Results:
It should just keep rendering page properly a it did when I first logged in.
