Bug 318564 ha NOT been resolved
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.5

Multiple click on the HOME icon, when a home tab group ha been set, raise an entirely new batch of tabs, rather than refreshing all tab pages.

This behavior doe not occur in any other version of Firefox or Mozilla.

It is NOT the issue that may or may not have been fixed in the Bug reported a it predecessor duplicate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up multi-tab home group (say, M tabs)
2. Set current group a home.
3. Click on the home icon. N click ===> N x M tab now appear: you can get hundred of tab this way, if that's what turn you on.....



Expected Results:
The original M tab should be refreshed. NO new tab should have been added.

Firefox 1.5 bug. Mozilla 1.7.12 and all previous have never worked this way.

No config file tweaking helps.
