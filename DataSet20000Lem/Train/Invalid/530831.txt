When a non-western web page is left open for a long period of time (a day or two), the page title on the brower becomes unreadable (question marks). Here is a screen shot of the problem: http://www.cedarparknotebook.net/ourhome/uploads/2009/11/2009-11-24_111408.jpg

Once this happens, the browser ha to be closed (if multiple tab are open) then reopen to have the page title displayed correctly; or open a new FF instance and then go to the same page to display the page title correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a non-western web page, say Chinese, and other tab
2.Leave the non-western web page open and continue your other work, including lock/unlock your pc, etc., for a day or two.
3.You will notice the page title becomes unreadable.
Actual Results:
The page title becomes unreadable.

Expected Results:
The page title should always support uni-code text.

This actullay happened in previous version of Firefox too, such a Firefox 3.5.
