You have so many bug under VISTA that I cannot list them all here. I have used Firefox for year -- no more. I have been a software developer for 25 year and you guy need to fix these bug pronto. I know from speaking to other user that you are losing more and more of them every day.I urge you to WRITE ME. Some examples: Disappearing menus, website popup failure (when they SHOULD pop up). failure of the browser to close properly. and many many more. If you want to stay in business GET THEM FIXED.
