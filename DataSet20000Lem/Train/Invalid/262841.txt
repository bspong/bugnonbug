On the page http://www.krishna.com/_new/main.php?id=323 certain link &lt;a&gt;
get randomly bumped to a new line, a if a line break wa inserted in front of
link. See attached image.

I also made sure the html markup is well-formed. It should conform to XHTML 1.1,
though it's using a custom DTD (XHTML + Value attribute for lists). I also made
sure it's not the CSS stylesheet doing this.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. code an unordered list (ul) which includes a link in the list item (li) part.
Actual Results:
The link get bumped to a new line a if a line break (br) were inserted in
front of it.

Expected Results:
The link should have remained an inline item (i.e. no new line).
