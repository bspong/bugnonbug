support.ati.com: Browser hang and eventually report error trying to submit bug report to ATI Linux driver support site. The same URL/report on Firefox 2.x on Windows succeeds
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008101315 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008101315 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.3

I've been trying for some time to report a bug re the Linux ATI driver using their support site URL (as above), but it fails every time using Firefox 3.x (from my Ubuntu install.)



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce the problem:
1.) Install Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid), apply all updates.
2.) Using the installed firefox, visit the URL: http://support.ati.com/ics/survey/survey.asp?deptID=894&surveyID=508&type=web
3.) Attempt to make a bug report and click submit.
4.) Watch it wait/try for a couple of minute and eventually fail.


Actual Results:
The browser hang and eventually report an error (failing to complete the bug report on the ATI site.)

Expected Results:
The browswer should succeed and navigate the ATI bug report completion page.

I tested using Firefox 2.x on Windows, so while I don't think the OS is relevant there is nevertheless a possibility that this may be somehow OS related. I'll try and do a test to confirm.

All test were done with no theming or any special add-on installed.
