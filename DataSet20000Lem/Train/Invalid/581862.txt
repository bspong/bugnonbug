chrome.manifest not executed with bootstrapped harness.js

I created an extension with jetpack 0.5 SDK. In all previous version of Firefox, chrome.manifest would still register the chrome:// url for preference and such. However, when I ran the same extension in Firefox 4.0b1, I got: "No chrome package registered for chrome://gslinksmanager/content/prefs.xul"

Also, on a side note, when trying to open Preferences when the xul doesn't exist, the whole app basically freeze and doesn't allow you to do anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install extension
2. Attempt to open Preferences
Actual Results:
Firefox freeze and chrome url aren't registered.

Expected Results:
chrome url are registered and the preference open.
