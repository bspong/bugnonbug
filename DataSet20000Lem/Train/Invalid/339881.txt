There should be the option to have several tabbed homepage when the browser is opened.
I want google, wikipedia, voo2do and my blog site open all the time. If they all opened in seperate tab - ie multiple tabbed homepage - it would be very handy.
At the moment I find myself habitually opening at least one or two extra tab a soon a I open the browser.
