Firefox add style="position: absolute" to <a> tag
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The original code look like this:
<a href="/pl:egzamin,1,27.html">....</a>

It render OK in the other browser (including FF 3.0). FF 3.5.1 render this code a
<a href="/pl:egzamin,1,27.html" style="position: absolute;">...</a>

what cause <a> tag to overlap each other.

There is no "position" entry in the original HTML code. It seems FF just add this code by itself.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open link provided
2. Click on light-blue tab in the page content (Business English, Teacher Qualifications etc.)

Actual Results:
Overlapping <li> entry

Expected Results:
Corrected website is available on http://lcci.rysie.com/pl:1.html

Changes needed to correct this problem manually: forcing stylesheet to display <a> tag relatively by adding

a {
display: block !important;
position: relative !important;
}

The problem exists on XP and Vista. It wa reproduced on two different machines.
Both machine have the same plug-in configuration, including Firebug 1.4.1 and NoScript 1.9.7.7.
