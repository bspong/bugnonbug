If you add reference.com a a search engine, it ha malformed search URLs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to reference.com - make sure that it is not already added a one of your search engines.
2.You will note that it can be added; do so.
3.Enter any search query with this engine. The example I have presented is "SEARCH."


Actual Results:
URLs in the form of:

http://www.reference.com/browse/SEARCH?r=77

which redirects to:

http://www.reference.com/search?q=?r=77

Expected Results:
Searches should generate URLs of the type:

http://www.reference.com/search?q=SEARCH

Also, please close Bug 158732 - a feature request to add dictionary.com a a search engine; it is now a default setting.
