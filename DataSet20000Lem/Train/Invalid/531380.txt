Hi all

OS: Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic
FF: 3.6b4

Up until now I usually install firefox at

Code: Select all
/opt/firefox



The permission of this directory are then set to

Code: Select all
sudo chown -r root:root /opt/firefox



The result are that the Help -> Check for updates... menu item is always grayed out.

Now for the first time ever after installing FF3b4 This menu item is not grayed out after setting the permission of this directory to root.

Is this a bug/oversight?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} /opt/firefox
2. Update firefox
3. sudo chown -R root:root /opt/firefox
Actual Results:
Help -> Check for update IS NOT grayed out after setting owner of /opt/firefox back to root.

Expected Results:
Help -> Check for update should be grayed out after setting owner of /opt/firefox back to root.

Does this mean that firefox can now update itself when run a logged in user? Even though the file are now owned a Root. Previously (i.e FF <= 3.6b3) this wa not the case.
