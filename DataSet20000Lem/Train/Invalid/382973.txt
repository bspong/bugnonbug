Mozilla won't load any webpage anymore after update

I have Windows Vista.. and my Firefox update itself whenever required. However, this last time, it seemed to install the update.. and now it refuse to load any website. When I open it.. it just say "Done" on the bottom left of the status bar. No URL appears on the bar on top even if I click on a link. It continues to say "Done".

I went to Help > Check for updates... and it say "There were problem checking for, downloading or installing this update. Firefox could not be updated because:

AUS: Update XML File Malformed (200)

I have tried restarting the computer.. and I uninstalled Firefox and re-installed it twice to no avail.
Read somewhere else to create a new profile but that wouldn't work either.

Am confused. I love Mozilla.. and I need it
