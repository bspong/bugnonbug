since I have upgraded to firefox 2, the tab don't get displayed properly anymore. the main screen remains white, but i can see the tab on the very left side for about 1cm wide. i can even switch the between the tabs, but they only get displayed 1cm wide (same for the first tab). i checked the extension and it doesn't seem to be related to them, though i can't be certain. i use the same extension on a window machine and don't have this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
i don't know how to reproduce this a i've only upgraded to ff2
