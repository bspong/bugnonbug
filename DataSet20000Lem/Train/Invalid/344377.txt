I recently enabled XkbOptions ctrl:swapcaps in my xorg.conf, which make the cap lock key behave a a ctrl key (and the left ctrl behave a cap lock). The close window keyboard shortcut ctrl+shift+w doe not do anything now when I used the cap lock key a a ctrl.

Strangely, all the other shortcut key I've tried still work fine with the cap lock key a a ctrl. This even includes other ctrl+shift combinations, such a ctrl+shift+z for redo. Also I can still ctrl+shift+w if I use the right ctrl key instead of the cap lock key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add 'Option "XkbOptions" "ctrl:swapcaps"' to the keyboard section of xorg.conf
2. Restart X; cap lock key is now really a ctrl key
3. In Firefox, hold caps+shift and press w (which should be the same a ctrl+shift+w)

Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
The currently focused Firefox window should close.
