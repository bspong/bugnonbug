I open a new tab and the focus is on the adress bar. At that point I cannot use
the cursor key or any other mean to position the cursor (home/end). That of
course mean I cannot select a part of the url. up/down work though --> I can
select from the history.

If I hit ctrl-L (goto urlbar) everything work fine again. Additonally this doe
only happen on new tabs, if I focus the adress bar in an existing tab via mouse,
everything works.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Tab Extensions
2. Hit ctrl-T for new tab
3. Type something in and try to use the left/right cursor keys.

Actual Results:
nothing, because the cursor key do not react

Expected Results:
the obvious, position the cursor
