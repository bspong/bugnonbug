I have just set up my own MediaWiki site and the installation seemed to work perfectly for me. However when I press the reload button in my firefox browser the wiki Main_Page disappears and is replaced by a blank page (a completely blank page). The same thing happens whenever I press the top-left image (which point to the Main_Page). Using CRTL+SHIFT while pressing the refresh button doe reload (and display) the main page correctly. This is however very unpractical. The same problem applies to all other page in my wiki. Reinstalling the wiki gave the same result. My site work normally in InternetExplorer, Safari and Opera. All Gecko-based browser and Konqueror do however show this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.wouterbeek.com/index.php?title=Main_Page
2. Reload the page.
3.

Actual Results:
The browser area in firefox go blank. Even the backward button doe not work! Only CTRL+SHIFT+reload works.

Expected Results:
The page should be displayed inside the rendering area of firefox (just a it doe in Safari and Opera).
