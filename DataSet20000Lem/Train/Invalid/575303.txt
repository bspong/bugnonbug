I installed Nuance's PDF Converter Professional 6 recently and it integrates with MS Word, Excel, Microsoft Outlook, Internet Explorer correctly. However, although it is listed a an add-on in Mozilla Firefox in Firefox I cannot discern a way to use PDF Converter Professional 6 to save a web page in PDF formant.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install PDF Converter Professional 6 and register it so you can use it.
2. After this installation completes, open a MS Windows Internet Explorer web page and verify you can save a copy of the web page to a PDF format named file.
3. Open a Mozilla Firefox 3.3.10 application and verify the PDF Converter Professional 6 is saved in Add-ons list. Try to save a Web page in PDF format to a named file. I cannot figure out how to do this.
Actual Results:
I can find no discernible way to do this

Expected Results:
That I could save a web page to a PDF format named file
