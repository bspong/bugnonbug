Secure Connection Failed












Here's an example of one warning:
developer.mozilla.org us an invalid security certificate.
The certificate will not be valid until 12/10/2007 12:02 PM.
(Error code: sec_error_expired_certificate)
Additionally received same for mail.yahoo.com , a site I have accessed for years.
----
Also today:
HISTORY sorting display only Today (by Date) & won't SORT on By Last Visited under View

Interestingly all the History entry are there for the Keep my History setting I use.
By Date display show only today's.
By Last Visited display show all of them, but not sorted by most-recent at top. The entry are semi-ordered by Date, yet willy-nilly.
Using V 3.0.8

Using History help me during work and research which is why I would like the by-date display to return, along with the Last Visited display.

These two malfunction are rather major to appear on same date.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. try navigating to mozilla.org site to determine if security certificate warning appears
2. try navigating to mail.yahoo.com site to determine if security certificate warning appears
3. Navigate to History sidebar pane, see if previous date are displayed by folder
4. In History sidebar pane, see if By Last Visited view show most-recent at top, oldest at bottom.
Actual Results:
re: Security certificate: Attempts to nav to those two site (and others, like caremark.com) displayed Security Certificate warnings.
Following the process to update certificate allowed for access.

re: History, see Details listed above. Preferences were not changed; this is first occurrence of History problem.


I nearly marked this Severity a a "major" a both happened today, and earlier today when I attempted to post an entry on the Firefox Support Forum Ask a New Question page(s) THAT errored out repeatedly, not allowing a posting. Display noted a repeated error: You have mistyped the anti-bot verification code; please try again. I typed in the correct displayed anti-bot number each time.

There may be something connected among all three of these separate problems. Thanks.
