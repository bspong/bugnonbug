I noticed that Flash movie are not shown with Firefox 3 if they're added with a valid xhtml syntax. The code us only &lt;object&gt; tag without the &lt;embed&gt; tag a shown in A List Apart (http://www.alistapart.com/articles/flashsatay/) or Ambience.sk (http://www.ambience.sk/flash-valid.htm). Sites like Youtube and Adobe.com work ok so the problem may not be in the Flash player.

Also the Flash movie were displayed properly with Firefox 2. After updating to FF 3 they were not shown anymore.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3 and Adobe Flash (9.0.124.0).
2. Visit a site with a Flash movie added with valid xhtml syntax. Examples http://www.4f.fi (on the left side should be a Flash movie) or http://www.hurmaavahamina.fi/ (the whole site should be a Flash movie)
3.
