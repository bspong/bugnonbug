User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

When I open a page with this text:
=================================================
<html>
<head><title>V</title></head>
<body>


<applet code="v.class"></applet>
<applet code="v.class"></applet>


</body>
</html>
=================================================

(The applet doesn't exist.)

The "busy/stop" button come on and stay on. Even after I stop the page no
other tab can be loaded or reloaded. Exiting leaf a firefox.exe process
running. Some feature work: I can create and delete tabs, and closing with
more than one tab give me a warning (and after I say close the window vanishes
but the process remains).

Zoon, IE View, Web Developer, tabbrowser extensions, googlebar, link visitor,
spellbound and spellbound component.
