XPConnect Errors: scope ha no 'Components' property
###!!! ASSERTION: XPConnect is being called on a scope without a 'Components' property!: 'Error', file /home/ddahl/code/moz/mozilla-central/mozilla-central/js/src/xpconnect/src/xpcwrappednativescope.cpp, line 792

I get this error when trying to use the new lazy nsIDOMGlobalPropertyInitializer console object. This is the case when I dynamically create a script node via the console like:
document.createElement("script").innerText = "function foo(){window.console.log('foo');}"

The patch required to reproduce this are on bug 568629 and bug 587734 a well a bug 589329 for some XPConnect patching

I may have some thing wrapped incorrectly, not sure.
