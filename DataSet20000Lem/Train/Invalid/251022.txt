Windows XP - Tab height too small

On Windows XP, the height for the tab bar is too small. On Windows NT it is
fine. Both instance are Firefox 0.9.1. The problem on XP is that the tab bar
is about 3/4 the size it is on XP, which make it inconsistently small when
compared to the Personal Toolbar Folder, but also make the Tab bar look really
jammed together. Mozilla display fine on XP.
