When I load www.kp.ru page in Mozilla Firefox 1.0, firefox.exe us up 87
percent of my processor's speed. www.kp.ru is a famous Russian online news
paper. I tried the same page in netscape 7.0 and I had about 50 percent used up.
I tried that page in Internet Explorer, the page didnot load at all, while my
processor wa at 100 percent used up. So I disabled ActiveX scripting and
download of ActiveX control in IE and the problem wa solved. Processor wa at
1 percent at all time.
I think that web site is running some kind of spy code or broken activeX script.

I suggest that in the future version of FireFox it should have an option for
disabling ActiveX scripting, without having a forced notification of blocked
ActiveX on the page like in IE. It's annoying...

Please reply me with a resolution of this problem.
Thank you very much! I love the speed of your browser!

Happy to help!

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start Mozilla firefox
2. press control + alt + delete to bring up the task manager
3. type in "www.kp.ru" in the address bar without quotes.
4. watch the processor usage percentage.
5. from there you are on your own...
Actual Results:
processor wa at 87 percent for half of an hour which overheated my Dell cpx
650Mhz laptop. The cooling fan came on, that's when I noticed the problem.

Expected Results:
1. The software should have a some kind of announcement saying that some script
on the page is running for an extended period of time and is using up computer
speed.
2. The software should have an option for disabling any kind of script running
on the page including ActiveX.

No crash wa observed.
