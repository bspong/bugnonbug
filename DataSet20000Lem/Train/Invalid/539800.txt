Some page (eg. eBay, Encyclopedia Dramatica, other wikis) make Firefox freeze for about 1 - 3 second duration at inconsistent interval during loading. Very few page are affected, and only page using Wiki software, with the occasional exception (Wikipedia doesn't have the issue, though it did when I first noticed the problem, though it seemed to resolve. Encyclopedia Dramatica though, doe have the problem and persists.) There is also the exception of eBay, that ha the issue, despite (to the best of my knowledge) not using wiki software. Wikis such a the Assassin's Creed wiki used to have the issue, but no longer do.

Encyclopedia Dramatica and eBay are the only persistently problematical site that I currently know of. ED seems to only freeze when transferring data from "ytimg.com". eBay doesn't seem to have a pattern to it.

When it freezes, it freeze the whole browser window, not just the tab. If I click the window (I'm using Windows 7) it whites-out and say it's not responding, though it's normally a too small timeframe for me to be able to get this to happen.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Go to Encyclopedia Dramatica (Can be offensive content)
2) Load a page. Front page work fine.



Actual Results:
The page will load, though it will freeze multiple time during loading.


Expected Results:
The page load normally, smoothly and without freezing the browser momentarily.

I'm using Firefox 3.5.7, with the following addons:

StumbleUpon toolbar
FireShot
Down Them All!
