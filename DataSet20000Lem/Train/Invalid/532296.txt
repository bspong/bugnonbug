FEBE appears to backup, but the progress window continues to indicate that the backup is not finished.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When backing up out of a User Account FEBE's progress bar continues a scan type action indicating that the backup is not complete. The directory where the backup ha been designated for the backup doe have backup a follows:
bookmarks{default}.html; 2,546 KB
bookmarks{default}.json; 2,453 KB
FEBE data{default}.fbu; 1 KB
prefs{default}.js; 13 KB

My preference are set up to create a backup file both when Firefox opens, and when it closes. I did this just to test the backup capability

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup FEBE to indicate whether a backup is desired when opening/closing Firefox
2. Open Firefox
3. Backup progress window opens, and a progress scanner seems to indicate that the backup is proceeding.
4. The scanner never indicates the backup is complete
5. As stated above in "Details", backup file are created in a folder which ha a the current date a it name.
6. I haven't tried to Restore any of these backup because I don't know if they are complete valid files.
Actual Results:
See "Steps to Reproduce"

Expected Results:
Backup progress window in the User Account should show completion instead of a dark strip in the progress bar that pass from left to right indicating that the backup ha not completed.

I'm not sure how to classify this issue. While there seem to be backup files, I'm not sure if they are usable since the progress window never show that the backup ha completed.

I haven't checked FEBE in my Administrative Account, since I never access the Internet from it.
