forward and back button crash analysis
we need some tool and work to analyze forward and back button crash out of the talkback data. this bug replaces an old problem in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56086 but it appears other problem still exist looking at quick searching of talkback comment data.


http://talkback-public.mozilla.org/talkback/fastfind.jsp?search=1&searchby=comments&match=contains&searchfor=back+button&vendor=MozillaOrg&product=Firefox15&platform=All&buildid=&sdate=&stime=&edate=&etime=&sortby=bbid
firefox 1.5 show 200+ crash with the comment "back button"

and 5 for "forward button"

any continuing work on bfcache or cache optimization, or history navigation in general would benefit from report that keep an eye on crash with these kind of comments.

It would be good to sort and categorize the stack trace by signature to providde a better grouping than time of crashed base sorting.

let file dependancy bug on anything that turn up out of analysis of the current data in talkback
