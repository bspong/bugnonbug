www.tvtv.de => "Tagesprogramm" (on the left) => If you then click on the name of
a show on the right, a popup window with the detail should be opened.
But Firefox show the small "popup blocked"-Icon in the status bar, even with
the popupblocker completely disabled!

The problem sometimes isn't there when I clear the browser cache, but le than
two minute later it appears again (long time before the cache is full).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.tvtv.de
2. click on "Tagesprogramm" on the left
3. click on the name of a show on the right

Actual Results:
The "popup blocked" icon appears in the status bar, even with disabled popup blocker

Expected Results:
open the popup window in a new browser or tab

The problem appears with Firefox 0.10., 0.10.1 and 1.0 RC1
