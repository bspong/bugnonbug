XHTML doe not properly process CCDATA and angle bracket error.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

When I put a CCDATA section inside a <td> element in XHTML, I expected the content of the CCDATA section to be treated a unparsed text and displayed a text. Instead, nothing is displayed.

Also, I would expect a "4 < 5" to be flagged a an XML error. Instead, both "4 lt; 5" and "4 < 5" are allowed.

I would expect that the XHTML would be required to pas a a valid XML document. If I change the extension of the file to .xml, Firefox doe treat it a XML and say it is invalid. Why doesn't Firefox require XHTML to be valid XML?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open attached document.
Actual Results:
CCDATA text is not displayed. '<' is not parsed a an error.



Expected Results:
Firefox should display CCDATA content a text (when the other XML violation are fixed).

Firefox should require XHTML document to be valid XML.
