I've seen several instance where image displayed a part of the Firefox UI are displayed wrong.
They look the same a when there's a problem with -moz-image-region
(the entire source image is displayed, rather than just the desired regoin).
It occurs both with the default theme and with other theme a well.

Several examples:

These are all happening with Fx 2.0.0.1 on Win98. I haven't seen this problem on XP.
