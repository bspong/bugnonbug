I like the FireFox browser but my internet connection is a lot slower than it is
with IE. I changed the setting in the connection tab but it's not any faster. I
have satellite signal and it's at least 3 time faster when I use IE. Why is
this and what can I do to make my connection faster with FireFox?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Connection is very slow compared to IE
