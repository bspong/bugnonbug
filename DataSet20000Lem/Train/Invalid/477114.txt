Double escaped URL when using keyword search on YouTube
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2a1pre) Gecko/20090205 Minefield/3.2a1pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have a bookmark "http://youtube.com/results?search_query=%s" associated with the keyword "y". If I type "y some search word" into the address bar, the generated URL is "http://youtube.com/results?search_query=some%20search%20word", which is correct of course. But another few millisecond later it change to ""http://youtube.com/results?search_query=some%2520search%2520word" (percent character are encoded again).

Reproducible: Always
