Lock icon missing from location bar at secure sites.
seen with Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007102904 Minefield/3.0a9pre and equivalent Windows build

STR:
1) visit a secure site - bugzilla.mozilla.org is fine

tested results:

no lock icon at the right end of the location bar, though the yellow notification is present and the status bar lock is present

expected results: in addition to the yellow notification and status bar lock, there should also be the lock icon at the right end of the location bar

this ha regressed in the past few days. I'll dig up the window shortly.
