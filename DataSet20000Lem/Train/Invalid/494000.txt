I must not be the first one to report this, but, sorry, I can't find the existing bug.

FF 3.0.10 on Kubuntu 9.04.

Search-as-you-type or normal Find don't seem to be able to search within text areas. This bug ha come and gone through the years, and i wa pretty bummed to see it crop up again. I think it came with 3.0.10, but maybe a few version before that. I think it may affect Windows version a well, but can't claim that with certainty.

2. Search for something in that text area
