I don't know if the fault lie with the code at signonsandiego.com (the web-site
for the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper) or with Mozilla/Firefox. But
whenever you open their home-page or any of their stories, the page continually
grab window-focus while loading.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the signonsandiego.com homepage
2. right-click on any story and select Open in New Window
3. when the new window opens, try to switch back to the original

Actual Results:
the new window will repeatedly grab 'focus', i.e., it will become the active
browser window.

Expected Results:
Focus should stay on the homepage (or any other page you've manually selected).
