I'm reading the SAP R/3 manual - quite boring stuff ;-)

The source code tell Firebird: <font FACE="Symbol">&#174;</font>. This mean an
left arrow, my charmap tell me. This make sense ;-)

Firebird instead show &#210; or &#226; instead (can't tell the difference, same
sign in my charmap). This sign is an (R). This make no sense ;-)

Bug or feature (if text too boring, put s.th. inside to attract the user's
attention)?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. looking at the text
2. looking at the source code
3. comparing source with charmap

Actual Results:
I notice that the source tell the browser to show a left arrow. Firebird show
the (R) sign instead.

Expected Results:
Firebird should show the correct char of the font.

Changing the theme doe not change the effect. As said, the charmap tell me
that the character requested by the source (the left arrow) ha the given code,
so my font file seems to be OK.
