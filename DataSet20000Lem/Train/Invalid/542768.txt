Firefox hang when dispatching event to thread on interval

We have an extension that doe processing on an interval and we're using a thread pool (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en/The_Thread_Manager) to make sure our processing doesn't affect performance. Since the upgrade to Firefox 3.6, presence of Firebug alongside our extension cause deadlocks.

To isolate and reproduce the problem, we wrote a very small extension that list in the browser error console, every 5 seconds, the file on your desktop with latest modification time. That extension is available here: http://dokdok.com/threadExt.xpi

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have an extension dispatch event to a thread in a setInterval (see submitted extension)
2. Make sure that Firefox profile also ha Firebug installed
2. Browse, open tabs, scroll, play around with window size
Actual Results:
Firefox hang indefinitely. gdb show a couple thread stuck at semaphore_wait_signal_trap and semaphore_timedwait_signal_trap. The browser UI is not responding anymore, the only thing to do is to force quit the Firefox process.

Expected Results:
... keep running :)

This wa reproduced on Firefox 3.6 with Firebug 1.4 and Firebug 1.5 on Mac OS X 10.6 and Ubuntu 9.10 (less frequent). It doesn't happen with FF3.5 and disabling the new TraceMonkey for chrome script (javascript.options.jit.chrome config option) doesn't solve the issue.

Removing Firebug eliminates the problem. Logged http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=2770 with discussion that lead to this bug request.
