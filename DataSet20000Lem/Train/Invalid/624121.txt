rtorrent 0.8.6, wtorrent installed using "svn co http://svn.wtorrent-project.org/wtorrent/trunk/wtorrent/" (109 revision). When I try to open localhost/wtorrent and enter my username and password my PC stop responding and only hardware reset helps. When I'm doing it with other browser (such a chromium or opera) all seems to be ok. I found some people on the internet who have similiar problems...
And that problem is sometimes happens on other pages. It happens about 1 or 2 time at 2-3 days. On other page It's hard to reproduce it, but on the wtorrent it happend 7 of 8 time today. When I'm not using firefox all seems to be ok.
Maybe there is a problem in my system, but I think that this is the problem in the firefox. I'm sorry in advance if it is wrong.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch firefox and go to the wtorrent page
2.try to login
3.
Actual Results:
kernel panic

Expected Results:
login into the wtorrent and manage my torrents.

Use flags:
www-client/firefox-3.6.13 USE="alsa custom-optimization dbus ipc -bindist -gnome -java -libnotify -startup-notification -system-sqlite -wifi" LINGUAS="ru"
Theme wa default. Here is addons installed:

-firebug
-flashblock
Unactive:
-FoxyProxy Standard
-JavaScript Deobfuscator

I tried rebuild it with custom-optimization off, but the result the same..
I'm not sure that I need to post this bug into the mozilla bugzilla instead of using gentoo bugzilla...
