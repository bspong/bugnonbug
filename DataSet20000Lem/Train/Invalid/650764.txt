When you right click on a webpage with a background image and choose "View Background Image" from the displayed context menu, the browser open the background image in the same tab, thereby obscuring the page. To return to the page, you have to click the Back button and then the page load again (the "Connecting...", "Waiting...", and other process repeat).

Most of the time, the user would want to stay on the page while wishing to have a glimpse of the full background image. It's desirable to open the background image in a new tab/window while keeping the original webpage open, or at least an option can be provided.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a webpage with a background image, say, Firefox's Twitter profile at "http://twitter.com/firefox".
2. Right click on the page and choose "View Background Image".
Actual Results:
The profile page is replaced with the image. You need to load the page again by clicking the Back button.

Expected Results:
The image should open in a new tab, some people prefer that.
