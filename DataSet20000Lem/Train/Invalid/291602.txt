After loading and installing Firefox update 1.0.3, the browser could not connect
to ANY site (ie: Google.com, microsoft.com, Netscape.com, etc.). I reinstalled
Firefox update 1.0.2 and found it to be functioning properly. Again attempted to
install Firefox update 1.0.3 with the same negative results. Rebooted the
computer resulting in no change with the problem. Reinstalled update 1.0.2 to
allow use of the Internet through Firefox.
No other problem with this browser.
