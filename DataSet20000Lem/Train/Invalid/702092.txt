Steps to reproduce:

Current Way of Version Numbering brings great confusion to the Mass. And someday we will end up with insane large number for a version number.



Expected results:

Since we are approaching Year 2012, and incidentally Firefox 12 a well, i think we should merge the two and starting having YY.MM a version number. Like the way currently Ubuntu use to ship.

Doing this would have no more public perception of Mozilla deliberately inflating version number trying to catch up Chrome. And user would "feel"and understand the train release schedule with a "timely" version number.
