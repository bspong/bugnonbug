Firefox 4 is handling PHP differently
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Since upgrading to FF4 both Firefox & Google Chrome (!?) are failing to handle PHP. The site is fine in Safari. Unfortunately the PHP site in question is on a private VPN. I'm hoping that it's a simple corruption issue of some local file or another that is somehow, seemingly, shared with Chrome. Specifically, on this PHP based site, inline address url are randomly not painting at all - that's random in that some do and most don't. Submit and commit button do not work at all. The site in question ha not undergone functional change in the better part of three year (i.e. apache,php,perl engines).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I will try to find an appropriate public PHP site that mimic this behaviour and update appropriately.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
The web page, that interacts with, update and control a central database for server application ha been rendered ineffectual and all but useless.

Expected Results:
I expect address link to paint and submit button to submit form data - no longer functioning on both counts.

Uhm.. not break PHP site? Perhaps a file list of what could possibly affect PHP sites? Not sure.
