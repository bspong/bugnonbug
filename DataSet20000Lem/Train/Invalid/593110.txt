Greasemonkey is an addon for creating and using script within the facebook community. On particular script that I use is called Mass Accept, which will accept all my application gift in one click. Restaurant City, Frontierville, My Vineyard, Social City, Hotel City all do not show the gift that I accepted by using this add-on. I am not familiar with using script nor do I have any knowledge of creating and/or maintaining an addon for Firefox. I do hope there is a simple solution so I do not have to accept 50+ requests, one at a time.

Thank you for your time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Facebook.com and login to your account.
2. Make sure Greasemonkey is installed and active.
3. Scroll down to 'Requests' and click 'See All'
4. Greasemonkey will create two button 'Check All' and 'Mass Accept'
5. Click 'Check All' then click 'Mass Accept'

Actual Results:
The gift or gift that were accepted, do not appear in the gift box or inventory of the appropriate applications.

Expected Results:
The accepted request that were accepted with the Greasemonkey addon and the Mass Accept script, should accept and deliver all request to the appropriate application.
