I log into webmail at nwlink.com. There is no mail to be seen in FF 2.0.0.4 or .5. If I log into webmail with NS 9.0b1, the mail can be seen. Tech Support at nwlink.com cannot duplicate this malfunction. I have cleared private data without effect. I have FF installed on two machines, one running W98SE and both have this same problem
