This bug is different than other bug report regarding "connection refused"
because those bug report are a general configuration issue where NO site are
reachable.
In general, I have ZERO configuration issues. To reproduce this bug and
understand it, it help to know that the site in question ha a very slow upload
link to the internet so it load VERY slowly. This is true regardless of your
own internet connection (broadband or dialup). However the site is functional.
If you try to surf to site in IE, youll find that IE patiently wait for it to
load and in few minute (apx 5 minutes) everything is present. With firefox
after about 25 second one get the error dialog box "The connection wa refused
when attempting to contact www.davealex.dnsalias.com" To recap: with this bug,
IE yield 100% of this slowloading site, firefox yield zero percent of it. The
main unusual item here is the site is a functional, but because of hardware, slow.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. using firefox go to www.davealex.dnsalias.com
2. In apx 25 second you'll get error dialog box mentioned.
3. Using IE go to same site. It take a few minute but it WILL load.

Actual Results:
get error dialog box
"The connection wa refused when attempting to contact www.davealex.dnsalias.com"

Expected Results:
wait for site to load and display it.
