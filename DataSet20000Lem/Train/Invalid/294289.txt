sddll.dll error. Firefox 1.0.3 and 4., especially when I download something new.
I solved the first time by uninstalling 3 and installing 4. Had to do a system
restore for 3. 4 worked for awhile until I downloaded quicktime 6.5. Do not have
the problem with Firefox 1.0. Only have the problem when trying to update to a new
firefox. Will probably need a 5 to fix the problem. Also, somehow, lost firefox
1.0 bookmarks. Can't import to 4 any longer. Reinstalled 1.0, the original
bookmark are gone. I can't locate them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.complete shutdown... even cold... including modem and pwr disconnect.
2.restart... F1, because I have an imminent harddrive failure (after 3yrs of
imminent useage... have downloaded PowerMax, finally, to check harddrive.)
password protect (which act odd, to me)
3. use quick launch, on or offline, sddll.dll error.
4. use many and various spyware, etc programs. have free zonealarm and avg.

Actual Results:
Installing 3 (eventually and ultimately deleting) cannot pull up firefox.
4 the same problem, but have not deleted, but ininstalled and reinstalled
several times.

Expected Results:
worked!

There may be a bug or spy in your program and/or system. I am NOT a computer
geek, but I am, also, not stupid. Firefox 1.0 work correctly a far a I can
tell. I
have an old C++ compiler, but really don't have time to install or learn this
stuff at the moment. If interested, speak to me. I surf, now infrequently, like
most. Bush Hog is incompatible with Firefox. There are a few more, supposedly,
legitimate site like Bush Hog, that are incompatible with Firefox. What a shame!
