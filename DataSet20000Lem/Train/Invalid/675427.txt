Steps to reproduce:

Having two tabs, being on the first tab, I open a new tab by link, a new tab is created to the right. Now there are three tabs, the new tab in the middle. I then activate the new tab and then close it.


Actual results:

The tab go to the one on the right.


Expected results:

It would make more sense to go to the tab on left, the one that created the closing tab initially.
