I used to block cockies and image from different website like google.
suddenly when I visited google image got loaded and cockies accepted!

I checked out the exception list and wa surprised that both, the coockie exeption list and the image exception list were empty!


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to preferences, and click the "Exception" button for "load images"
2. add google.com
3. visit google.com
4. close browser, restart browser
5. visit google.com again to see if image are still blocked



I wa able to reproduce this once,
but now it seems to work...

look like some website found a way to make FF erase your block lists...
