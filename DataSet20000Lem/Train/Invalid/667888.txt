Tabs not switching. Mac + FF5
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_7; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.21.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.5 Safari/533.21.1

Steps to reproduce:

Open more than one tab in the browser.


Actual results:

The most recently opened tab display within the window. Switching tab change the focus of the tab (meaning FF seems to register the change), but the content of the window itself doe not change. Closing the last-opened tab reveals the next-to-last opened tab. Switching the order of the tab doe not appear to change the situation.


Expected results:

The tab should have resulted in different content appearing in the browser window.
