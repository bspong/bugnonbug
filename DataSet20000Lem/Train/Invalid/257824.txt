When opening many web pages, an error dialog appears with the message "Could not
create the control {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}. Check that it ha
been installed on your computer abd that thispage correctly reference it."

I can click it away (but you get many of them, so it's pretty tedious) so it's
more of an annoyance. I only get this on my laptop - an install on a desktop
(also running WinXP) doe not experience this problem.

1. Open a web page e.g. www.tgw.com

Actual Results:
