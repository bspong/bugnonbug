follow the link to reproduce this bug. All file are include in bug.rar in the same web location.

It's apparently very specific at Event handler + XHR execution.

I don't know from where that comes.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
script error and XMLHttpRequest failed.


if only you delete the line 51 of core.js :
new Event.observe...

and replace in bug.php the line 24 :
<form name="e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5" method="post" >
by :
<form name="e4da3b7fbbce2345d7772b0674a318d5" method="post" onSubmit="return Form.ajaxsend(this);">
that is fully functional now.
