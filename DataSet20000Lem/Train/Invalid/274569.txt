Firefox crashed on toshiba.de
Hi,

I hope I don't post a know bug.

I had an error when surfing on toshiba.de and I can reproduce the error on two
different PCs.

I made the following step

1. deactivate Cookies
2. open www.toshiba.de
3. Click on "Computer Systeme"
4. Click some time on "Neuer Versuch"

Firefox 1.0 crash on step 3. or after 4.

Thx

PS: Sorry for the bad english :)
