Firefox incorrectly demonstrates 1.x behaviour when a tab is closed

When you open a new tab, then close it, Firefox reverts to the tab that wa in focus when you open it. However (pay attention now :) ), if you browse other tab while that opened tab is still open, select the opened tab from a tab OTHER than the tab you opened it from, and close it, Firefox selects the tab to the left, the old behaviour. It isn't clear now but it will be once you read how to reproduce it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open at least 3 tabs. Make sure the 1st tab is selected.
2. Now open a 4th. Select that 4th tab.
3. Close it. Firefox 2 go back to the 1st tab. Good.
4. Open a 4th tab again from the 1st tab.
5. This time, select the 2nd tab, then focus the 4th tab again.
6. Close the 4th tab. Firefox focus the 3rd (?!!) tab.


Actual Results:
Obviously it reverted back to it original behaviour, opening the tab to the left.

Expected Results:
Firefox 2 should focus on the 2nd tab, since that wa the tab last in focus before the 4th tab got closed.

Its a mouthful, I know. :) I'm not 100% sure but I think the expected result is the way Opera behaves. IMO, this is how Firefox 2 should behave.
