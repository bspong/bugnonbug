Rendering issue. z-index order wrong on FF Mac

On OSX Firefox incorrectly render the menu. The sub menu (to the left of the main body text) is rendered above the dropdown menu that appears when the mouse is hovered over the Products menu item on the main menu. This only happens when using Firefox on OSX.

Originally the sub menu had no z-index defined - only the dropdown menu did. I have since added positioning and a z-index.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the above URL
2. Roll mouse over Products item on main menu
3. Observe the submenu to the left on the body text being rendered above the dropdown menu.

Actual Results:
Submenu rendered over the dropdown

Expected Results:
Submenu should render below the dropdown

As far a I can tell this is a browser bug a FF on Windows 7 work correctly a do other major browsers*

*Chrome (any webkit?) had a strange rendering issue where the submenu wa draw below the left-hand image before I added the z-index.
