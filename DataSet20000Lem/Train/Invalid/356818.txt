Hi,

after switching from FF 1.5.0.6 to FF 2.0rc2 on my laptop I noticed that the text in page body is very small. I could enlarge it with Ctrl-+, but then the form field got huge and overall this is not a proper thing to do.
I couldn't find the "what's the length of this line" option in preferences.
Also, setting browser.display.screen_resolution didn't seem to affect the rendering.
Setting minimum font size to high value hurted the layout of most sites.

I figured that my screen resolution (xdpyinfo) wa set to 75x75 and KDE/GTK font size adjusted accordingly (thus the GUI of Firefox wa OK), while the real resolution of the screen (as measured with a ruler) is 92dpi.

Starting X with -dpi 92 option got me the right font size in Firefox, but the rest of the desktop wa insanely huge. I got around it by re-adjusting the size in KDE/GTK and now everything seems to work right.

But Firefox should have a way to change the resolution by the user, since not everyone know how or is able to edit platform-dependent driver settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a setup where e.g. xdpyinfo report 75x75 and a physical resolution is 96 DPI
2.Have the whole desktop configured to display right
3.Install Firefox 2.0 and see how the text is unreadable

Actual Results:
Body text is too small (would be too large if xdpyinfo reported something higher than the real value)

Expected Results:
A way to adjust to environment setting or change the resolution a in Firefox 1.5.x
