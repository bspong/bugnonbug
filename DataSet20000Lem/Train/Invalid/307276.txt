User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050830 Firefox/1.0+

At 1280x1024 and 96 dots-per-inch the truetype font look horrible. Running
slackware current.

Since it is extremely difficult to describe the incorrect look of the fotns I
have attached a screenshot:

This affect only the Linux version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Browse a forum using the above font (see screenshot). At random interval the
font rendering will screw up and get all out of wack, for lack of a better term.


Expected Results:
The font should render correctly.
