Opening the HUD with Inspector open cause Style Panel to move
Opening the HUD while the Inspector is open cause the Style panel to move down level with the bottom of the HUD Console. Style panel is currently attached to <browser> top and this move it.

This problem should go away when the title bar patch are in (bug 552982) and the Inspector make use of them.
