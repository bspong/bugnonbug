When next page loading is very slow, it's hard to know whether it's still loading or not
When I click some link or bookmarks, the new page loading may sometimes very slow. Then, I try to check whether the new page is still loading or whether I failed to click or I wa something wrong.

However, it's hard to know in current UI.

1. The progress bar under location bar is very thin and doesn't have enough contrast (bug 597592). But even if it's fixed, when the progress is near 0%, it's not clear whether I'm seeing the progress bar or not.
2. Only the title of tab is changed a "Loading...", but it's not clear because I need to read the text and need to *understand* the content.
3. Favicon on tab still remains the old page's. It's not changed to an active indicator.
4. The status bar is gone, and there are no feedback of current network state such a "waiting response from www.example.com...".

I think that the active indicator in tab should be back. That is very clear interface for load_ing_ because it's animation icon and changed from a symbol of the old web page.
