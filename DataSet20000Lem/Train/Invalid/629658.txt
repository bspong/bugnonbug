Unable to perform XMLHttpRequest CORS request with credentials: NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI

Trying to perform a CORS request with XMLHttpRequest Level 2 fails no matter what I try. I am providing the username and password a parameter to the open() method of the XMLHttpRequest object assuming that this cause the Authorization HTTP header to be set.

I am setting the withCredentials property of the XMLHttpRequest object to true to signify the usage of credential via CORS requests.

However, this only yield an obscure NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI error which is related to internal redirects a I can take from the source. A real HTTP request is never performed.

Not providing the username and password via the open() method result in Firefox prompting for these with an authorization dialog.

Manually generating the Authorization HTTP header and passing it via the setRequestHeader() method only yield an unknown error (the onerror handler of the XMLHttpRequest object is invoked) which is impossible to identify due to it being a mere ProgressEvent error.

See the test case attached to this report to verify the issue and let me know what I have to do to make this work if there is anything I can do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Perform a XMLHttpRequest CORS request with credential provided and the withCredentials property enabled
Actual Results:
The request is aborted with a NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI error.

Expected Results:
The request is performed thanks to the provided credential and the response returned.
