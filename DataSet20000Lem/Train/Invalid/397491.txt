When opening a new tab using appl-T or with a link, the addition of a second tab cause the screen to go blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window and load a page.
2. Open another tab in that window.
3.
Actual Results:
What *appears* to be happening is that the tab are being squished over to the left side of the tab bar, since I do get the "change tab" arrow there, and can pull up a listing of the tab I have open. It doe not seem to matter which webpage I have open.

Expected Results:
I wa expecting normal tab behavior -- i.e., that it would open the tab bar at the top of the screen and then display all my tab with their contents.

Selecting a different tab doe not cause it to display. Dragging the horizontal scroll bar doe not change the width of the screen. I had this problem with both this version and the last one, although not the one before that.
