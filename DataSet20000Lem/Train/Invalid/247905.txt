displayed instead of the parsed HTML-Content. Additionally, some content may be
parsed. The Problem appears frequently while browsing through the menu in the
left frame; but it is not side-specific!

1. browse to the named URL
2. browse through the menu in the left frame
3. normally, after about 5 click the problem should have appeared

Actual Results:
HTML-Sourcecode is displayed

Expected Results:
parse HTML-Content
