failing to load correctly localhost

I installed apache on my pc.

I entered the url "localhost/index.php" before installing php, and it gave me
error, asking me what I wanted to do with that php file.

After installing php, the same errore continued, inexpectedly. I.e.: the browser
kept asking me whether to save or open the file.

I could solve it only clearing the browser cache: after that, the php page wa
interpreted correctly.

Reproducible: Always
