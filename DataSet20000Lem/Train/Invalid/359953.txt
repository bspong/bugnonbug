Contradictory wording for "Mouse/Tab Focus" option

Under Tools => Options => Tabbed Browsing => Tab Focus => Mouse/Tab Focus, there are the following two options:

( ) Select new tab created by link
( ) Do not select newly created tab

The second one is espectially mysteriously worded, but more significantly, it blatantly contradicts (expresses the opposite of) the option right above it. If both option are checked, what happens to new tab created by links? The first option would say "select it", the second say "don't select it".

I would suggest a better wording, but I couldn't figure out what the option actually do, so I can't be of help.

Reproducible: Always
