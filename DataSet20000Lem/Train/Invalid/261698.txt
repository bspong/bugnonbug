I am developing a site that ha custom stlyes for link using the a:link,
a:hover and a:visted styles. I am using link that are nested several <DIV>
tag deep. One particular set of link are located at the top and are position
using abolute positioning. The other set of link are at tbe bottom of the
page. When I mouse over the bottom links, they seem to work fine. When I mouse
over he top links, the targeting appears off, only the top few pixel of the
text seems to pick up the over event. If I remove the link at the end of the
page, the top link work fine.

I tested this page in several other browser (IE 6, Netscape and Opera) and they
do not have a problem which lead me to believe it wa a bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit the page in the link and you will see what I am talking about. The
link at the top display strange mouseover behavior.




I'm marking this a a major feature that is broken because so many people use
CSS nowadays and customize their link that I think this would be a major problem.
