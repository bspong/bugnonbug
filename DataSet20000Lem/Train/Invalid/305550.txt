Firefox wrongly try to use quicktime to play .wav file. It should be using
'soundrec' (as reported under Tools->Options->Download). It additionally report
that quicktime plugin is missing & hence it cannot play the sound. Notably,
quicktime 6.5.2 is installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?sourceid=Mozilla-search&va=wave
2. Click on the sound icon in red (which is a javascript
javascript:popWin('/cgi-bin/audio.pl?wave0001.wav=wave') ).
3. A new window pop up which, in IE, would result in the pronunciation of wave
using the app registered to handle .wav files.
Actual Results:
In Firefox, the new window doe not play the wav sound. It instead report that
quicktime is required to play the file and that it's a missing plug-in.
Curiously, quicktime is installed. Moreover, the registered app for .wav file
is 'soundrec' in Firefox. So, I get no sound.

Expected Results:
A human voice saying 'wave' should have been heard.

This is reproducible from at least 3 other firefox installations, all 3 on
Windows XP.
