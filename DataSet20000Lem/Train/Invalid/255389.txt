An little idea :

One single bar for text entry and several icon at the right of this bar (which
ha place and the size of the present address bar) for the specific behavior
(search google, google news, dmoz, dict.org, ... customizable of course)
And the default behavior (when enter) would be go to the specified URL...

An image, if my english is too bad : http://users.skynet.be/fa594421/projetAB.jpg

adventages :

+acess in one clic (in place of two) at customizable service

+a wider text input thus a better view on the querry (for more complex search,
phrase traduction, etc.)

+maybe more intuitive (I have done test on dummy subjects, and they dont see
that they must enter the text and then clic on the little icon and then choose
the search engine)
