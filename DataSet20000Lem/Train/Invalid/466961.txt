VMWare Infrastructure is a software that allows the user to remotely connect to virtual machine (http://www.vmware.com).

Having installed it, the logon credential next to the Login Name and Password field do not seem to be recognized. The toolbar is not displayed the first time either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install VMWare Server.
2. Go to the logon which is commonly https://<computer name>:8333/ui/# or
http://<computer name>:8222/ui/#
3.Update user name and password to logon.

These are usually the OS logon credential on the hosting <computer name>. In my case I use the Administrator logon.
Actual Results:
Password manager doe not prompt to remember password. Password is not automatically retrieved upon subsequent logons.

Expected Results:
Password manager prompt for password a other websites.
