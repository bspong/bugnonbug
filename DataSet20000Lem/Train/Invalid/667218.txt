When pressing the right mouse button the context menu appears immediately rather than when the mouse button is released, which is the expected behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Press and hold right mouse button
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Context menu appears

Expected Results:
Context menu should not appear

Discovered this when I installed the Snap Links Plus extension, but it also occurs on an entirely new profile with no extension or plugins added. It adversely affect the functioning of the extension.

Discussion of problem on Snap Links forum, where dev suggested I raise this bug, can be found here: http://snaplinks.mozdev.org/drupal/forum/Snap-Links-109-disabling-rightclick-context-menu-FireFox-4
