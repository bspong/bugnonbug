Some site's that I go to regulary I get a 404 error "Firefox cannot find page". These site include, but are not limited to Facebook, Digg, and my school e-mail account. There is no pattern that I can see. I click to refresh and then it almost always reloads the page without the 404 error. I checked my internet but i wa always connected.
