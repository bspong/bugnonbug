This occurs when saving an image using "Save Image as..." from the context menu. The save dialog pop up, but the context menu stay open and is on the top most layer. The real problem occurs when the save dialog is behind the context menu, because the user can't see the location, save name, etc. The only work around is to move the save dialog from behind the context menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save an image using the right click context menu.
2. Place the save popup behind the context menu that didn't go away.
3.

Actual Results:
The save dialog is covered up by the context menu.

Expected Results:
Context menu should go away after selecting an option or at the very least making the save dialog on top of the context menu.
