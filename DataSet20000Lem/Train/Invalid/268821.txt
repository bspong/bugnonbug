Can not browse with keyboard inside an XML frame

On our intranet there is a HTML page with two frames. The left one is HTML (
with javascript , a menu ) , the right one is XML ( with XSL ). I can not select
a link in the XML frame with the TAB key. When I get to the end of the left
frame, the focus go to the URL bar ( like ctrl-L ). Even if I select a link in
the XML frame with the mouse, pressing TAB immediatelly leaf the XML frame and
doe not go back.

Strangelly, while writing this bug ( I use multiple tab ) I went to the
problematic page and for a moment I had the focus in the XML frame and could
move around with the TAB key. But when I left the XML frame, I could not get
back any more ( with the TAB key, I could with the mouse of course ).

Sometimes when changing tab with ctrl-TAB, the TAB key go thru the link on
the previously visible page ( on the other tab ) and not on the currently
visible one...
