Firefox 4 doe not run xpi Plugins
When I install the o2c player plugin (windows only) from www.o2c.de (just visit that url and allow installation), firefox creates a o2cplayer@eleco.com.xpi file in my profile directory, but doe not load the plugin (about:plugins doe not list it). If I manually unzip the xpi in that directory, everything work fine.

The same xpi work on Firefox 3.6.x just fine. The plugin also work fine on 4.0 after manual extraction.
