[Mac] Default favicon and close button look similar and make tab look cluttered
Tabs on Mac look pretty horrible in the bon echo builds. There are three issue that leap out at me.

1. with the addition of the tab close button, the tab now ha two very similar icon when loading an empty page or a page without a favicon. The grayed out close button and the default globe favicon give the tab a cluttered appearance and confusing target for selecting/closing.

2. the blue border for selected tab often doesn't match the actual tab dimension and look very bad.

3. with the new tab scrolling behavior, a tab can be cut off by the scroll button. Tabs should not be truncated like this. We should either show the whole tab, or move it out of view and resize up the remaining tabs.

Screenshots coming.
