Right before the EMBED .mp3 stop firefox crashes.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Near the end of the mp3 the sound "skips" like a record playing the last note
over and over again. The browser crash and the noise stops. Internet
explorer seems to handle it so I do not believe it to be a problem with my sound
hardware.
