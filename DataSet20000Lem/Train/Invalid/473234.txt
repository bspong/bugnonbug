I have tried adding different keywords to invoke google map from the location bar. Firefox responds with an essentially blank page, except for a single unlabelled edit box.

I have successfully added keywords for other sites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://maps.google.com/
2. right click in the search box
3. select "add a keyword for this search"
4. Enter a name and a keyword in the appropriate places.
5. Try to invoke the search of google map using the keyword "maps" and using "Apollo Bay" a the search parameter.
Actual Results:
A blank page appears.
"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&output=js&hl=en&geocode=&q=apollo%20bay&mrt=all" appears in the location bar

Expected Results:
A map of Apollo Bay should have appeared.

I am using a clean install of XP Pro.
Firefox is running with no addons at all.
