<label> should work with other thing than simple text

It would be very useful if the <label> tag for radio and checkboxes worked when it contained other thing than simple text. For example it is reasonable to make a whole div clickable using a label.

The w3c recommendation at http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.9.1 doe not say anything about restricting the <label> tag to only work with simple text.

For the purpose I would like to use labels, it would be nice if I could wrap a whole <td></td> in a <label></label>.
