For two month freecorder toolbar worked perfectly, letting me record any audio source and capture it. About 10 day ago I tried to start the recorder and it failed. I have uninstalled, re-downloaded, reinstalled and even installed the newest version. It still fails when I try to activate it on the freecorder toolbar on Firefox. I have written to Applian a well. I am kind of dumb a to where to turn, but I really want to get this addon working.
Thanks for your assistance.
