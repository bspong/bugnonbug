Running Ubuntu 8.04 and new Firefox update were recently pushed out. Suddenly Firefox is crashing quite regularly and corrupting the profile; icon don't show in the toolbars; extension won't install/update/run.

Create new profile each time. Have tried without any extension and Firefox crashed when I tried to open a regular XUL file; profile wa corrupted.
