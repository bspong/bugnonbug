As per bug 628807, we currently have a delay that prevents split menu entry from closing immediately when the cursor exit the menu.

Can we make the delay also happen when mousing between split menu entry and
regular menu entries?

For example, hover over Options and wait for the submenu to appear. Then
quickly mouse over to addons and then back over to Options before the submenu
disappears. You'll see that even though there's a delay before the Options
submenu closes, you can't make it stay open. The delay in this case is rendered
useless and give user the false impression that they have a short period of
time to return to the submenu after accidentally mousing over something else.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mouse over Options split-menu and wait for submenu to appear
2. Mouse over to addons and then quickly back over to Options before the submenu disappears.
3. Note that even though your mouse is back on Options, you can't make the submenu stay open.
Actual Results:
Options menu disappears even though mouse is back on the split menu entry

Expected Results:
Options menu stay open if mouse is back on split-menu before menu delay expires.
