Well in the part on the right I have the title and a list.

It should be
+----+ Documentation
| | *Quick start


but the dot is too close the grey bar on the left, and it is on the left of the title like:

+----+ Documentation
| |*Quick start

Cheating with the padding for list item, I manage to get the list item far the bar on the left. Try adding

.rtext ul{
padding-left:130px;
}

in the CSS and vary the padding amount. The padding is calculate from left margin of page and not from the right margin of the bar.
