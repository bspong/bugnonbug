When I receive email from HOTMAIL.COM I have always clicked on the URL in the email to see the relevant document. This no longer works.

Now, I have to use "Open Link in new window" instead of just clicking on the URL a in the past.

This bug is in 3.6.3 and 3.6.4

Please fix by tomorrow morning. Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open HOTMAIL.COM
2.Click on an email in the INBOX
3.Click on the BLUE URL in the email body.
This should take you to the referenced document. It doe not.
I have to use "Open Link in new window"
