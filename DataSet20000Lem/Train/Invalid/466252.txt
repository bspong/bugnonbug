Screenshot of dialog

Seen while running Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081121 Minefield/3.1b2pre

STR:

1. Tools | Clear Recent History
2. Uncheck "Visited Pages"

Expected: The Downlist List item would now be selectable
Actual: The item is greyed out and not selectable

Using the same build on 10.5.x, if I perform the same step I get an active dialog that I can check or uncheck.
