add <title> attribute to search engine icon in searchbar
I made a copy of a.o. Google search to search via the dutch server
(www.google.nl), which give preference to dutch result above english.
The icon doe not leave much room to play with (16x16p) so the next best thing
is to change

<search
name="Google NL"

in my googleNL.src

it would be very usefull if the icon would get a <title> attribute so that I can
instantly see which google engine I am using if i hoover over it.

When you use e.g. babelfish for translation between various lingo there is
even more need for some sort of (visual) discrimination.
