I restarted my Vista machine because of an update, and Adobe Acrobat got hung up trying to close on a dialog, so Vista provided the "do you want to restart right now or wait?" message.

I had already clicked the dialog so Vista got the idea and finally restarted.

After booting up I fired up firefox, it said that there wa an update to NoScript, installed perfectly fine, done.

However, it appears that the session info for the last time I wa running ha been lost (apart from what I have in my history).

Sorry for not being able to help with more information but I wouldn't know where in the sourcebase to start...

Reproducible: Didn't try
