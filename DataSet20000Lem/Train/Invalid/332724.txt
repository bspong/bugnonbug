a you know, in normal mode, this current buttons_no.1_ are big and customizable buttons_no.2_ are small ; but when I click on the "use small buttons" in "Customize toolbar" window , change all the button to the small and uncheck it change back them to big _not to default mode_ , and set to default button doesnt correct it ; it seems im going to unsitall & install again FireFox to solve this problem ;
I think , this is a bug ;
-=-=-=-
Im usin FF v1.5.0.2
& extensions: FlashGot 0.5.9.993 & Tab Mix Plus 0.3.0.5
& Theme : Default
& no plugins
&
WIN XP-NT 5.1 build 2600 without SP
HDD~160
RAM~512 SD
CPU~633 mhz
-=-=-=-=-
other prob is :
FF v1.5.0.2 kill more memory resource that prev. version ( such a v1.07) ; it take 10-15 sec.s to run ;

it go to crash mode when it opening a web-page in a tab , and I change to other tab ;
I think it another bug , that it not compatible with all system (low CPU's);

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
the size of button change _&_ memory resource killing
