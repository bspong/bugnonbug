When attempting to open a .tif file *within* the browser, it usually crash
immedately after the QuickTime plugin fire up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open above image using QT plugin within browser
2. Observe Crash


Actual Results:
Firefox crash and take all the open tab with it.

Expected Results:
Firefox shouldn't crash, even if the image is not correctly displayed (and there
appears to be other bug related to how tiff image are displayed).

Work-around: save tiff document to disk, or use a different tiff viewer than QT.


Might be critical, but not sure if it is a QuickTime or Mozilla bug, and doesn't
appear to happen to every tiff document in existance.

Searching talkback for quicktimeimage.qtx return 17 crash and searching
"tiff" return 25 crash (some overlap between the two searches). This bug
seems to have appeared and disappeared long ago, per Bug 102587, which claim
the latest Quicktime would fix it. I'm running the latest. Might be related to
Bug 187421, but doesn't look identical. I couldn't find any other bug on this
crash either.
