I installed the most recent version of callingID toolbar (1.6.0.67) for win xp, it used to work with firefox 2.x, but in version 3 it doesn't look. It appears a enabled in the add-on list, and it name is available in the view->tools bar menu, but is not visible in Firefox 3. However it is visible in IE 7. I have already done what the vendor said for fixing it but didn't work. Maybe it is a bug in firefox 3.-

Extensions installed:
