While browsing digg.com SkipScreen extension began showing some potentially dangerous behaviour. The extension triggered an alert('Howdy'); combined with a pop-in requesting feedback. Annoying a this was, the behaviour of the alert('howdy') wa the most concerning. It reported the alert in the title a being ->from<- the site I wa currently on instead of from the extension.

Reproducible: Always

2. Navigate through a paged archive (ie: digg.com) until it trigger alert('howdy')
3. Observe title of dialog box
Actual Results:
site title appears
