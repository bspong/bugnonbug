While Internet Explorer and Opera can show the page properly, Firefox can't find address of images; That is, it recognizes address as:
http://www.minigolf-flensburg.de/images%5Clogo.gif
rather than:
http://www.minigolf-flensburg.de/images/logo.gif
So that I cannot see image in this page in Firefox.
