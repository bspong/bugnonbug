In the latest bild of minefield,it give you 44 window of request for password,and it block firefox.Can't change tab,can't chose a menu item,can't shutdown.

in my curent vertion of firefox 2.0.0.8 (ubuntu gutsy).Firefox displayes a request for password for the ftp,by clicking either OK or CANCEL,the password window disapears and is replased by a window that say

"530 sorry,the maximum number of clients(6) from your host are alredy connected"

(i didn't try regularly to see if this happens only when the limit is passed).When you click OK it give you again the password window,by clicking OK or cancel,it sends you back again the "limits of connections" window,and then you start over and over. ...
In all this time you cant click anything else then the above mensioned windows,you can't even shutdown firefox,or go to an other tab.I didn't test yet to see if everything work fine if the limit of connection is not past.
