"Bookmark This Page" and "Show All Bookmarks" menu are interchanged. I usually bookmark a page by pressing "Alt + B" and then "down arrow + Enter". This I wa using from a long long time. Now that the "Show All Bookmarks" became the first item, I can't do this anymore. Is there a reason for this interchange? Can you please change them back to the original place?


Reproducible: Always
