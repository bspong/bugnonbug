cs border and padding FOR A LINK doesn't work a class but work a inline style

I have this menu where the bottom border should change when mouse over, and when a class is applied,

#pageLinks a{
text-decoration:none;
color:#444444;
padding:9px 0 9px 0;
}

#pageLinks a:hover, .selectedPage{
font-weight:bold;
color:#000000;
padding:9px 0 5px 0;
border-bottom:4px solid #000000;
}

when mouse over it works, and when selectedPage class is applied it doesn't change THE BORDERS (it doe change the color and font-weight)

when I tried applying the style inline (<a href="..." style="...">) the border and padding did work...

I hope I wa helpful and this bug wa not yet reported...
