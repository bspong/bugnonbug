Mozilla Firefox yield "Document contains no data" on EVERY PAGE
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/125.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/125.9

Right when I start up, I get "document contains no data" for the start page, and for any page I try to
view. I think it may have something to do with the RealPlayer plugin, but deleting it from ~/Library/
Internet Plug-Ins/ didn't seem to make a difference.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox.
2.Go to any website.
3.
Actual Results:
"Document contains no data" popup

Expected Results:
Displayed the page.
