Clicking on Sponsored Links on result page after Google search result in Page Load Error

Do a search on Google, i.e. Chevy, Quicken, etc. On the result page the "Sponsored Links" are invalid. Clicking on them generate page load error with message "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.googleadservices.com." or "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at ad.doubleclick.net." This would only occur on the Sponsored Links and not on all of them, but usually the top Sponsored links.
The correct page would load if I manually type in the web address.
Seems to be a new issue with latest version 3.05

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Search any item i.e. Chevy, Quicken, etc on G serach
2.Click on a few Sponsored Links, usually the top Sponsored result
3.Will result in page load error every time
Actual Results:
Failure to connect with message "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at ad.doubleclick.net." or "Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at www.googleadservices.com." depending on the Sponsored link.

Expected Results:
The Sponsored Link should display the linked page i.e. Chevy.com or Intuit.com.



Typing in the link address manually will display the correct page.
Non sponsored link work just fine

I have uninstalled and reinstall 3.05 with no improvement. No problem with previous version.
