Yesterday, for no apparent reason, my Firefox stopped working. The icon no longer open the program and when I click on a link that should open in the default window I get an error that says: Windows cannot find " ". Make sure you type the name correctly and try again. I haven't changed anything. I restarted my computer, cleared the history and the cookies, ran a defrag and scandisk and still the program won't open. I don't want to lose all of my speeddial address or all of my bookmarks. What should I do?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on the icon
2.nothing happens
3.
Actual Results:
Program won't open. The mouse pointer hourglass appears for le than two second and then is gone.

Expected Results:
Program should have opened.

Please help! I miss my program!
