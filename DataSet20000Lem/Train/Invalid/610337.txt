Created attachment 488829
test page

Build ID:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101103 Firefox/4.0b8pre

Steps:
1. Load http://mozilla.org in an iframe (try with attached test page)
2. Open Console and reload the page
3. Open a new tab and load http://mozilla.org
4. Open console here and inspect the network events, warning

Behavior:
When load in an iframe, console go echo same warning repeatedly, like in some kind of infinite cycle. After step 4 you can confirm that these warning do not appear if http://mozilla.org is loaded normally.

Not sure what cause this, what is certain is that it didn't happen before while testing with the same page.

The same thing happens with http://www.universityhealth.org/body.cfm?id=38115, what is different are the warnings, and it can't be always reproduced.
