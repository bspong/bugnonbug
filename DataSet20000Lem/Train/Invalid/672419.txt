HTML5 Media Player doe not always activate in FF 5.01
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

Using FF 5.01 YouTube Videos won't "fullscreen" instead they "full-Window" (enlarge to the size of the Browser's Window).

1. Visit http://www.YouTube.com/ .
2. Choose a Video and play it.
3. Click on the Flash Player's Toolbar's extreme right end (the enlarge to full screen Button).



Actual results:

The Video enlarges to the size of the Browser's Window instead of the size of the Desktop (the Monitor's full resolution).

Hitting the [ESC] key work and return to standard play.


Expected results:

The Video should hide the Browser (and anything else on the Desktop) when in fullscreen mode.

Note: As of an hour ago the 'YouTube Video Fullscreen' worked correctly on Nightly and Aurora.
