Since installing 3.0b5 yesterday, my previously very stable machine now repeatedly report that "Event ID: 4101: Display driver atikmdag stopped responding and ha successfully recovered". The screen go blank for a few second and then come back, although the machine ha completely frozen once and had to be hard booted.

The url being accessed doesn't appear to be relevant.

The atikmdag.sys file itself doesn't carry a file version. It's dated 6/27/2007.
The display adapter is an ATI VisionTek Radeon X1300 with driver set 8.391.0.0
This is a Vista machine without SP1.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Sorry - there do not appear to be any fixed step to reproduce. I just need to be using Firefox for a few minute before it start happening.
