Please support the horizontal scrolling with the Mighty Mouse properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse a long web page (which doe not! need horizontal scrolling)
2. Scroll vertical with the Mighty Mouse

Actual Results:
The Mighty Mouse ha a ball. If you scroll vertically but do not perfectly do so
and just a little bit scroll horizontally, Firefox jump back a few pages.

Expected Results:
Scrolling vertically with the Mighty Mouse should scroll vertically, and
horizontally should scroll horizontally with that mouse. It should not go page
back and forward.

Every other application us the horizontal scroll feature of the Mighty Mouse
to scroll a document horizontally. Firefox should do so a well. The page
jumping feature is totally unexpected and confusing.
Also the page jumping is very annoying since it is very easy to accidently jump
page when using the ball of the Mighty Mouse.
Firefox should not do that. It make the scrollball of the Mighty Mouse unusable
in Firefox.
