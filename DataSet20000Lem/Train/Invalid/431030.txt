adding new bookmark by right-click on livemark folder start library view looping
Adding a new bookmark by right-clicking a livemark container in the library sidebar make the library view jump between that container and a different one (probably the previous one viewed) several times. These seems similar to the problem with the library back and forward button view cycling. The number of jump varies between one and twenty.

Saw this while looking into bug 431029.

Using:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008042606 Minefield/3.0pre

STR:
1/ open library
2/ make sure you already have a livemark bookmarked and visible in the sidebar
3/ right-click the livemark container
4/ pick "new bookmark"
5/ fill in the field and press enter to create bookmark
6/ observe jumping
