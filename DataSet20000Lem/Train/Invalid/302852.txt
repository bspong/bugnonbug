Popup Windows blocker fails to block unwanted ad

This is occurring only through the Drudge Report site. Ads are coming up
despite the fact that Popup Windows blocking is active. One thing I have noted
is that the ad come up with the IP address in the web page title, which
display in the button along the lower toolbar in Windows. After clicking it,
the website domain name is presented. They included: z1.adserver.com,
web.tickle.com, adopt.hbmediapro.com

I apologize for not following related threads, but after several minute of
looking I found no way to hook into them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit Drudge Report
2.Read some of the article if nothing happens
3.Be sure to deny all cooky
4.If nothing happens, try returning to the Drudge Report home page
5.Work on other applications. After a few minutes, you may see a popup ad
appear in your Windows toolbar.
