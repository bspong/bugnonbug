I wa sorting the bookmark and I dragged a bookmark into a folder in the bookmark list. Then, without closing the bookmark list, I dragged that same bookmark in order to arrange it. After that, the bookmark list just wouldn't close. I deselected the Bookmarks menu, still the list remained. I could not minimize Firefox either, the desktop would just flash for a moment and return to Firefox. A screenshot depicting the problem is attached. More screenshots are available.
