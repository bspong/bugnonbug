Favicon not restored for chrome:// url
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110729080751

Steps to reproduce:

1.) Open up an add-on that open in a tab (in my case, FireFTP, which load at chrome://fireftp/content/fireftp.xul )
2.) Close the tab.
3.) Restore the tab (using Cmd-Shift-T or what have you)

(the same behavior happens if restarting the browser and the session is restored)


Actual results:

Favicon not restored.


Expected results:

Favicon should be there.

I tried using nsIFaviconService but this seems to have no effect on chrome:// urls...
