Tool Bar "Search" input field value is not taken when press Enter Key or Search Button
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5

When I type some text inside the Toolbar "Search" input field and execute the search, the "Key words" I typed is not taken for the search, & Firefox just load the Search Engine Home Page with an Empty Search Input Field. Then I have to type the key word again in the input field.
It's just like typing the url of any search engine home page. Just load the home page of the search engine. But it never identify the keywords I typed in the toolbar search input field for a search.(Sometimes it works.but for most of the times, it give the bad result).
I'm someone who love Firefox and it's add-on and who belief that 'Firefox' should be the future universal Application UI.So I would be so much thankful, if you could kindly consider this bug and rectify this for us.
Thanks you very much!!!
