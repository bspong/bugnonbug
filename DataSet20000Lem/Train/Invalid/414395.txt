Should we use gtk-media-stop for download's stop icon?
This isn't even really a bug a much a an observation that seems logical enough.

For the download manager, we currently us gtk-media-pause for pause and gtk-media-play for play, but not gtk-media-stop for stop.

In the case that a GTK icon theme make their medium icon much different from the rest of the icons, it would probably be a good idea to use gtk-media-stop for stopping downloads.
