After changing theme and closing browser, unable to bring it back up
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.8

Was online, using Firefox (which I downloaded two day ago), with no problems.
Decided to change themes, selected a different theme that I had downloaded for
Firefox and closed the browser, tried to bring it back up to use a couple of
minute later and got a message that "no vbl binder for this browser" and that
it wa unable to launch.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. I did not reproduce since i could not launch the browser again
2.
3.



Expected Results:
Launched to use

I had changed theme originally (when I first downloaded) from what the default
is, to red cat and then wa going to change to another this morning - that's
when this problem happened
I'd like to know if this is something where i have to remove Firefox and reload
it brand new again...or if there is a way to fix without removing.
