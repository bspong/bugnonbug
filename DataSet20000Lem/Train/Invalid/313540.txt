This happens on all edges. I couldn't measure the exact distance but my guess wa around 3 pixel from the edge of the back button. Again, this happens on all edge (left, top and bottom). The right edge make sense of course because that is where the arrow is.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website and click a link
2. Use the mouse to press the back button near the top, left or bottom edge of the widget.
3. The back button history menu drop down a if the history arrow on the back button wa pressed.

Actual Results:
The back button menu drop down.

Expected Results:
The default back behavior should happen (ie go back in the history).

The version I am using is from SuSE 10 and I am using the clearlooks theme in GNOME. The specific firefox theme is the default theme that ship with SuSE 10. I believe this is the Industrial theme.
