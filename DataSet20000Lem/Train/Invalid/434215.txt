Bookmarks Toolbar doesn't display the icons/text of content in the Bookmarks Toolbar...

After upgrade to 2.0.0.14 the bookmark toolbar no longer display the content of the Bookmarks|Bookmarks Toolbar Folder. Using the Bookmarks menu to select the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder show the saved bookmarks, and clicking on any of the saved bookmark in the Toolbar Folder cause the browser to navigate properly to the bookmark's associated page. The content of the folder were not affected and all bookmark's previously saved work a expected.

I also tested for "phantom" icon or hotspot by clicking along the toolbar where icon should have been represented but there wa no navigation or mouse reaction.
