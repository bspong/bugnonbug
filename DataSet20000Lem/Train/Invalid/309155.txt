SetTimeOut fails when IFRAME is involved

I'll start this by saying that there is no issue with Internet Explorer 6.x,
only with Mozilla Firefox.

If you go to the URL above, and move your mouse over the dynamic javascript
menus, you will notice that the menu do not vanish after 0.5 second *IF* the
mouse ha moved into the IFRAME (directly below the two row of dynamic menus).
If the mouse is in the main page, then the menu will dissapear.

This appears to be a problem with Javascript SetTimeOut, which seems to be abort
or fails to execute the minute the mouse move across the IFRAME.

This problem doe not occur with IE 6.x.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move your mouse over the dynamic javascript menu (do not select a URL)
2. Make sure your mouse is over the IFRAME when the mouse pointer move off the menu
Actual Results:
The menu will not vanish.. SetTimeOut mysteriously abort if the mouse pointer
is over the IFRAME when it move off the dynamic menu.


Expected Results:
Functionality should behave a Internet Explorer 6.x. Regardless of what IFRAME
the mouse pointer is over, the SetTimeOut function should be called (in this
case, the function call a Javascript function that hide the dynamic menu after
the onMouseOut function i

The problem is not caused by onMouseOut.. I have confirmed that onMouseOut still
fire even when the mouse pointer is over the IFRAME (using a simple alert()
javascript).

The problem is definitely SetTimeOut...

P.S. No click is involved at all.. this is purely mouse movement.
