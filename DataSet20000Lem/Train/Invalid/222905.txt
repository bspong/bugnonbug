PROPOSED: The Thunderbird mailbox-tree handler should be the model for the bookmark handler

I've previously pinged on the difficulty of creating a heierarchy of folder in
the bookmarks. I wa 'defeated' by the principal of least-surprise. So, I'm
going to relate this to an existing function: there will be le surprise still
if two tree-view control behave basically the same.

1) The Thunderbird Folder Tree allows "New Subfolder / Rename Folder / Delete
Folder / Search / Properties" on the rightmouse -- all of these are appropriate
and, IMNSHO, valuable function for the bookmark folder.
2) The Thunderbird NewFolder dialog, even when called from SelectFolder=>
NewSubfolder, allows for changing the parent - it only nominates the selected
item. Again, very very useful while storing a bookmark.

And, only slightly off topic, PLEASE give u a "NewFolder" button on the
AddToBookmarks dialog - it's a terrible waste of time to navigate down a tree
and then find the folder category you're targeting hasn't been created. An
excellent model is the FilterProperties dialog in Thunderbird.
