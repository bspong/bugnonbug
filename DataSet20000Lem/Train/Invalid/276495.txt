browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction open popups with toolbars and menubars in new window
I like this option and have set it to 2 to allow webapps to work correctly.
However, right now this option also allows popups with toolbar and menubar to
open in new window, while most user expect these window to be opened in tabs.

To test this bug, set the pref to 2. Open this page

in firefox and click on the "Mozilla" link under the Publisher column
