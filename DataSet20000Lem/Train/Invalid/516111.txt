Bug #1:

If the "About Firefox" window is OPEN, then if you select "About Firefox" again, it should be brought to the front, beep, generate an error (Window already open", do something. Do something other than ignore my request. How do I know it's this or Firefox is Offline? I don't.

Bug #2.
In help you have "Report broken website, Report web forgery. Add a menu item called "Report Bug", just like Safari has. This would do nothing more than open "http://bugzilla.mozilla.com"

The first is a bug, the second is an enhancement.

If you want to call item #1 a feature, then fine. It's a feature, for Firefox not to respond to a request. If you don't understand, ask.



Reproducible: Always




Item #1 consistant with normal Windows behavior; Windows "Ignores you", especially when Windows want to restart your machine. I like to change that.

Item #2 is a feature enhancement to get more bug reported.

Some people believe feature are bug and vice versa.

If item #1 can be considered an enhancement without stepping on people's toes, then call it an enhancement request.
