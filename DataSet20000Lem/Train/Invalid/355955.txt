When you click on a tab that is already selected in Firefox, the standard window selection box/marquee appears around the tab label.
I don't know whether this is intentional, but the maequee is unattractive and make interface look unprofessional.

See attached screenshot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a tab and select.
2. Click on the tab again.
