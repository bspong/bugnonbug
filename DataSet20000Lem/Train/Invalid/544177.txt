Clearing recent history corrupts the live bookmark favicons of page already visited with those of current opened tabs. This continues to take hold (aka favicons change based on continued browsing) until the user revisits the affected page in the live bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Requirements: Multiple tab open. Live Bookmark exists.

Step 1: In a new tab, view any page on a live bookmark. Ex. Use the BBC live bookmark that come with Firefox.
Step 2: Leave other tab open. Clear all history.
Step 3: Open up live bookmark. Favicons for page that had been visited prior to clearing history change to those of open tab (including those prior to clearing)
Actual Results:
Favicons in the Live Bookmark for page that have been loaded change to those of page that were open in various tabs.

Expected Results:
Favicons in the Live Bookmark should be cleared or remain the correct ones.
