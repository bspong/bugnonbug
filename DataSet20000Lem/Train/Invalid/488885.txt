Is this to place to report extension bugs?
I didn't see any obvious place in the Add-ons menu.

The above URL describes and illustrates the problem with the
Resizable Textarea extension (which is otherwise very useful).

The original window size can cause unnecessary whitespace
and an unnecessary horizontal scroll bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Resizable Textarea extension.
2.Start with a very wide window.
3.Load http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~rbutterworth/ff-rsta-bug.html
4.Make window narrow.
Actual Results:
A horizonal scroll bar appears.

Expected Results:
All of the scrolled-out-of-window area is only whitespace.

Not produced the unnecessary scroll bar.

Note that I don't think it is the browser itself that's at fault.
It's doing what would be the right thing based on the code that get inserted
at the end of the document (strangely, between </body> and </html>).
