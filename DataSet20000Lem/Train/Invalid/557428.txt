Newest rev. 3.6x continues to require more and more memory until overloading the system, hanging, and crashing. Did not occur using 3.5x. Tried numerous "fixes" -- quite unsuccessfully. Sorry, to be unable to determine cause... And, yes, using it on four variously configured machine -- all exhibiting same problem...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. keep many window and tab open
2. use FireFox regularly
3. observe crash a memory allocation escalates.
Actual Results:
FireFox hang

Expected Results:
10-16 hour later -- hang and crashes, every day.

Not gobble more and more resources...
