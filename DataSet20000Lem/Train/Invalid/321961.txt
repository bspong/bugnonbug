There is no vertical scrollbar on the right side of the screen and have to use my mouse wheel or page up and page down instead of being able to grab and slide the screen up and down.

When I would try to access the menu bar tool and go to the options, the only thing that would show up would be the three button that would be on the bottom of the option window... but no window..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Installed initially, did it.
2. closed browser and restarted. did it.
3. Uninstalled completely and reinstalled. Did it.
4. Reinstalled an old version of firefox, returned to normal.

Actual Results:
Could not access option nor had a side scroll bar.

Expected Results:
Should have been able to access the option window and had a side scroll bar.
