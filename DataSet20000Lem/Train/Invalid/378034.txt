If you bring up the "allowed sites" for popups dialog and click "remove all sites" the list of allowed site for popups is not cleared. Instead, the list of exception for cooky is cleared.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Firefox preference dialog
2. Under the "content" tab, click the exception button for blocking pop-up window
3. Click "remove all sites"

Actual Results:
The list of the site might shuffle in order, but none of the site are removed. If you then go to the "privacy" tab, then click the "exceptions" button under the cooky section, you'll see that all the site-specific cookie setting are gone.

Expected Results:
The list of exception for pop-up should be cleared and the setting for cooky should not be touched.
