The current version of Firebug Lite generates four HTTP requests. The header for these need to be improved to make sure user get the right version of Firebug Lite and to improve performance. The suggested improvement are listed for each HTTP request.

1. http://getfirebug.com/releases/lite/1.2/firebug-lite-compressed.js
A. Add an Expires header with a date in the past, so that on subsequent request it'll generate a Conditional GET request.
B. The ETag should be removed unless it is being used in some way.

2. http://firebuglite.appspot.com/firebug-lite.css
3. http://firebuglite.appspot.com/firebug.gif
4. http://firebuglite.appspot.com/spacer.gif
A. Add an Expires header with a date 1+ year in the future. Add a version number to the filename (eg, firebug-lite-1.2.css). If the file ever changes, the main firebug-lite-compressed.js can be updated to point to a new filename.
