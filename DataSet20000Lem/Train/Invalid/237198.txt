Windows reserved word and certain special character accepted a bookmarks.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Firefox accepts Window's reserved word and certain character (not accepted by
I.E.) a name of bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Add Bookmarks option and enter a window's reserved word such a prn or
com1 or com2.
2. Just click 'Ok'
3. Follow step 1 and enter any character from this set {\ / : * ? < > | }
4. Then click 'Ok'
Actual Results:
Firefox accepts both, the Window's reserved word and the special character
(not accepted by I.E.).

Firefox also allows multiple bookmark with the same name and doe not warn if a
bookmark exists with the same name.

Firefox accepts the character {\ / : * ? < > | } a name of bookmarks, which
are not accepted by I.E. (Oracle)

Expected Results:
ORACLE: I.E. doe not accept the Windows reserved word and rather 'crashes'.
However it doe promt stating that the reserved word already exists a a
bookmark name (which is not the case). Upon accepting to 'overwrite' the browser
crashes.
* Hence the usual expectation would be that Firefox reject window's reserved
word a name for bokmarks.


Follow up tests:
----------------
1. Tested this against an Oracle (I.E.) and found that it crash on accepting
Window's reserved words.
2. Picked the set of character not accepted by I.E. (Oracle) and fed them a
name of bookmark for Firefox, and found it accepts almost everything.
3. Copy-Pasted all form of data, such as, entire MS Word table, special symbol
from MS Word, and found that the Firefox accepts it readily, although with
strange character representation (As compared to I.E.)
4. Tested for the same on Suse Linux and the misbehavior hold true.


Importance of the bug:
----------------------
1. Using Window's reserved word a name of bookmark (files) can/may easily
conflict with the system a the file whose path contains reserved word can
cause the machine to crash (which wa depicted when performing test with I.E.).
Hence accepting a bookmark name which is a Window's reserved word can cause
misbehavior of the program and the system itself.

2. The special character from the set {\ / : * ? < > | }, consists of
character used in path names, query string etc. and hence can conflict when
given a file names(bookmarks). I.E. (Oracle) for this reason prohibits use of
these character for use in favorite names.
