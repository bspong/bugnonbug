After changing helper app twice, file won't open automatically and prefs list wrong app a default

See "steps to rep"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I associated sgf file with cgoban, then changed it to qgo, then changed again to glGo, always saying open automatically. Now it always asks whether to save or open with glGo. The Prefs/Apps entry say qgo(default), glGo. I can't edit that "default" bit. Note that the behaviour is to offer glGo, even though qgo is listed a default and cgoban ha disappeared altogether. It look like there are two place in the program where this default is stored, and they got out of sync. Perhaps there should only be one place.
Actual Results:
Saa above

Expected Results:
Latest fave app should be default everywhere and open without asking whether or not to save

Linux Mint is kicking ass, and Vista is soooooooo sloooooooooooooooow.
