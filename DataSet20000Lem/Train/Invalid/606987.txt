I make a wordpress plugin (share and follow) that ha many user reporting to me that the window.sidebar.addPanel(title, url,"") element of the bookmarking ha stopped funcitoning properly in Firefox.

I've tested this substantially and re-checked the code that wa working only 2 week ago and have found the same problem a them. Please see the link and click on the "star" bookmark button under the post.

What happens when you click on it is that it try to bookmark the physical content of the HREF='' and not the javascript response that should take up that space.

i.e. actual code on page for location
javascript:window.bookMark('http%3A%2F%2Fshare-and-follow.com%2Fwordpress-plugin%2F2010%2F10%2Fversion-1-50-now-out-cdn-extra-icon-sets-more-social-networks-massive-change-in-code-its-halloween%2F',%20'Version+1.50+now+out.+CDN%2C+extra+icon+sets%2C+more+social+networks%2C+massive+change+in+code%E2%80%A6+it%E2%80%99s+Halloween%21',%20BrowserDetect.browser);

bookMark() run this code
window.sidebar.addPanel(thetitle, theurl,"");

BrowserDetect.browser() just report back what browser such a Firefox

Wanted response in the location when clicking the button is

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto URL
2. click "star" bookmark button under post
3. Look at location in the browser popup much for bookmarking
Actual Results:
