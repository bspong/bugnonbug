The test URL above is actually used in an <iframe> tag in this main page
<http://www.voipcheap.com/en/index.html> ...

<iframe src="https://www.voipcheap.com/myaccount/buycreditpanel.php?title=&name=User+name%3A&password=Password%3A&submit=sign+in" border="0" style="width: 240px; height: 45px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;" align="top" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"></iframe>

but also work by itself (stand-alone).
Make sure you have the full URL incl. the parameter which are used to display the text "username", "password" and "login" (submit) in arbitrary language.
When you try to login FF never promts if you want to save the password and there is also no trace of <www.voipcheap.com> etc. in the password manager.
Probably the special construct of the login dialog cause this problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. URL = "https://www.voipcheap.com/myaccount/buycreditpanel.php?title=&name=User+name%3A&password=Password%3A&submit=sign+in"
2. Enter any username and passord, press [submit]


Actual Results:
FF doe not prompt "Do you want to save the Password?" but just continues to the next page (dependent if login wa successful or not).

Expected Results:
1. FF should prompt "Do you want to save the Password?" dialog (inserted on top of the page)
2. if you select "Save password" then username/password should be stored

Please also test with the full start page where the login is an <iframe>
located on the upper left side with heading "Buy Credits / Sign in" ...
