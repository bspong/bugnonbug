The problem with current implementation of persona with tab on top is that only upper part us the persona background, rest of the aero frame is the way it wa earlier , which is of course not at all symmetric
There are two way to solve this ;

One is to use Chrome's way of implementation , that is reducing the width of the aero frame , which i think is not good a it doesn't make it look like any other window application or rather just explorer

Other is to (IMO) restrict persona background to just toolbars like tab bar , nav bar etc and not to the aero frame while on tab on top , and i don't know if this should be restricted to aero only or to all frame including basic and window xp


This is ONLY a enhancement bug in my opinion

Reproducible: Always
