I have a bookmark - http://www.digitalhome.ca/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=11. When I click, the address becomes - http://www.digitalhome.caforum/forumdisplay.php?f=11 in the address box.

Note the first forward slash after - http://www.digitalhome.ca is missing.

I have a second forum with this website and it exhibit the same actions.

I have a third and it doe not.

I checked the property of all and the forward slash is present on all properties.

2.address box show missing forward slash
3.

This happened on two bookmark only. I have a third forum with this site and it work OK. I checked the property for both the failed bookmark and all wa OK.

I deleted both bookmark and reloaded them.

The problem ha corrected itself. The bookmark address is copied identically to the address box.

I have around a hundred or so bookmark and these are the only two so far that are affected.
