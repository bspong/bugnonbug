When I compose an email using FIREFOX and my Yahoo web mail account, entering an obvious url doe not turn it into a clickable link like it doe when I use IE. So if I'm trying to suggest that everybody I know go to www.firefox.com , it will stay a text rather than immediately turning into a link. Cutting and pasting is too much work for most folks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open yahoo mail client
2. Compose an email with a url listed in the body of the text
3.

Actual Results:
it stay a text

Expected Results:
it should turn into a link
