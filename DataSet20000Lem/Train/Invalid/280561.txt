I use firefox with the Qute theme. When multiple tab are open, and I follow a
link in the same page (which also remains in the same tab) the throbber in the
tab doe not work while the page is loading. The throbber in the toolbar work
fine though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a non default theme
2. Have at least two tab open, so the tabbar show up
3. Follow a link in which you stay in the same tab
4. Or: press back or forward in the same tab
5. Or: drag a link from a page in one tab to another tab

Actual Results:
The throbber in the tab in which the page is loading doe not spin

Expected Results:
Obvious

This bug doe *not* show up:
1. When using the default theme
2. When selecting a bookmark to load in a new tab
3. When selectin a link to load in a new tab

I tried both the Qute 3.0 theme and Noia Extreme 2.81, both are the latest
version at update.mozilla.org. I don't think it's theme manager related so I
filed it under Tabbed Browser.
