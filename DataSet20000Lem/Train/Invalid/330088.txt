Tree structure (hierarchy) not very clear in Properties window
When you look at the "old" Add Bookmark window, the structure is very clear, there is no room for any doubt where the folder is located.
In the new Properties window, I find it difficult to discover the hierarchy, I see normal text and bold text and that seems to represent the quantity of bookmark in it. I think this is not very important. It is equal to me whether the folder is small or large.
The old one (with folder icons) is also more decorative.
