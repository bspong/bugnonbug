Firefox DOES NOT DISPLAY advertising ad generated with the Wordpress, theme but Chrome do
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

It seems like Firefox ha a problem displaying the advertising ad generated by the Gazette Edition Wordpress theme (from Woo Themes), a premium wordpress theme that can be managed from the Wordpress admin interfase.

The ad work OK in Chrome and IE8, so I'm guessing it's a problem with the Firefox rendering engine or something like that. Just thought you guy should know since I promote using Firefox in that online version for our local newspaper.

I'm not very skilled at PHP but I'm gonna do some research about a hack or something that help me while the problem is fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL http://codiceenlinea.com/
2. Look at left sidebar.
3. Do the same first two step in Chrome or IE.
Actual Results:
Square advertising space on the left sidebar don't show with Firefox.

Expected Results:
All the ad i set up should show when accessing the URL with Firefox.

I have used other Wordpress theme from Woo Themes before (Fresh News) and it worked OK. But, however, I seem to have the same problem with some other theme besides the one one I'm reporting the problem for (Gazette Edition). The advertising space don't show in Firefox but they do in other browsers.
