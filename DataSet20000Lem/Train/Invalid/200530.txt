This seems to apply to any jpeg or gif on any web page. Not a big deal, but it
wa annoying until I figured out how to undo it. To undo, you must left-click in
the browser window but not on the image. Also occurs in Pheonix 0.5 milestone.
Does not occur in Mozilla 1.1. Doesn't affect page background. If this is a
feature, sorry if I don't see the benefit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load a web page with a jpge or gif image
2.Place pointer over image
3.Hold left mouse button down and move pointer.

Actual Results:
Image get darker

Expected Results:
Nothing should happen...or at least, clicking on image again should undo it.

Occurs with new profile using default everything
