It's a slow a Internet Explorer.

I used to have an older version of Mozilla before Firefox. One of the reason I
liked it wa that it wa way faster than Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer
just pause every few screens, and I don't know why - maybe it's doing some
internal memory defragging or something.

Unfortunately, Firefox seems to do this same pausing every so often. It seems
slower in this way than the previous version of Mozilla. The connection light
is off so it not a slow network thing. I suppose it could be a slow
server-side thing, but I don't think it's even connected yet to the server.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just browsing, it pause every so often.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
It pause for a minute or so.

Expected Results:
Just load the page, keep going, like the older version of Mozilla.
