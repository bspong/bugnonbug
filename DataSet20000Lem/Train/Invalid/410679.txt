When installed, I could not get my old bookmark (FireFox, latest 2.x version) file into 3.x. Usually I've simply copied the old file back to the new profile or just used the old profile. I had to import the bookmark into IE7, then do an import from FF. Even that wa a huge hassle a it ceated multiple of various folders. For instance I now have 2 "Bookmarks Toolbar" under "All Bookmarks". It will not allow me to delete one of them even if I empty one. BTW-when they both had link in them there would not be any toolbar showing. When I combined them into one it showed.

Additionally, the "Sort By Name" is grayed out an I cannot sort bookmarks. This happens whether just view the booksmakrs or I go fully into the "View Bookmarks" Menu. So nowhere to sort, period.
