"Load new tabbed page in background" - Where is that option?

In Mozilla and Netscape, one option for center click is:
"open new tab, load page in background"
That option is not there in
Tools // Options // Advanced // Tabbed Browsing
and I cannot find it anywhere else.

Since this is one of the coolest feature of tabbed browsing I'm confident it
still exists, but I cannot find it. Help please.

Also, please put that option it back under
Tools // Options // Advanced // Tabbed Browsing


Reproducible: Always
