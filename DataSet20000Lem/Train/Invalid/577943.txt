History: Cannot change "view by"

I can only view my history by "date and site" and "by date." When I try the other views, the list remains blank. I've left it there to load in case it's loading but it never did.
I tried deleting some history in case I had too much, but that did not work. I also re-installed Firefox (using MozBackup to keep my history and other preferences).

Reproducible: Always
