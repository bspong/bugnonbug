Sometimes after select and dragging the TEXT in the box, the box move
BUT sometimes select and drag on the TEXT, give a small box outline, which
look like a text selection drag highlight, is dragged, and the box doesn't
move until the text highlight is released, when the box suddently move to
be under the mouse cursor.
This later behaviour suggests that the mouse-down and mouse-move event are
arriving at the javascript after drag release.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the attached SVG+JavaScript
2. Select the text (e.g. letter 'e') and drag
3. either box move immediately, or a text selection move with the cursor, and box move when the mouse button is released.
Actual Results:
click down on the text (e.g. letter 'e') and drag
either box move (what I want) or text selction moves, then box move on mouse button up

Expected Results:
clicking down should allow box and it text to be dragged

This is also a bug in Firefox 4b8
