Using domain guessing the URL http://apple/isync should resolve to
http://www.apple.com/isync, but the "isync" portion of the address is stripped
in the process of adding the "www." and ".com" to the URL. Therefore, the
browser simply get directed to http://www.apple.com/.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter "http://apple/isync" a an address
2. Wait for a page to load
3. See the front page of the Apple website load.

Actual Results:
Main page of the Apple website loaded.

Expected Results:
Firefox should do a the Mozilla browser would, and load the Apple iSync website
at http://www.apple.com/isync.
