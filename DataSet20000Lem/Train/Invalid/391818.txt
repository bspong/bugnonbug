Firefox block pop-up in this web: http://www.imvu.com/catalog/web_hpth.php?
at first not, i can open new pages, and everything is OK. but after a few minute firefox start blocking! i have included the page into the list of allowed webs, but firefox still blocking.
i have tried to disable the blocker, but the problem continue.

i have found one solution, i close firefox. then i reopen firefox, go to the page, and now there is no problem! but after a few minute firefox start blocking again.

i know this problem isn´t very important, but it very annoying.

thank you very much, and sorry for my english, im from spain and im 17... sorry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. i open the page, everything is OK, i can open new page and firefox don´t block.
2. after a few minute surfing on that page, firefox start blocking.
3. i restart firefox
4. now the problem ha gone
5. after a few minute the problem appears again, and firefox start blocking page which i want to open.
Actual Results:
when the problem appears i restart firefox, and after a few minute i restart firefox cause the problem is still there.

Expected Results:
firefox shouldn't block these pages, cause it me who open these page from here: http://www.imvu.com/catalog/web_hpth.php?

anyways, if the page is included in the allowed page list of the blocker, firefox shouldn't block them.

Im using macfoxII graphite a theme
im not using other pop-up blocker (and when the problem starts, firefox tell me that it ha blocked a pop-up with a message at the top of the page)
i think this problem dindt appear with other versions.

thank you very much, and congratulation cause firefox is the best web browser!!!
