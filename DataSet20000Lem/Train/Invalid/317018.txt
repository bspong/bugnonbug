The back/forward button appear to be enabled or disabled based on the most history of the most recently opened tab, not the currently displayed tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox, go to any website, click on a link.
2. Verify that the 'back' button is enabled
3. Open a new tab
4. In the new tab, go to any website
5. Verify that the 'back' button is disabled (you haven't followed any link yet)
6. Click on the first tab.

Actual Results:
The back button is still disabled, even though this tab ha a history. Hitting ALT-Left doe nothing, but hitting 'Backspace' still work (however, the Forward button remains disabled).

Expected Results:
The forward/back button should reflect the history of the tab you switched to.

It look like the forward/back button are attached to the most recently opened tab even after you switch tabs.

I have similar problem with the search box (it always try to find in the most recently opened tab) and the URL bar (switching tab doesn't update the location bar).
