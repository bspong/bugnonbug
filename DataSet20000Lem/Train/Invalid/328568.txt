When scrolling a text page with the keyboard the area that pass under the mouse pointer get garbled frequently.
This happens sometimes when the mouse pointer change from caret to arrow and you scroll one line.
Seems to depend on the blinking state, maybe if the scroll happens when the caret dissapearad and ha to reappear a arrow then the position of the area to be redrawn ha an error on it's height.
I'm attaching a picture of a Bugzilla search page after scrolling up and down several times.
It happens in an 800MHz, 512MB Pentium. It might be processor-speed dependent.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go Bugzilla, search for "mouse pointer"
2.Leave the mouse pointer in the center of the screen
3.Scroll up and down using the arrows, in one line step
