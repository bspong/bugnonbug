Bug Description:
The Bottom of the Firefox Window ha about 50 pixel of blank gray space with the exception of one red Caret "^" on the far left.

The Status Bar including corner's drag-to-resize icon consistently hover about 50 pixel above the bottom of the window. The drag-to-resize icon can still be used to resize the window a well a the edge of the window. This space will only go away if the window is resized so the web-space is zero, for example if the task-bar is up against the tabs.

Note on Severity:
This bug is le annoying at higher resolution although very frustrating when it take a large percentage of the window area.

Environment:
This occurred on Windows XP Pro 2002 SP2
This is a BASF Corporate Dell Machine (Service Tag C2ZP3D1)

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
I do not know how the bug occurred. This ha been an issue for several months. I do not have a workaround. While I cannot now, I will spend more time trying to reproduce the bug later.

I did try to re-install firefox hoping this would solve the bug, I wa previously running "Firefox 1.5.0.4" and re-installed "Firefox 2.0.0.12" after several automatic updates.
Actual Results:
The re-installation did not fix the bug.


Software should not have this gray space.
