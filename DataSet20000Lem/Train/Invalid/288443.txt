Firefox refuse http connection when application is not located in /Applications or ~/Desktop
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

I created a folder an the same level a /Applications; I call this folder
Internet and it contains all manner of Internet application (browsers, FTP
programs, etc). If I put Firefox 1.0.x in this folder, Firefox work fine
_except_ it will not open any http URL (Connection refused... message pop up).
However, if I put Firefox in /Applications or ~/Desktop, there is no problem
connecting to http sites.

No amount of fiddling with network or firewall setting will get Firefox to open
an http URL when it is in my Internet folder. I have not tested it by putting
it elsewhere (I'm happy to have it work in /Applications).

This behavior doe not occur with Mozilla 1.7.6

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Put Firefox in a folder at same level a /Application
