Like I said, the scrollbar is compeltely missing. I opened up something (bookmarks I think) and then there wa another arrow within my address bar. And then I went to my option to try to change skins, to se eif that might help, but it is invisible except for the "OK, APPLY and CANCEL" buttons.

Reproducible: Always
