When I first open the browser, if I right click a mysterious unnecessary bar appears between the title bar and the menu bar. This stay here for a while.
Later on, if I right click (have not determined if it is random or doe it after a specific number of clicks), the bar disappears, and the right click menu stop appearing. The function begin to work again when the browser is restarted.

1. Open browser
2. Right click
3. Continue using right click on occasion
Actual Results:
Random bar appears, then disappears later on (after last step) and the menu will no longer appear.
