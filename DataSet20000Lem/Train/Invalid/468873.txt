During a session, with only one tab or more open, firefox will say that it is loading but the bar down the bottom will say 'stopped'. Everything stop and when closed firefox will not open again saying that it is still running.

While utilizing website (like: facebook, xanga) I would try to sign out or use a program attached to the site and firefox would looklike it is loading the information but the bottom bar - that usually say 'done' or state the link the cursor is hovering over - would state 'stopped'. And nothing would load. It wouldn't matter if I just got on line or whether I had been online for an hour. It doesn't happen exclusively with these sites. When I close firefox it won't reopen, stating that it is still running and not responding. I have scanned it with avast! and Spybot S&D to look for those kind of problem without result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use blog or network site
2.Try to sign out or jump to another site
3.Once it stops, close
Actual Results:
1. Worked fine.
2. Said that it wa 'loading,' but bottom bar stated 'stopped'
3. Closed, would not reopen until after restart. Sometimes twice.

Expected Results:
That it should load whatever I click on or state why and a mean of resolution.

I'm not smart enough to know what is going on.
