When firefox is launched, I have my iGoogle page set a my home page. (http://www.google.com/ig?hl=en) and it is not centere and all content is moved to the left. I cannot see any info that should have been on the left a it is currently off screen. However, when I click the "Home" button, or refresh the page, the content re-aligns and center just a the page is supposed to be. So this problem only occurs when I open FireFox.
