Use random version number
It seems that Mozilla people want to ban version number information (no difference between minor and major release, and even removal of version in About window -see #678775)...
But stupid user still get attached to version number. So I suggest to lose them a bit more with removing any numerical order from the versions. A random version number is the key! After Firefox 6, let's welcome Firefox ¤, then Firefox § or Firefox µ.
