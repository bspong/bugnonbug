This "Fast Browser Search" just appeared a one of my 11 search engine that I have to choose from in my browser - it is automatically set a my default search engine each time I open Firefox. Changing my default or removing it completely doe not "stick", once I restart Firefox it's right back to being default!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Manage Search Engines
2.Either choose a different default search engine or to remove Fast Browser Search
3.Restart Firefox

Actual Results:
Upon restarting Firefox, the change made previously to either change search engine default or to remove Fast Browser Search, are gone and setting have been returned to previous settings.

Expected Results:
I expect that when I either change my default search engine OR remove a search engine (Fast Browser Search) all together, for the browser to maintain these setting after restarting.

Was this "Fast Browser Search" search engine included with the version 3 update? Or wa it installed by a website that I visited?
