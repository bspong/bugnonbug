You need to have a flash plug-in installed to experience this bug.

I don't think this is a bug of the flash plug-in, because i guess only Firefox know which flash animation is in the foreground tab, so Firefox ha to handle this.

But I am unsure if Firefox ha control over the sound output from flash plug-ins...
