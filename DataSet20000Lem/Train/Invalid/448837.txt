On starting up my laptop tonight and launching Firefox, the window flash very briefly, then come up with the Mozilla Crash Reporter. I get the same behavior trying to start in safe mode with everything dilabled.

I even (after backing up my profile directory), fully uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled, tried to start it from a new profile, and it crash just the same.

I also tried logging in a a different user on this machine, to isolate a Windows profile problem: same crash.


Running 32-bit Windows Vista Ultimate SP1. There wa no problem earlier today; just on starting up my machine tonight.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 3 in normal or safe mode.
