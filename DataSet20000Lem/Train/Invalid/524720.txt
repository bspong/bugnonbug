Browser come up invisible

The browser window just show for a very little time somewhere near the top left corner of the screen with a very small size. Then, before anyx action can be done, it disappears. It still can be seen in the taskbar. With right-click you can maximize it and it is shown correctly. If you try to change (reduce) it size, the window just disappears again.

I have not found a good way to reproduce this bug but I have the impression it appears more often with onr of the following conditions:

1) Browser ha crashed before
or
2) More than one browser window are open and the user log off / shuts down the PC.




Reproducible: Sometimes
