When the 'Show contents' box is checked, a text pane appears but remains empty. The same problem also appears with the privacy policy for the first time reporting a broken site.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Help->Report Broken Web Site...
2. Fill out the form that appears with the detail of the problem.

4. Check the 'Show Contents' box (Or something like that; I have no way to get back without filing another report, which I don't want to do)

The text pane should have displayed the contents, a plain text, of the bug report.
