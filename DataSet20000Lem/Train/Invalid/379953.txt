I have a ajax/javascript tool which work fine on Opera, IE and Safari but break with Firefox. The problem come from the fact that there is some kind of limitation in the length of a string. In any case alert(response.getElementsByTagName('contents')[0].firstChild.data) clearly show that the data ha been cut (the variable string is not complete, but is only a substring of what I have passed by xml).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
I can see a substring of the string contained in the xml element.
