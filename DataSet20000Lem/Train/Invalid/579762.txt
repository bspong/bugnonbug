Mark first real tab similar to first-tab
The first tab is always marked first-tab="true". If the first tap is an app tab, it will get "first-tab". However, there doe not seem to be a way to easily match the first *real* tab. IMHO it should have a marker, too (or first-tab should mark the first real tab and a new marker should mark the first and last app-tabs)
