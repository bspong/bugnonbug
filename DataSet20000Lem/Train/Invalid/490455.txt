Firefox ha been crashing after I click to run/open it when I first get on the computer. At first it say 'Firefox is installing your update and will start in a few moments..." First off, I have no idea what update it is talking about? Then the green download bar only go a little way before it show a Software Update Failed and say 'The update could not be installed. Please make sure there are no other copy of Firefox running on your computer, and then restart Firefox to try again.'

It will do this continously after I press the okay button. I have uninstalled the product, which is hard to do since I have to hurry up and click ok and then uninstall before it pop up again. And re-installed firefox about four time now and it still happens randomly.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Randomly chooses a day to do update when starting Firefox
2. Update Fails
3.Press okay and it recycles the process
Actual Results:
It keep trying to update then fails. You can do it for hours. Have to uninstall, cause the message will not go away. Pressing 'OK' just restarts it.

Expected Results:
1. Finished the update.
2. If failed, it should not keep cycling after I press 'ok'.

I actually haven't tried not having the theme I have now. I don't remember the name, but it wa pink? I might try it but am unsure if that's the problem.
