For no reason Firefox started working much slower than just a few week ago,
sometimes it crash 1-3 and more time on initial program start. Uninstalling
and reinstalling did not fix the problem.

If this cannot be explained by a bug, I would suspect Microsoft is trying to
undermine Firefox superiority to their IE by probably including some nusty code
in their window update - is it possible? I have no choice but to use IE a
Firefox doe not work well anymore. I will try to fix it but please make sure MS
doe not interfere with your product because I support Firefox all 100%, I do
not want to use IE!
