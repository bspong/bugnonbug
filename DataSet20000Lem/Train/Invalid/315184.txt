I'm using a function html2ansi(str) to replace some string in str. The parameter 'str' came from the content of a editable iframe. But when the content of this iframe is copied from Mozilla (either 1.0.7 or 1.5 rc1) it self,

str.replace(/\n/gi, '')

will replace some blank to ''. If it wa copied from a IE window, str.replace just decrease the lenght of str a little.

I modified the program to the following, but the problem is still there,

function html2ansi(str)
{
(1) alert('length: '+ str.length + ' '+ str);
str=str.replace(/\n/gi, '<tmpstring>');
str=str.replace(/<tmpstring>/, '');
(2) alert('length: '+ str.length + ' '+ str);
...
(3) alert(str);
return str;
}

The line (1) gives,

length: 144 The day of a program living a a single entity are all but gone. Today's program need to be more versatile and expandable. The simpest way to

The line (2) give the following. VERY WIRED. At line (2) there is actually
no '<tmpsting>' in str, but '<tmpstring>' is displayed in 'alert'.

length: 153 The day of a program living a a single entity are all but gone. Today's program need to be more versatile and expandable. The simpest<tmpstring>way to

At line (3), alert still give '....<tmpstring>...', but in the returned value,
there is actually no '<tmpstring>'.

I can not make a single html file to repeat this yet. But it happens every time
on my website (a Chinese website, GB2312, not English). If you want to look at it, send me a email (yasheng@gmail.com) for a step by step instruction.
