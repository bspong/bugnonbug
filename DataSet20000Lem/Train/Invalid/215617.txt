When visiting the cited URL, an alert containing the summary text
pop up 11 times. Examining the protocol stream with Ethereal doe not
reveal anything unusual (text dump of trace attached). A number of
theme icon are missing, but the number missing doesn't exactly match the
number of time the dialog popped up (it's usually one or 2 more than the
number of alerts).

The system I'm running on is RH8.0 on a LAN behind another RH8.0
system acting a a router and NAT firewall.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the theme page on texurizer.net
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Themes page display with some preview icon missing,
multiple alert popups.

Expected Results:
Themes page display with all icons, no popup alert.

Does Firebird need to limit the number of simultaneous connection
it attempts?

I'm really curious about where the dialog originate, since I didn't
see any "421" http error in the data stream. AFAICT 421 isn't an
official http error code.
