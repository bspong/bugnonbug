Update of extension ha erased all content of drop-down section of URL Bar

Having had a pop-up reminding me for 4-5 day that an up date wa available, I
up-dated MR Tech About About to ver 1.2.2, today. Upon restarting FF I find all
URL'S that used to be stored in the DD box below the URL box are no longer visible.
I have looked to see if this ha been reported elsewhere, and whilst several
item had similar characteristics, none appeared to 'match' exactly.

As many of the URL's are quite lengthy and not stored elsewhere, the process of
recovering from their loss, could be lengthy/costly to say the least.

If it is simply a matter of re-connecting to a config. file, your direction to
the necessary instruction would be greatly appreciated. Otherwise, any help you
can offer would be gratefully received.

Kind regard

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Up-Date via Pop-up
2.Re-start FF
3.URL'S all gone

Actual Results:
I wa unable to view any URL's previously accessible, via the drop-down box
below the URL box.

Expected Results:
I would have expected the URL's to have remained available.
Having previously updated the browser from 1.0.4 to 1.0.6, and experienced no
adverse effect from so doing, I fully expected similar result on this occasion.
