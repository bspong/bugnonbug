A recent checkin changed the behavior of Firefox scrolling to not scale mouse wheel event in order to make scrolling better for user that use trackpad scrolling, this slows down scrolling for everyone else.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Scroll with the mouse wheel

Actual Results:
Scrolling requires more movement of the mouse wheel to travel the same distance on the page.

Expected Results:
Scrolling work a before.

I wa going to tag this onto the end of bug 314856 and ask that it be reopened, but decided this wa more productive since the problem the user had really should be addressed, just not in a way that made thing worse for non-trackpad users. I'm filing this a an RFE because I can live with it as-is or keep using 11/28 in the meantime and this might need an enhancement added to suitably fix.

I don't use a Mac laptop, but the first step seems to be...

1) Find out what Safari scroll like with the trackpad. Josh said he ha a Powerbook, so that seems pretty straightforward. Darren Stone gave some number in his comment (#9) in bug 314856. Safari rather than generic Cocoa application should be used for comparison since that's what user are going to be comparing the Moz browser to.

2) Adopt that behavior (for Camino a well).

3) If it's not possible to do (e.g. Apple is doing something to accomodate trackpad user that just isn't feasible for Firefox) then expose a method to adjust the scaling to user through prefs (about:config type access is fine, though it'd probably be friendlier if you had a "trackpad scrolling" checkbox in advanced with auto- and smooth scrolling for people who wanted the non-scaling behavior). This might be welcome on other operating system but this wa a change to the Mac event handler so Mac OS X is where this is filed. It's worth looking at Darren's comment in 314856 again just to see how much of a difference this make to mouse-wheel user in the real world.

3) And just for the sake of consistency, Firefox should scroll the same number of line when using the keyboard arrow keys. Safari doe the same 3 they do with a mouse wheel increment, Camino doe about 2, Firefox currently doe 1. Both Moz product should do the same a a mouse wheel increment (so normally 3 like Safari). This would have the side effect of making Firefox feel faster to user without actually doing anything to improve scrolling performance. Scrolling by clicking on the scrollbar arrow is probably fine as-is, though someone should probably look into why it's so much worse on Camino one of these days.
