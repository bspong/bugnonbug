Selecting option in Preferences-Options-Tabbed browser-Advanced Tab and Tabbar do not seem to get updated to preferences.

Note: AFAICT entering value in Advanced Preferences for these values:
browser.{tabs|tabar}.extensions.{ondblclick|onmiddleckick} (four option in total) are sticky and are used when middle or double clicking on the tab or tabbar (I assume tabbar mean the portion of the tabbar not occupied by a tab)

Unfortunately, number aren't shown on the Preferences panel and alpha equivs aren't shown in the Advanced Preferences descriptions.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the Preferences section described above make selection to any or all of the values. Click [OK] then [OK] then [OK] (I think that's the right number ;-) )
2. Return to same panel and value are not shown.
3. Atttempting to dblclick/middleclick on tab/tabbar doe nothing

Actual Results:
No response.
Setting these value in "Advanced Preferences" tree DOES result in action being taken when double clicking/middle clicking.

Values appear when I revisit the tabbed browser prefs page but I haven't yet tried entering them again to see which if either is retained.



Expected Results:
Save/Display and act upon the setting entered
