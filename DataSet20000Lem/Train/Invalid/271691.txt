Mozilla seems to know that I am in Japan and I can't get a normal english
search going in the quick search box- (it only search www.google.co.jp). The
really wierd thing is even when I type in www.google.com in the web browser, it
take me to www.google.co.jp instead so I have know choice but to use IE for
google searches. I am using mozilla firefox 1.0

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.type anything in the quick search bar
2.OR type www.google.com in the search bar
3.

Actual Results:
mozilla will only search www.google.co.jp

mozilla will redirect you to www.google.co.jp

Expected Results:
take me to whatever version of google i want (in my case the english version)

Just want to make it clear that I am currently in Japan.

I consider this a major problem because it force me to use IE.
