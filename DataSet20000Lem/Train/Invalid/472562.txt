Stuck in "Save As" window after ejecting a mounted drive.

I wa saving a file and decided to eject a drive, and everything kinda bugged up. The drive ejected fine, but when I'd click on folder it showed them a empty, even though they weren't. Then I would click on a folder, and it would highlight a random folder in the sidebar (see pic).

And finally when I went to try and Save the file, it wouldn't execute anything, cancel would not do anything either. But I wa able to quit the browser without crashing. This wa all in the "column" view if that matters.

Hope this help somehow!
