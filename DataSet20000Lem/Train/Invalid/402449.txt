When closing muti tabs, the keyboard navigation for "Confirm close" dialog box is not working.
In Tiger , one could use the "Tab" button to move around "Cancel" and "Close Tabs" button , but in Leopard this doe not happen.
Also, the default button used to be highlighted. In Leopard one cannot know which is the default button?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open mutli tab
2.Click close (red button on the top-left corner of the window)
3.Confirm dialog box appears
