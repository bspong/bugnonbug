The function to schedule firefox to check a site for updates, work fine till a
site is found changed.
When the page change it pop up a notification dialog (if set to do this).
Clicking OK on that dialog the page is opened up in a new window.
But after <user set delay> another dialog show up notifying the change already
seen.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Schedule firefox to check for update on a bookmark and to show a pop up
2. Wait for a change (or better change yourself that page)
3. Click OK on the dialog
4. Wait <scheduled delay>
5. The dialog show up again

Identical problem happen with "open web page on new window" or "play a sound"
or "change icon"
Actual Results:
- The dialog will keep showing every <check delay> *forever*
- The web page is opened in a new window every <check delay> *forever*
etc.etc.

Expected Results:
- After the dialog is shown the first time, it should check against the
*updated* page for *further* update
- After the page is opened up in a new window for the first time, it should
check against the updated page for *further* update
