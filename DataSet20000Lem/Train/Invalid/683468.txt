User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0

Steps to reproduce:

I opened Tools->"Manage Content Plug-ins".


Actual results:

I got 100% CPU load with "All plugins" checked. Dialog becomes almost unusable. When "Plugins in use" is checked everything is OK.


Expected results:

This dialog should not cause continuous 100% CPU load in any mode.
