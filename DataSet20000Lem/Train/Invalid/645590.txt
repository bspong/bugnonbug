Downloaded Firefox 4 and message said it wa not compatible. FF4 wiped out FF 3.16.15 in my application folder. I have FF 2.5 but will not protect against on line attacks. When I click update Version 4 is all that come up. Where do I find older version like 3.16.15 to download?

Reproducible: Always
