More option to Windows Users - Firefox with IE control

One of the thing I hate the most is to find a page that only open in IE. Some
because of bugs, others because of plugins etc...
Since Firefox is very extensible I think that instead of like some plugins that
offer the option to open a page in IE, Firefox should have a option to replace
in one tab the mozilla control by the mshtml control. This way we would never
need to open IE and we could bookmark, block popups, etc... into firefox.
Additionaly this could be very useful to Evangilization projects. If there wa a
option (like the popups allow) to mark a page to open in IE-mode, firefox could
upload that to an envagilization project so they can take care of it.
