I'm not sure when it happen but since Foxfire 3.5.3 my Megaupload Time attack 0.2.8.1 doesn't work anymore. Every time I load a megaupload page and put in the code it just refreshes the page with a new code to put in and it just keep doing this. Without proceeding to complete the download. I've had to use my internet explorer to complete this task. So can you up date this add on also make it english I think it's spanish right now for some reason?
