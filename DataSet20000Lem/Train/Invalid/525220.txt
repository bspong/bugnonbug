Build Identifier: 3.5 but it began with 3.3 I think

Secunia's PSI work fine, but when I get an email saying saying something ha changed, like a new edition of Firefox (which for some reason doe not notify me a it is supposed to - of new builds), and I go to Secunia.com, a soon a I click on the link for online scanner, Firefox shuts down completely. When I reboot it, I have an error message saying "this is embarrassing but" and Firefox cannot reload previous tabs, I have to start a new session. I've disable all addon's but CoolIris and Forecast Fox, and the problem remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.either click a link in a secunia notice or go there from my bookmark
2.click online scanner
3. Firefox crash - every time.
Actual Results:
Steps 1 to 3 describe it perfectly.

Expected Results:
Firefox crashes, i reboot and have an error message saying "this is embarassing but Firefox can't reload your tabs".

Just run the online scanner for outdated programs.
