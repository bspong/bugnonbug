I use a dark grey theme in Kubuntu (dark backgrounds, light text). The background of both the location bar and the search bar are both dark. But the text that appears when hovering a link is always black (therefore almost impossible to read). The same for the name of the search engine, if I don't fill anything in. E.g. "Google" is shown in black on dark grey.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set a dark background for location and search bar.
2. Check the _default_ text in the search bar.
3. Navigate to any page and hover a link. Check the text that appears in the location bar.
Actual Results:
The text is black in both instances.

Expected Results:
The text should be light grey, obeying the theme in KDE.
