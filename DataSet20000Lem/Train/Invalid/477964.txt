thier is another one.. and that is .. i use freedownload manager a my download manager , recenltly when i open this website www.tictacvid.com sometimes it give an error : in which a file of freedownload manager namely : "components.dll" ha been corrupted or ha a bad image.. or something like that.. and ask u to install freedownload manager again..
