When switching to Minefield using the taskbar, a new window is opened instead of switching to an existing window or popping up a list of existing windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. With a default configuration, ensure that one window is open in Minefield.
2. Locate the Minefield icon in the running application area of the taskbar and activate it with enter or left mouse click.
Actual Results:
A new window is opened, a if one had selected File -> New Window in the browser.

Expected Results:
The previously opened single Minefield window (in step 1) should have become the foreground window. No new window should be opened.

This work correctly in Firefox 3.6 builds. It used to work in Minefield a well. I suspect it broke around the time that support wa added for Windows 7 jump lists, but am not certain of this.

If this is intentional, there should be a way to disable it (if there isn't already).
