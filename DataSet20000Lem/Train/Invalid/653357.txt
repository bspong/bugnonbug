If I need to save something from a Facebook chat, or I simply prefer logging the chat I have, copying the chat on Windows XP differs from Windows 7.

This behavior is the same with CTRL+C and with Right-click, Copy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into Facebook on a Windows 7 and Windows XP machine.
2. Have a Facebook IM conversation with someone.
3. Highlight the conversation and paste it into Notepad, WordPad, or another simple text editor on both Windows XP and Windows 7.

Actual Results:
Windows XP actually copy more than Windows 7 and, arguably, what it is supposed to copy.

Expected Results:
The pasted content should be the same on both operating systems.
