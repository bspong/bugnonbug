Firefox is loosing a cs declaration. It is requiring a semicolon after the last declaration in an imported file, This only happens in the included file from another cs file, via an import. A missing semicolon in the first file work fine.

The w3c grammar for a ruleset ha the semicolon a not needed following a declaration. It is only needed in a declaration when it follows another declaration.
http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/grammar.html
ruleset
: selector [ COMMA S* selector ]*
LBRACE S* declaration [ ';' S* declaration ]* '}' S*

declaration
: property ':' S* expr prio?
| /* empty */

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. There are 3 file needed to reproduce the problem.
I have included them below.
The main html page,
the first cs file pulled in by the link tag,
the second imported cs file.
3. Save the three file that are below.
4. Open the HTML page, notice that the last line is visible.
5. Change the imported cs file by adding a semicolon after the the last declaration.
6. Redisplay the files, notice that it now works, and the font is very small.
Look in Firebug at the cs ruleset, you will see that it is missing the last declaration "font-size:3px" when the semicolon is missing.

Actual Results:
Firefox is loosing the last declaration.

Expected Results:
All the cs declaration should be recognized.
