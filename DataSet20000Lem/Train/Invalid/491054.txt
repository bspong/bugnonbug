Unable to access youtube file or to open PDF files. Mozilla refers u to the Adobe website to download the appropriate version of Acrobat reader and Flash Player. When attempting to download these file the Adobe website advises that the our platform (Intel 64-bit processor) is not supported and that we need to run Firefox (and also Thunderbird we presume) in 32-bit mode.

How do we do this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access a 'youtube' or PDF file.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
'youtube' file doe not open.
PDF file doe not open.


Querying the Adobe website indicates to u that there is no plan in the immediate future to create a 64-bit compatible version of these two plug-ins. Why I connot imagine. Both Intel and AMD are producing 64-bit processors.

The computer's configuration is pretty much basic Windows XP(Home) with System Commander in charge of the boot procedure.

Thanks for any help you can give u with this problem.
