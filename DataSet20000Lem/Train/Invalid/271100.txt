It's possible to edit existing Live Bookmarks but not to add them manually. This
is inconsequent:

If the user want to add one manually (which is not linked within a HTML-file),
he ha to add another Live Bookmark and than change Feed Location in the properties.

This is more a bug than a missing feature.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:


Actual Results:
Add a button "New Live Bookmark..." to the Bookmarks Manager (like the already
existing button "New Bookmark...".

Expected Results:
It should be possible to add Feeds manually like it is already possible zo
