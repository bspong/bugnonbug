Addresses in the location bar are a moving target
Since the location bar changes, it's now tough to click a specific letter in the URL. If I enter "weird.com" instead of "wired.com", the 'e' is now a moving target.

1. Look at the location bar, see "www.weird.com" separated from the path.
2. Move the mouse towards the 'e'.

Expected results: It doesn't move.
Actual results: It moves.
