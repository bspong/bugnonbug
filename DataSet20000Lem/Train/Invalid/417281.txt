Have searched bugzilla for this and did not find it. It this is a Dupe, I'm sorry. I would guess this ha been reported many times, but I don't see it. If you go to http://search.yahoo.com/dir the "Yahoo Search" logo doe not display. If you click the other link on that page like "Images" or "Local" the logo is also missing. The only page the work is "Web" because it ha a different logo setup. I am using nightly Minefield but so I thought it might be a trunk issue, but I tested it on 3.0 Beta 2 with the same result. So, I decided to try it on 2.0.0.12 and STILL got the same result! The page work fine on IE 6.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://search.yahoo.com/dir

Logo Was Missing.

Expected Results:
Logo Should Be There.
