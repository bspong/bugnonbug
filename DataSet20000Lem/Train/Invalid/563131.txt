Nightly tool can't override compatibility issue of addons due to new Addon Manager

I recently thought to re install latest nigthly , in fact a clean fresh install. Now , i want to run stylish etc addons , but Nightly tester tool won't help for the new addon manager doesnt have "Over ride compatibility" button...

I hope you can understand

Reproducible: Always
