Long Javascript line cause Firefox to GET the page a second time

The page is created via php, and the page sent to Firefox ha a long line of Javascript code (approx. 1500 characters). The line itself is an array declaration on the order of:

coupon = new Array(new Array(434, "Jenny's Cappuccino Drink Club Dec '07", "https://www.softcardsystems.com/storefront/images/uploaded/cappuccino club exp 071231_1.jpg", "2007-12-01 00:00:00", "2007-12-31 00:00:00", "2008-01-01 00:00:00", "202"),
new Array(435, "Jenny's 1/2-price Fountain Drink Dec '07",
...
and so on, but a one line (the example above ha newlines interspersed).

My server code, a well a the server logs, see that another GET is generated from the browser to the page. The first one is generated from a preceding page, this second one is generated from the target page. For example: coupon_edit.php generates a "GET coupon_supercede.php" (expected), which generates a "GET coupon_supercede.php" (unexpected). The resulting page ha the long line, and it seems to work correctly. Still, the second GET is disturbing.

After interspersing newline char in the long Javascript line to break it up, Firefox no longer generates the second GET (expected behavior).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Generate a long (1500+ characters) Javascript line, with a newline only at the end of the declaration. Mine wa a long Array object declaration, containing nested Array declarations.
2. GET that page.
3. That should do it.
Actual Results:
Firefox generates a second GET for the same page.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have rendered the page without a second GET.

Breaking the line up (with \n) fixed the problem...Firefox no longer issued the second GET.
