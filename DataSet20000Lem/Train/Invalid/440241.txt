I have a slimslat website stats logger, I used the new Firefox 3 and viewed the website. The visit wa not logged a "Viewed using Firefox 3", but Firefox "2.0.0.14". I clicked "Help -> About Mozilla Firefox". Though "Version 3.0" is displayed at the beginning, at the end it is displayed a "Firefox/2.0.0.14".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have Slimstat installed in your website. (http://wettone.com/code/slimstat#)
2.Hit your website using Firefox 3.

Actual Results:
The browser for the hit is taken a "Firefox 2.0.0.14" and not "Firefox 3". That is what is displayed in slimstat.

Expected Results:
It should have been logged a "Firefox 3"

I think changing the version in the bottom of "Help -> About Firefox" will help.
