The function to "open in tabs" work fine in the new Firebird browser, but when
I install the tab browser extension that function stop working. I have not
gotten it to work at all and I have used a completely clean installation of
Firebird to test it on. It just dosn't seem to work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firebird on a clean Win XP (or win2000) machine
2. Choose to install the tab browser extension
3. Restart browser
4. Move "Mozilla Firebird & Mozilla Information" folder into the "Bookmarks
Toolbar folder" using the bookmark manager
5. From the Bookmarks toolbar choose the "Mozilla Firebird..." folder and choose
open in tabs.

Actual Results:
Absolutely not a thing.

Expected Results:
Opend 6 new tab and loded the corresponding pages.

I classify this bug a normal. For me personally it is crucial for an upgrade.
