Tested with Firefox 2.0.0.4 and Greasemonkey 0.7.20070607.0
Problem exists in prior version a well.

With Greasemonkey installed a restored session will have the order of all but the first two window reversed.
Closing Firefox and reopening will reverse the order again, thus returning to the original order.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable session restore in Firefox
2. Install Greasemonkey add-on
3. Open several window (at least four)
4. Use File>Exit to close Firefox
5. Reopen Firefox, the order of all but the first two window will be reverse.
Actual Results:
The order of all window in a session restore, except the first two, will be reversed upon starting Firefox if Greasemonkey is installed.

Expected Results:
Windows should retain their original order.

This ha been reproduced on a test machine with WinXP SP2 and all security updates.
No Firefox profile existed before testing.
Enabling session restore and installing Greasemonkey were the only change over the stock install.
Removing Greasemonkey will allow session restore to preserve order correctly again.
