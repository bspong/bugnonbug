Often, when a new point release, especially a new beta, pre, etc. release come out, extension are automatically disabled, or new extension can't be installed until they are upgraded to the latest point release of Firefox.

This force to the user to choose between the latest release of the browser, or not being able to use extensions.

It would be very useful to have a UI way to let the user override the maxVersion setting in the extension.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade the browser to a recent build.
2. Notice how extension are disabled automatically.
Actual Results:
Extensions are disabled with no possibility for the user to tell the browser to keep the extension anyway.

Expected Results:
The extension installer should ask if the (seemingly) incompatible extension should be installed anyway.
