when you use window.location="http://google.com"; within an extension where your code is loaded into chrome://browser/content/browser.xul a an overlay, it replaces ALL of the browser, including all of the bar EXCEPT the title bar with http://google.com, i haven't tested this with other url but i would imagine it would do the same

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create an extension that ha an overlay on chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
2.in the onload or the onclick of a button (probably anywhere would work) put window.location="http://google.com";
3.load firefox with the extension
