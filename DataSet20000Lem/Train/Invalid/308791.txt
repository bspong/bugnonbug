[Mac] Toolbar of disk image window hidden in recent Deer Park nightlies
Not sure if I should have assigned the component a "Installer" or "Build
Config". Anyway...

In recent nightlies, when you download and mount the disk image for Deer Park,
the disk image window display no toolbar. Up until that point, the toolbar had
always been shown by default.

Just to be clear, I'm talking about the OS X window toolbar, and NOT the browser
toolbar :)

The toolbar is obviously very handy to be present by default, a the first
action one want to do is drag their new browser application to the Applications
folder icon on said toolbar.

Of course it's quite simple to go up to the View menu and select "Show Toolbar",
so this is hardly a critical issue. But it'd be nice to have it back the way it
was. :)

I can't be specific in which nightly dmg this changed without downloading a heap
of old dmg files, but I'm pretty sure it started at the same time that they
added the agreement/disclaimer thing that pop up when you mount the disk image.

Cheers
