Any web page any where, I go to print, error message saying "Before you perform printer related task a printer must be installed. Do you want to install a printer now?" I click yes "Operation could not be completed. The print spooler service is not running"

I have 2 printer installed a well a pdf. I can print normally outside firefox. I never had this problem with earlier version of firefox. i have rebooted and it made no difference. i am running the latest version of comodo firwall and firefox is not blocked from any activity, although some activity have an "ask" before executing. this should not effect printing
