Typo: Firefox bookmark toolbar still say "Firebird Help"
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

This is a typographical thing, not a software bug. The browser name ha changed
to Firefox, but the help link in the bookmark toolbar still say "Mozilla
Firebird Help." If copy-editing stuff should be reported in some other way,
please let me know. Thanks.
