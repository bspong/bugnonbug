manage folder usability interacts poorly with new sidebar
The manage folder context menu item open that folder in the bookmark manager
with no way to get up to it's containing folder (or the root folder). The
sidebar doesn't take note of this and offer the root folder which is quite
confusing for user who think that if we display the root folder in the sidebar,
that they should be able to get at it in the main pane.

Tested with 7/21 branch window build on XP
