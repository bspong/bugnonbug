Performing keyword search cause FF to hang [caused by XUL/Migemo]
Created attachment 372953
Sample taken during the hang

For the past month or so doing keyword search in the FF address bar cause FF to beachball and hang hard, and the only way to break out of it is to force-quit the application.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a keyword search (google is a good example- navigate to google.com, right-click on the search field and create a keyword search. I use "?" a my google keyword trigger.)
2. Try typing a keyword search - using the above example, if I type "? this is a test keyword search in firefox" it eventually hang the browser (see attached sample).
