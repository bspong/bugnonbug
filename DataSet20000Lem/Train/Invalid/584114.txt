If you open the setting window of firefox to configure homepage and stuff like that, that window isn'T resizable.
Seems like under linux it work fine but under Windows it doe not.
The only thing you can do under Windows is maximizing the complete setting window which is good but not a usefull a resizing the setting window.


Tested also on an empty fresh profile. It is no issue, just bad coded. :P

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open setting window
2. Try resizing it by drap&drop on one side, which isn't possible
3.
Actual Results:
Nothing, that's the point
