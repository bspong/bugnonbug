If i upload file trough standard file upload dialog ( <input type='file'> control ) to webserver, firefox dont close handle to file ( need CloseHandle(hFile) ). You can watch it trough ProcessExplorer ( http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx ) - just upload file to webserver, run ProcessExplorer and you will see (use 'Ctrl + F' in ProcessExplorer) - handle on file is not closed. You cant even delete uploaded file until close FireFox.
