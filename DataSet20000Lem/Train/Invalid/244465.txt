Hi All,

This page:

http://www.xpertss.com/cgi-bin/WebX?9@232.wZhga7FlfNA.3@.ee6cd17

is freezing up my browser. It is the "add topic" button of the Word Pro "How do
I" discussion area. The form pop up to add the topic and freezes. My CPU
usage then jump to 100%

You will need to sign up for an account at http://www.xpertss.com to test this.
They are safe. They are a very nice tech support form for Lotus' Smart Suite.
And, I have used their service for year without a problem. Posted a lot
with the combined Mozilla a well.

Please forgive me for posting this a "Critical" but the defination doe
say "Crashes or hangs". I wa able to make my post with that "other"
broswer. :'(

Many thanks,
--Tony
