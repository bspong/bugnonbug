User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
Build ID: 20110902133214

Steps to reproduce:

1. Choose to be in private mode or to never remember the history
2. Open firebug on any page
3. Reload the page


Actual results:

Firebug is disabled when the page is reloaded.


Expected results:

Firebug should be stay enabled?!?
I use the option to never remember the history because I want that all the data are deleted when I close the browser, which ha nothing to do with the reload/refresh of a page.
I just want to see which request are sent when a page is loaded but a soon a I refresh the page firebug is disabled, which is really annoying.
