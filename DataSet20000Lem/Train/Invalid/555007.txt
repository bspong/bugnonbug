In Linux the desktop shortcut (to a folder) (called "Link to Location (URL)" in distros that use KDE desktop environment and "(place) launcher" in distros that use GNOME), though work well in the operative system ((double) clicking on them open Konqueror or Nautilus with the route a the target folder of the shortcut), have this problem in Firefox:
+ when one is on a web page and click on a "Browse..." button a file system browser window opens. If one then click on Desktop and then on the shortcut, instead of forwarding to the target folder, the file system browser window closes, leaving a the route the one of the shortcut (instead of the target folder of that shortcut).

(There is no problem in Firefox under Windows).

Reproducible: Always
