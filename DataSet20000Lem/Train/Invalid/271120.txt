Mozilla Firefox 1.0 cannot load any page - "mozilla.org could not be found"
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier:

Have used Mozilla 0.9 without problem and just upgraded to 1.0. Now,
unfortunately, nothing works. No page will open, even the homepage,
mozilla.org, google.com, yahoo.com, etc. This automatically lost 0.9 for me
a well.
Have uninstalled, re-downloaded, and reinstalled several times, all to no
avail. Rest of computer function appear normal at this time. Don't want to
return to IE, but what can I do next?
Loved 0.9, sorry I got mixed up in 1.0. Keep up the good work, waiting to
hear,
Larry

Hope that's clear. Or call me at 301 270 3145 if you want.

I could not find a similar problem listed on the existing reports, but many of
those are more technical than I am.

Many thanks for all the good Mozilla work.
