This site ceased asking the required security question approximately 4 day ago before allowing access to account. Customers are allowed to login with no security question being asked and a correct security answer being given before access is granted. When testing this same site on the Safari browser, the security question are asked and only when the correct security answer is given is the account access granted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit link and enter account number, then password.
2. Account access is immediately granted with no security question being asked awaiting an answer.
Actual Results:
Account access is immediately granted with no security question being asked awaiting an answer.

Expected Results:
A series of security question that the account holder ha created should be randomly asked and the site must then await the proper answer before access is granted.
