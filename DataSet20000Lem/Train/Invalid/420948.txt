saved password not migrated
Saved password are not migrated from IE7 using Fx3b4rc1 on Vista.

STR:
1. Go to bugzilla.mozilla.org on IE7 and enter your bugzilla credential
2. Opt to save your password for that site
3. Run the latest Fx3b4 candidate and go to the File menu and select to Import everything from Internet Explorer

Expected: If you go to the Security preference in Fx3b4 and click on on Show Passwords, you should see an entry for bugzilla after you import your data from IE.

Actual: There are no entry in the saved password preferences, because they are not imported from IE.
