In the example URL, there are two frames, left and right. The link on the left
page look like this:

<a href="left2.html" onClick="loadright()">new</a>

Where loadright() is a function that open a new page in the right frame. The
href link here should at the same time open left2.html in the left frame, but it
doesn't. When there is an onClick function, only that is called, and href is
ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://tomas.nocrew.org/moztest/
2. Click on the link "new" in the left frame.

Actual Results:
Right frame changes, but left frame doesn't.

Expected Results:
Left frame should also change, with left2.html.
