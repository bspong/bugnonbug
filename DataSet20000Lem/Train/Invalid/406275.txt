While attempting to use Firefox I found that all of the favorite from IE were not available. After attempting to update the bookmark I installed the latest version of Foxfire. I followed the instruction to update the bookmark list, first exporting from IE the importing into Foxfire. Did I do something wrong or is there a glitch in Foxfire?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.export IE favorite into HTML file in document folder
2.import into Foxfire identifying correct file
3.Check bookmark for complete list
Actual Results:
some of the item are in the bookmarks. I did not see any change in the list of bookmark at any point in the attempt to update

Expected Results:
All the favorite from IE would be in Foxfire Bookmarks
