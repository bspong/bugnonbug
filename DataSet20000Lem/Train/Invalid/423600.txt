mplayer starts, but fails to launch flash

Possible javascript or mime-dispatching problem for FF or mplayer

This problem ha _only_been seen on the layersmagazine.com site, and seems to happpen on all (many, anyways) of their flv videos.

The browser show the embedded mplayer plugin. Mplayer report the sequence buffering, playing, connecting, stopped without launching the flash plugin.

==> However, tight-clicking in mplayer, choosing 'copy url', and pasting the url into the location bar *works*.

My speculation is that this site is using unusual javascript which is unexpected by firefox and/or mplayer. I suppose it could also be specific to Linux Mint.


Linux Mint: "Darnya"
kernel 2.6.22-14-generic
mplayer Version: 2:1.0~rc1-0ubuntu13.1
flash Version: 9.0.48.0.2+really0ubuntu12.2

Although this may be considered to have a workaround, I thought you might like to see this repeatable example. Perhaps it's a site javascript error, or just an unusual javascript construction. With only a few tests, it wa found to work on window and some fedora and ubuntu.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any flash video at layersmagazine.com
2.
3.
Actual Results:
see detail

Expected Results:
should launch flashplugin

see details: pasting url reported by mplayer works!
The url seems to be constructed strangely in the site javascript. Mplayer figure out the correct url, but doe not launch flash.
