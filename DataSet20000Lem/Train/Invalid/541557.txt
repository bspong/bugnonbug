Tab Separation Feature Shows Apparent Debugging Message When Tab Is Dragged Into A Content Area [caused by Split Browser]

The feature that allows tab to separate from their original browser window seems to have a debugging message enabled for when a tab is dropped onto the conent area. The message produced is 'TypeError: dt.getData("application/x-moz-tabbrowser-tab").linkedBrowser is undefined'.

This is not reproducible when it is dropped outside the browser window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup: Open a new tab.
2. Reproduce: Drag newly created tab into the content area.

Actual Results:
The message mentioned in "Details" appears.

Expected Results:
The message should have been suppressed, a the separation still occurred.

I wa running Tab Mix Plus at the time. I will post a message when I attempt to reproduce with it disabled.
