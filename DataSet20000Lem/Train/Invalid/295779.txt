I have RealPlayer 10 installed. I go to the Real Radio page
<http://radio.real.com/?rnd=1117249457557&has-player=false> and for some reason
I can't sign in using Firefox 1.04 for Mac. Thus I am prevented from accessing
the premium content I've subscribed to. I don't recall ever having this problem
with Firefox for Mac before. Safari ha no problem with it. My PC using Forefox
1.04 ha none either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Subscribe to RealRadio
2.Go to http://radio.real.com/
3.Try to sign in


Actual Results:
A new browser window open at the same page, still saying "Hello, Guest"

Expected Results:
A new browser window open at the same page, saying (in my case) "Hello, Robert"
