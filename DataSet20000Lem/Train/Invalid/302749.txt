Feedview: feedview remove html and thus garbles certain blogposts
It seems that feedview remove HTML tag from the post (for one reason or
another) so the blogpost end up looking bad.

Here are 2 examples:

http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/atom.xml - roc's blog us lists, and since
they are stripped (look at the Gecko 1.9 post) it becomes unreadable.

http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/atom.xml - Asa's blog us <strong> and <p>,
and the feedview end up doing strange thing to the <p> tags.
