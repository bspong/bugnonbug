General gripe about the browser.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Firefox 0.9.2 is stable, fast, secure and allows tabbed browsing. But here are
my gripe a few week of use:

1. The small icon on the navigation toolbar and the toolbar itself can be
smaller. The bookmark toolbar and tab can be smaller also. Or give the user
the ability to increase/decrease these attributes.

2. There isn't a true fullscreen option. This is one of the reason why I
uninstalled Mozilla v1.1. Well, that and it wa slow compared to IE. IE ha an
auto-hide feature that allows you to view the entire web page without the URL
and navigation buttons. Try a fade in/out feature (like IE) or completely
ingenious feature to get rid of the navigation bar.

3. Sometimes the main menu doe not work or expand when Alt is pressed. That's
annoying.

4. You can only make it fullscreen by expanding the browser window first then
hitting F11. Make it so that all you have to do is hit F11 twice.

5. Sometimes Ctrl+Tab doesn't work when pressed.

6. I downloaded a theme on the mozilla website (w/o documentation), and i don't
know how to install it on firefox.

7. Why do you need to close the mozilla browser to end a file download?? Add
an option on the file download window to end it.

8. It is difficult to remember the last hypertext link that i clicked when i go
back to a webpage with a list of hypertext links. Try highlighting them like IE.

I'm using: Windows XP PRO SP1,
ePox 8rda+,
AMD athlon 1700+,
512mb ddr ram,
powercolor radeon 9500,
40GB 7200rpm western digital,
Firefox 0.9.2 a default browser,
default theme,
minimal install.

Some of these problem might just be my ignorance of browser option or repeated
on the mozilla website. But I got a good feel of the browser and looked through
the most-frequently-reported bugs. Looks like 0.9.3 is out. Sweet...

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 0.9.2 with minimal install and a similar rig.
2. Use the browser.
3. Use my list.
