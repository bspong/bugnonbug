Not possible to run Firefox 3.6 and Firefox 4 Beta 1 on the same machine
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8

When I install Firefox 4 beta 1 on the same machine a a machine running firefox 3.6, I am not able to have both seamlessly coexist. Specifically, if I run one, it is very difficult (or impossible) to run the other. I don't even care about them running at the same time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 4.0 Beta 1 on the same machine a one that ha the latest version of Firefox 3.6
2. During the installation process, choose Firefox 4.0 to be the default browser. (Or maybe you need to do this the first time Firefox 4.0 start if you are installing Firefox 4 using one Windows account and running it on a second.
3. Notice on the start menu there are now two Firefox icons, one for 3.6 and one for 4.0
4. Start 4.0, and, if necessary, select it to be the default browser
5. Shut down 4.0
6. Attempt to start Firefox 3.6
Actual Results:
Firefox 4.0 start even though Firefox 3.6 wa chosen. I even manually ran Firefox 3.6 by going to Start -> Run -> C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe. Even then firefox 4.0 start. There wa no way for me to start Firefox 3.6

Expected Results:
I should be able to run Firefox 3.6 when I select Firefox 3.6 icons.

If I do not set Firefox 4.0 a my default browser, then it's a little more tolerable. Just each time I start Firefox 3.6 after starting Firefox 4.0, it load up the dialog box you see whenever you upgrade Firefox 3.6 to the new patch level a it check compatibility of newer icons.

If you will not support Firefox 3.6 and 4.0 running on the same machine, then resolve this bug a WONTFIX. I personally want to be able to run both because I am blocked on bug 582257 and bug 582259 and certain addons that do not currently work on 4.0. It's nice to be able to switch back to 3.6 when I need to do any of those items.
