All GET with data attached (ie search box-both ff's box and on page, google, yahoo) doe not work in FF3, FF2, IE 7, but work in Safari

FF Safe Mode, DNS flush, and reboot doe not fix.

FIrebug show nothing. No timeout, just continually 'waiting for x.com'

POST and normal (w/o data) GETs work fine.



Reproducible: Always




SP3
All work normally when boot into safe mode
