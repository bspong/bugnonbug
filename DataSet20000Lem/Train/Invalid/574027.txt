Use HTTP header to submit a "scan in progress" message and prevent timeouts

If a virus scanner scan an HTML page, it ha to scan the whole page.
This is the reason why the page is sent from the server to a
AV proxy(where it is scanned) and the first byte of the page arrive at
the browser only after the scan ha completed.

This can cause timeouts in the browser.

An additional HTTP header that could be sent from the proxy to the
browser stating "AV-SCAN-IN-PROGRESS 10%"
would allow to send the proxy a "connection is still alive" message to
the browser and the browser would not have to abort. Maybe it would even
be possible to display a progress bar in the browser.

Reproducible: Always
