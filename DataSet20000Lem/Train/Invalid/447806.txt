Apparently, the select1 control can be displayed with or without a scroll bar, depending on the number of item in the control. With a large number of items, the scroll bar is displayed and the label of the item are partially obscured (i.e., not visible).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://biology.fresno.edu/test-select1.xhtml (an xforms document with a select1 control containing 21 items)
2. Click on the control to reveal the 'pull-down'
3. If the window geometry is 934x615 or less, the item label in the pull-down menu are obscured.
Actual Results:
Item label in the pull-down menu are obscured.

Expected Results:
Item label in the pull-down menu should be visible

It look like the scrollbar is being placed incorrectly (on top of the label instead of adjacent to them)

Hmmm... I have to confess to using PimpZilla 4.01...
