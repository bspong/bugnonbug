Firefox 1.5 B2 is missing default vendor and vendorSub useragent and app.version preference
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050921 Firefox/1.0.7 (mmoy CE 1.0.7 Release K8B-X36)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050921 Firefox/1.0.7 (mmoy CE 1.0.7 Release K8B-X36)

After Firefox 1.5 Beta 2 is installed, the following preference no longer exist
in the defaults/pref/firefox.js file:
app.version
app.extensions.version
general.useragent.vendor
general.useragent.vendorSub

This mean checking the navigator.vendor and navigator.vendorSub string via
javascript (or via preference) result in them being null. In prior version
navigator.vendor and navigator.vendorSub returned "Firefox" and the browser
version respectively.

In addition some extension check the app.version string to check what version
of Firefox they are running in. This is now null a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the location bar enter "javascript:alert(navigator.vendor)"
2. In the location bar enter "javascript:alert(navigator.vendorSub)"

Actual Results:
1. An empty alert box pop up.
2. An empty alert box pop up.

Expected Results:
1. An alert box with the word "Firefox" should pop up.
2. An alert box with "1.4.1" (for Firefox 1.5 B2) should pop up.
