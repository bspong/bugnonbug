Get rid of all us of feedIcon16.png and use page-livemarks.png instead
So, there seems to be some confusion between feedIcon16.png and page-livemarks.png. feedIcon16.png is only used on winstripe and pinstripe by the Applications panel of the preference window, but it should be using page-livemarks.png like everything else. gnomestripe is abusing feedIcon16.png in place where only page-livemarks.png should be used.
