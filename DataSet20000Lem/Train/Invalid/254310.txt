The menu on top of the page doesn't expand a it's supposed to.
Works with KHTML, so I guess the JS is not using any "IE-only" javascript.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.ig-phelsuma.de/
2. Try to get to the menu below "Home", "Phelsumen", etc.



Expected Results:
A menu with additional link should expand.
