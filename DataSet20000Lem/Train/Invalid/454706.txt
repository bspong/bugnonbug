when opining browser it act like it ha never been used before. It doesn't load the home page, it ha no bookmarks, it default to a Google Search engine and everything ha to be inputted every time and Passwords do not work. I have use Firefox for many year and I updated to 5.0 knowing that some of the program I ran before would not work, but this is a nightmare.

How do I get back to 3.0.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. The program worked an hour ago just fine.

2. On restarting the program the program fail a described above.

3. I do not know if it will work tomorrow.
Actual Results:
All I have to do is open the browser and it will aether work or not, there is no way of knowing which way it will go.

Expected Results:
Nothing work and I shut it down and go to IE, and that is not my first choice, but I have to use something.

Let me know how to get back to version 3.0 and I will be a happy camper until you get these bug out of the new software.
