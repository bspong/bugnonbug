The 'Add New Toolbar' function in Customize appears to be broken in Firefox 4: any custom toolbars created are not persistent. This also affect upgrade from previous Firefox (3.x at least) version where custom toolbars were already present and persistent: they disappear completely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Customize...
2. Add New Toolbar;
3. drag some icon to the new toolbar from Customize... list;
4. exit Firefox 4;
5. restart Firefox and note that (a) custom toolbar is not displayed and (b) custom toolbar is not even listed in Customize... context menu.
Actual Results:
I wasted half an hour recreating a heavily customized toolbar that wa lost in the upgrade from Firefox 3.6.x to Firefox 4; I assumed that the upgrade simply required a new paradigm (though it would have still been rude and high-handed not to WARN me of such). However, upon creating a new toolbar in Firefox 4, I exited and restarted the browser and the toolbar had completely disappeared, all trace of it. I duplicated this process repeatedly.

Expected Results:
Custom toolbars should be persistent, obviously... what else is the point of a toobar?
