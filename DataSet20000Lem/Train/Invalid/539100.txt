I have reduced memory usage effectively without compromising performance. Brought it down from 90+ MB to 68 MB. As a default, internet cache size should be 20 MB, rather than 50 MB. Also, browser.cache.memory.capacity set to 16384. Set "browser.cache.disk.capacity" to 20480. I now have 3 tab open, one myspace.com, one mozilla.com, and one this site. Memory usage initially wa 65 MB for all 3, but ha risin to 72 MB on idle. Why? Im not sure. could be a memory leak involved with Java and Flash. look into that too.
Additionally,

browser.sessionhistory.max_entries; 0
browser.sessionhistory.max_total_viewers;0
browser.sessionstore.interval;0
browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo;1
browser.sessionstore.max_windows_undo;1

all of these setting reduced memory usage, while reducing functionality. However, similar value to these give or take one or two, will reduce memory usage and please alot of users, without reducing performance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.test default setting using task manager
2.open about:config and apply my recommended setting
3.restart firefox and test again
Actual Results:
reduced memory usage


Reducing memory usage allows better multitasking.
