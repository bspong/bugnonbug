nsIBookmarksService::ResolveKeyword can make a better use of string
ResolveKeyword is currently declared a

string resolveKeyword(in wstring aName, out wstring aPostData)

What it return is actually in UTF-8 so that we'd better declare it a

AUTF8String resolveKeyword(in wstring aName, out AString aPostData)

With that, we can avoid ToNewUnicode and ToNewUTF8String in actual
implementations.Moreover, the string conversion across XPConnect will be done
properly instead of 'blind inflation'.
