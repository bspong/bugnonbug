Both sage-1.4.3 and sage-1.5a (the latest nightly) don't work with Firefox 3.6
beta 1.

Firefox 3.6 is already at the the Beta stage and should be release very soon.
The roadmap indicates the release THIS month (2009-11)
(https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Roadmap)

Sub-folders under the "Feed Folder" do not work:

- The folder don't have a folder icon. They look like bookmark and link
instead.

- The folder don't open and close when clicked.

- The icon in the sidebar (below the check- discover feed buttons) are gone.

Workaround: It is possible to open and close the folder by opening/closing
them in the bookmark sidebar.They remember the state from there. But, besides
being cumbersome and hard to find, that force the user to have the feed folder
always open in the bookmark view, which make the bookmark le usable
(crowded).

PS. Firefox 3.6 beta 1 can be downloaded here:

PPS. This might be a good opportunity to use a better default style in Sage. I
suggest using the one attached to bug 17649.


Reproducible: Always
