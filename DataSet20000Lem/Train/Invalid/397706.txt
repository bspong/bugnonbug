Situation: installed 3.0a9, had setup multiple profile so that 3.0 will not interfere with my 2.* Firefox profile.

1. Importing 2.0 bookmark into 3.0 bookmark left me with two(!) "Bookmark Toolbar Folder"s. That's bug. No two folder of the same name should be allowed.

2. Trying to copy-paste bookmark from freshly imported 2.0 bookmark showed that Copy and Cut action of pop-up menu (Wind0ze ha no visual feedback for ^C/^X so even le sure for keyboard shortcuts) do actually nothing. Really nothing. Cutting/copying bunch of bookmark from in a folder doe nothing. In pop-up menu, option "Paste" doesn't become active.

3. Drag'n'droppping selected bookmark doesn't work if selection contain folder (live bookmark are OK). Clicking on selection trying to drag it doesn't start drag'n'drop - but instead expands last selected directory.

End result: it is impossible to move bookmark folder from one folder to another.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox^WMinefield 3.0a9
2. Start Firefox 3.0 with -profileManager, create new profile and start it with the new profile.
3. Select Bookmarks > "Organize Bookmarks ..." > "Import and Backup" > "Import ..." > "From File ..." and locate your old Ff2.0 bookmark.html file.
Actual Results:
Watch all the bugz described above.

Expected Results:
Bookmarks behave a they should be.

I rate this a major, since I expect that not only me would try to use import/export for bookmarks.

With so much problems, it is better to disable the "feature" at all: leaving user to usual (but well known) copying of bookmarks.html from one profile to another.
