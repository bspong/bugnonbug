new item created above currently selected item, instead of below
This is a bug that's been filed before, but there wa an attempted fix. The
patch that'll be attached here is the bandaid that will ship with 1.0, that will
bring thing back to the previously broken state -- bookmark will be created
above the currently selected item, instead of below.

The reason for this is that we use the RDF Container InsertElementAt interface
here -- which, when given an index to insert at that's already occcupied, shift
the old element forward, instead of putting this item after it. This is a
bummer. I tried to do some magic where the index wa pre-incremented, but
InsertElementAt bail if you pas it an index that's greater than the number of
item in the container. In either case, we have to know the item's exact
index, so that we can undo. It's a huge pain in the ass.
