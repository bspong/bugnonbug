Sessionstore test use openDialog with undefined param
openDialog is supposed to be called with a chrome location. In most (all?) of the case we're using it, it's called with location, which is undefined. This isn't causing any problem that I know of, but we might a well fix it sometime. With all the orange in sessionstore, it's in our best interest to make the test a correct a possible.

We can use getBrowserURL() which just return "chrome://browser/content/browser.xul", that string literal, or use |openNewWindowWith()| http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/utilityOverlay.js#609. openWindowWith call openDialog with the right parameter and the same window option we're using anyway ("_blank", "chrome,all,dialog=no") and all we have to pas is a URL.
