Each tab doesn't independently track whether the location bar is in focus [Caused by LastTab 3.0t3.1]

In FF 3.6.16 and earlier, I would often interrupt drafting a comment inside a textarea, switch to a different tab, copy the url from the location bar, and switch back to paste it in.

With FF 3.6.17 and FF 4.x when I switch back to paste the URL in, focus is now in the location bar, not where I left it.

Was this a deliberate decision to make the location bar state more global? It seems to go against the spirit of the move to move tab above the toolbar. Now the location bar and search bar seem more clearly local to each tab. I think their behavior should follow that metaphor.

Pointers to past discussion appreciated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a tab with a textarea, put keyboard focus in the textarea.
2. Open a new tab. Put keyboard focus in the location bar.
3. Switch back to the old tab.

Actual Results:
Focus is no longer in the textarea but in the location bar.

Expected Results:
Focus should remain in the textarea.
