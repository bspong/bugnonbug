Some web-sites won't load, or are incomplete ;since I upgradeed to 1.5

Websites that I frequent don't work correctly since I've upgraded. I'm not sure if it's a Flashplayer (Macromedia) problem, or Java. One example is, I have Roadrunner and go to their site everyday. It won't load. All I can get is a blue screen and the task bar show fully loaded. If I use Firefox in Safe Mode, it will work. I've disabled extensions, changed theme and nothing worked. I'd like to go back to the other version(before the upgrade), where everything worked flawlessly.I'm being forced to go back to I.E., or run in Safemode. I'm sorry that I can't give more detailed specific's.

Reproducible: Always
