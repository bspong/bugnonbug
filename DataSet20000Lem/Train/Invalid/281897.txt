More button in Customize Toolbar dialog.
I like Firefox' minimalist approach to toolbars, and the default set of 5
button suite the need of more general users. It is the intermediate to
advanced user who actually use the Customize option in the toolbars. Thus the
dialog should contain some button that will cater to the more advanced users.
These button should not be in the default UI but should be easily added by
simple customization. I suggest the following buttons: Up, Snapback, Show/Hide
Images, Full Screen, Font Size, Print Preview, and JavaScript Console. Feel free
to suggest others. Some of the button I suggested may even be more useful than
some button which are already there, such a Cut, Copy and Paste.
