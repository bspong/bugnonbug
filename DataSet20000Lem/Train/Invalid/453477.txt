When closing a tab after loading a message in Gmail, a security warning dialog is displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Gmail (https) in a new tab
2. Load an email message
3. Close the tab
Actual Results:
You get the security warning dialog saying that

Expected Results:
The tab should close without the warning. Since the connection is being closed, there shouldn't be any content transmitted unencrypted and the dialog should not pop up

I don't have a regression range, but I'd say sometime in September. I'm super busy now, but I'll look into it when I get a chance.
