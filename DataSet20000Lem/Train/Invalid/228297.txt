Bookmaks schedule and notification won't work.
- Right-click on a bookmark item ("Bookmarks" menu).
- choose "propeties" menu item
- setting up a schedule (e.g. "check this location for update - every day -
from: midnight - to: 1AM - Every: 2 minutes.
- setting up a notification (i've tried all of them).

Nothing happens even if the content of web page ha changed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click on a bookmark item ("Bookmarks" menu).
2. choose "propeties" menu item
3. setting up a schedule (e.g. "check this location for update - every day -
from: midnight - to: 1AM - Every: 2 minutes.
4. setting up a notification (i've tried all of them).

Actual Results:
There is not any notification effect when the content of web page ha changed
when the set time is up.

Expected Results:
"Bing !" ;)
In fact, it should notify the change in the content of the choosen url.
