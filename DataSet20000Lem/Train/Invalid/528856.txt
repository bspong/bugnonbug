Copy Url & Close Firefox. Paste doe not work
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When copying the URL from the address bar, then closing the firefox window, then attempting to paste - whether it a text document or Internet Explorer, nothing happens - it is a if Firefox somehow cleared it entry from the clipboard.

I noticed this in Linux a while ago but thaught this wa standard behaviour because it happens with other apps too. I don't remeber having this problem with Firefox 2 on Windows though.

BTW This also applies to xp64.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
From Windows XP x86:
1. Open Firefox
2. Type http://www.mozilla.org in the address bar
3. Press enter (if you want)
4. Select all the text in the address bar and copy (ctrl+c)
5. Close Firefox
6. Create and open a text document from your Desktop (use the right-clic k context menu and navigate to "New" -> "Text Document")
7. Paste the copied text (ctrl+p)
Actual Results:
Nothing - the text copied earlier ha gone.

Expected Results:
The copied text successfully paste into the new text document.

Note that the copy and paste work OK a long a the Firefox browser ha not closed.

I've also tested this with multiple browser window open - all browser window have to be closed for the paste to fail.
