problem with viewing CSS

I have noticed that some CSS feature that are in standard specification and
which css-validator reckons a ok are not properly displayed in firefox. F.e a
attribute of xHTML can have width set in CSS according to W3C standard but it
is not recognized by firefox. You are all against not-so-standarded web pages,
which only internet explorer can display - and that's why not keeping strict to
standard is suprising. Except that, firefox is very good job.

Reproducible: Always
