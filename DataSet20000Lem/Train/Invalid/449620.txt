Bottom 20% of Firefox window is blank

When Yahoo main page (or any other pages) are accessed, there is a large blank area at the bottom of the screen. This area is occupying about 20% of the window. All the information that is usually displayed on the screen is there, but the blank area at the bottom SHOULD be used to show more of the display without having to scroll down. I can send a screen shot if it helps.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Pull up Firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:
All that need to be done is to click on Firefox. It doe it every time and I've rebooted several time to see if it corrected the problem (it DIDN'T).

Expected Results:
Same a when it first started (today - 8/7/08)

Used the ENTIRE window to display whatever website is being viewed.
