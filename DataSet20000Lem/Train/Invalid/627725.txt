As shown in the attached snapshot, in most flash animation I observe white rectangle instead of caption, text. This is visible on the "Le Monde" website for instance in this infography but also in most flash applet... I did not observe this behavior in Beta 8.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View a flash applet

3.



My Flash version is 10.1 r 102.
