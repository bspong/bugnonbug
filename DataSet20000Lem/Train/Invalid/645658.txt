permanent http redirect stuck in browser
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I've set up a new virtual host on my webserver but made a typo in the ServerName directive so when I accessed it I got served the default virtual host instead which is a permanent redirect to the main site.

The problem is that after fixing it the ServerName I still get redirected to the main site but only in Firefox where I experienced the redirect first. When I use another browser or wget I get the correct site. Also other people using Firefox get the correct site so it look like this initial permanent redirect is somehow stuck in my browser.

I tried shutting down Firefox, clearing the cache and starting it again but I still get redirected.

What can I do to get to the correct site?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site that permanently redirects you to somewhere else
2. Remove the redirect on the server side and serve a normal page instead
3. Visit the initial URL again
Actual Results:
I still get redirected to the new site

Expected Results:
I should not get redirected anymore but instead see the new page under the initial domain
