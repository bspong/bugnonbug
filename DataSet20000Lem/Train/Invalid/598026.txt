-install-global-extension seems to be broken (Firefox 3.6.8 & 3.6.10)

installing add-on with the command line switch "-install-global-extension" ha no effect - just a new instance of firefox is started

we are using this functionality since 2.x to install common add-on's (like language packs) - and we recognized this failure at least since version 3.6.8) - failure wa verified on Windowx XP SP3+ 32bit and Windows XP SP2+/Windows Server 2003r2 64bit

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download de.xpi from version matching language pack
2.{path}\firefox.exe -install-global-extension {path to xpi}\de.xpi
3.no effect - a new instance of firefox appears



We set severity to "major" since deployment of firefox is strongly handicapped if common add-on's can not be automatically deployed also
