I upgraded tonight to 1.5.0.2 at Firefox's prompting. Upon launch, I discovered that right-click no longer works! On a MacBook Pro, right click is achieved via holding down Ctrl while clicking or via plugging in an external mouse. Both way of right-clicking are broken. This worked just fine on version 1.5.0.1 and prior. Loss of right click is a total show stopper and a major regression. Right click is only disabled for thing within the viewport. I can still right click on the Navigation Toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the Universal Binary of firefox on a MacBook Pro
2. Attempt to right-click on anything within the viewport
3.

Actual Results:
Nothin happens

Expected Results:
A contextual menu should appear.

This bug wa not present before 1.5.0.2
