JPEGs not displayed and missing button

These are two pesky problem that have dogged Firefox from the start. #1 is that
JPEGs on, say, ebay aren't displayed (no probs with IE). #2 is that button are
hidden from display although do function, e.g. on Amazon's website (again no
probs with IR). Is it too much to hope that this'll be fixed in 1.0??

Actual Results:
As already described.
