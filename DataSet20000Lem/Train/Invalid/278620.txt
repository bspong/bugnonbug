Freeze when choosing download preferences/downloading after file association

Firefox freeze immediately (must be killed) when I try to download any file
after I associated .torrent file with a shell script "azureus". Strangely, it
worked fine until I restarted Firefox. Then every download stopped working.

Firefox doe also freeze immediately when I try to open the "downloads" tab in
preferences.

I'm filing this into Preferences because I believe it must be associated with
the file association.

I have very few file associations, and I doubt any of them are overlapping.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click file to start download (or "what should I do with this file" dialog);
no matter which file (except html, text and other which are handled by firefox
itself)

Actual Results:
Firefox freezes.


I've got the latest debian testing package of firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U;
Linux i686; nb-NO; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041128 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0-4))
