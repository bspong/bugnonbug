Don't want SESSION RESTORE thank you. If a website freeze and I have to reboot, FF insists on trying to restore and lock up again. It should ask "I can try to restore - would you like me to?", then I could say "NO - I just want a clean browser session".

I don't know why, (I've never seen this in older version of FF). But recently I've had a few lock-ups with one or several websites. This may be the website server, or maybe a temporary glitch with the ISP. However, if I reboot and try again later (or the next day), Firefox seems to think it ha a restore option for me, and automatically assumes that I want it. Well, I don't !! The result is that FF attempt to re-open 2 or 3 browser with maybe 10 active tabs, and at least one of the tab lock up and jam the PC. It should be very simple - if FF think it ha a session rstore capability, it should ask me and accept the fact that I'm going to say "NO - give me just one, fresh, new browser with just one tab. I don't want anything else. Please don't assume that I want anything else. I will tell you the URl of where I want to goto when I'm ready". Instead, it lock the PC and after a battle and rebooting maybe twice or three time it finally say that it is embarassed.
