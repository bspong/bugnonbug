While installing Phoenix I chose not to use it a default browser, but afterward
I changed my mind and clicked my way to Tools > Preferences > Set default
Browser, clicked it, and clicked OK-button.

Afterward I clicked on a link in my mailprogram, but still Internet Explorer wa
used. The I tried with another program, clicked a link and it opened in IE.

So I went back to the Tools > Preferences, clicked on Set Default Browser,
clicked OK and rebooted the computer. Still no changes.
