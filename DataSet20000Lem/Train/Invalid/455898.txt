unclear how to disable all three panel for all page

When I open a page I've never been to before, the Script panel is enabled. (That is, when I open the Console panel the Script line is bold and it doe _not_ say "disabled" in the rightmost column. The checkbox is unchecked.)

At this point, if I leave the checkbox unchecked, I can click on "Enable selected panel for www.whatever" and next time I go here Script is disabled. But if I visit a different web site the same thing happens - Script is enabled (bold).

How do I make it disabled for all pages, without suspending Firebug? Do we need to add something to Options that display the "meta" enabling/disabling of the Console, Script, and Net panels?
