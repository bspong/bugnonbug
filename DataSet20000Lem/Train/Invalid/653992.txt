While using 3.6.17, MAC OSX, and using the path "Firefox > Preferences > Advanced > General" there is NO BOX to check for Tracking Options. In the Firefox Main Page Security URL (http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/security/) you use a demo feature to show a tracking option under Advanced. I do not have this. I deleted FF and downloaded again, after installation still not there. The tracking option a described on the security page doe not exist.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.downloaded upgrade 3.6.17

2.deleted Firefox

3.downloaded new, clear version of FF 3.6.17

Actual Results:
this bug happens every time. the user function to track is not showing up in this version.

Expected Results:
I expect your FF to have all functionality that you say it will have!!

The software should have added the tracking feature to the Firefox>Preferences>Advanced>General page
