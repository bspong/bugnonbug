User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

Any one of the following cause the problem:
-select "new window" from file menu
-alt-home
-ctrl-n
-home button in title bar
-open firefox for the first time

these still seem to work correctly:
-select "new tab" from file menu
-ctrl-t

i am using firefox 5.0 on a Dell PC with 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise. Intel Core 2 Quad CPU, 2.66GHz, 4GB RAM, 160GB HD.


Actual results:

about 13 separate tab are opened. it seems it one separate tab for each of the last ~13 website accessed.


Expected results:

-select "new window" from file menu = a new window should open up with one tab
-alt-home = should navigate to home screen on current page
-ctrl-n = a new window should open up with one tab
-home button in title bar = should navigate to home screen on current page
-open firefox for the first time = a new window should open up with one tab
