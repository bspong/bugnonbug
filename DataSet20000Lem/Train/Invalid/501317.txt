After update of add-on problem with tab mix plus, no symbol of the most add-ons, no new tab (strg-t), session were not saved. When starting FF default page appears, new page could be opend (strg-n) and there new tab possible, but not in the first opened page.

Reproducible: Always

1. deinstalling FF, reinstalling, installing only tab mix plus
problem not solved
2. creating new profile (...\firefox -P), starting, installing tab mix plus
same problem
Actual Results:
After updating some add-on firefox start not a desired. Only deault page wa loaded and no new tab could be created. No symobls of tab mix plus, noscript on the screen or in the list of symbols.
Deinstalling Firefox (with user data), then installing and reinstalling tab mix plus, problem doe not disappear. Sometimes the configuration-page of tab mix plus can not be opened. Then I have to reboot the pc.
Creating a new profile and installing tab mix plus, problem already there

Expected Results:
Problem is already there, i.e. firefox start with default page, could not create new tab on the first page but open a new and there I can create new tabs. Althoug I have configured tab mix plus, no question about saving session or recreating session by restarting firefox

firefox start only with the default page.

On an other pc deinstalling of ieview help but on the above mentioned nothing helped.
