FireFox 3.5.1 ha developed two problem after I installed the last update of colorful tab addon:
1. If I leave the browser idle for a while, it hang up on resuming activity, requiring termination with window task manager.
2. On restarting it will will not be able to reload the tab open during the terminated session with a message "well this is embarrassing but ..."
For the time being it seems I have resolved the problem by uninstalling Colorful tab addon.


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Install the latest colorful tab addon
open 3 or four different url in so many tab
leave idle for, say, 30 minute
resume
close and restart firefox

Expected Results:
1. FireFox may freeze on resuming from idle state
AND
2. Tabs will show the reload problem with "well this is embarrassing but ..." message
