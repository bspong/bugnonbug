Before (Firefox 2.0) it wa possible to use Stylish and custom stylesheet which wa changing that behaviour but on Firefox 3 all input usercsses are ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set a dark theme on KDE (or possibly GNOME) with input element set on black
2. Run Firefox/Minefield 3.0
3. Go to any site with form
Actual Results:
In Minefield 3.0b5 and probably all other beta color for input (textarea, input, submit button etc.) are taken from system's settings. If someone (like me) have a dark theme, they are black (and web standard is that they should be white or similar). It's confusing because some webdesigners are setting dark color on those elements.

Expected Results:
1) Inputs should be using default colour no matter what are the system's setting OR/AND
2) UserCSS on input should be working again

Included picture of Bugzilla's form a a good example how doe it look. KDE 3.5.8, custom colours, Crystal theme, Minefield 3.0b5 trunk 03/22/08.
