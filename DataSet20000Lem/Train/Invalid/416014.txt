The background file for my website doe not show up on Mozilla. It doe on Netscape and Internet Explorer.

My website ha a turqouise colored pattern background defined under an HTML style command. The latest version of Internet Explorer and an earlier version of Netscape (7.1) both load the background properly when displaying the home page. (http://www.salrachele.com). Mozilla Firefox latest version doe not. I suspect it ha something to do with the way Mozilla interprets HTML code. Offending script is ...<style="background-image:url([file path])">...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
2. Call URL (http://www.salrachele.com)
3. Background image fails to load -- there is only a white background.
Actual Results:
No background image is displayed. Text and graphic load normally.

Expected Results:
A turquoise colored pattern background should appear behind the text and graphic on the home page (and all other page linked to the home page).

I have not tested this out on other computer - only on other browser (Netscape 7.1 and IE 7.x.

I uninstalled and re-installed Firefox (which reset the profile and build sequences). No effect.
