On Quitting, Firefox vanished from "applications", then Mail, Itunes, Safari, Iphoto, etc. preference coudn't be saved.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/85.8.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.8.1
Build Identifier:

After playing with Firefox for a few minute several times, it vanished. Only the .dmg could be
found in the trash. Then, my preference in many OS X 10.2.8 could not be 'remembered' by the
computer. Took it to Apple's Genius Bar, they ran a BatChmod to verify/change permissions.
Seemed to work. The Genius said that Firefox change permission to install itself, but then maybe
didn't change them back. I spent at least 8 hour rebuilding my Mail account 2 times, before I
gave up. I'm not going to reproduce the problem because it cost too much in wasted time. Please
make this work, I want to use Firefox!! Thanks.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Firefox for Mac with 10.2.8 G3 400Mhz
2.Run Firefox a few times, w/o adjusting prefs
3.Launch other Apple apps, like Itunes, Mail, Iphoto. That's what I recall doing.
Actual Results:
Didn't try to reproduce, but if I did what I wrote above, it might. Who know what the other
variable were...

Expected Results:
Repaired or recovered or 'reset to how they were' my permissions.

Email me for more clarification or system info, also a phone call might be worthy, but I know time
is expensive. Email for phone number if necessary.
