Binary wa not built to account for PA-RISC1 machine
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.8 under HP-UX 11.11

When trying to run the binary it get an error about running on incompatible hardware. This is symptomatic of forgetting to build with the approprate compiler optionto ensure protrable codding for both PA-RISC 1 and PA-RISC 2 machines. I cannot remember the exact option but it is readily availbe from the compiler man page. Please rebuild the TAR file with portable code so Firefox can run on the all hardware running HP-UX 11.11

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install binary and try to run it. Running from command line reveals the error.
2.
3.



Expected Results:
If compiled with protable code, Firefox should come up.
