The button with the star in the location bar (at the RHS of the address field) displaying a star doe nothing useful. In particular, no bookmark is added or removed, a I would expect from the tooltip.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the button with a star in the RHS of the address field
2. If a dialog appears, hit either button on this dialog
3.
Actual Results:
Nothing. Well, the star change color. But the bookmark remain the same.

Expected Results:
Because the tooltip say "Bookmark this page" I would expect a bookmark to be added. Or, when I choose Delete, the bookmark to be deleted. Moreover when it should remove a bookmark, I expect to be able to choose in which folder it will be added. Nothing of any of these thing actually happen.
