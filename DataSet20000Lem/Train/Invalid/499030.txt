With the latest version of Firefox (I couldn't remember since which version) on a new HP laptop (Windows Vista Home Premium with latest patches), download window doesn't pop up when clicking a link to download any type of file. After clicking, nothing happens. I have tried to check download option but still it is not solved. The only way to download and save the file is by right-clicking and choosing "Save File As" option. Unfortunately some website through Javascript disallow right-clicking.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open any website having link to any file type (.exe, .torrent, .zip, ...). Try to click the link to download a file.
Actual Results:
Clicking the link doesn't do anything.

Expected Results:
In normal situation, a Download window pop up asking the target location to save the file.

SOLUTION FOUND!

I made some test on Options and finally on Add-Ons. I tried to disable some add-on one by one to see if there's any add-on causing the problem. I thought at first about add-on related to download management.

Finally I can confirm that this download problem is caused by DigitalPersona Extension 1.0.1.1 (in my case) supplied by fingerprint reader software! I believe this might happen to most of laptop with built-in fingerprint reader (DigitalPersona).

Laptop: HP Pavillion dv3655ee with built-in DigitalPersona fingerprint reader.
OS: Vista Home Premium SP2 (and latest updates).
Browser: Latest Firefox (3.0.11) with DigitalPersona Extension add-on (installed automatically, can be disabled, but cannot be uninstalled).
