weblogic java applet crash
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4
Build Identifier: firefox 3.6 beta 4 in english (windows xp 32 bits)

the left frameset of the BEA WebLogic console is a java applet which crash (only with this version of Firefox) and reopens the login form in a 2nd tab.
I've tried many time to reinstall the JVM, to empty my FF profile, but the only way to have the console work is to switch back to FF 3.5.
same bug with FF 3.6 beta 3.
java version is jdk1.6.0_16

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run weblogic console
2. go to http://localhost:7001/console/login/LoginForm.jsp and login
Actual Results:
then the page opens, the applet crash

Expected Results:
java applet launch and I can navigate in the weblogic server tree

sorry I can't send you the java console exception stack-trace, because I'm at work and I really need WebLogic to work. I've spend too much time in finding the origin of this bug, bug I can guaranty that this only happens with FF 3.6 (beta 3 and 4 tested).
