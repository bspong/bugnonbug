3. Some where along the way it must be causing something to happen that is causing the window opened to stop rendering properly. That is they become transparent or the information is distorted. Some part are rendered
properly, some part are not rendered at all and other part are just mixed up. Open any where from 0 to 18 window at some site and just save 0 to 30 link at each site.

thing then proceed normally. The same is true if both browser are stopped. On rare occasion both browser to be stopped to get the problem to go away.
