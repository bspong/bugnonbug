browser.ssl_override_behavior = 2 is not working for me.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9b3pre) Gecko/2008010413 Minefield/3.0b3pre

I observed that setting browser.ssl_override_behavior to 2 is not pre-fetching the URL and the certificate.
It give me the "Problem loading page" "Secure connection failed- Certificate is not trusted a it is self signed"

As per my understanding, when the option browser.ssl_override_behavior is set to 2, it shouldnt give any problem loading the page.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the browser.ssl_override_behavior = 2 and restart firefox.
2. Try to open any http site with a bad certificate e.g: "https://genes.med.virginia.edu/webdoc/EN/html/install_faq.html"
3. It say "Problem loading page"
4. Gives me an option to add it a and Exception (which I have to manually)

Setting the browser.ssl_override_behavior option to 2 should automatically load the page, but it is not doing so.

Actual Results:
Gives me an error page saying "problem loading page" even when browser.ssl_override_behavior is set to 2.

Expected Results:
It should redirect to the url without any user interaction
