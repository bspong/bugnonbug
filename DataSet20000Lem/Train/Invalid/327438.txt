When Firefox ha a image from a visited site stored in it disk cache and this image is updated on the server, Firefox doe not detect it (I've been waiting for several weeks). Internet Explorer 6 dected it immediately. Opera ha no problem either. In Firefox, I've been waiting for week for the image to change. In vain. The change is still undetected.

The only way to work around that in FF is to hit F5. Firefox should check the timestamp of a cached image at least once per session.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Updated image is not detected (the cached version wa used instead).
