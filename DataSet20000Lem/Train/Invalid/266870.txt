I recently downloaded & test the Firefox RC1 from:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.0rc1/Firefox%20Setup%20(1.0rc1,%20en-US).exe.
But despite the fact Firefox PR can sort, RC1 CAN'T sort the bookmark by name.

Sad but true; first Firefox lost Mozilla Suite's 'sort by ...' variation like:
URL,date... And now RC1 lost it completely letting u depend on extension only...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Choose Menu->Bookmarks->Manage Bookmarks...
2.On right side pane; right-click on a populated folder->choose 'Sort by name'
Actual Results:
Surprisingly nothing! The folder to be sorted by name remain 'unsorted' a is...

Expected Results:
The folder chosen should be sorted like it wa sorted in Firefox PR & others.
