repro:
Open FF
open Bookmarks Manager
select a random folder
go to the [Edit] menu and click [Set a Bookmarks Toolbar Folder]

result:
The content of the selected folder is now visable on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

further expected:
The selected folder to be renamed Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.
The new Bookmarks Toolbar Folder to show up at the top of the bookmark list.
The old Bookmarks Toolbar Folder to be moved from the top.
The old Bookmarks Toolbar Folder to be renamed.
