I ended Firefox through end task, and then opened it back up and chose to start a new session. I wanted to choose which tab to restore, so I went to History > Restore from last session ... but it said "Unable to read from file, this is unrecoverable" and I lost all my open tabs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. End Firefox through the task manager.
2. Open Firefox, but choose not to restore tabs.
3. Try to restore your tab through History> Restore from last session ...
Actual Results:
I get the error "Unable to read from file, this is unrecoverable"

Expected Results:
It should show a popup that asks me what tab I want to restore.
