in ebay at my message there are some select box at the bottom of the message list to choose which way the content marked ha to be handled. The Possibilities are to delete, copy, move or mark these messages. Since delete is only one option this work fine but all the others one have to select which way this action wanted to be done (in copy and move the dest dir have to be chosen in mark the kind of mark ha to be selected). These selctions work that way (normally) that to choose the appropriate option start the action without any further delay or additional doing (like clicking a start box). This doesn't work. To select any option doe nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to my message (with message in there)
2.mark any of these message to take any action on it.
3.select one of the option belonging to 'copy', 'move' or 'mark'
Actual Results:
No change

Expected Results:
chosen action to be done (like moving the message from one dir to another). In some case rewrite of whole page with changed content (if move to is chosen the message would disappear).

Boxes look a different way a in window version.
