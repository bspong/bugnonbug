When i click the icon in taskbar and open a new firefox window the bookmark bar even if is clecked to be viewable is empty (you have to un-check the option and check it again to show).

In a new window the back button is not function able a it should be, seems disabled and "squeezed" like it's wrongly placed or rendered.
