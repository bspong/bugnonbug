alert-service is not registered/launched on i386
desktop-notification (e.g. "download finished") is not thrown on 32-bit linux system (Fedora 15). It affect firefox only (official mozilla binary (7.0.1), latest trunk, package shipped by Fedora). Thunderbird work a expected.

nsAlertsService::nsAlertsService() is not even called on i386, I'm still investigating it.
