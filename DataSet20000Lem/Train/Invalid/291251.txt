Drag and drop of folder in bookmark cause lockup. Works for individual pages, but not folder or Live Bookmarks.

This is one of a couple of problem I've found with drag and drop.
Cannot drag and drop folder or LiveBookmarks in the bookmarks. When attempting
it with those in the personal bookmark toolbar, Firefox lock up instantly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a few bookmark in the personal bookmark toolbar including multiple
folder and pages.
2. Click and hold on a folder and attempt to drag it to another location on the
personal bookmark toolbar. (so to change the order of the bookmarks)
3. Firefox will lock up.

Actual Results:
All input to Firefox disabled.
No redraw of browser (when switching to another program and switching back to
the frozen Firefox).
Only solution is to force quit Firefox.

Expected Results:
The same functionality a when drag and dropping individual page bookmarks.

It is a minor bug, but because it lock up the entire browser, anything you were
doing in this or any other tab is lost. So it could potentially happen at a
critical time with a substancial amount of lost data.
