Every user of Firefox and Arovaxshield seems to have the same problem. Firefox is rewriting blocked cooky by Arovax in the Profile file of Firefox. This happens when "enable Firefox tracking cooky shield" is activated. This problem may be a serious one for a beginner or for anyone not really interested in computers. He'll end up with lot of useless junk that will slow down the computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Arovax
2. minimaze it in the systray
3. open and run Firefox

Actual Results:
After a few day any cleaner used will report no cooky but thre all will be in the Profile file

Expected Results:
The cooky should not have been rewritten

Of course there is a simple solution th this problem: "disabling"enable Firefox tracking cooky shield".


But it doe not satisfy me because we don't know what else the software may be doing and that the average user doe not know. So it may be a serious problem.

In one word Firefox should stop rewriting those blocked cookies.
