The addons manager like to open extraneous tabs. This is a idea on how to help reduce the number of new tab it opens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a blank tab in Firefox.
2. Navigate to a web site; it doe not matter which.
3. Open another blank tab.
4. Open yet another blank tab.
5. Use this third tab to navigate to a web site; again, it doe not matter which.
6. Open the Addons Manager.
Actual Results:
The addons manager open in a fourth tab, instead of the already open blank tab.

Expected Results:
If a blank tab exists anywhere in the current session, the addons manager should open itself inside that tab, instead of opening another new tab.
