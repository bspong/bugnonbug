I'm running Firefox 2.0 with Vista RC 1. Today I installed the following three update from Microsoft and after that Firefox would no longer work:

Definition Update 1.14.1736.7 for BETA Windows Defender (KB915597)
Definition Update for BETA Windows Mail Junk E-mail and Phishing Filter (KB925697) [October 2006]
Intel Corporation - display - Intel(R) 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics Controller

Upon restarting Firefox it said a previous version wa already running. Wouldn't work until I ran the uninstaller then reinstalled.


Sincerely,

Gordon Jones
