Pages not render correctly in OS/2 but are in WinXP (same release).

Page actually contains an image (jpg) that is not rendered in OS/2. Selecting
http://downloads.lexmark.com/cgi-perl/downloads.cgi?ccs=229:1:0:0:0:0 (Drivers
and Downloads) from the subject page lead to a page that is also missing the
image and ha no selectable items. WinXP doe not have the problem with the
same Firefox release.

Reproducible: Always
