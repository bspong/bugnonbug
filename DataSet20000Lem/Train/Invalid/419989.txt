About two nightly build ago, there ha been a problem with Vbulletin boards. Specifically it is drawing a dark edge along the bottom, and to the left of the reply box. Also the cursor is showing up to three times. I have to click the box again to get a normal cursor.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a vbulletin forum
2.Start a reply

Actual Results:
Cursor issue and dark edge in reply box on bottom and left hand side.

Expected Results:
No cursor problems, or dark edges.
