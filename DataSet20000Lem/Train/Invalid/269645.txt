Every time I log into slashdot, then try to quit firefox, firefox crash

It seems that everytime I login to a site, and then try to exit firefox, firefox
will crash upon exiting. I've managed to get the following backtrace from gdb.
This happens with my own compiled version of the 1.0 release source along with
the official mac version of firefox 1.0 that is available from the web site. The
talkback "agent" from the official version sent some "crash data" somewhere upon
that version crashing.
