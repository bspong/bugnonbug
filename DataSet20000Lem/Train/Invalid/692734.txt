:first-child didn't apply w/ another child block before
Created attachment 565461
test-case

I have a block with few child (different classes):
<div class="parent">
<div class="some-child">
Some child
</div>

<div class="target-child">
Should be red
</div>
</div>

And apply CSS a following:
.parent {
background:green;
}

.some-child {
background:yellow;
}

.target-child:first-child {
background:red;
}

.target-child still didn't have background.

I'll make demo http://jsfiddle.net/PKgJL/
