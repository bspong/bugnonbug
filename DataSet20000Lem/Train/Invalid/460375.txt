Quicktime plugin caused my CD Rom to stop working

I installed the quicktime plug in manually because Firefox would not install it. After I installed it, my CD ROM stopped working. When I went into Computer>Properties>Hardware, the little yellow exclamation point wa there showing there wa a problem with the driver. I did a roll back on Windows, which removed the Quicktime plug in and my CD Rom started working again.

I am sure this is really a Quicktime problem not a firefox program, but I wanted to report it to you since you guy are the computer genius and I'm just a computer nerd. THANKS!
