When I click the home icon to load the homepage tabs, I get all my open tab PLUS my homepage tabs, even though I ha originally set Overwite open tabs.
It happens at random.

I set the home page and then go to Tools, Options, Tabbed browsing, Features, and check Overwrite open tabs, all is well until sometime later when the computer ha been rebooted (I can't determine how many reboots before the problem occurs). When I go back and check my setting I find that the Overwite Open Tabs ha been unchecked.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set Tools, Options, Tabbed Browsing, Features, check Overwite Open Tabs
2.Set home page with 4 open tab
3.open one or two more tab then check HOME icon to reload the home page
Actual Results:
Randomly the Home Tabs would NOT Overwrite and the check wa no longer there.

Expected Results:
Only the home tab should load but I am sometimes finding that the home tab PLUS
the current open tab are loaded.
