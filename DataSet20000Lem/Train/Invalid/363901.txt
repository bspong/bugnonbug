Causes Windows to crash (Blue Screen)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

The problem usually happens after I have been web surfing for at least 30 minutes, and have several tab open. After I close all the tabs, thereby shutting down Firefox, Windows crash and give me a Blue Screen. Sometimes there is a 5-10 second delay from the time I close Firefox until Windows crashes; other times, Windows crash immediately after closing Firefox. This happens about 75 percent of the time. The other 25 percent of the time, everything work normally (that is, nothing crashes).

Prior to installing Firefox 2.0, I had no problem with Windows crashing. Firefox 1.5 seemed to work very well alongside Windows.

The only extension that I have installed are IE View Lite 1.2.5; NoScript 1.1.4.5.061206; and Print Image 0.4. I have no theme except the Firefox 2.0 default.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Web surf for at least 30 minutes, and have several tab open.
2. Close all the tab (shutting down Firefox)
3. Windows will crash (with Blue Screen) about 75 percent of the time

Actual Results:
The problem usually happens after I have been web surfing for at least 30 minutes, and have several tab open. After I close all the tabs, thereby shutting down Firefox, Windows crash and give me a Blue Screen. Sometimes there is a 5-10 second delay from the time I close Firefox until Windows crashes; other times, Windows crash immediately after closing Firefox. This happens about 75 percent of the time. The other 25 percent of the time, everything work normally (that is, nothing crashes).

Expected Results:
I expect Firefox to close without causing Windows to crash.
