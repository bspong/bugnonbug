86% cpu load when firefox is running

On FC7, running Firefox-2.0.0.14 (i386)
with 4 windows, and 16 total tabs.

I killed many tab before load factor went down
to a more reasonable level around 6%. Those tab contained
NO animations, or active (playing) videos, nor
active audios. So, now I am at 5 total tab with
load factor at 6% (which I still think is high, given
that I a not doing any searches, or refreshing any pages..
I saw many such filed bugs, and all of them are left at
status unconfirmed! That is BUNK!
My ide disk activity light remains almost constantly
on until I kill firefox. What the *&^%$ is it doing???
