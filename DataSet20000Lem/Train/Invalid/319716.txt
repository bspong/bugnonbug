I have to disable Nortons Internet Security - 2005 before I can open up Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have Nortons Internet Security 2005 running

2.Click on Firefox to launch

Actual Results:
After clicking to launch browser, the browser screen appears with just the Firefox logo on the top and the home page never downloads. No error message

Expected Results:
launch Firefox browser.

Opening the browser is not a problem at all after I disable the Security program. I could not find anywhere in the FAQ's about how to configure the firewall to allow opening the browser.
