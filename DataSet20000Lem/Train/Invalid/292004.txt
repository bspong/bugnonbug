When I start up firefox, Firefox will open, but then freeze and doesnt load
the homepage. (Wich is the firefox google page.) It doe show the title of the
page in the title bar though. Rolling over button will not show
their "rollover status" however I have the googlebar installed and if I click
the "googlebar options" button, the googlebar option box doe come up. I
cannot type url in the addresse bar. if I press ctrl+T to open a new tab, and
close firefox, (even though it frozen) it tell me I am about to close 2
tabs. (like it should)

I recently updated to 1.0.3 and updated googlebar too. although I had problem
with googlebar and had to uninstall it then reinstall it.
