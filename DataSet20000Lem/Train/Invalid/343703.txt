Although the default theme show a disabled state in it icon when the row of scrollable tab reach the far left end, the disabled condition is not passed to where a third-party theme can make use of it.

When one us DOMi to inspect the scrollbuttons when they are in a disabled state, the right scrollbutton show disabled=true when one inspects it in a new window. However, when the left scrollbutton is inspected in a new window while it is in a disabled state, the disabled condition is not displayed.

Although the default theme show a disabled left arrow, when the left scrollbutton is inspected in a new window, no disabled state is present.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build a third-party theme with the current default scrollbox.css file
2. Install it in Firefox.
3. With Firefox open, make enough tab to require scrollbuttons.

Actual Results:
The left scrollbutton doe not show a disabled state.
The right scrollbutton doe show a disabled state.

Expected Results:
Both scrollbuttons should show a disabled state.

When scrollbox.css is transplanted unchanged from the default theme to a third party theme the disabled state doe not appear.

Even though the left and right code are identical except for filenames, the right scrollbutton show a disabled state where the left scrollbutton doe not.

The visual appearance is reflected in the code apparent in DOMi.
