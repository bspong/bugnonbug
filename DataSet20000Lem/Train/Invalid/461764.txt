I wa trying to add a new bookmark to the bookmark toolbar by right-clicking on it and selecting "Add". This is the first time I have tried to add a new one since the update to 3.0.3. When I do this, the option window never pop up, and the app immediately freezes. I let it go for 10 minutes, but it showed no sign of recovering. I killed the process and restarted. Was able to repeat the step and get the same result 4 times. Have not tried on a separate PC yet to determine if this ha to do with my particular setup on this laptop, or if it is a problem on all 3.0.3 installs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open browser
2.Right-click ANYWHERE in bookmark toolbar
3.Watch a program hang indefinitely.
Actual Results:
Program freezes, doe not recover.

Expected Results:
Open an option window with choice of adding or editing link in the toolbar, opening link in new tab/window, etc.

Using default theme, Foxmarks (2.1.0.12), Firefox Showcase (0.9.4.9), IE Tab (1.5.20080823) and WeatherBug (2.0.0.4)
