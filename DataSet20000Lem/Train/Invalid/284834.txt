when attaching an event listener that contains a function call making use of the
event object, the event object doe not appear to be recognized. See example below:

myTestCase = document.getElementById('testCase');
myTestCase.addEventListener('click',function(){alertMyEvent(event)},false);

however, if I include the onClick event in the html object it appears to work
correctly, a seen here:

<span onclick="alertMyEvent(event)">test</span>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a function that make use of the event object
2. create an event listener for the 'click' event that trigger the
aformentioned function
3. open the javascript console and click the html object you attached the
listener to

Actual Results:
The function failed and I received the following error in the javascript console:

Error: event is not defined

Expected Results:
The function should have been passed the event that fired.
