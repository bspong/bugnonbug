Sometimes, every 3 time or so I close a tab I get the error which is in the screenshot linked to above. The error is 'Type Error:result [each result] merkerID is null' This only happens when I close a tab and I have to click the "x" on the error to continue browsing. This ha only started happening since Firefox updated itself.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Link in new tab
2. Close Tab
3.
Actual Results:
Same a described

Expected Results:
Nothing besides closing the tab.

I am using the default theme.
