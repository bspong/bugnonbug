link to release note missing from Firefox 4 (and from firstrun page)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I can't find a link to the release note for Firefox 4.0 anywhere within the application. Not in the "About" window, and neither in any of the page linked from the entry in the "Help" menu.

This is especially bad since it is also missing from the firstrun/Welcome page for Firefox 4.0 (bug 647965).


Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
There should be a link to the release note somewhere in Firefox.
