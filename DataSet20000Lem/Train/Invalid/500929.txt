If bug 77790 is resolved/fixed, I think this could be another step towards a more styleable browser interface with CSS. How about some simple -moz CSS code to style the alt="" bubble? Preferably, you should also be able to assign a certain time for it to stay open (as long a it isn't over, let's say 120 seconds).

Reproducible: Always
