I have my navigation button moved up beside my menues (File, Edit,...) and my
addressbar moved up nextto these to save space. And there for I have removed the
navigation toolbar.
This also give an advantage in fullscreen where the screen i fact becomes
fullscreen with no button at all.
Pressing F6 (to get to the addressbar) in fullscreen where the addressbar is not
vissable and you star typing an URL, Firefox will try to show you a dropdownbox
with suggestion that is about 100px wide, making no more room for the "http://"
part of the sugested URLs.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
0. Start your browser on a blank page.
1. Customize your toolbars to have the addressbar show on the same toolbar a
your menus.
2. Remove the navigation toolbar (right click remove tick in "Navigation toolbar").
3. Switch to fullscreen (F11).
4. Press F6.
5. Type an URL of a previous visited address.
Actual Results:
A too small autocomplete sugestion box shows.

Expected Results:
Not sure. Maybe the addressbar should become visable and the suggestionbox
should show under it (like in vindowed mode). Maybe only the suggestionbox
should show, but in full witdh. Maybe no suggestionbox should show at all.

Not sure how it should be presented.
