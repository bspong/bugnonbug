THis ha been happening on my Redhat 9.0 for most of a year. Every single time,
without exception, since well before MOZILLA 1.0, I have to track down some
stupid libxpistub.so and put it in /.

Why is the installaer looking in / for a lib? Why doesn't the the installer put
it there? At least the older installer broght on ealong, even if they were too
stupid to find it. The latest version firefox-1.0.1.installer.tar.gz doesn;t
even have the the thing - I had to get it from a previous installer.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download insstaller tar.gz.
2. use installer
3. see error. every time.

Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
I expect the program to install firegfox wihout having to copy semingly
unrelated stuff into /
