Too many beta version to test in the same time.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.0; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0

Actual results:

There are too many beta version to follow in the same time: currently we have Firefox 7.0b1 and Aurora 8.0a2.


Expected results:

I suggest to issue new beta version only when a final release is issued.
I will not start a Test Drive for Aurora 8.0 until Firefox 7.0 Final will be released.
