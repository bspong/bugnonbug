Redirect within a frame doesn't work properly.

www.testsession.com is a masked, forwarded domain name. It is forwarded to
www.indeq.com/testsession. The forwarding and masking (if you access
www.testsession.com) is accomplished through the use of a frame:
--------
<html>
<head>
<title>TCFSA Test Sessions</title>


</head>
<frameset rows="100%,*" border="0">
<frame src="http://www.indeq.com/testsession" frameborder="0">
<frame frameborder="0" noresize>
</frameset>
</html>

<!-- m -->
--------

The www.indeq.com/testsession/index.html redirects to a file called home.php.
Firefox try to load www.testsession.com/home.php which doesn't exist because
of the domain forwarding. It should open www.indeq.com/testsession/home.php
because this is the actual page for the frame.

IE and Mozilla 1.7.2 handle this properly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Enter www.testsession.com for the URL
3. Receive "File Not Found" error.
4. Try the same in IE

Actual Results:
I receive a "File Not Found" error.

Expected Results:
The browser should have loaded www.indeq.com/testsession/home.php into the
frame. Instead, it try to load www.testsession.com/home.php.

This may be similar to bug #251622. Although I don't understand that bug enough
to determine if it is.
