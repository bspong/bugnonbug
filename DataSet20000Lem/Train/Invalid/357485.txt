Privacy leak: clearing private data doe not clear favicons
Favicons remain on disk, even when private data is cleared. This is a security risk, a it mean that a partial record of which website have previously been browsed remains on-disk, regardless of privacy settings.

To reproduce:
* Make bookmarks, and revisit so favicons can be seen in menu
* Clear private data (and, optionally, also restart browser after clearing)
* Look at menu again

What happens:
* Favicons are still in the menu, and still on disk

What should happen:
* Favicons should be cleared from disk, and also removed from menu in running browser
