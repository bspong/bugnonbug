My mouse died so I'm resorting to browsing using a keyboard. Type-ahead find is
very useful in this situation, but annoyingly although I can open link using
enter I can't open link in a new tab using alt+enter. Seeing a alt+enter is
the standard for opening address in a new tab from the address bar it seems
like a natural progression to add it to type-ahead find.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.mozilla.org
2. Type 'Best of 2003'
3. Hit alt+enter

Actual Results:
Nothing

Expected Results:
Opened 'http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,110653,pg,11,00.asp' in a
new tab.
