The popups that appear when hovering over text appear to be a fixed size (very large), rather then being dependent on the size of the text in them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to example URL
2. Place mouse over 'nobody@mozilla.org'
Actual Results:
Popup that appears showing 'nobody@mozilla.org' is too big

Expected Results:
Popup should only be the size of the text in it.

This worked a expected in FF4b9
