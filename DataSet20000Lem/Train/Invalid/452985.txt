For the last two day when cooky are deleted they are automatically added to the blocked cookie list causing me to be unable to log in to certain websites. Deleting them from blocked cookie list only work temporarily. I readd them a "allowed" but next time cooky are deleted the "allowed" is changed to blocked again!

And to have to do this for every website visited is ridiculous a every website visited wind up on blocked cooky list when cooky are deleted and unblocking and adding them a allowed is changed back to blocked next time their cooky are deleted.

Help please!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit gmail then delete cookie. Find it's now on blocked list: google.com, mail.google.com and www.google.com. Remove all and add them a allowed.
2. Close FF.
3. Reopen, go back to gmail, login then try to view inbox.
3. Get message saying "browser is not accepting cooky and find that it's back on blocked list.
Actual Results:
Just what I said above.

Expected Results:
Not added anything to my blocked cookie list, just a it ha always done. Should have been able to view gmail inbox a usual. Same thing happens with ebay. But like I said, now EVERY site I visit wind up on blocked cookie list when their cooky are deleted which is unacceptable.

I don't use a theme or anything fancy that would eat memory. I have not installed anything new or changed any settings. The only update have been to Stylish and NoScript addons in the past few days.
