Dear Firefox Developers,

Using Firefox we would like to generate Thawte X.509 E-Mail Certificates.

When generating the Private/Public key pair using Firefox a well a requesting the certificate, we are logged in on the Thawte Website.

Our security relevant question:
Which data is transmitted to Thawte during the Private/Public key pair and certificate generation process using Firefox and Thawte ?

Does Firefox send to Thawte any form of “private” key during this process, or not ?

If the private key wa transmitted to Thawte, in theory a Thawte staff member –would he gain access to the private key at thawte- could decrypt email encrypted by us, or sign an email in our name …

We would be happy to understand better the key and certificate generation process using Firefox (and Thawte), considering the security critical point mentioned above.

Thank you in advance,
Proud Firefox user


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to thawte and generate Private/public X.509 key pair and certificate
Actual Results:
Typical Thawte X.509 E-Mail Certificate generation process

Expected Results:
Which data is transmitted to Thawte during the Private/Public key pair and certificate generation process using Firefox being logged in at Thawte ?

Does Firefox send to Thawte any form of “private” key during this process, or not ?
