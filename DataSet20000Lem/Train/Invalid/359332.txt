allowing for per-grouping sort
allowing for per-grouping sort

while place allows for multiple grouping (see bug #358784, for example), we do not allow for different sort per-group.

what I'd like to do is allow for GROUP_BY_DAY to be sorted by SORT_BY_DATE_DESCENDING followed by GROUP_BY_HOST sorted by SORT_BY_TITLE_ASCENDING.

for a serialized query, that would be something like:

place:&beginTime=-2592000000000&beginTimeRef=1&endTime=7200000000&endTimeRef=2&type=1&group=0&sort=4&group=1&sort=1

This would be the uri we'd used for the history sidebar, "View | By Date and Site"

To accomplish this, in addition to fixing the code that serializes / deserializes the queries, we'd need to fix nsNavHistoryContainerResultNode::RecursiveSort() to not simply pas through the sort comparator, but to allow the container to have a sort type that would override the parent node's sort type.

the real goal is to avoid hard coding the assumption of "when sorting by title ascending, sort date container by date descending", because that is what we want for the history sidebar.

removing that assumption will make it easier for extenstion author to write a "better" history sidebar.
