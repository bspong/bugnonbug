FF block access by Win to the folder a previously browsed local file lived in.

1) File x (e.g. JPEG file) life in folder G on my PC. I view the JPEG with this ver. of FF. 2) I view another file with FF. 3) I delete or move file x. 4) I try to delete folder G. Win say folder is in use.

A browser, unlike say a word processor, shouldn't even exclusively own the file it's viewing, should it? Let alone own the file's folder. Let alone keep any of those flag open when the file is no longer being viewed/browsed by FF.
