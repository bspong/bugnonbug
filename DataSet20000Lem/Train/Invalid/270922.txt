Neither the menu-command nor the right mouse button context-menu open any
dialog box. The 'Save Media' seems to work. Before reporting I reinstalled
'firefox-1.0.en-US.mac.dmg' dated 11-07-2004. Unfortunately I haven't used the
saving dialog after the final 1.0 release. However it worked on the September
release candidate.

These are the system update I installed since Firefox release 1.0 final:
"Mac OS X Update" (10.3.6)
"AirPort Software" (4.1)
"Power Mac G5 (Juni 2004) Firmware-Update" (5.1.8f7)
