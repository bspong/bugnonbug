When pressing the "Close Window" button (the X on the top right) with multiple
tab open, I get a dialog saying "This window ha 3 tab open. Do you want to
close the window and all it open tabs?". Options are "Close all tabs" and
"Cancel". No matter which one I press, Firebird shuts down, closing all tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open multiple tab
2.Press close button
3.Click Cancel

Actual Results:
Firebird closed anyway

Expected Results:
Should have remained open
