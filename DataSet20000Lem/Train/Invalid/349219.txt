Over at the MozillaZine forum there ha been quite a bit of whining about how terrible the new tabstrip looks. A lot of the problem are simply glitches, but I believe there's one major problem a well.

Previously, inactive tab were darker and closer to the style of the mockups at the wiki page (http://wiki.mozilla.org/FX2_Visual_Update/Default_Theme_Update). However, some said this decreased the readability of the text (as the text wa made transparent a well a the tab itself). However, the new, lighter version also look uglier. I feel a good compromise between the two would be to decrease the opacity of the background tab but to increase that of the text in the tabs, so that it is readable. This is, in fact, what is depicted in the original mockups, and look very nice.

Reproducible: Always
