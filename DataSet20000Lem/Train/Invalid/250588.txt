In the DirectX SDK documentation file "dxreadme.htm" (example:
http://safariexamples.informit.com/0672325969/DirectX%20SDK/dxreadme.htm)
section of the text are layered over previous one when viewed using Firefox.
It appears that the 'style: "width: 772px; height: 385px"' are honoured to the
last degree and, hence, isntead of expanding the DIV vertically because there is
too much text inside (as IE does) it continues to write text down the page, but
start the next DIV directly below the first one--right at 385 px, in this example.

Indeed, removing the "height: 385px" from the end of the style definition cause
the page to display correctly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open "http://safariexamples.informit.com/0672325969/DirectX%20SDK/dxreadme.htm"
2. Scroll down about 15 line

Actual Results:
You can see where the text "Uninstall: To uninstall, use "Add/Remove Programs"
from the Control Panel..." is overlayed over "Contents: Touched Areas DirectX
9.0 SDK Update(Summer 2003)..."

Expected Results:
Spaced out the DIV for the "uninstall" portion after the div for the first second.
