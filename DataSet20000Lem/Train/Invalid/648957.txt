Add-On telling me I have Firefox 2.0
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.18) Gecko/20081029 Firefox/2.0.0.18 FBSMTWB
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.18) Gecko/20081029 Firefox/2.0.0.18 FBSMTWB

When I went to install an add-on, it told me I only had Firefox 2.0 installed, when I actually installed Firefox 4.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Downloaded Firefox 4.0
2.Opened page for add-on
3.Tried to download ad blocker, but said I only had version 2.0
4.Looked at About Firefox on above bar and told me I had version 4.0
Actual Results:
Wouldn't let me download the ad blocker or any other add-ons.

Expected Results:
Let me install the ad blocker for Firefox version 4.0

Previous version of Firefox work with add-ons, but Firefox version 4.0 doesn't.
