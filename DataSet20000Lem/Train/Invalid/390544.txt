The external link have been set up using 'blank' to return the visitor to the website on closing out of the external link. This work fine in Internet Explorer. In Firefox the visitor is given two option - Close Tabs or Cancel. Both have virtually the same result - the visitor is not returned to the website he wa exploring. I design website and this mean that visitor to my clients' site are taken away from their site - perhaps 'never to return again' if they are using Firefox and not IE. This ha not always been the case. Was there an update that changed this option. If so, How to I ensure searcher are returned to the page they left when they close out of an external link?
