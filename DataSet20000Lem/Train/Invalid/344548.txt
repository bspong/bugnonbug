Problem parsing link if another object in a page share the same name/id a the anchor you're linking to

I noticed this while attempting to create a page that used a list of link to browse to different section of that same page (internal link or "bookmarks").

It's hard to explain without using examples, so I'll illustrate with code:

Say I have a link - <a href="#foo">Bar</a>
An image below the link - <img src="foo.gif" name="foo" id="foo">
And then a named anchor - <a name="foo" id="foo"></a>

I want the link to direct the browser to scroll down to the named anchor. What end up happening is the browser is directed to the image instead. I assume that this will happen with any object in the page that share the same name/id wa the image. Whichever object the browser encounter first will be where the link is directed to. Please view the above URL to see the problem in action.

Now, I wa unable to find any information on standardization of object name and id on the web, so perhaps it's just bad form for a designer to name two different object the same thing. But testing this in other browsers, I wa unable to replicate the problem. It may be that all the other browser handle link to object incorrectly and Firefox is the only one following standards, I don't know. I wa always under the impression that an href could only point to a named anchor or another page, not a specific object within a page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with a link, a named image, and an anchor of the same name
2. Click the link.
3. Boom!
