URL bar ha no transparency when not focused when using lightweight theme
Previously on Firefox, when a Persona wa installed, the URL bar ha some transparency.

With Firefox 4, the URL bar ha no transparency which mean Personas don't look good.

Best solution would be to recreate the URL bar image with some transparency. Alternatively I think what Firefox 3.6 did wa do a 90% opacity on the URL bar.
