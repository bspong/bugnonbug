I keep trying to load the new Yahoo homepage. However, I have to resort to doing that in IE. Everytime I go to the homepage in Firefox, I get an error that reads:

Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library
Runtime Error
This application ha requested the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support team for more info.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load: www.yahoo.com
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Open Firefox. Type yahoo.com into the address bar and press enter to load. Error message pop up a page is loading.

Expected Results:
The Yahoo Homepage should load normally, not leave me to switch back and forth between IE and Firefox.
