When viewing any web page on beta release 2, the "Home" and "End" key do not work. This appears to be because part of the page appears to be "selected" - you can see a cursor in the text of the page. This happens on *every* page on my Windows 2000 pc, it's fine on XP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Windows 2000, open Firefox 3 beta 2, and go to http://news.bbc.co.uk/
2. When the page ha loaded press the "End" key.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and press the "Home" key.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens when the "Home" and "End" key are pressed.

Expected Results:
It should jump to the end of the page when pressing "End", and to the start of the page when pressing "Home".
