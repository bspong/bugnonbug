Clear Private Date > Clear Autocomplete Data Option
Clear Private Data doe not clear autocomplete data for forms.

Instead, there is an option: Tools > Options > Privacy |_| Remember what I enter in search form and the address bar.

This checkbox can be unchecked, but the autocomplete data can't ever be cleared.

There should be an option to clear autocomplete data in the 'Clear Private Data' menu.
