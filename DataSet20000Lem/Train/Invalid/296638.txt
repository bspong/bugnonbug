mozilla sends mass email with virus attachements to random address
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)
Build Identifier: 1.0.4

I have been recieving alot of returned email with virus attachements thru
using outlook express 6.00.2800.1123. I recieve these email only when I use the
firefox browser. the returned email stop when I use another browser and do not
start firefox at all. I believe firefox ha been turned into a zombie mass
mailing program. I have not tried anything but running AVG free anitviruse
version 7.0.323 which ha not worked. I have a Zone alarm free 5.5.094 firewall
and when I take out the premissions for firfox browser to communicate out of my
computer, the email stop.
I love firefox and hate using the internet explorer. Please help with
suggestions.
thank you

3.

Actual Results:
after I have used the firfox browser,even if it for a minute, I check my mail
using outlook express and there is at least three or four returned emails, with
attachments, from poeple I do not know.

Expected Results:
Run at it previous normal speed, without me getting returned email from
unkown addresses.

I am not a computer expert, but I know all returned virus email only happen
when I use firefox. I have stoped using firefox and went back to internet
explorer, and the email have stoped so far.
