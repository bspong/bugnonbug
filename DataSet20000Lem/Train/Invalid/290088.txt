If the "advanced" section of option (tools->options) wa the last selected
section, clicking options/scrollbars/etc. receives no response. This may be
related to the mousewheel not working unless that section is focussed. Clicking
another section and clicking back seems to make this behavior (the advanced
option dialog not responding) go away.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox, click tools->options
2.click on the advanced section
3.close firefox
4.reopen firefox, open tools->options
5.the option dialog should point to the advanced section
6.clicking on the scroll bar and option of the advanced section fails to show
any change in the dialog

Actual Results:
Whether it is actually working and just not updating the GUI, I'm not sure, but
I saw no change in the dialog.

Expected Results:
Behave normally: scroll when scrollbars are clicked, toggle option or open
other dialog when the appropriate option are triggered.
