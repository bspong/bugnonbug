caused a fatal error while rendering this experiment. It Turned window to basic and flashed a few time crashing my graphic card driver and never came back from that state hanging window until I forcibly held the shut down button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to the site
2.click launch experiment
3.render it
Actual Results:
all in the detail

Expected Results:
run it without hang or glitch

Could have happened due to my configuration at "about:config" or my blacklisted x3100 graphic card. All the reason to run webgl a a separate process and so the tab and component of firefox
