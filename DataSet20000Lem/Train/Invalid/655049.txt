JavaScript (jQuery) cannot determine the real size of a window

When I try to detect real size of a resized window and the window is really small, let’s say it is smaller than 300×300px, window object (in JavaScript) hold wrong size – I can confirm that width of the window is affected and give wrong result – the given width is bigger than is it actually.

I wa told that this problem may cause some add-on and probably it is true. When I removed my .mozilla directory and the new wa created, everything wa fine.

Reproducible: Always
