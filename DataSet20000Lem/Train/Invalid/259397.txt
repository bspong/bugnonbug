Firefox 1.0PR sends "Firefox/0.10" User-Agent
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

The preview release of Firefox 1.0 feature a bug; at the end of the User-Agent
string, it say Firefox/0.10, rather than Firefox/1.0 (presumably what it should
be).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox 1.0PR
2.Open a page which identifies the browser's user-agent.

Actual Results:
All page showed Firefox/0.10.

Expected Results:
It should have displayed Firefox/1.0.

I have tested this on both Linux and Windows; both have exhibited this problem,
so I assume Mac would be included.
