With firefox 0.9 I have experienced a whole lot of crash in seemingly random
situation - usually I wa just browsing and after clicking on a link, the
browser crashed, usually not even showing the crash report window, so often I
could not even reproduce the URL I wa entering when the crash occured. A sample
URL I did write down is given in the URL field.
I have the flash plugin (version 7) and java plugin (from Sun) installed.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
Be unlucky and click the wrong link
Actual Results:
Browser window disappeared, leaving no trace of what happened

Expected Results:
Shouldn't crash
