javascript pop-up crash browser.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

When I click on a javscript popup. eg. "Customer ha root/admin access." The
browser crash with a 'program error' & tell me the application will now
close.

Where is the error log for firefox located?

Thank you

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.servermatrix.com/managed_services.html
2. click on a link with a javascript pop-up (eg. "Customer ha root/admin
access.")

Actual Results:
Browser crashed with an "application error"

Expected Results:
Placed the pop-up in a new window.

This seems to be a bug with extension support and

I feel that a full application crash from any extension is a major issue.
