Unexpected search submission of private data when middle-clicking a link

Usually, when I middle-click on a link, Firefox open the link in a new tab.

However, with certain javascript links, instead of opening the link in a new tab, Firefox sends whatever personal data I might have on my clipboard (X-selection) directly to Google's ever-increasing database of information about me. And since the data is sent a plain-text by default, it could also easily be sniffed by some third party. This can also happen when a user accidentally ha the mouse slightly off target even when trying to click a plain HTML link.

I believe most user have an expectation that clipboard data is private, and that a trusted application would not unexpectedly expose it to the world just because of a misplaced mouse click.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select some text in Firefox or any another application.
2. Middle-click somewhere on a web page, other than a link or textarea.
3. Middle clicking certain javascript-generated link can also produce the same behavior.
Actual Results:
If the text happens to be a valid URL, the browser will load that page. Otherwise the text contained in the X-selection is submitted to the configured search engine, possibly a plain text.

Expected Results:
I would expect nothing at all to happen, since the click wa not on a "hyper" page element. (The same thing that would happen if you left-clicked on the same spot.) For the case of the javascript links, I would expect the link to open in a new tab, or not at all.
