firefox default font setting are too small
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; cs-CZ; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080208 Fedora/2.0.0.12-1.fc8 Firefox/2.0.0.12
Build Identifier: Fedora Rawhide different build of Firefox 3 beta 2 and beta3

(originally filed a Fedora/Rawhide bug on the above shown URL)

Firefox show many web site with tiny font that really unreadable.
A user said that his firefox default font setting in window are the same with
fedora but site diplayed differently.
So the user ha to go to advanced font setting and set "minimum font size" to a
different value(on every language he use). I think current value is "none"
I think that this situation is not ideal for novice fedora users.
I have to mention that this also is the case for epiphany.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:
font are too small and "minimum font size" is not set.

Expected Results:
Either font should be always sanely sized (probably not possible given the wide variety of web out there) or "minimum font size" should be default to some sane size.
