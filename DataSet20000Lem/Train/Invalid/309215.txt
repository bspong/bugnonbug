My name is Kevin Wendt. I am the webmaster for www.msa.umn.edu. There is a
"fill-in" menu on the left side of the screen. When you click on the
"INFORMATION" image/link, javascript should be invoked, replacing the
immediately following <div> with text in the form of a <ul> with several links.
"RENTERS' SURVEY" and "LINKS" should do the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load URL
2.move cursor to "INFORMATION" image/link
3.click

Actual Results:
Nothing.

Expected Results:
Created an unordered list of link to other page on the site (Committees,
Members of Forum, etc.)

Lack of use of this feature block surfer from navigating page on site other
than home page.

I am the webmaster for this (D-1 University's student government) site. I want
it to be Mozilla compliant (as it is the best browser ever). Unfortunately,
this work in IE and not Mozilla/firefox. Any help will be immediately
implemented. But I'm a student and TA and an officer of the student government
here, etc. I need some help figuring this out. THANKS.
