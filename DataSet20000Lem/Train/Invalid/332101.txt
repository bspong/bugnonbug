Firefox unexpectedly and randomly 'experiences a problem and shuts down' when playing pool on shockwave. Prior to shutting down, a window appears on the screen that say "Firefox is experiencing a problem and need to shut down". Within seconds, Firefox shuts down. There is no pattern to when this occurs (it can happen at any time....sometimes twice in ten minutes...other time maybe one time per hour). This occurred approximately 8-10 time yesterday over a 3-4 hour period. It ha happened 3 time today in le than 1 hour. This ha never happened before until the past week or so.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:
have to log back into firefox

Expected Results:
Everything is fine for awhile...then shockwave quits in the middle of a pool game.
