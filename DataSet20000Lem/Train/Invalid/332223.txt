I wa automating the script for mail server. Noted the script and when run it again in the live environment , it always fails when the script come to the point where the autogenerated number ( take example of yahoo mail server) is to be filled . Tried a lot of way but could not got the solution

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the yahoo mail and select new mail id
2.when the page pop up fill all the detail and also note the script.
3.Run the script again in the live environment and it fails at the point where autogenerated no is to be filled a each time it change and also we have no
control on this no.

Actual Results:
Each time the script fails at the same point a the autogenerated number change every time.

Expected Results:
To successfully running the script the script should pas this point also which it doe not

we can take the example of yahoo mail for simulating the same environment.
