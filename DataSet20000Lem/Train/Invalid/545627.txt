http://kissyoutube.com requires java runtime environment plugin to be installed in order to be able to download video files. A "you need java" link lead to http://www.java.com. Installed jre-6u18-linux-i586.bin and successfully ran it. But returning to kissyoutube.com the "you need java" message still appears. Going to http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1 to verify if java is installed result in message that java is not installed; and the message "Additional plugins are required to display all the medium on this page" and the button "Install missing plugins..." are present. So jre is not detected a installed even though I ran the installer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.kissyoutube.com/watch?v=M4NHxrkU5nA&feature=related. You'll see the "you need java" link
2. Click on link to go to http://www.java.com/getjava/ and install jre.
3. Go to http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp?detect=jre&try=1. You'll see java is not installed.
4. Return to http://www.kissyoutube.com/watch?v=M4NHxrkU5nA&feature=related. You'll see you still need java!
Actual Results:
Java still not installed despite successfully running installer.

Expected Results:
Java should have been detected and video download button should have appeared.
