The order of the exported bookmark should be the same a the order presented by the Bookmarks Manager.

2.Add a few bookmark in reverse alphabetical order under a bookmark folder

4.Export the bookmark
5.View the exported bookmark file

Actual Results:
While the Bookmarks Manager will show the bookmark and folder sorted by name, the resulting exported bookmark file will not be sorted by name.


Expected Results:
The exported bookmark file will be written by the Bookmarks Manager in the order that it display the bookmarks.
