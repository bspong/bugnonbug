According to Apple interface guidelines, menu item for non-utility window should be located in the Window menu. See URL above. Compare with any OSX application especialy Safari. Suggest to move at least Downloads and Add-ons from Tools to Window menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Compare Tools menu with Window menu
Actual Results:
While looking for the Download window, click Window menu but no download window?! Sadness ensues.

Expected Results:
Clicking the Window menu let you open windows! Peace and happiness abound.

Especially good for safari switcher and user of both Fx and Safari.
