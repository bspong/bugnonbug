When entering the URL http://usatoday.com and clicking ENTER, the page begin to load placing content on the screen. After the "real content" appears, the ad and their software begin to load and shortly after that the content disappears before everything is loaded and the word DONE appears in the bottom lower corner. I have tried updating the add ons, but no update are available. I have rebooted the system with the same results. If I want to view usatoday.com, I must use IE, which I do not want to do. But with FireFox, I can see nothing from usatoday.com.
