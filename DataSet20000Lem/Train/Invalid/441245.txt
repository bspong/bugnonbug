say last time i have added a bookmark to a page which ha got a title "hello world".

Next time. if i try add a bookmark to another page titled "foo bar" by clicking
"Bokkmarks > Bookmark this page",
then, i can see a dialog with a text saying "page bookmarked" and underneath this text is a text field labelled "name:".

This textfield still show the page title "hello world"!

Although the page ha been bookmarked, the "name" textfield is really really confusing. I am a webdev., and, if I find it confusing, it a reasonable assumtion a lot of people will feel the same!

or is it just me? :">
