90% cpu utilization even when Firefox minimized after more than an hour
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 1.0.3

I don't have a specific URL that this occurs for. But several time I have had
to close Firefox using the Task Manager ... when the PC becomes totally
consumed by Firefox ... even though it is minimized and have not loaded any new
page for minute or even hours. In these situation Firefox is unresponsive
and I am unable to determine what caused the instability. Please advise if and
what diagnostics I could attempt prior to forceable shutdown by TaskManager.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. So far, I have not observed a predetermined sequence that lead to this
situation
2.
3.

Actual Results:
n/a

Expected Results:
n/a

Please advise what diagnostic precaution I should take either before or after
a lockup occurs. Since this happens only occasionally, I have not observed any
consistent precursor.

I have seen similar bug report for Linux, Mac and even WinXP ... but not for
Win2k (server) ... is this something that is unique to each OS or systemic for
all OS versions?

Finally, if this not a known bug ... what can I do to help you to nail it down?

Suggestions?
