Precondition: Have some text in the search bar
1. Go to the search bar by pressing Ctrl+K
2. Switch search engine by pressing Ctrl+Down arrow


Actual results:

The cursor is moved to the beginning of the text and the selection is lost.


Expected results:

All the text in the search bar should stay selected, just like it is if you switch search engine with Ctrl+Up arrow or with the mouse.
