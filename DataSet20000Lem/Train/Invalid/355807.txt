Subscribe Now doesn't work for RssReader
Steps to reproduce:

1) Install RssReader (at url above)
2) Go to feed (such a http://planet.mozilla.org/rss20.xml)
2) Click "Choose Now"
4) Select RssReader (under program files)
5) Select Subscribe
6) Notice that RssReader is launched but subscription is not added

If you repeat this (after RssReader is running) you'll get a popup from RssReader saying RssReader already running.

I'm guessing RssReader isn't taking the cmdline params properly to subscribe to feeds?
