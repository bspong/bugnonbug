Zoom override REDO kbd shortcut
Mac problem.

The keyboard shortcut for ZOOM is ctrl+shift+z.

In mac, the keyboard shortcut for REDO is ctrl+shift+Z.

See the screen menubar, Edit menu:
"Redo..... [shift][cmd]Z"

It is now impossible to undo without using the screen menu bar because it is used for zoom.

Example:
In Gmail, while composing a mail. three or four consecutive "redo" atttempts (using shift+cmd+Z) can hang or freeze the browser for a over a minute.

Expected Behavior:
[shift][cmd]Z should be a redo command.

[shift][cmd]Z should not be context-sensitive. i.e. DO NOT "redo in textarea/input, otherwise zoom".

It is possible to reassign my preference using about:config, but mac user should not be forced to do this to prevent breaking the undo feature.
