Welcome to Gravix's homebrew guide to stealing stored Firefox passwords!
You may be thinking at this point: "Why dont I just just go under
Tools>Options>Privacy>Passwords>Show passwords"?
Well… imagine if you wern't sitting in front of the computer (or you dont have
access to that user's firefox)! Then what? Exactly.

This guide is going to be the first of many guide to come.

Prep:
Access to a computer [remote/local] which ha Firefox
Some way of file retrieval
Firefox on a computer you have access too.

Ok, now for the easy part, try to keep up please.

1) Copy the following file to a storage media:
Under C:\Documents and Settings\[User]\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\[Random].default\
signons.txt
key3.db
2) Move them to a place you have access too.
3) Now for the swap, open up the same folder on your computer (making sure you
fill in [User] with your username), and rename the existing signons.txt and
key3.db to something alternate (I usually just put a .bak or ~ at the end of them).
4) Paste the stolen file in their place.
5) Load up Firefox and open Tools>Options>Privacy>*expand Saved
Passwords*>*click View Saved Passwords*
6) Your probably wondering, "Ok… where are the passwords?". This is where I tell
you to click "Show Passwords"
7) Congrads! You now have a list of site with their corresponding username and
password!

Important notes:
1) If you only take the signons.txt file and not the key3.db, then you wont be
able to view anything in the file.
2) If Firefox is running while you are taking the files, it will not work. It
will tell you they are "In use". Also make sure you dont have Firefox running
when you switch the files.
3) To restore your passwords, just delete/move the stolen file and rename your
backups.

I hope you all have enjoyed!
