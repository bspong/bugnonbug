Moz. FF - FF main web page say I am using old but am using 7.0.1
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

Was at the Firefox web page and it reported at the top that uh oh, look like you are using an old browser version. Get 7.0.1. The only thing is that I update a week ago and am using the latest general release - 7.0.1.


Actual results:

FF web page reporting I am using an old version.

I got a similar report a few day ago somewhere else but can't rememeber where I was.


Expected results:

Page should not be reporting that I am on an old version.
