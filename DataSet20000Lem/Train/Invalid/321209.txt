When we click on a button to open a new window via our script with only titlebar and statusbar(which is default), we would like to press F11 to make that window fullscreen if we wish. Fullscreen meaning no titlebar and no statusbar. Since we do it willingly, there should not be a security concern related to status bar thus allowing u to cover the entire screen with only our content displaying. Currently, the statusbar still shows. It shoulnt be that restrictive since we press F11 to fullscreen it not by applying a script to make it fullscreen.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Using a open window script (respecting the popup blocker) via a click to a link with only titlebar and statusbar
2.Press F11
3.See there is still a statusbar

Actual Results:
The statusbar is still there.

Expected Results:
The statusbar should not display, we press F11 meaning we want it to cover the entire screen.
