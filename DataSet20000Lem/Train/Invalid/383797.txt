Firefox seems to be trying to enlarge all image by a little bit. The enlarging pixelates the heck out of the image. Can't really be any more specific, unfortunately. Can't identify any relevant change that happened before the issue cropped up, so I can't really figure out what the cause is.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any website
2. Images appear stretched/pixelated
Actual Results:
Image is pixelated.

Expected Results:
Image should display normally.
