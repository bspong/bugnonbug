Per Brain Livingston Website FIREFOX NEEDS PATCHES TRUE OR FALSE?
Is the current version of FIREFOX 1.0 in need of these patches? I downloaded and
put the patch on my old 166mhz laptop. Seems to work both way (50000 or 15000)
a he suggested. Suggest if patch is truly needed to fix download asap since most
will not go looking for Brians Livingston website. Plus, anyway to make read
mail option use my current OUTLOOK and not attempt to make one ADD MSN explorer
mail which is not wanted by most already installed email users.
