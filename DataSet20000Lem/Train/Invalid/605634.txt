Proposed patch.

When two Web Consoles are open on two tab with the same URI and one is closed, the second one throw error when closed.

The proposed patch fix this issue. I noticed this bug when fixing an issue that would cause the test "browser_webconsole_bug
_597103_deactivateHUDForContext_unfocused_window.js" for bug 597103 to fail when the browser home page wa set to an unreachable URL. This patch fix the bug in that test, which allows it to serve a a test case for this issue a well.
