UI - Why is it getting smaller?
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Firefox 4+

I am growing very concerned with the direction the Firefox UI is taking. The recent change from FF 3.6 to 4.0 have prompted numerous call from friend and family on how to downgrade or restore previous UI elements. It ha also caused me to disable significant functionality in Firefox 3+ and not upgrade to 4.0.

Rather than provide a laundry list of pro and cons, which never work no matter how well a point is argued, I would instead ask a simple question:

What user experience is being added by increasing screen area and removing UI element that Fullscreen doe not already provide?

I ask a all sort of change are being made for the benefit of netbook user and in the interest of company who want more space to advertise but ease of use issue for average user seem to be ignored in the current (FF4) and planned (URL bar removal) UI changes.


Reproducible: Always
