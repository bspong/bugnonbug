My bank require my computer to be registered so that I can access my accounts. Never had a problem before now everytime I access my account I have to register the computer before I can go on. This is not a simple task and I have stopped using Firefox for now. No setting have been changed. This started to happen on the last update from Firefox. I do find this a major problem for myself a I access these account often throughout the day. Using 2 browser is no fun.
