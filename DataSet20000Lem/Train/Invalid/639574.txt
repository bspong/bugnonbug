After march 03rd, the auto update stopped working.
If preferences, firefox is configured to auto-update
On the 07th, I'm still at the b13 20110303 nightly. I tried to force an update through Help>About, but I get a "Minefield is up to date".

But I checked there (http://nightly.mozilla.org/), and it say "Built on 07-Mar-2011", so I'm sure there were some other nightly build after 03-Mar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I suppose that would work, but nobody noticed (or I didn't find anybody mentioning it on the web)
1.Have the same Minefield version a me
2.Try to update
3.
Actual Results:
No new nightly found.

Expected Results:
An update occurs.
