Firefox preferences: Linux - Edit->Preferences, Windows - Tools->Options

Why is it that to get to the same dialog in Firefox take two different menu path between Linux and Windows? To get to the preference dialog in Linux, I click Edit->Preferences. To get to the same functionality in Windows, I must use Tools->Options.

Shouldn't these be the same?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot to Linux or Windows and start Firefox.
2. Go to Edit->Preferences or Tools->Options

Shouldn't those be reconciled?
