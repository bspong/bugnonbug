MAC address required to change AP on Ubiquity AirOS wireless internet radio

I use Firefox for the management interface on Ubiquity AirOS radios. V.4.0 ha changed to require a MAC address to be entered for the AP when making a new connection or changing from one to another AP. It's not a critical problem since the site survey tool display the MACs of all visible APs. Some of my management machine still have 3.6.16 which at this time will make connection without locking to a MAC address.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log on to Ubiquity AirOS radio
2.Wireless tab, click select SSID
3.note "Lock to AP MAC" is highlighed and new AP connection not completed until MAC is entered



As I said above this isn't critical since the MACs are available from a site survey but it is a change from usual that might have other effect.
