It happens on occasion the browser just go away. When this happens, the process is not closed by the task manager. Which also mean whatever I may have been doing is gone. I have been in the middle of chat and school this week when it happened. When I close the process, then reopen the browser, it doe not have the issue again during the session I am logged into.
