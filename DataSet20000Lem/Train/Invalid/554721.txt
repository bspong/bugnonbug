There appears to be a bug in the new version of Firefox. It ha caused a problem in another program that I use.
Tech Smith Snag-It (Ver 9.1.3) ha a capture feature that allows the capture of a scrolling web page in it entirety. when you click on a page, Snag-It automatically scroll the page to capture it; that is id did until I upgraded to the new Firefox page (the one that ha selectable background for the top of the page).
I reinstalled Snag-It; it didn't help.
I re-upgraded to Firefox 3.6.2; it didn't help.
Snag-It worked fine before the Firefox upgrade.
Snag-It work fine in MS Internet Explorer 7.0.5730.11.
