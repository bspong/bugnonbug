display:none for print medium get ignored
According to the W3C specifications:
* CSS stylesheets which are defined a media="print" apply to printing
(http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/media.html#media-types), and
* Elements that have a display:none parameter should not be rendered in the
layout (http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/visuren.html#propdef-display).
* Elements that have a visibility:hidden parameter should not be visibly
rendered (http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/visufx.html#visibility).

However, element that have both (or either) of the two aforementioned
parameter still appear in the Print Preview and on paper when printed. I am
attaching two file that prove it.

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 exhibit the same behavior, so maybe I am
misunderstanding the specification.
