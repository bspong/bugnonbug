I am on Minefield nightly build and the tineye extension recently stopped working. It wa working until about a week ago. I reverted to a stable build to verify that whatever is causing it is due to recent code change (as I'm not a programmer I don't know what though)

When I try to use the extension it fails to open a new tab with the tineye search like it should.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox stable
2. Tineye extension work
3. Install minefield
4. Tineye extension broken
Actual Results:
Extension failed to open search in new tab.

Expected Results:
Extension should open a new tab with tineye search.
