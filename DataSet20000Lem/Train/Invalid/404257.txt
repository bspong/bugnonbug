Pictures (loaded with the <img> tag) disappear from page (sometimes you can see it while the page is still loading) if their src contains "spon". The same happens with graphical hyperlink (<a href="..."><img src="..."></a>), this time when "spon" appears in href.
In both case it doe not matter if there are any character in front, or after "spon". The filetype of the graphic doe not matter either.
The error doe not show up when the file are loaded from local storage, or when you just type in the absolute URL of the picture in the address bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a valid html or xhtml file.
2. In <body> include <img src="spon.png"> (just an example, any string containing "spon" will work - make sure this is the right path to the file).
(3. Upload the file to a web server)
(4. Delete the graphic and even the 'broken picture' icon will not appear.)
Actual Results:
The picture will not appear on the page.

Expected Results:
The picture should show up a normal.
