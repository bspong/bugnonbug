I just clicked on a link in safe mode and FireFox 3 downloaded a html page.

No extension loaded period !

The URL is http://www.solutions.ukdots.com/advertising_methods.html

It also happens when I cut and paste the URL into the addressbar.

Server fault. The page is sent with "application/x-httpd-php" instead of "text/html" or similar.

See http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=708645&p=3669015#p3669015

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on or paste into addressbar
2.http://www.solutions.ukdots.com/advertising_methods.html
3.Watch it be downloaded
Actual Results:
Downloads webpage instead of being rendered

Expected Results:
Rendered webpage.


Here is the logic on how to fix this.


If FireFox the URL is a download; then check to see if extension is .html, htm, .php, .asp , ect.

If extension is not a webpage then download and send download done notice. Go back to bussiness a usual.

If extension look like a webpage then open empty tab and download file and then check content to see if it is a webpage. ( it is very easy to check file download to see if it's content is a web page)

If content is a webpage; then render web page in empty tab.
If content is not a web page ;then check to see if content is zip file.
If content is a zip file then rename file to .zip (example: example.html to example.html.zip)

If content is not a webpage and not a zip file then send download done notice.
Go back to bussiness a usual.
