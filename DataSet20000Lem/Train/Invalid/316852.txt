Firfox doe not open in a new window. Cannot open 2 firefox browser windows. When one instance of firfox is open and if i click on the firfox shortcut icon on "Quick Launch or Desktop or Start Menu" nothing happens.
Nothing happens when i click "Open in a new window" on any url. Nothing happens when i click "New Window" in file menu or press CTRL+N.
It wa working fine (till morning 17th Nov. 2005) but this problem started happening after i installed update to extension "Flashgot, Wizz RSS and MediaPlayer Connectivity"
