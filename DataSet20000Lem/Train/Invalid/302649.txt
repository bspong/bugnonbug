When closing a window with no tab (just the one), the warning box about closing
window with multiple tab appears. It shouldn't. This behavior occurs when
another Firefox window doe have multiple tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Window
2. Create new tab
3. Open second window
4. Close second window

Actual Results:
The closing window with multiple tab warning appears.

Expected Results:
Close the window.

This happened on 1.4 too, I never tried it on other version but I bet it ha
the same behavior.

I've only confirmed this bug on Windows platforms.
