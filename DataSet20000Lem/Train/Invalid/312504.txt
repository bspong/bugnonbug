When editing a Wikipedia page, if I try using &#8217;&#8217;&#8217; to put
emphasis on text, Firefox will escape the text to it HTML eqivalent, which the
mediawiki software doe not process.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a wikipedia page
2. Click edit
3. Add something meaningful that involves using emphasis/bold.
4. Click show preview (and note that some of the symbol become hex codes)
5. Look at the messed up page and don&#8217;t save it.

Actual Results:
I got a page with my text, but with wrong formatting and extra character that
were meant to be formatting characters.

Expected Results:
See a page with the intended formatting and text.
