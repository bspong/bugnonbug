Usually one summary item found at the bottom of the content section mis-renders.

On the main page, the first you see, a summary can be found at the bottom of the
main content section. It is a colour-alternating set of rows.

Upon loading the page, usually one (random??) row mis-renders and force the
un-floated <Div> text down, causing the summary row to occupy more vertical
space than is obviously desired.

If you hit refresh, the problem is fixed. But each new page load yield the
same results. You must refresh after each newly retreived (and not refreshed)
page before it display correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit Iniquity.ca
2. Note that at least one summary row take up more than the desired amount of
space.
3. Hit refresh

Actual Results:
Note how the summary item consumes le vertical space. My window setting are
all the same. What did I do to cause this page to render differently on two
identical views?

Expected Results:
All Summary row should occupy an equal amount of vertical space and not force
text to the line below.

I suspect the image that is floated to the left is the culprit, causing Mozilla
(firefox in my case) to bug out on the first load...

Why it behaves differently on a refresh? I don't know.
