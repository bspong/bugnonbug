When debugging in flash, with flash player debugger, when a breakpoint is hit, flash builder is being open in debug mode and I can check all variable and stuff, the problem is that flash player suddenly stop working and I lose the debugging info because firefox kill it. In chrome, it display a window asking what to do, which is optimal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make project in flash builder and set a breakpoint
2. run project in debug mode
3. when breakpoint hits, wait a few minute
Actual Results:
Firefox kill flash player plugin thinking it ha crashed

Expected Results:
ask me if I want to wait for the plugin to respond or if it actually crashed and I want to kill it.

This problem is key for flash and flex developers, it's the main reason of why I don't use firefox a default browser, therefore I don't use it at all.
