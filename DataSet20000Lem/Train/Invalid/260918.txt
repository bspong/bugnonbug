Some link within live bookmark don't work (invalid RSS, may result in "tag is not a registered protocol")
When using the RSS 2.0 feed from feedHouse, some Live Bookmarks don't work.
Currently, one from weblogs.mozillazine.org work fine, a doe one from Eric
Meyer's website. The item related to MozillaZine stories, however, don't work:
I get the error message "tag is not a registered protocol." The RSS1 feed work
fine, which is probably why I'd never seen this before, a I usually migrate my
bookmark between nightlies a opposed to having fragmented bookmark file
everywhere.

This might be a duplicate, but I saw nothing promising in the Firefox product
with r in the summary, so I'm filing it to be safe. Right now I'm using a
Firefox branch build on Linux that I spun for myself a few hour ago.
