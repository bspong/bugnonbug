If/when I do a rmb on the toolbar icon and click customize and then drag icon (e.g. new tab) to the icon on the toolbar (e.g. next to the home icon). These icon are lost after a firefox restart.

I created a new profile and tried this and the icon remained until I copied my cooky file from my old profile.
