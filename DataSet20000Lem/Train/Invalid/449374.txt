Hi,
I upgraded to FireFox 3 a couple of week ago. Initially most of my theme needed updates. Now, a theme applies only to the top portion (addressbar, Menubar and bookmark toolbar). The theme doe not dress up the scrollbars and the status bar(at the bottom of the browser window). This wasn't an issue with FF2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FireFox 3
2.Install a theme say "AeroFox 3.0.1"
3. Observe the scrollbars and the status bar


Expected Results:
Themes should dress up the entire browser, not just the addressbar and Menus
