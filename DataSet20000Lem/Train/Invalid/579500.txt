item added to the palette via the DOM are not visible in the customization UI
in bug 568932 i add Jetpack widget a toolbar button to the navigator toolbox palette. i know they're added, a i populate the add-on bar with them using only the id of the widget via toolbar.insertItem.

however, they do not show up in the palette when i view it via View/Toolbars/Customize.
