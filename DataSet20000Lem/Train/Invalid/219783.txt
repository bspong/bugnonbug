Typing with dead key doe not work correctly in GTK2 build

Firebird built with GTK2 doesn't seem to pay any attention to the definition of
what dead key (e.g. "dead_circumflex") set in
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose (in RedHat 9). Instead it seems to
use some default definitions. Thus "dead_circumflex" + a doe produce "â", but
"dead_circumflex" + c doe not produce "&#265;" (c with circumflex), although that is
what is defined in "Compose", and although that work in all other (Unicode
capable) programs, and in all non-GTK2 build of Firebird and Mozilla.
"dead_circumflex" + u produce "û" although I've redefined it to produce "&#365;" (u
with breve) in "Compose" (which work in all other programs, e.g. KDE programs,
and in non-GTK2 build of Firebird and Mozilla). Other custom keyboard
definition done with "Xmodmap" do work, e.g. the "dead_circumflex" is on the
key where I put it, but it doe not do the thing I've defined in "Compose".

I can type the above mentioned special character if I define them with e.g.
AltGr in my Xmodmap file. Only when they're defined with dead key combinations,
the problem occurs.

This is most probably a problem with GTK2 itself, since I've seen the exact same
problem in a GTK2 build of the text editor Vim. But I thought it needed to be
reported for Firebird a well. Actually a long a this bug is in GTK2 (if there
is where it is) GKT2 build of Firebird are defective.

Most probably the same bug show up in GTK2 build of Mozilla (if there are any
such builds).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make some custom redifinitions of dead key in "Compose" (make sure they work
in e.g. a Unicode aware console.
2. Try to type the custom character (e.g. in the URL field) in a GTK2 build of
Firebird


Actual Results:
The custom definition where ignored.

Expected Results:
It should have used my custom definition just like all other program do, and
just like non-GKT2 build of Firebird do.
