Inserting htt://www.Hotmail.com in Browser Location Bar (US English version) redirects to Chinese (or Asian) Language Log-in Page

Every now and then I will place Hotmail.com in the Fx Location bar to
access the Hotmail sign-in page.

However, after general surfing (from a day to several days),
I am redirected to the "Chinese" or Asian language version of the Hotmail sign-in page.

To change this behavior requires that I delete all "Live.com" saved session
cooky and password cooky in Fx. Only after deleting all live.com cooky (6), and again placing
Hotmail.com in the L.Bar, am I able to reach the English version of the
Hotmail.com sign-in page.

From Web Developer 1.1.5. following is the cookie information listed for that URL. However, removing 6 live.com (all, in my case) cooky is necessary to access the English language page.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: I have no other issue regarding security except this one.
Java always disabled, cooky always for session only.

I use a host file (automatically blocking over 30,000 unacceptable
cooky using Spybot, SpywareBlaster and other applications.
Connection: High anonymous, data line/WWAN, no one ha ever had access to my Viao, file cannot be shared, Windows update always up to date (NET core), attachment never opened. No issue with 25+ Fx Versions, no issue on system (years). Use rootkit detector, advanced Firewall settings, Tor/Privoxy through another proxy, and all unnecessary XP service disabled, KeyScrambler and much more. (I mention these thing only to illustrate that the cookie is able to insert itself only in FX, not IE, Safari, K-Meleon or Safari

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.After all live.com cooky are removed from browser, general surfing (work) commences.
2.Cannot be certain which cookie because more than one are requested at same time (beginning with the Live cookie for MSN search. All I know is that it is one of 6, only 3 identified by Web Developer (but all have to be removed).
3. Always happens after one (or more) surfing session requiring acceptance of a Live.com cookie.
4. It doe not appear to be the cookie accepted by the English language page (unless it is able to change it original "for session only" structure with additional request for another cookie).
