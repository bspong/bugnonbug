Firefox 0.8 not removed after installing 0.9
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.8

I had Firefox 0.8, then installed 0.9. In the "add or remove programs" screen,
both version are present. When I try to uninstall 0.8, I get an error about a
log file that can't be found and a registry key.

btw, I tried to reproduce the error so I could type it literally here, and in
the process the uninstaller closed this bugzilla page without asking me.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Firefox (0.8)
2. install new version (0.9)
3. go to control panel "add and remove programs"
4. try to uninstall older version.

Actual Results:
got an error box, old version still present in add/remove program dialog screen.

Expected Results:
1. version 0.8 (or old version in general) should not have been there in the
first place, after installing 0.9.
2. it should have uninstalled properly.
