The preference in Firefox 3.5.4 aren't saved. For instance, changing the home page aren't persisted after close Firefox. I'm using Ubuntu 9.10 but in Ubuntu 9.04 occur the same problem. The installation of new plugins don't is persisted too.

Reproducible: Always

1. Open Firefox
2. Set home page to some page like www.google.com
3. Close Firefox
4. Reopen Firefox.
Actual Results:
The home page back to the default. The installation of new plugins don't is persisted too.

Expected Results:
The home page that I configure would be persisted. When I reopen the browser, it would open my configured home page.
