There is a rendering error which happens in the Preferences dialog. I suspect it's a general problem with the XUL rendering engine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the preference dialog.
2. CLick "Connection Settings".
3. Close the "Connection Settings" dialog.

Actual Results:
The "Home Page" title will not be restored properly.

The problem happens with Firefox 1.5 RC2 on Windows XP, using the Littlefox theme.

I think I'm using "Extra Large fonts", to be configured using "right click on desktop" -> "Preferences".

I'm sorry I cannot give more accurate information on how to reproduce this because this happened to me at work (I cannot reproduce it on my Linux box at home).
