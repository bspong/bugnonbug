On Mac OSX Version 10.5.5 (NOT 10.4 or before), if you tab from a text input to a button input that have tabIndex set, it will skip over the button input and go to one without a tabIndex. This prevents user from being able to tab around a form and simply hit enter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Build Page
1. Make an input[type="text"] with tabIndex=1 followed by one with tabIndex=2
2. Then have an input[type="button"] with tabIndex=3
3. Place a text input anywhere on the page WITHOUT a tabIndex
Open page then...
4. focus the first input by clicking
5. hit tab once and it will go to tabIndex 2 field
6. hit tab again
Actual Results:
It go to any field without a tabIndex

Expected Results:
It should go to the next field higher on the tabIndex
