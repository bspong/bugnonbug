When I go to the Add-ons Manager while using Sandboxie - Minefield Crashes

THIS IS NOT THE SAME BUG AS Bug 601355!
Anyways, I run the program Sandboxie at www.sandboxie.com
This program sandbox whatever program is run within it. It is quite stable and I'm running the latest version 3.50.
When I try to run Firefox Sandboxed it crash immediately when I go to the Add-ons Manager.
I also disabled Java-script and all Add-ons it still crash when going to the add-on manager.
If I start a SANDBOXED Minefield in Safe Mode, the Add-On Manager load properly.

I cannot use the latest minefield with sandboxie because the add-on do not work. Sandboxie doe not crash at all. I will report the problem to www.sandboxie.com a well, but this is possibly a Minefield problem too.

A lot of people use Sandboxie so Firefox should investigate the problem!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Minefield with the program Sandboxie
2.Go to Tools-Add-ons or Ctrl-Shift-A
3.Minefield crash
Actual Results:

Expected Results:
Add-ons Manager should load properly. It shouldn't crash.

Sandboxie is a free unlimited download which is popular. Please just try to see why this is crashing because Sandboxie ha been totally stable for everything else including older version of Minefield! This is possibly related to bug#601355 because before that problem started, Sandboxie and Minefield working fine together. But then I couldn't use Minefield for 3 week until the Javascript bug wa finally fixed. So I don't exactly know which build this particular problem started. I'm saying this is critical because I won't use a web browser unless it is sandboxed and right now, I can't use any add-on because the add-on manager crash with Sandboxie running.
