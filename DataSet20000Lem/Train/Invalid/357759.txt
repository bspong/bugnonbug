' + c should give me a ç (cedilla) but doe not. I had to type it somewhere not in Firefox to copy and paste it here. When I try to type it on Firefox 2.0 (final) I get &#263; (c with acute over it). All other program (KWord, Konsole, OpenOffice, KDE->Run command) work fine (Thunderbird ha the same problem though).
I'm not sure if it matters, since it work everywhere else, but my keyboard is a US one (as yours probably) with us_intl mapping.
Regards.

Extremely annoying since portuguese relies heavily on cedilla.
