The spacing of ascii character (/\_|) used to generate captchas is broken with Firefox 3 beta 3. The result is a "squished" and mis-wrapped mess. Viewing the source show the content rendered properly, a it should.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=submit
2. Scroll to the bottom for ascii captcha
3.
Actual Results:
A "squished" mess of ascii characters.

Expected Results:
Properly formatted content within <pre> tags. It should appear similar to the viewed source.

I will upload a png of a sample captcha affected by this bug.
