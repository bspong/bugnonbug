Just installed Firefox 0.9.3 in same subdir a Mozilla. Invocation of firefox
brings up about a dozen popups warning of Java function missing in xpcom.dll;
and now Mozilla no longer come up ("Mozilla ha generated error and will be
closed by Windows"). A copy of xpcom.dll, dated today, is in the same subdir a
firefox.exe (and mozilla.exe).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a running copy of Mozilla.
2. Install firefox 0.9.3
3. Try to invoke firefox -- many Java error popups referring to xpcom.dll.
4. Try to invoke mozilla -- Win2K error generation popup.

Actual Results:
Noted in step 1 - 4.

Expected Results:
Both Firefox and Mozilla should still have operated a separately invoked
instance of browers.

Missing Java call in xpcom.dll.
