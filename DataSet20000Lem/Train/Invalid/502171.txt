Drag and drop from external apps to firefox doe not work correctly, dragging a link from a email viewed in thunderbird into tab bar of firefox try to load a double url, in address bar it enters the same link text twice which cause a lot of problems.

I'm using latest firefox 3.5 and thunderbird 2.0.0.22 (20090605)

This is a regression, this worked properly in firefox 3.0.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. open a email with link in thunderbird
3. drag the link from thunderbird email into firefox tab bar
Actual Results:
url of the link that firefox open is repeated twice, which cause a lot of problems.

Expected Results:
the link should load properly in the new tab.

i'm running two separate firefox process with separate profile if that affect anything.
