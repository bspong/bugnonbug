Went to the NY Times page:
http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/us/12potomac.html?em

from news.google.com. Was redirected to:
http://best-antivirus03.com/1/?sess=p2Tx1jzwMi02MyZpcD0xMjguMTIwLjE2Mi4yMjQmdGltZT0xMjU2NkAMPQlM

which prevented access to the Minefield menu bar, and attempted to download a malicious executable. A dialog box wa popped up, which required clicking on one or two button before any part of the interface became usable again. After a few attempt to go back to the NY Times page (and being redirected), the attack stopped. Another user replicated the event on their machine. Appears to stop after about 5 attempts.
