My extension add a custom user stylesheet. It mostly work but fails to apply input border CSS directive to webpages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

4. But the top input box still ha no borders! (The exact same CSS directive work if they are in a webpage and not in a user custom stylehseet).
Actual Results:
No borders.

Expected Results:
Borders.
