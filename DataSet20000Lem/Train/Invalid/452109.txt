The log in page for Merrill Lynch doe not work in Firefox 3.01. I tested several time and called Merrill Lynch about it. Finally I switched to Safari, which worked. What should happen: When you type in your ID, the field for the password should disappear. Then you click continue to go to the next round of questioning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I think I said a much a I can in the field above.
Actual Results:
What happens instead in FF 3.01: The password field doe not disappear and an error message appears.

Expected Results:
(stated above)

Merrill Lynch ha recently changed their security system.

In FF, the password field remains on the page, but it should not (the ML representative said this). If I type my password into that field, I still cannot log into my account. So the problem seems to be related to whatever automates the disappearance of the password field.
