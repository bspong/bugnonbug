Page flicker when loading another page

When loading another page after clicking on a link or a bookmark, the page view flicker once or twice very shortly and in this time, arbitrary other content becomes visible in the entire tab view. Mostly that other content come from another open tab, it may also come from a Flash plugin loaded in another tab only. But I've also seen random pixel garbage a few times. It's quite distracting, more so than the jumping Windows 7 border glaze from the other bug.
Could be that hardware acceleration is unstable. I'd try to disable it entirely if somebody tell me how.

Reproducible: Always
