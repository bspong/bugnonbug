Firefox 4 fails to interpret included file if mime type not exactly right.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.204 Safari/534.16
Build Identifier: 4.0

The behaviour of firefox 4 ha changed from 3 (and all other major browser with regard to included cs and javascript files). Currently all browser (except for firefox 4) understand the type of included file from the way it is included e.g. <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="class.css" /> would mean that irrespective of the mime type the server return that included file would be treated a css. Now if the mime type is returned a text/html instead of text/css the file be it javascript or cs is downloaded but ignored. This is a significant issue a combres (and other compression utils) suffers from inability to specify mime type consistently, and any webserver which is missing all mime type configured or cs file that don't have an extension for instance (common with compressed files) will not render properly

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Include an external cs file (with no extension) in a html page, specifying type a stylesheet, e.g. <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/somecssfile-with-no-extension" />
2. Check server return cs file a not text/css e.g. text/html
3. Browse to page
Actual Results:
No style are applied from file, and same applies for javascript

Expected Results:
The browser should be capable of dealing with the file in the way the markup specifies irrespective of content-type header returned in http response. And apply the styles/javascript in the file.

This is breaking a fair number of sites, that use either compression software (which strip the file extension of cs and jscript - preventing the correct mime type being set by the server). Although strictly speaking the server should return the correct mime-type, the browser should also understand that a linked file with it type specified in the link should be treated a that type and not just ignored.
