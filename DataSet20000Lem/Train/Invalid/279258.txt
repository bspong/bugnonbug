When trying to print to PDF, Firefox attempt to print to PDF. It go through
the page count (printing page 1, 2, 3). It stall with the spinning ball icon
for about 30 second to a minute. The it act a though it ha completed the
request properly. When I try to open the PDF with Preview, the file wont open
because it is corrupt. Not all Ebay web page act this way. I would estimate
about 40% do. Note: I do not have the same problem on that web page with I.E.,
Camino, Safari, or Netscape. Those browser create a usable PDF file from that
web page. I am using Mac OS 10.3.7 on a 400mhz G4 computer. The printer driver
is for the Laserjet 1200
