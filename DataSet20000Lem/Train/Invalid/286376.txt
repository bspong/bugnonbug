ESPN.com display javascript application dialog
Currently, when I visit ESPN.com, I'm greeted with a Javascript Application
dialog that so far ha said "false", "cookiefalse", or "cookie2false". The page
then continues to load. If I then click the "Continue on to ESPN.com" link, I'm
again given the same error message and the browser fails to continue on to the
main page.
