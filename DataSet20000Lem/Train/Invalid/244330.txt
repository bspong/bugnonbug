See screenshot.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://slashdot.jp
2. View -> Character Encoding -> Unicode

Actual Results:
See the screenshot. Whole page is rediplayed a garbage. Switching to a
different character set will show the page again.

Expected Results:
Try to display some sort of representation of the page other than a page full of
garbage characters.

I do not have the Japanese font to display the page, could this be a trigger
for this problem? The page is served up a Japanese character set.
