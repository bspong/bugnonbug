Just after the first launch of firefox 0.9RC (old install wa a firefox 0.8 not
nightly)
I reveive 3 time the message box "firefox.exe - Entry Point Not Found"
"The procedure entry point ??1nsCString@@UAE@XZ could not be located in the
dynamic link library xpcom.dll"
And now, at each new launch of firefox, the message box appairs 1 time ...
All extension are disabled except DOM inspector...
The new firefox wa installed on the same directory than the previously 0.8

Maybe a problem in the install (xpcom.dll in use ????? but firefox wa not
running ...) ...

The firefox work well (i'm writing this report with 0.9RC ... but this should
be fixed before the release ...
