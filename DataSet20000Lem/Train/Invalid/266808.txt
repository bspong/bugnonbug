before connecting to the internet (dialup) I open firefox. I used to be able to
select a bookmark, that would bring up the connect to window. I would connect
and get my site. Now when I do this I get an ALERT that say there is no data.
I have changed nothing to precipitate this.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2. select bookmark
3.
Actual Results:
I get an alert saying that there is no data

Expected Results:
It should bring up a box for me to connect to the internet.

I have two computer with firefox. This ha only started to happen on one.

I can work around it by connecting to the internet before opening firefox on the
effected PC, but that us up valuable space in the taskbar by the "Highstream
dialer"
