This page is an export of http://www.pitwall.org/my_namelist.php?action=view but you need to be logged in to view the page, so i've copied it.

When you go to this page, it start downloading and you see the content filling.

But when that's done the entire browser hang for 15 second at least on a Dell Optiplex GX280 (Pentium4 - 3GHz - 512mb). firefox.exe process go to 99% processor time during the freeze.

I've tried to open this page from my harddisk: the result wa the same. The problem is not my internetconnection.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf to the page
2. Wait till the page ha completed downloading
3. Try to go to another tab, open a menu, whatever. It should be stuck by now ;)
Actual Results:
When you wait long enough, the browser come back to life and you can surf like before.

Expected Results:
The application shouldn't freeze. If only that one tab would be "frozen", i could switch to another tab to do something else while the page is being rendered or whatever.
