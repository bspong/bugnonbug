When I recently updated my Firefox my internet connection stopped working. The error wa conflicting IP addresses. I removed Firefox and my internet worked again. I then re-installed the entire program and my internet crashed again and I haven't been able to use it since. Is there a virus on the download?????

Reproducible: Always
