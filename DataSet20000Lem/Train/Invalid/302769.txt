Contacted geocities to see if it wa a problem with coding a the site ha
worked fine in every other browser I have ever tried. Geocities tech support
said that Mozilla is not a good browser, "Garbage" wa the actual description.
Recommended I use netscape or IE. There are no java script or complicated
application on the site, only text and pictures. I still want to use Mozilla,
but it appears incompatible with simple html coding in this case. Is there
something wrong with the site or doe Mozilla simply not like the fonts.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any of the above listed site
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The font diplays incorrectly and change to smaller or larger size randomly
when the coding is for the same size. Roughly half of the link do not work and
appear a just text.


Expected Results:
Displayed the site a every other browser does.

Also when updating in Mozilla, all of the ' punctuation is changed to ?, so it
is impossible to update when using Mozilla.
