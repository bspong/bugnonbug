I prefer it when Cmd-B open the bookmark window and when Cmd-shift-H open the
history in a new window. Actually, it's not even possible to open History in a
new window in Firefox, a far a I can tell. I wish that were possible and I
wish that there were a preference to open History and Bookmarks in new window
instead of sidebars.
