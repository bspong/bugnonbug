UniversalXPConnect, isn't allowing access from a remote script. There is a difference in behavior when script is run locally and when say remote web server, When ran locally asks for allow/deny but in remote case it straightaway reject. Since parent window closing is not possible, having a major issue with dns being cached for 1 minute. I have been trying to reset the dns cache entry and wa successful when script wa run locally but not when ran from a remote site. It would be helpful to have the same behavior. It would be great if you can take this a priority issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have "netscape.security.Privilage" in java script
2.Create a Component class instance of prefs
3.
Actual Results:
Automatically rejecting the access.

Expected Results:
Should ask the user to whether allow or reject the change. Since thats the behavior when ran locally.
