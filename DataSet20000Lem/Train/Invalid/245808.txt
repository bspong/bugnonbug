In the right frame on the main page at http://www.abi-null-drei.de/, the browser
couldn't load the stylesheet file. I tried to place the stylesheet file on both
servers, but in both cases, the file couldn't be loaden.

The left frame is on a different server (
http://www.partysaarfari.de/abiscripte/news/main.php )


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.abi-null-drei.de/
2. that's it, look on the right frame
