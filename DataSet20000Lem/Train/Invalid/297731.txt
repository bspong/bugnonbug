crash during redirect

Crash occurs during redirect from the ap.org homepage via the _AUDIO_ link

The link accesses:

http://customwire.ap.org/dynamic/files/specials/videolineups/audio.html?site=random&selection=home

peculiarity #1 - the crash doe not seem to generate a crash report for
"collector.dll"; at least I don't see the usual info box that the report is
being sent

peculiarity #2 - the crash occurs during the page load for the final target site

peculiarity #3 - it also happens on another system:

This system: AMD - 6K at 500 MHz; 524MB RAM; (Firefox 1.0.4)

Other system: P-II at 400 MHz; 468 MB RAM; (Firefox 1.0.3) - yep; the next
previous version

Commonalities: Both system are running Win98SE, and are accessing the 'net
through a D-Link 513 10T/100 BASE ethernet NIC through a Linksys "Network
Everywhere" 4 - port ethernet router (cable/DSL router) into a Motorola
Surfboard 4200 cable modem (Brighthouose Networks transport, Earthlink account)

Both system also are running Computer Associates' EZ Trust EZ Firewall Lite
firewall (ver. 4.5.554.000) set to "high" security ("stealth" mode).

I have a third system available for test with a different NIC and processor /
memory configuration (P-I at 133 MHz and 32 MB RAM), but I don't know if that
would make any difference...
