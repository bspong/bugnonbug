when I tested every spyware i can think of- what i seen is onestepsearch, zango watch what is done in the web browser. it can cause the browser to start having problem with memory and it flood the browser. The browser also ha a problem with eating to much memory; when the browser open it take up at least 75Mb of page file. With zango and onestepsearch it go to a high 275Mb in memory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download onestepsearch and zango
2. use a packet manager or port watcher on the program
3. watch the toolbar send personal information such a your browsing habits.
Actual Results:
uninstalled mozilla firefox, then the toolbars.

Expected Results:
reinstalled firefox. bloat is still there though.

Mozilla should be written in the program area a le sloppy, and le DLL dependency, what i mean is the le thing the browser ha to load- the faster it work and load up. It would be nice to see it eat 10-15Mb but nothing hard core.
