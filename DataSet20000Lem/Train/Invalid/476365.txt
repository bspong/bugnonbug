Very often, when I browse the web with Google and want to open some particular page, Firefox open another commercial page, taking full screen on top of the one I wanted. The example given above in the URL is just one of many. This never happened with the previous versions, nor did happen all the very frequent crashes.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.try to open this URL:http://www.commentcamarche.net/forum/affich-9968744-firefox-3-0-5


Actual Results:
2.Firefox bounce off to : http://www.priceminister.com/info/home?t=2173342&zanpid=1202987854389881858 in a new window on top of the first one.


it should have stayed on the requested window, without opening a new one. And it should not crash every now and then. Difficult to be more specific. The crash open a window to report the crash which I dutifully send to you.
