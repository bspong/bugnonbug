I had 3.0.4 on 2 Hardy computer and just after updating via Ubuntu repository, Firefox decided not to start again.
The browser can be launched via URL i.e. typing into terminal http://google.com and by right click menu, choosing Open Link.
Then it start with last saved tabs, plus the link that I chose to open. Expected behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Firefox launcher
Actual Results:
Classical "Starting Firefox" is visible on task panel.
Then invisible, but firefox doe not start.

Expected Results:
It should start Firefox.
