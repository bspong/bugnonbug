rdf+xml type is not recognized by Firefox's RSS module

I HAD to change the OSNews code to this, in order to make Firefox to "see" our
RDF feed.

<link REL="alternate" TITLE="OSNews RDF" HREF="//osnews.com/files/recent.rdf"
TYPE="application/rss+xml">

Before, I had it type a rdf+xml, and that wa not recognized by Firefox
(it's a proposed type by the W3). Please add support for the rdf+xml type, so
I don't have to "fool" Firefox to be able to see it a rss+xml.
