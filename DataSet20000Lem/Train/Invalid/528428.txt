Find bar doesn't seem to allow input of certain key sometimes, usually 'n' and 's' an 'l', usually around the 2nd and 3rd letter of words, for eg. "find", long", "animal", "follow" etc. Sometimes, it requires 2 key press for some letter to show up, again usually on the 2nd or 3rd letter of a word. Doing this fix the other problem temporarily a well.

No problem at all with inputting any character a the first letter of a word.

No problem seen with input on any other applications, or other place within firefox, eg address bar, field etc.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.ctrl+f
2.type "non" or "nnn"
3.
Actual Results:
Find field doesn't allow input of 2nd "n" in both case

Expected Results:
Find field should allow input of all characters.

The problem seems to disappear from time to time. Additionally, the field requires 2 button press to make certain letter appear, eg, "r", for eg "arnold" ha to be typed "a r r n o l d". Typing in the 2 "r"s cause the problem with the other key to be fixed temporarily until you click away from the find bar.
