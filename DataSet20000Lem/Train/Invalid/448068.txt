a:hover applies to all anchor instead of just to links...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create an anchor (<a name="blah">Blah</a>)
2.add cs (<style type="text/css">a:hover {color:red;}</style>)
3.render
Actual Results:
the anchor turn red when you hover over it

Expected Results:
the anchor should not change

dunno if this is a CSS issue or a Firefox issue...(I tried looking at the CSS documentation, but when I didn't find any mention of this effect in reference material I just didn't have the time to slog through the really deep stuff and hoped since this effect doesn't show up in IE [blech] that it might be a bug)

despite the wonder of standard compliance, I'd suggest that we strongly consider (if CSS would say that this is correct behavior) modifying this so that anchor aren't included because it make use of anchor and hover effect on link problematic (besides being completely counter intuitive).
