Incorrect display of text entry box if anything but the default monosmaced font is installed.

In Netscape 7,2, go into the "appearance" section of the "edit preferences"
menu, under "fonts" and change the monospaced font from the default "courier
New" to "corporate mono", if you have it. Then try to browse a form that
contains a text entry box, and you will see the mishandling of the textarea tag.
The textarea is truncated at the left margin and doe not accept input, which
is accepted outside the box in an un wrapped continuous line.

If you don't have "corporate mono", I can supply the normal Win .ttf file.
Goes in window font directory.

A form to browse is at: http://www.lhasa-apso.org/breeders/listme.htm
But any form on the internet will give the same result.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change preference monospaced font from "Courier New" to "Corporate mono" (or
other monospaced font)
2. Browse any form that us a textarea box, using the "textarea" hTML tag.
3.

Actual Results:
The textarea is truncated at the left margin and doe not accept input, which
instead is accepted outside to the right of the box in an unwrapped continuous
line. This change the horizontal screen dimension to the maximum, rendering it
virtually unusable.

Expected Results:
It should have presented a box for text input of x column and y rows.
