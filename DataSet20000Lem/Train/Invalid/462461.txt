"ASSERTION: Bookmark hash table out-of-sync with the database"
One of my Firefox profile is screwed up in such a way that starting Firefox prints:

###
### mDiskDevice->Init() failed (0x8000ffff)
### - disabling disk cache for this session.
###

and within 30 seconds:

###!!! ASSERTION: Bookmark hash table out-of-sync with the database: 'realBookmarked == *aBookmarked', file /Users/jruderman/central/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavBookmarks.cpp, line 2296

Using mozilla-central, build is about an hour old.
