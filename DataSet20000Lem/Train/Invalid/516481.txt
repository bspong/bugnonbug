Even if you Ctrl-Shift-Del and choose to clear everything. Twitter will still remember my username and password. So I think it is not really clearing the form. I have noticed this on one or two other site also.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into Twitter (I'm not sure here if you have to tell Firefox to remember your user/password or not) try both
2. Then Ctrl - Shift - Del - Choose the option to erase Everything.
3. Go back to http://www.twitter.com - click the sign in menu thing. Your username and password should be still be there.
Actual Results:
Go back to http://www.twitter.com - click the sign in menu thing. Your username and password should be still be there.

Expected Results:
When I want to clear everything... I mean everything.

This is happening in version 3.5.3
