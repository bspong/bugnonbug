the screen is now divided - in the upper part every menue/submenue option, which
had to be accessed through a drop-down list is noe displayed a tiny icon
aligned on the left border of the screen; on MouseOver they disappear.
The lower part (you need to scroll down to find out that there is more to be
seen) show the usual main icon more ore le correctly, but occupies maybe
only maybe a third of the screen area than it used to.

Reproducible: Always
