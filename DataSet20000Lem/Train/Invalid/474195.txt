.info domain site doesn't load by "info" proxy settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I add one webhost "info" on proxy allowed host like:
user_pref("network.proxy.no_proxies_on", "info, localhost, 127.0.0.1");

2. my webhost http://Info/ site load fine without proxy, but http://www.any.site.info/ doesn't load by proxy.

Actual Results:
it is working like that on IE: "*info; localhost; 127.0.0.1" - doing "info; localhost; 127.0.0.1" it allows site with .info domain.


I just want to bypass proxy for my host "info" but I want to define all .info domain site to work by proxy.
