right margin of printed page is truncated

When the page at http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-
cherrypy/ is printed, text on the right side of the printed page is
truncated. I'm pretty sure this is a Firefox problem, because IE doesn't show
the same problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-cherrypy/
in Firefox
2. Print it.
3.

Actual Results:
text on the right side of the printed page is truncated.

Expected Results:
NOT truncated the text. Wrapped it to fit the page width.
