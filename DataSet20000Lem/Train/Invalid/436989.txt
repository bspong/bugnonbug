In the LibX extension, we embed icon in a web page by adding <img src="chrome://skin/libx/someicon.ico"> element to a client's DOM.

FF 3.0 RC1 (though not FF 3.0b5) disallows this access unless we set contentaccessible=yes.

This is contrary to the documentation at http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Chrome_Registration#contentaccessible which state that contentaccessible=yes allows untrusted content access to chrome:// URL.

In this case, the content attempting to access the chrome:// URL is trusted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download http://libx.org/editions/vt.5/libx-vt.xpi
2. Go to: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006073132X
3. See the broken image next to "(Hardcover)"

Repeat the same in FF 3.0b5 or FF 2.0.0.14 and you see the correct link.

Actual Results:
The image is broken unless I specify contentaccessible=yes

Expected Results:
The image should be shown even if contentaccessible=yes is not given, because contentaccessible applies only to untrusted content. Here, the script performing the insert() action is trusted.

Please either fix this, or, better, explain to me how I can insert a <img src="chrome://...." /> element in a script from within a trusted extension without FF thinking that untrusted content is attempting to access chrome://

If I must set contentaccessible=yes, justify why I need to open *all* of my extension to untrusted content, rather than just the skin/ subdirectory.
