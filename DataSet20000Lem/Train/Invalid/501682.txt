when using the addon "reload every" on the new version of firefox 3.5, I get the above error repeatedly. It doesn't matter if I have 2 tab or 12 tab open reloading. It only seems to happen when using the reload every.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few tab in firefox.
2. Set reload every to 5 second and enable all tabs.
3. Wait.
Actual Results:
After just 1-2 minutes, I received the error A script on this page ha been stopped due to a low memory condition.

Expected Results:
Tabs should just reload every 5 second with no errors.

I had no problem with the previous version of Firefox. I would like to have the Firefox 3.0.10 again until this is resolved, how do I do that? I also don't know how to check and see what "theme" I'm using.
