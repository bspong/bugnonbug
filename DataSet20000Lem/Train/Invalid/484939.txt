form field are not submitted if the form itself is changed trough a javascript. (worked on previous version of FF)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7

if there is a form, and you change the number of the field of the form, based on a dropdown (for example you ask the nationality on a registration form and based on that you display or not the zip code) then the field that is, or is not displayed (<div></div>) doe not submit it content.

simple schematic example:

<javascript>
funtion (update)
{
document.getElementById("test").innerHTML = '<input type="textbox" >';
}
</javascript>

<form>
<input dropdown onchange="update">
<input textbox>
<div id="test"></div>
<input submit>
</form>


Please note that this example is just to show the page structure, it is not a working example to copy and paste..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a form with a dropdown or any other action that can execute a javascript
2. add a javascript that change a empty div to a new form field
3. execute the page, do the action needed to display the new field, submit the page
Actual Results:
the data entered in the field displayed by the javascript is not submitted. it worked properly on the previous version of FF (3.0.6) and work fine in internet explorer. so the page itself is ok.

Expected Results:
the data should be submitted just normal

this bug is urgent, since it prevents proper registration on many sites.
