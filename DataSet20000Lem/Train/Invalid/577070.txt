It would be nice to know the file size already on the client without have to upload it on the server. I don't see any security issue by exposing this information on the client and on the other side it can be used to block the upload of large files. Today you have to upload the file to perhaps reply the user that the file size ha exceed the limit. A simple javascript check would be more efficient.

Reproducible: Always
