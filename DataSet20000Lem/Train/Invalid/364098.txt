2.0 Browser hang for 10-15s after page ha finished loading (was responsive for 4s, then freezes) when running Norton Antivirus Corporate Edition v7
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

Whenever I load or refresh a page, the browser finish loading, I can use the page (scroll, type, whatever) for about 4s. Then the browser freeze and is completely unresponsive for 10-15s. This ha happened since I upgraded to 2.0.

I have tried a new profile, uninstalling all add-ons, and a clean install (of the same version.) I have tried Safe Mode. It is reproducible no matter what I do. This only happens in Firefox. All other apps on the machine are fine a far a I can tell.

Additionally (not sure if it's related) I rarely have a taskbar icon for Firefox. It randomly appears and disappears. I have no Firefox icon right now while I type. See bug 345856.

I am on XP2. It happens on every site I go to. It happens whether there is one tab open or multiple. It happens no matter whether the browser ha just been started or ha been open for days. Nothing fix it. It even happens when I switch tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox
2. Load any page (even your home page whether yahoo or mozilla.)
3. Bingo

Actual Results:
Browser load page, ok for a few seconds, then freeze completely for 10-15s.

Expected Results:
It shouldn't be freezing.

This ha happened since I upgraded to 2.0. I have tried everything... registry tweaks, parameter tweaks, accelerators, removing IE 7 (just in case there wa a conflict.) Nothing is working. I'm using the default theme.

This probably isn't relevant, but ...
