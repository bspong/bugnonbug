system reboot on specific search text

OK, so it's weird. But it happens every time...
Windows XP Home SP2
AMD Athlon 2200+
1.67GHz-512 MB RAM
Firefox 1.0.3 EN-EN (not EN-US) release

Every time I enter the text "Poirot-Delpech Crête" into the search box the
system reboots. No warning, nothing. "Poirot-Delpech Crete" doesn't crash it
(note no accent on 'e'). I wondered if there wa some kind of bug relating to
accented character in the search box? Reproduced it twice on my system, will
try with others ASAP but getting rather tired of crashing mine. Incidentally,
"crête" alone doesn't reboot the system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot Firefox (I had more than one tab open first time, only one on reproducing)
2. Enter "Poirot-Delpech Crête" into search box (I think my default is Google,
not Google UK)
3. Hit enter. Make cup of tea while system reboots.
Actual Results:
Reboot. Windows restarts, usual "Kernel Fault Check" and "Windows Error
Reporting" spiel. Windows Error Reporting say it wa caused by "an unknown
device driver" (I assume this is the default when they don't have a clue?)

Expected Results:
Should have searched for specified text and not rebooted.

This is using the default theme - in fact the only change I have made to the
1.0.3 installation (having used automatic update since FireFox 0.9rc, and that
wa the released Win32 installer package) are the installation of the plug-in
specified in the attachment.
