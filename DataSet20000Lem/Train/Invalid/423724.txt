Tools/Page Info/Security :

"Have I saved any password for this website ?" => "No"

Clicking "View Saved Passwords", I saw I already had a password for this site so this information wa eroneous.

As a bonus, I won't put an "s" after "any password"


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Tools
2.Page Info
3.Security
4.View Saved Passwords
Actual Results:
Says no password is stored for this site but once password list opened, it show one.

Expected Results:
Says "yes", because I have a password saved for this site

Got a screenshot, attaching it ASAP
