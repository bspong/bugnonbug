Keywords added using the add bookmark popup window doe not save keyword, only the bookmark. In order to use a keyword, it ha to get added to property after the bookmark is stored.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. navigate to any web page
2. ctrl-D to open add bookmark menu
3. add keyword in the "tags" line - click "done" to save
Actual Results:
When keyword that wa added is used, it try to go to the http://<keyword> location rather than the actual bookmark url. Keyword is not saved with bookmark.

Expected Results:
The keyword should be stored a part of the bookmark and the keyword should navigate to referenced bookmark url when used.

This is probably a duplicate of some other bug but multiple search only show similar bug from year ago.

If the key word is manually added to the property after the bookmark is added, then the keyword is then stored and functions.
