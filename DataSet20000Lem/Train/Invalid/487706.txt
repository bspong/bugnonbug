This what appears in the address line when I try to access email
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/3.0.8

What should be appearing is https://mailcenter.comcast.net How do I rewrite the proper code so I can access my mail without having to go to Google and type it in search line there. My computer won't even let me type it in the address line if I have Firefox open. It default to your stupid code!!!! Otherwise I have been a loyal and very satisfied customer of Firefox but this last upgrade?????

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox.
2.Get error message "page taking to long to open" along with above address line which definitely is an error. "Try again"
3.Go to Google for work around.
Actual Results:
I already contacted Comcast. They have said it is a software problem and they are working on it from their end, but they are not sending the code. You are. I checked my computer setting and my computer say it is set for "mailcenter.comcast.net" I had NO problem til this last update. What's up?

Expected Results:
Given that nothing else is wrong but the gobbledy gook in the address line,I would expect that nothing is going to change until that is fixed.

The software should have sent Comcast "https://mailcenter.comcast.net"

I am using the default theme. I also have lost all my add-ons, plug-ins, settings, toolbars, etc., and have had to rebuild everything. What a mess.
