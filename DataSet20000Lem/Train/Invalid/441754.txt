When i select more than one bookmark in Organize Bookmark and click in "Abrir tudo em abas" (portuguese), something like "open all in tabs", all current tab are closed before the bookmark are opened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.open some tabs, let say, 4 tab
3.open organize bookmark
4.select, let say, 2 bookmark
5.select "Abrir tudo em abas" (portuguese) in the context menu
Actual Results:
the first 2 tab are used to the bookmark selected and the other 2 tab are closed

Expected Results:
actually, i whould prefer to open the bookmark in new tabs, so i would have 6 tabs, 4 that are opened already and the new 2 tab for the bookmarks, but if it opened the 2 bookmark in the 2 first tab would work to, but not to close the other tab
