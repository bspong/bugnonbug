Mozilla development related tag added accidentally?

I think someone checked in a pre-populated list of tags, which would be nice (bug 408780) but the tag that are in there now are all related to mozilla development and should be removed. See screenshot

Eg. of tags:
bonsai
tinderbox
status meeting
litmus
hendrix
