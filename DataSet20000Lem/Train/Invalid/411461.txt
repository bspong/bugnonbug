investigate client side sql injection
client side usage of sql make suite vulnerable to client side sql
injections.

iirc there wa a bugzilla bug about a sql injection in dead code (don't
remember the bug number atm)

potentially buggy method is:
ExecuteSimpleSQL

i grep'ped for it usage but couldn't find any bugs.

are there other functions/methods like ExecuteSimpleSQL that execute a sql
string that should be checked?

probably it is a good idea to add a scary comment in ExecuteSimpleSQL about
the danger of it usage.
