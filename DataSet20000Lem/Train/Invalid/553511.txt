Firefox beta doesn't identify itself a a beta
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/3.6.2

I just ran "Help -> Check for updates" using Firefox 3.6.0 under Vista. The window said 3.6.2 wa available, so I let it upgrade. "Help -> About Mozilla Firefox" identifies it a Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2) Gecko/20100316 Firefox/[b]3.6.2[/b]

The only mention that it a beta is that AFTER I upgraded it opened a http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6.2/whatsnew/ tab that say "Thanks for helping u beta test Firefox 3.6.2!" and later on mention it beta3. I checked app.update.channel and it is set to beta.

Why doesn't the beta identify itself a a beta? Its a beta, not a release candidate or a final release. I don't want to upgrade every time there is a beta, I just want the option. In this case there wasn't anything worth the risk (no interesting features, important security fix or bug fix that I cared about (the NYTimes article skimmer web page is still broken)), so I wouldn't have upgraded if I had known it wa a beta.
