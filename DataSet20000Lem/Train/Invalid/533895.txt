Bookmarks not available after upgrade from Firefox 3.5 to 3.6b4

I have both Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6b4 installed. When I open 3.5 I can see my bookmarks, but when I open Firefox 3.6b4, I have no bookmark in the tool bar or under the bookmark menu.

Interestingly, when I click 'bookmark this page' inside 3.6b4, nothing show up, but when I switch back to 3.5, the bookmark is listed!

I'm not entirely sure, but I'd say 'Bookmarks don't work' is a Major feature, but if I'm an isolated case, I guess it not a major issue.

Reproducible: Always
