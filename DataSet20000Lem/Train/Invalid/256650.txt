Tried a number of different character set on the latest nightly of Firefox
and none of them seem to want to render &prime; or &Prime;. This is important
for site like wikipedia that need this functionality in their mathematics
sections. What are being rendered are little box with the numbers:

"2032" and "2033" in place of the correct glyphs.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the webpage above with the latest nightly
