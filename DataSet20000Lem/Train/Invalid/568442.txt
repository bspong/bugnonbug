If I either Quit using menu command, or close via Task Mgr for hanging during session, I am not able to open Firefox because it is still running (somewhere...) It present problem when trying to load program requiring exit from the browser because I usually have to reboot to get it to turn off ( a small window DOES pop up saying "close firefox now?" during that process so SOMETHING is running. Since scanning and repairing registry with PCFIX 20109 to improve computer speed), I can now stop Firefox by holding down the CTRL + X key for a minute or so until the icon stop flashing, which seems to indicate that it is closed...
A related problem is that the X/Close Window button sometimes close ALL windows, and no command key will bring up them or new ones...I have to somehow quite Firefox and restart a new session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.quit using menu command or X (close)button OR through Task MGR
2.always happens no matter how I exit the program...even happened with my brief try at the Beta, which Ii have given up due to my inexperience and lack of time
3.
Actual Results:
Must reboot the computer OR hold down CTRL + X for a minute (icon flash and when it stops, I can restart Firefox.

Expected Results:
It should stop running when you Exit any way you do it...

Many time the X/Close button DOES NOT WORK , especially if there are more than 2 window open. Either nothing happens or ALL window close, and the computer say that Firefox is still running, a in the main bug reported above by me and by many others
