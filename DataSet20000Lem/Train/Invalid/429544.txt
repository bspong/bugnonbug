This bug is very much related to Bug 423247.

In that bug, I described a problem with Ffox 3 beta 4 when visiting www.renfe.es (spanish railways). The bug wa fixed, but now in Ffox 3 beta 5, the behaviour on the same webpage is different, but it's still not possible to add an exception.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.renfe.es (spanish ralways)
2. There's a pull down menu with the text "Principales Estaciones Origen"
(departure train stations). In that menu, select any entry (for instance,
"Madrid")
3. Then, within the same iframe, a warning message show up, with the following message:
................
Secure Connection Failed
w1.renfe.es us an invalid security certificate.
The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is not trusted.
(Error code: sec_error_untrusted_issuer)
....................

I wa able to copy the whole text with mouse selection, but the whole text cannot be seen. Next I will add a screenshot.


Actual Results:
It's not possible to scroll down, and therefore it's not possible to add an exception (not possible to press any button or link to add exception).

Expected Results:
The error message (warning) should appear in a way such that the user can add an exception if they wish.
