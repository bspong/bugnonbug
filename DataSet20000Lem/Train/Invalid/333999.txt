In my cookie preference I have decided to allow site to set cooky and only originating sites. In my exception I have blocked all cooky that match *doubleclick* pattern.

When I visit www.cbc.ca I get a cookie from doubleclick. (Yes, they may use IFrame or redirect trick or whatever). But my understanding of cookie exception it seems is wrong. I though that if I said "Block *doubleclick*", it meant block the damn cookie from *doubleclick* no matter how it attempt to get on my computer, even if I visit www.doubleclick.com from address bar, their cooky should still be blocked, because of my exception setting.

If my understanding of this is wrong, then you should really provide the user with the ability to do what I want to do, and rename the misleading "Exceptions" feature to something more appropriate.

Reproducible: Always
