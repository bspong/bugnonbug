"send link" won't use the default email
When I press "send link" the browser start Outlook Express rather than Netscape
mailer 7.1. I have tried goting to the "set defaults" in my start menue and
selecting the Netscape email client, but Firefox continues to use start Outlook
Express with the page link. I just upgraded my Firefox to versoin 1.0 but the
problem remains.
