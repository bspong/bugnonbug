First CSS menu position by DIV absolute display OK.

Second CSS menu also positioned by DIV absolute doe not display in FF 3.5 nor doe subsequent item outside that DIV.

Have now merged both DIV separated CSS menu into one DIV whilst keeping both CSS menu a separate block of coding. Instead of having the first CSS menu displayed now neither are displayed.

IE7 and FF 2.0.9 display the page perfectly.

Have renamed li and ul to xxx... and it made no difference.
Have removed the CSS no overflow but it made no difference.

Validated with W3C the HTML and CSS = both clean.

For demonstration purpose have disabled the background picture.
