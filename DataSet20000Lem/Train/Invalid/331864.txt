Setting a top margin on a child div inside of a parent div will apply the top margin to the parent div if the parent div contains a child div with a top margin a the parent's first content (I believe all block element produce the same results: i.e. a...

The margin bug can be seen using the above example. What I believe should be happening is the parent div should be flush up against the top of the browser window and the child div should be 15 pixel from the top of the parent div. However, what is happening is the child div's top margin is being applied to the parent div. If content (text) is placed after the div, the bug still happens, but if content is placed before the child div, the bug doesn't happen.

I tried using a span element displayed a a block (display: block;) and the margin bug still occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a parent div: <div id="parent">
2. Open and close a child div: <div id="child">&nbsp;</div>
3. Close the parent div: </div>

The child div (or block element) should have a top margin set. It's easier to see the effect if both element have a unique background color (background-color: #xxxxxx;) set.
Actual Results:
The parent div (or block element) inherited the child div's (or block element) top margin.

Expected Results:
The parent div (or block element) should not have inherited the child div's (or block element) top margin.

This bug can be produced very easily. It cause major layout problems.
