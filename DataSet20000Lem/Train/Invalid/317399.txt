Hyperlinks won't work and I can't get past the first page of the site.

The site open and all of the link work in Internet Explorer, but in Mozilla none of the link work and I'm stuck on the first page. I loaded the web site but I need it to work in Firefox and don't know how to get it to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in address.
2.Try to click on links.
3.Nothing happens.



Expected Results:
Nothing. New page won't open, nothing even show up when I place the mouse pointer over where the link is supposed to be.

Links should take me to other page of the web site.
