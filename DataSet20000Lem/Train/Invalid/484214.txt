I have a fixed width wrapper div with margin set to auto on the left and right. When I add a border the div is no longer centered but rather shifted right by the width of the border. It would appear that border width are ignored when the left margin is being calculated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a fixed width div with margin set to auto and a wide border.
2. create an equivalent div without the border
3. notice that their left-hand margin are the same when they should both be centered.
Actual Results:
See the URL supplied for a demonstration.

Expected Results:
Both containing block should be centered regardless of border width.
