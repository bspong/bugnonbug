Remove app-specific #ifdefs from nsContentTreeOwner.cpp
Ostensibly for bug 215296 hyatt added an #ifdef into nsContentTreeOwner.cpp so
that Firefox window title would not have the " - Firefox" suffix although
untitled document would still generate a Firefox title. Surely it would have
been better to #ifdef the chrome file instead?
