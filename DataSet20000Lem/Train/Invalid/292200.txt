Problem of display of a input area based on a CSS

I cannot see correctly a input area based on a CSS.

When the pixel size is under 10, it seems to have a problem.

My CSS code :

.button {
color: #575b5e;
font-size: 9px;
font-family: Verdana;
background-color: #FFF
}


My HTML sentence (based on the .CSS file)

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#f9d1d1" align="center" colspan="2"><input type="text"
name="TEXT_D_DEBUT" class="button" value="28-03-2005" size="11" maxlength="10">
</td>
</tr>



Under last Internet Explorer 6 version, it's perfectly displayed. Under Firefox
1.0.3, it seems to be like 10px ! And the background-color is without any effect !

Reproducible: Always
