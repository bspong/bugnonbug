I copied some line from the table from
http://www.literaturhaus.at/autoren/H/horvath/fotografien/

When I wanted to paste into Google, it just pasted the first line. I tried the
same on several other websites. It seems that this just occures at this page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.literaturhaus.at/autoren/H/horvath/fotografien/
2. select some line of the text below the picture
3. and copy it to the clipboard either by shortcut or right-click -> copy

Actual Results:
It just pasted the first selected line.

Expected Results:
It should have passted all two lines.
