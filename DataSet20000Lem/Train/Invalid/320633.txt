I have installed FF1.5 upgrading from 1.07

I have two machines: XP and Win98 respectively.
The install on the XP machine ha no problems.

The install on the win98 machine ha resulted in a grey bar below
the status bar. Switching off the various toolbars ha not helped
The bar contains a single ^ symbol approximately half-way down
on the left hand side.

It is not affected by the choice of theme - I have tried switching
between theme with no change.
