XMLHttpRequest failed when used in *first* external script on the page.

I use ScriptLoader class to dynamically load JS-files. It us synchronous XMLHttpRequest to load external script, and then evaluates received contents. Right after definition of the ScriptLoader class I use it to load script.js that alert 'Success.' string. The problem is occured when loader.js is attached in the head of a page in the first place, with no preceding <script /> element that load external scripts. I have tested that many time to figure the problem out. View the example at http://1m.kiev.ua/dynjsloadtest/. As you can see (I use FireBug), XMLHttpRequest work well only in approx. 30%-40% case (alerting 'Success.'). Other 60%-70% are fails.
