In the Firefox 4 RC1, extensions.checkCompatibility seems to have no effect anymore. This is the case both with and without the Add-on Compatibility Reporter extension installed. Tested with both new and old profile on both Win7 and OS X.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set extensions.checkCompatibility to false in about:config
2. Restart Firefox
3. Attempt to install incompatible addon or open addon manager to view previously installed incompatible addons
Actual Results:
Incompatible addons are still disabled.

Expected Results:
Incompatible addons will still load (or at least attempt to)
