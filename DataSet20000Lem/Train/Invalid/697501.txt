Steps to reproduce:

To view live streaming a site installed Inbox searchbar on my computer. It wa a load of crap so I uninstalled it. On IE everything went away. On firefox, even though I killed it a a search engine (it wasn't listed a an addon, plugin, or anything else) when I type any name in the site address line that isn't associated with ".com" (etc) then the "Inbox" search engine come up with the thing I typed in. I have Google a my default search engine. Inbox is listed no where. They have figured out how to get around something in your code or it isn't uninstalling correctly for FF.


Actual results:

The Inbox search engine redirects my search criterion to their engine - unauthorized.


Expected results:

Google should have launched with my search criterion
