Now since Firefox 2.0, the default style for tab's close icon is to only display the close icon on the current tab,
while I think the Eclipse tab style is more reasonable, i.e.
Show close icon on current tab, but also show close icon on other tab when the mouse hover on them.

Please consider this, minor code change, but with noticeable user experience improvement. :)


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
only show tab's close icon on current tab

Expected Results:
show tab's close icon like the style in Eclipse
