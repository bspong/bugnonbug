On certain sites, CTRL-Left Click doe not work on weblinks a expected and instead work a if only Left Click wa pressed. This mean that the link open in the same tab rather than opening a new tab. Right clicking and selecting "open in new tab" and middle mouse button work a expected.

This behavior ha been noted on Yahoo Mail Classic webmail (mail.yahoo.com), when clicking on message and folders. There have also been unverified report of it occurring on ebay.co.uk. Further information on this is located on the provided URL which describes the issue on the Mozilla Forums.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign in to a Yahoo Mail webmail account (mail.yahoo.com)
2. Left click on "Inbox" on the left hand side
3. CTRL-Left click on any message in the inbox.
Actual Results:
Message open in the same window, replacing the inbox folder display.

Expected Results:
Message should have opened in a separate tab.

This issue ha been documented a occurring in safe mode (with all customizations off) and on two separate system (thanks to smsmith). It may be the result of some specialized script that Yahoo is running which suppresses this behavior. Setting "browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction = 0" did not solve this bug.
