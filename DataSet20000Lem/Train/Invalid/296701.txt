When I open Bookmarks and I try to right click on a bookmark (I.E to change name
or delete) the roll down menu doesn't appear. All I see is a small grey square.
When opening bookmark again, the bookmark link is broken. After starting
Firefox again, bookmark work but I still can't right click on them. (Sorry if I
didn't explain well enough but I'm from Holland and my technical english isn't
all that good)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on "Bookmarks"
2.Right click on any bookmark
3.See the little grey square!

Actual Results:
The little grey square appears and the bookmark link doesn't work.

Expected Results:
It should have opened the roll down menu in which I could for example change the
name or delete the bookmark.
