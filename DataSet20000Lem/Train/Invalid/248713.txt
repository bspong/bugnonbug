Firefox 0.9 browser never appears after installing over Firefox 0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

I wa successfully using Firefox 0.8 for several weeks., when I decided to go to
Firefox 0.9.. I DID NOT UNINSTALL FIREFOX 0.8 BEFORE INSTALLING FIREFOX 0.9 ON
MY WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL SYSTEM. I then had the problem that Firefox 0.9
would never bring up it browser window. The Firefox process would be there, but
never any browser window. I tried following the step regarding deleting the
profile directory but that did not help. I also followed the instruction
contained on the mozilla support page,
http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.phtml?title=Firefox_:_Issues:_Firefox_Won't_Startup
but that did not help either. I have redownloaded and then uninstalled and
reinstalled FireFox 0.9 again, but still no success with EVER bringing up the
Firefox 0.9 browser window. I would sincerely appreciate any suggestion to what
could be causing my problem. I have seen this problem on WINDOWS 2000
Professional. Both of these operating system were up to date a far a the
latest critical update from Microsoft were concerned. In the meantime, I will
stay with Firefox 0.8, which I wa able to reinstall just fine and it now work
a it did before I tried to upgrade to FireFox 0.9.

Please email me at rdachows@us.ibm.com or just post your message here in this
mozilla forum.
