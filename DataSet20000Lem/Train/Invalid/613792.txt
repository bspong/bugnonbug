i have two suggestion

sometimes i get soo many tab that it hard to keep sifting them

allow me to right click on the tab and get a vertical list up of what tab i have in this window, then allow me to sort them according to topic with the parent at the left (if firefox monitor which tab come from which tab this can be done automatically - maybe even show a tree) then every topic i have can have a new row of tab or a row of tab moved to another window.

saving more tabs:
also when closing window it asks me if i am sure if i want to close all the tabs, have a third option, that is close firefox saving the tab and the windows. and bring them all back when user run again. the only way to do this right now is to have firefox crash or something.

Charlie.

Reproducible: Always
