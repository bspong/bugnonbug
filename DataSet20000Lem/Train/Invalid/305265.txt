image and html graphic will not load in Firefox, they work fine in IE
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I have had problem with Mozilla in the past upon encountering a virus,
sometimes it just crashes. I have difficulty resetting the user profile.
This time all image and some html graphic are effected. I did not see a
virus message, no image will load although Java and Java Script are enabled in
the Options file. I have tried clearing everything and rebooting, and I tried
to download a new version of Firefox and it came up with the same problem. Some
text show but will not respond to clicks, some text simply doe not show, and
no image show. I may have updated an extension the same night I encountered
the problem for the first time. The first site I had the problem on wa
Epitonic.com.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.select yahoo mail on the toolbar(no Icons will show, just the word: Mail)
2.go to email account (or My Yahoo, or anywhere)
3.Look for image and html graphic

Actual Results:
no image appear in email that had images, some link work and others will not

Expected Results:
If I go to My Yahoo I should see image when I click on a news story, if I go to
Mail I should be able to Mark a message a read. I can't do either.

I check Get Fuzzy at Comics.com every morning. The strip are not there now,
there is no box to click to procuce the images, but the other graphic are the
and most are interactive.
I have to use IE for some thing now.
I hate using IE
I hate it
