F6 move focus to frame but JAWS announces nothing
1. Open the following URL:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/UA/TS/html401/cp0203/0203-FRAME-TITLE-TEST.html

2. When F6 is used to move focus from frame to frame on a web page containing
frames. Jaws doe not read the frame title. This is a problem with firefox and
not JAWS I believe. When f6 is pressed to move focus to the next frame nothing
in the frame is given focus. The first link in the frame should receive focus
or if the frame is being revisited, the link that had focus last during the
previous visit.
