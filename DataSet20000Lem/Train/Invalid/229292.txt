Irrelevant error message pop-up whenever textarea is clicked

Whenever I left-click within a textarea (multiline textbox), a pop-up appears
with the message:

mozex error: temporary directory 'C:\Windows\temp' not found

Now, this message should not appear anyway, but the fact is that I don't even
have a C:\Windows directory, nor do I have any environment variable with
C:\Windows\temp in it value.

I have had the same problem with another build, from about a week ago.

This doe not happen when right-clicking or when tabbing my way into the textarea.
