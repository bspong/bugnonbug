Hi, because of the limit on vertical space on modern day computer (16:9) I have decided to get rid of the bookmark tool bar and move the Bookmark Tool bar item folder to the address bar.

But when you open up firefox you get two arrow like the below link

In order to solve this you need to right click and click on customize

And then press ok and then it work and you get the below

Noticed now that it read bookmark now. Is there a way to make it always read bookmark instead of doing the thing that I wa doing. It is becoming a pain and it is not theme related a all the theme work in the same way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place the bookmark tool bar item in the address bar
2. Restart Firefox
3. The folder ha a double arrow icon ">>"
4. Right Click Customize
5. Press OK
6. ">>" disappears and replaced with Bookmarks.
Actual Results:
It is explained above I think

Expected Results:
It should not have the ">>" to start off with.

Nothing much, the URL image attach should be ok for you to follow.
