I saw this minor problem on previous releases, although it seemed worse with FF3.5. I determined a "fix" for the problem, but that fix didn't seem necessary, so I'm still submitting this bug.

I have modified the toolbar layout to place some bookmark on the same line a the file menu. There is sufficient space, but FF decides to put up the ">>" button.

Since there used to be a loading circle icon there, there wa a spacer on that line. By removing that spacer, FF3.5 function properly. However, that spacer should have been able to compress down to almost nothing to prevent the ">>" from appearing, IMHO.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Setup:
1. Customize toolbar:
1a. move bookmark toolbar item to the right of File... area.
1b. add spacer to the right of bookmark toolbar items.
2. Add just enough bookmark to bookmark toolbar to almost fill that area, so it come close to right side of the window.

Then:
1. Open browser. FF will not show all bookmarks, but will place ">>" button instead.
2. Widen browser so that all bookmark appears, then unwiden back to original size. All bookmark will be present.

"Fix":
1. Customize toolbar again, and remove spacer.
2. FF will behave ok now.
Actual Results:
Spacer cause bookmark not to fit.

Expected Results:
Spacer should compress to almost nothing to prevent bookmark from overflowing onto ">>"
