FireFox randomly freeze my entire computer while browsing....HELP!
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

I recently upgraded from 1.5.0.7 to 1.5.0.9 without installing any new applications. I then started to experience random freeze when I have firefox running on my computer (Windoze XP SP1). I must then reboot my computer and then I will start firefox up again and it will again freeze (sometimes it's 4 minute later, sometimes 1 hour later).

I'm not sure what the problem is because I haven't installed anything lately, therefore I tried reverting back to 1.5.0.7 and now even it freeze on me!! (Perhaps that is because I did not actually "uninstall" 1.5.0.9, I just installed over it??)

Please advise!! Is this a known bug within 1.5.0.9?? Thanks
