Cannot Customize Toolbars

After upgrading to Firefox 3.6 my customized toolbars were OK.
Tired to customize my toolbar again. ANY change result in Menus being grayed-out.
Exiting and reloading Firefox the change to the Toolbar is gone, but Menus are OK.
Did try Firefox Safe-Mode, clear Toolbars/Settings. Could NOT make ANY change to the default toolbar. Got same problem, Menus grayed-out, all toolbar change gone on Firefox restart. (Luck I backed up my Profile to get my original toolbar back)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Firefox normal mode, customized Toolbar
2.Used Firefox Safe-Mode to reset Toolbar to default
3.Firefox normal mode, customized Toolbar again
Actual Results:
Firefox Toolbar would NOT hold any Toolbar customizing. Menus gray-out when you customize and any Toolbar change disappear on Firefox restart.

Expected Results:
Be able to customize the Toolbar WITHOUT the Menus graying-out, and any Toolbar change hold when you restart Firefox.
