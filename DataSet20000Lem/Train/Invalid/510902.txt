After the upgrade to Firefox 3.5.2 (from 3.0.x) I see that the main progress icon disappeared from the top right corner. Thus if I only have one tab open (& have tab bar hidden) there is no way to see whether Firefox is loading the page. I can now only see the progress if I am using tab even when I have only one tab open.

I have not read about any change on this so assume this is a bug.
