Goes back when I don't want it to

This ha been pissing me off for age now. While I'm in the middle of using Firef*x, usually when I'm entering in a data field, it will GO BACK WITH NO REASON WHATSOEVER! Today wa the straw that broke the camel's back; I wa using my web-based email (runs on SquirrelMail) and it went back a page on it own; I went forward and ALL OF THE TEXT I'D WRITTEN WAS *GONE*, forcing me to start over. Yesterday, at one point, it went back FIVE PAGES.

Also, again randomly, the page will scroll up or down a click BY ITSELF. This is more frequent than the above problem, and it's equally random. I remembered to include this when it JUST DID IT.

I've been using Firef*x since it came out, and this HAS pushed be to scrap it and go back to IE. I'm sick of defending it based on what you and others say about it.

Building a new profile doesn't do it. It doe it on ANY computer I'm using.

And I'm sick of it. Firefox is fired.
