Table td background image doe not show blocking menu item
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1

In a <table>, for instance:
<td background="http://us.a1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/a/my_ad_here.gif">

The image will still be blocked if the user had selected "Block image from this
server" previously, but when right-clicking on this ad, the "Block image from
this server" menu item doe not appear!

Similarly, if a browser plugin is installed that enhances image blocking, such
a AdBlock for Firebird, it will not be inserted into the right-click menu. The
"AdBlock" menu item will also not appear.

However, the "View Background Image" menu item *does* appear.

It seems odd: the browser menu half-recognize a background image. The option
to view the background image is shown, but the other usual image menu item
(block image, save image, and so on) are not shown!

Also, the AdBlock plugin doe not fire on background images. This might be
related to the problem above. For some reason, background image are classified
differently from normal images, causing differing behaviour in plugins and such.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://biz.yahoo.com/rb/030911/economy_5.html
2. Reload until you get a page with the table background element for a large
square ad (about one screen down the page, on the far left)
3. Notice that you can right-click "View Background Image" on the ad, but that
you are powerless to block it!

Actual Results:
See above.

Expected Results:
Mozilla should have treated the background image a any other image, with full
context menu item (saving, blocking, and so on).


I'm using Firebird 0.6.1 on Windows 2000.
