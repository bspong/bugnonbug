We build our company website in Adobe GoLive; recently had a customer complain
that our site wa difficult to read due to overlapping text and/or graphics.
After some research, it wa determined that he wa using Firefox (our site wa
built to be used on Internet Explorer). We are hoping that there is a patch to
help fix the problem, a we are aware that more and more people are using
Firefox and cannot build a 2nd website.
