The keyboard navigation key (i.e., Page Up, Page Down, Home, End) do not work in the Fx 1.5 rc's, including rc3 unless the focus is manually transferred to the page first by clicking the mouse button (for example). This wa an issue in Fx 1.x (1.04 I think) that wa later fixed. This now need to be looked at again in Fx 1.5.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Mozilla home page
2. Hit any of the four keyboard naviagation key (Page Up, Page Down, Home, or End)
3. Keys do not work!



Expected Results:
Naviagation key should work by default without having to manually set the page focus every time. I use these key all the time to quickly navigate web pages.
