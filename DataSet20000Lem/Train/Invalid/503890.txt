unexpected "about:blank" is created at loading youtube
I'm working on bug 248380. At testing the patch, I found this bug.

When I go to YouTube <http://www.youtube.com/?gl=JP&hl=ja>, unexpected "about:blank" is loaded and the "about:blank" is hidden. I'm not sure what is the cause.

You can test this bug with DOM Inspector. Install DOM Inspector to your Minefield, go to YouTube and look [File] -> [Inspect Content Window] on the menubar of DOM Inspector. Then, you can look the "about:blank".

I'm not sure who creates the "about:blank", therefore, I file this bug to Fx/General.

I tested on 20090713044326-trunk/WinVista.
