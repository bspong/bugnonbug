I am suggesting a change to the way you upgrade to Firefox. When I installed it,
it took over the task of Mozilla 1.6 (which is good), but it failed to bring
all my bookmark from Mozilla 1.6 into it favorites. It would really be helpful
if it did. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.have Mozilla 1.6 installed with some bookmarks.
2.Install Mozilla Firefox.
3.look at bookmarks.

Actual Results:
brought in bookmark from IE (very handy), but did not bring in bookmark from
Mozilla 1.6.

Expected Results:
I don't know if it is supposed to do this or not but I would have liked it to
bring the bookmark from my previous version into the new one. Especially since
it deleted my previous version before I could record my bookmarks.

None.
