going to the http://www.chip7.pt one see that every time the top text scroll
the CPU reach the top (PIII-600)
openning several page from this site will take all the CPU and slowing down
alot the firefox
in window thing seens alot better, both firefox and IE seens to use only
little CPU

and it the firefox that it using the CPU, not X11, unlike a similar problem in
konqueror (it update too many time per second and make X11 eats all the CPU,
konqueror us only about 15% of the CPU)

dont know if this is a dupe, there are many performance bug in bugzilla, but i
have no idea if any of then applies here

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
just go to the page, watch the CPU usage going up sharp when the text start to
scroll


Expected Results:
i dont belive that this CPU dont have enough power for this script, in window
thing use little cpu, so there is a problem between firefox and linux. So the
CPU usage should be alot lower
