Not sure if this is really a bug, a this work only on IE 8 and all firefox, Chrome, Safari all fails for same.
We have a Table with 4 Columns, and last column ha a link that toggle just next TABLE ROW [TR] to display:none or block.
When we click on EXPAND link, it show the TR with only one TD with Colspan="4" however the text content doesn't get expanded to 4 column but restrict to first column only. We verify that HTML is code for syntax [maybe we miss something].
