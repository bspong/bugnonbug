I usually open multiple tab and some window then I visiting some newspaper on Internet. My intention is to read the information an another day then I have more time. After some days, maybe 5-6 and I have opened 30 or more tab firefox eats a lot of memory and make my computer (P2, 456 MHz) very slow. I only got 256 MB and 1 GB swopfile. Firefox can use more then 200 MB after some day and if I close every window and tab but one, firefox still use 200 MB. It all end then the system is very slow and firefox crash. Then firefox crash the memory is returned. Internet Explorer doesn’t react like this and eat up a lot of memory.
Can this be fixed by some one who know how firefox handle memory?
