Yahoo Toolbar Issue
I am sure you must be aware of Yahoo Companion. This is the toolbar that one can
install for your browser and give you short cut to many yahoo destination
like maps, mail, finance, sports, etc... It also ha a alert mechanism if new
mail are in your yahoo mailbox. In IE, if there is no mail, the alert (which is
a mail icon w/ a bell) is not seen, but w/ firefox it is seen making me believe
that there is mail when their is none. I am not sure if this is a bug, but
something to look at. In my opinion the alert/bell should appear only if there
is new and unread mail in the mailbox. I am sure this is more a Companion issue
than firefox but would like to report it.
