Firefox seems unable to load many web page that IE will load...
On opening the example web page, the "Please check name and try again" dialog
opens, but the url is valid; after trying in IE it work fine.
Switching back and forth from IE to Firefox, the problem go on for a while
(varies from a couple of minute to forever).

After cleaning IE and Firefox's cache, the problem is still on; so the 'cached
web page' solution is invalid

1.Find a random web page that give the mentionned dialog
2.Clear IE and Firefox cache
