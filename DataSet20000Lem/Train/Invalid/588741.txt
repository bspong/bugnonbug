when you using & instead of ? firefox is include cs j etc. from full adress and error occurred when you have /(slash) in link parameter

for example:
http://localhost/index.html&code=12/1234 firefox include css/js from http://localhost/index.html&code=12/1234/style.css
not from http://localhost/style.css

with http://localhost/index.html?code=12/1234 everything work fine


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Prepare some_page.html which include some cs or j file
2. open url http://localhost/some_page.html&code=12/123
3. the css/js file wouldn't be correctly include
