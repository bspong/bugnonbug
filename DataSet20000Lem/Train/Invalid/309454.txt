[RFE]: Option to block ALL popup window

Would very much like to see an option to block ALL popup windows, including
those requiring "positive user action". Might be more friendly to give it
sub-options to either open the popu-window content in a new tab or in the same
(originating) tab.

Reproducible: Always
