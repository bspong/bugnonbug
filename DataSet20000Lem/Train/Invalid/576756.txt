Add-on Compatibility Checking is Disabled
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.86 Safari/533.4

I have noticed that every time I go to Tools>Add-ons I keep getting a message that says:

Add-on compatibility checking is disabled. You may have incompatible add-ons.

Why am I getting this and how do I fix it or is this a known issue with 3.6.x

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. go to tools>add-ons
3. see the bar that says: Add-on compatibility checking is disabled. You may have incompatible add-ons.
Actual Results:
will not enable

Expected Results:
enable itself so I will stop seeing it every time I go to add-on
