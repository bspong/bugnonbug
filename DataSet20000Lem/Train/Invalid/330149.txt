After going to the website www.gametrailers.com for a short while, the memory usage go very high, I think it's because the use of macromedia flash on the site. The browser will struggle to scroll up or down after time and navigation is slow. There are other problems, where by If I try to view a wmp video of a trailer on the site the browser will totaly crash. If I download a video, the browser will either crash or the download will stall at a very small % or somtimes 99% complete, the only fix is to close the browser in the process list, a closing the browser normaly and trying to open again, say it's already open.

This also happens with general surfing for a prolonged amount of time, 3-4 hour the memory usage will jump from 34k to a high 300k and it somtimes us 100% of my cpu, which make my computer unusable, unless I cancel it in the process list. I took screen shot of this usage level...

A list of site I have this problem on range from...

www.ghostrecon.com
www.gametrailers.com
www.scifi.com/battlestar
www.scifi.com/atlantis
www.cbs.com/primetime/the_unit
www.ubi.com (community forums)
www.googlemail.com

I've had this memory leak problem since version 1.0, but this version is alot worse in term of memory usage and get to a point where the browser is not useable. I use two extension I don't know if they are the culprit. They are Gmail Notifier v0.5.5.2 and IE View v1.2.7 I use one Theme called Aquatint v1.6.4

Another problem, If I have all those website open in tab and navigate in them, after a long time of use,the memory will go super high, if I close all but one tab the useage is still the same.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.gametrailers.com
2. Navigate through game sections, Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon etc...
3. Watch a video or try downloading one and look at the usage figure.

Actual Results:
The useage jump from 35k to 65k-ish and over the time it's increase since I've been writing this bug over 10 minutes, it's now 170k and still rising. http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v406/Woosy/Misc/firefox3.jpg

Expected Results:
It should load the page normaly, and navigate with low usage figure which I consider 35k reasonable. This doesn't happen in Internet Explorer or Opera that i've been forced to use a an alternative, which use a low 14-20k usage.
