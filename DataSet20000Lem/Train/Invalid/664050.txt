An add-on asked me if I wanted a new default search, I said ok, I disliked the add-on, because it doesn't use the app button and the search engine, because it remained after I uninstalled the add-on, now I discovered that, fx 5 doesn't let me, I don't mean my add-ons, set any search a default search.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Alexa Sparky
2. when it asks to be the default search engine, let it
3. uninstall it
4. delete Alexa from search bar
5. try to make google the default search engine from Preferences, nothing, from search bar, nothing, from mycroft, click google, no make default search engine, nothing

Actual Results:
I can't make any search engine the default search engine.

Expected Results:
I can make any search engine the default search engine.
