Hello Mozilla!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox.

Some time ago Mozilla fixed vulnerability in Firefox described in MFSA 2009-22 (http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2009/mfsa2009-22.html). Which allowed Refresh header to redirect to javascript: URIs. And it's good that you fixed this hole.

This vulnerability wa fixed in Firefox 3.0.9. And recently, 06.07.2009, I found possibility to bypass this protection in Firefox. Also this method of XSS attack work in Mozilla (1.7.x) and Chrome.

To bypass protection from JavaScript code execution via refresh header it's needed to use data: URI, which will be containing requisite JS code. This method of conducting of XSS attack via meta-refresh tag is already known - it wa in XSS Cheat Sheet (http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html) already in 2006 year. And I used it to bypass protection in Firefox and to conduct attack via refresh-header redirectors.

XSS:

Meta-refresh tag and refresh header attack vectors:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ+">

With request to script at web site:

http://site/script.php?param=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2b

Which return in answer the refresh header and the code will execute in the browser:

refresh: 0; URL=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2b

Via data: it's possible to bypass in Firefox 3.0.9 and higher (I tested in 3.0.11) prohibition on JavaScript code execution in refresh header. But in Firefox 3.0.11 you can't get to cooky this way, but it's possible in old Mozilla.

Vulnerable version is 3.0.11 and previous version (and 3.5 should be also vulnerable).

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/3315/).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make request to refresh-header redirector script at web site:

http://site/script.php?param=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2b

2. Which return in answer the refresh header:

refresh: 0; URL=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2b
Actual Results:
The code will execute in the browser.

Expected Results:
The code must not execute in the browser.
