Searchbar autocomplete popup never show again after 'disableautocomplete' is set then removed
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

In Chrome (from an Addon), use code like this:
var p = document.getElementById('PopupAutoComplete');
p.setAttribute('disableautocomplete', true); // hide the searchbar autocomplete
p.setAttribute('disableautocomplete', false); // show it again
// or use p.removeAttribute('disableautocomplete')



Actual results:

The set to false or remove attribute would not bring back the searchbar autocomplete. It's gone for the entire session! Only restarting firefox would bring it back.

Setting p.setAttribute('onpopupshowing', 'return false'); then reset it to '' or remove the attribute ha exactly the same effect.

The most damning evidence that this is a bug is that if you do it to 'PopupAutoCompleteRichResult' using either of the above 2 methods, the popup will come back without any problem!


Expected results:

The popup should reappear after the attribute is reset or removed.
