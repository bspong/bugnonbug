I ran across a page encoded a UTF-8 (according to both the Content-Type header and the charset in the meta tag) that contained U+0092 (0xC292). The code point U+0080-U+009f are reserved, and it's my assumption that there isn't a legitimate reason for them to appear in a web page. 0x92 is a right single quote in windows-1252, and it wa clear from the context that the author's intent wa a single quote. Instead of a single quote, Firefox 1.5.0.6 render the U+0092 differently depending on the platform:

OS X 10.4.7: Box containing a capital 'A'
Windows XP Pro SP 2: nothing (not a space, just no character)
Fedora Core 3: Space
Fedora Core 4/5: Box containing 4 number (the unicode code point).

If I change the character encoding of the page to ISO-8859-1 or windows-1252 using the view->character encoding menu, Firefox render 2 characters: a capital 'A' with circumflex (0xC2) and a right single quote (0x92). This is what I expected, based on my understanding that the byte 0x80-0x9f are interpreted a windows-1252 even if the character encoding is ISO-8859-1.

It seems to me that Firefox should interpret U+0080-U+009f in a similar fashion, converting them to the "real" unicode equivalent when possible. For example, U+0092 would be converted to U+2019, RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK.

The page where I saw this wa a headline on Google's personalized home page, so unfortunately the content is transient. I'll attach a cut-down test case.

FWIW Safari render U+0092 a a right single quote; IE6 on WinXP draw a narrow box.

Reproducible: Always
