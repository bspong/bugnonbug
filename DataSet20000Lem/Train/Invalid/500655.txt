Put in two video on this post, with attribute of autoplay false and poster. I'm guessing the poster doesn't show b/c they start playing. I wrote this post in Vista with FF 3.1 beta 1 and it worked properly. Now I looked at it on a test box running window 7 and the autoplay didn't take. I'll check later on Windows Vista and Mac 10.5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page in 3.5 RC3, watch both video play at the same time, should be paused at start b/c autoplay is set to false
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Videos played

Expected Results:
Videos paused waiting for play command

no special themes, addons installed: adobe flash 10.0.2
