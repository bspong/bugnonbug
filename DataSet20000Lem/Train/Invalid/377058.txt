The keyboard command for force-reload (ignore cache) appears to not work correctly. When I hit the keyboard command, the page doe not reload the same way it reloads when I press SHIFT+[Click the toolbar "reload" button].

(I'm a web developer, so this mean my normal mouse-free method of rapidly iterating on HTML change in mockups doesn't work any more, esp with form fields.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Google.com. [any page with a form + elements]
2. type a query, "monkey" [modify the value of any form element]
3. Press "CTRL-SHIFT-R"


Actual Results:
The value of the text input element is still the modified value.


Expected Results:
The value of the input element should have been cleared. (Returned to it original value.) This also happens with radio button on page that I am creating.
