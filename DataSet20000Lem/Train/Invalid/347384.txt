Images on this page do not show up, and Firefox and Mozilla cannot locate the image on the server. Internet explorer ha no difficulty showing the page correctly. If I save the source html with I.E. to my hard disk, THEN I can load the page into Firefox, and it show it correctly.

Reproducible: Always

1.Go to the web site http://home.flash.net/~smithrc/eagleprj.htm
2.
3.

Actual Results:
.gif image do not show up.

Expected Results:
should see background flag image, Eagle Scout badge image, and TOC buttons.

I think it ha to do with "\" versus "/" in file pathnames. HTML like "/", but pc's use "\" in pathnames. When the html page is saved to my hard disk using Internet Explorer, only "/" forward slash appear in the html source, and it load just fine in Firefox. It won't load if I have used Firefox to save the HTML page.
