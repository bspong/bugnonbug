Buttons to "Restore Old Session" or start "New Session" aren't in the same place
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071022 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.8

When Firefox close unexpectedly and is restarted, the user is presented with a choice to continue where they left off, or to start a new session. These button are not in the same order in the Linux version a in the Windows version. Seeing a how I use Linux at home, and Windows at work, this is really annoying.
