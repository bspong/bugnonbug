Firefox freeze REGULARLY after update from Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121623 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Firefox/3.0.5

After the ubuntu update I notice REGULAR Firefox freezes.

The network environment is identical. Firefox freeze on all kind of websites.

During the freeze, which may take a couple of minute no other Firefox window or tab in a window can be used.

In the beginning I noticed the freeze in regard to GMAIL usage. But even without GMAIL Firefox freeze quite frequently.

This error did not exist before the update from Ubuntu 8.04 to 8.10 .



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Firefox freeze

Expected Results:
No freeze

As a software developer myself, it seems there is a general problem in the Firefox design.

Individual website should not be able to create a freeze of all existing displayed Firefox window or tabs.
