After I upgraded to Firefox 1.5 beta 1 I noticed that Firefox no longer block
shockwave flash. I created this testcase to find out why it no longer works.
Even when I try to use an additional attribute it still doesn't work:

testcase.htm:
<html><head><title>test</title></head>
<body>
<embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" test="block"></embed>
</body>
</html>

here is my userChrome.css file:
embed[type="application/x-shockwave-flash"],
embed[test="block"]
{
display:none !important;
visibility:hidden !important;
}


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add a rule for the <embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash"> tag to the
userChrome.css file and restart Firefox.
2. go to a site that us shockwave flash
3.

Actual Results:
Firefox tell me that 'additional plugins are required to display all the medium
on this page.'

Expected Results:
Firefox should have blocked the shockwave flash object(s).
