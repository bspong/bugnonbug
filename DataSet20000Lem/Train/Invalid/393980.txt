AJAX application retrieving all the data through simple message communication, exchanging JSON object with the server side

at the beginning, client app request for a vocabulary, server side sends JSON hash with all the vocab, the stream is UTF-8 encoded

on Linux, this decodes the data properly and the resulting string are correct UTF-8 string (and when i do something like div.innerHTML=receivedString, it display correctly):

newmessages=eval('('+xmlhttp.responseText+')');

however, on Windows, the string i receive using above code have the correct byte (content), but are not understood a UTF-8 string - so putting them into the page result in wrong display (something like 'retyping' UTF-8 string to ascii)

following code fix the problem on Windows:

newmessages=eval('('+Utf8.decode(xmlhttp.responseText)+')');

where Utf8.decode doesn't do anything else, only read the original string through String.charCodeAt() and based on utf-8 encoding, combine byte which belong together and creates new string through String.fromCharCode()

i.e. it just take the byte a arrived and re-interprets them a UTF-8 content


anyone having explanation for this ? is it a bug or OS-related behavior ? is there a way how to get rid of 'if (linux) ....' condition and use unified method for both platform ?
