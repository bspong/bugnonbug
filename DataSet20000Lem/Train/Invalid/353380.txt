old bug reapearing drag-drop url icon?
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

On drag-drop the URL icon (to save the link of a webpage) into a folder:

1. It is OK, a link to the page is stored in the folder.

2. BUT try to drag-drop a link already in the folder (duplication), the Firefox correctly identifies it a a existing link and asks if replacement is wished. BUT if one say NO, Firefox FREEZES requiring a CTRL-ALT-Delete and a kill of Firefox.exe in order to unfreeze.

3. This bug wa there in older versions. Was not there in the previous to this one. Now it is back?

Thanks for looking into this.
