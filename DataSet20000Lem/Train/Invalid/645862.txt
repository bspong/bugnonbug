Firefox shortcut doe not propagate to the Start Menu recent item list

I'm not sure if this is either a Firefox thing or a NSIS thing or a Windows thing. But the Firefox icon doe not propagate to the Start Menu recent item list.

I thought that maybe it wa a bad install and did a clean reinstall but nothing. It doe not show up in the recent program list no matter how many time that Firefox is started.

Its easily worked around by either pinning the shortcut or having it on the desktop but it will not show up in the Start Menu.

Some reported that it worked for them, but there wa not enough consensus.

Reproducible: Always
