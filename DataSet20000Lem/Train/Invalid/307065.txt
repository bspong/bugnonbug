User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

In the example page, all the <img> tag contain the string "100x75" in the "src"
attribute. Even when I create a simple test case with a file named "100x75.jpg"
and add <img src="100x75.jpg" /> into a test html page, the image fails to
display in Firefox and if you look at the webserver access logs, it show that
Firefox did not even attempt to fetch the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Rename a JPEG image to "100x75.jpg"
2. Create a bare bone html page containing the line <img src="100x75.jpg" />
3. Open the page in Firefox and stare blankly at the empty screen.

Actual Results:
Image doe not get fetched and doe not display.

Expected Results:
Image get fetched and displays.
