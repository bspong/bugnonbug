Since beta 1.5 installed and performed it's reboot, my PC try to start FF automatically upon reboot. Can only power down / shutdown notebook by removing the battery. Cannot remove FF from taskmgr from process window, doesnt' even record in progam window. Cannot use Outlook Express (it will not connect) the only thing that work is Netscape. I need to uninstall beta 1.5 and simply install the latest 1.7.x so I can use my computer. Is there a way through safe mode, though cmd mode, anything, I need to be able to stop FF from auto starting so that I can uninstall. The uninstaller cannot even cancel the FF process to uninstall the program ... HELP
