Widows 7/64 Repeatedly Crashes w/SWF 10.1.85.3

Since my machine updated to 3.6.12 on or around 10/28, I have been experiencing major, multiple machine lockups; I finally determined today that it is caused by the combo of the new Firefox update and SWF 10.1.85.3. I get blue (NOT BSOD) on one monitor and tan or tan moving diagonal on the other. The system is unresponsive to a ping for a safe shutdown, a it seems to be already gone.

If I start in safe mode, no issue. If I run regular mode and disable SWF, no problem. If SWF is enabled, the URL noted above <pendletonsafes> will repeatedly crash my machine when the SWF content loads, and perhaps then only when the mouse it moved over the flash content. This is repeatable for this site today, 2X, and caused at least one crash yesterday when viewing SWF content <URL not available.> It's probably why my new system ha been biting the dirt two or 3 time a day since 10/28. This doe not happen on different W7/64 machine with the same or previous version of firefox and an earlier version of SWF -- 10.0.32.18.
