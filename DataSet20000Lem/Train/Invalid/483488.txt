Browser is crashing by locking up, unable to shut it down normally, even with Ctrl+alt+delete. I must use the off button most of the time. If I do manage to shut it down, when I try to restart, I am told that Firefox is already running, and when I look in the Task Manager, it IS still showing up there. (I am able to shut it down through Task Manager at that point, but if I resume my session, it crash again, even if I eliminate all but one tab.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open more than one tab
2.Alternate back and forth
3.Open a pop-up window, and parent window disappears or lock up.
Actual Results:
The parent window locked up, disappeared, showed itself when I used Alt+ tab to move between windows, but it would not recover, and I had to reboot with the off button again.

Expected Results:
I had to reboot, and when I restarted Firefox and elected to resume my session, the same thing happened. Only by starting a new session can I avoid a recurrence.

It should have remained open and responded by shutting down correctly when I hit the x in the top right corner. It also should have allowed me to Alt+tab between window without crashing.
