Memory Leak using large amount of page file over 24 hour

I use firefox and multiple tab all the time. FireFox nearly brings my computer to a standstill almost daily. When it get to this 'state' the memory usage is considerably high. Specifically today, this wa reported to me by Windows Task Manager:

Firefox = 296 MB
Total PF Usgae = 1.21 GB

I quit FireFox and PF Usage dropped to 468 MB used.

I do not know of any specific web site or reason why this occurs. If given tools, I can better try to document what cause this, but without better tools, I don't know what else I can give you to go on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using web for the day will cause this to happen daily. Not specifically reproduceable with a single action, but it *will* happen daily.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
FF and OS start performing quite slowly
