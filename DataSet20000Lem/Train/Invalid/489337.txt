Summary: After using Firefox in Windows XP, the entire operating system will freeze. Even the keyboard cap lock light will not work.

I have spent several hour trying to troubleshoot this problem, but to no success. There is a 100% correlation with Firefox 3.0.8 I am willing to accept that there may be an underlying problem in the Windows OS, but only Firefox 3.0.8 and no other application trigger it. Previous version of Firefox worked just fine. The IE and Chrome browser work fine (I am tying this bug report in Chrome).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot Windows XP
2. Run without using Firefox. The system will run fine for days.
3. Run Firefox. Surf the web normally. Within the hour, the entire system will lock up. Most usually, it is when opening a new page in Firefox. Sometimes, it is when exiting Firefox. And on a few rare occasions, it is after Firefox ha exited.
4. I cannot find any correlation to any particular page, Flash etc. The freeze ha occurred on minimalistic page like the Drudge Report and complex page like GMail.


Actual Results:
The entire Windows XP operating system will freeze. Even the keyboard cap lock light will not work.


I have tried out all of the following:
Run Firefox in safe mode.
Disabled other application including Google Desktop.
Completely uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled Firefox 3.0.8

After all of the above, the OS still hang if Firefox is used. If Firefox is used, the OS doe not hang.

I am a software developer and power user. I have used Firefox for several years. Trust me, this is happening.

Conflating possibilities:
Around the same time frame, I installed Google Desktop Search. However, the crash occurs even if Google Desktop Search is disabled.
