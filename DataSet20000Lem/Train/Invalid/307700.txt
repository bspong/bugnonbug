When the option to select text with the keyboard is active, the location caret
can get "stuck" in certain part of the page. If the option is not active, page
scrolling work normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure that the advanced option "Allow text to be selected with the
keyboard" is enabled.
2. Visit the referenced page.
3. Click in any non-anchored visible text (such a "What's New In Firefox")
4. Hold the down arrow key and verify that the page scroll correctly.
5. Using the arrow key or page up/down keys, scroll either to the very top or
very bottom of the page.
6. Using the opposite key from the previous step, scroll the other way.

Actual Results:
The scrolling completely skipped the middle of the page.

Expected Results:
Scrolling should go smoothly between all the visible text on the page,
regardless of what the underlying HTML look like.
