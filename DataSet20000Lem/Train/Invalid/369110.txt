Click/hold on image will not open pop-up info menu with "copy image", "properties", etc.

If I click & hold on an image, the pop up menu (which did appear in previous version, 1.5.9,) with "properties", "save image ", etc. doe not open, and I can get no on-screen info on image file size, dimensions, file type, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Click/hold or right click or right click/hold while over an image.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens

Expected Results:
As in previous version, Firefox 1.5.9., mouse over an image & click/hold. Menu should open, displaying choice such a "save image", "properties", etc. Choosing "properties" would then display image info like file size, dimension and file type.

To get image info, I need to open "Page Info" and "Media" and select the image from list. This is a "one off" solution, in that to get info for another page's images, I need to close & reopen Page Info for every page after I load it.

Default theme, fresh installs; feature which previously existed just is no longer available or ha been disabled in v 2.0.0.1
