live bookmark doesn't show property in bookmark manager or bookmark sidebar
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2

When i ctrl-click on a broken live bookmark (default "Latest Headlines" is experiencing this problem) in the Bookmarks Manager or the Bookmarks Sidebar, I do not see the Properties item listed or the Delete item.

Those do appear if I Ctrl-click or right click on the live bookmark in the Bookmarks Toolbar.

I should be able to delete from those two location it if it doesn't work.

To reproduce:
1. Open a FF window and do Command-B (to open bookmark sidebar)
2. Click on a broken live feed (at the moment Latest Headlines is broken). You will get an alert, saying the feed could not be loaded.
3. Right click on the live feed

Expected: context menu showing option to Delete or see it Properties, such a when you right click on the live feed found in the bookmark toolbar.

Actual: context menu with option to Open or Copy.

This also happens if you use the Bookmarks Manager.
