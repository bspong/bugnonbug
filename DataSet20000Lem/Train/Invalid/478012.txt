just like the summary says, and when it start again it get a bit choppy and happens again. When the update for firefox 3.0.6 came out, nothing changed, the 2.2.0 is what I am running right now to send post this and I don't know why it work better than 3.0 versions, but it tick me off cause all my bookmark I have backed up will not work and/ or show on 2.0 versions. And I noticed there a secondary window open when it start up called the XML layer, why doe this open up separately, this take resources.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox
2.just surf no real step for this to happen to me with 3.0
3.it doesn't happen with 2.0
Actual Results:
it stop responding over and over for 30 second to a minute

Expected Results:
not stall up over and over, I know it may happen from time to time normally, but this is retarded, seriously

the backup bookmark file should be universal, so i don't know why i can't load 3.0 bookmark on 2.0 FIX this please.
