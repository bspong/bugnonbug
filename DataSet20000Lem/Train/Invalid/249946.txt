After deleting the very last bookmark in the Bookmarks Manager window, the Move,
Properties, Rename and Delete button and their corresponding Edit menu command
(collectively referred to here a "bookmark management commands") are still
enabled. Moreover, the user can move, delete, or view and edit the property of
the deleted bookmark -- although any edits done on the "deleted" bookmark won't
be saved.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to any Web page.
2. Add the Web page to the top-level of the bookmark list. Use Bookmarks |
Bookmark this Page (or press CTRL+D). In the Add Bookmark dialog box, select
the Bookmarks folder under the "Create in" drop-down list, then click OK.
3. Display the Bookmarks Manager window (Bookmarks | Manage Bookmarks).
4. The bookmark that wa added in Step 2 should be the very last entry in the
list. Select it and delete it (click Delete on the toolbar or press DEL).


Actual Results:
The Move, Properties, Rename and Delete toolbar button are still enabled even
after the bookmark wa deleted. (Notice that nothing is selected after the
deletion.) Also, the Edit | Delete, Edit | Properties and Edit | Move
Bookmark(s) command are still enabled. However, once the Move command (Edit |
Move Bookmarks) is executed, and the Move dialog box dismissed, the above
bookmark management command are disabled.

Expected Results:
The bookmark management commands, both on the toolbar and in the Edit menu,
should be automatically disabled after deletion of the last bookmark item, since
there is no longer any selected bookmark that these command apply to.
