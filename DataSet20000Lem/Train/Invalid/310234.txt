doesn't seem to parse <a name="goHere" /> correctly... think subsequent text to
next </a> is a link, so <a name="goHere"></a> is required for anchor point

Reproducible: Always

1.make an html file
2.include an xhtml-compliant anchor point: <a name="goHere" />
3.watch it break; then change to <a name="gohere"></a> and watch it work

Actual Results:
it broke

Expected Results:
had an anchor
