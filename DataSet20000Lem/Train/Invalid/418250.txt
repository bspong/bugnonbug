I'm using the new Firefox 3 Beta 3 with an imported old_Profile (from Firefox 2.0.0.12). Ctrl + the scroll wheel of my mouse should zoom the page, but nothing happens.

I tried it with a newly created profile and there everything work fine. I have disabled all addons in my old, imported profile and it still doesn't work. Using only the keyboard (Ctrl + "+"/"-") or the menu option the zoom work fine!

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox 3 Beta 3 with an old profile (from Firefox 2.0.0.12).
2. Press Ctrl and use the scroll wheel in order to zoom the page.

Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
The page zoom in or out.

I haven't had time to try it with another profile. Maybe I can generate a profile with Firefox 2.0.0.12 and import it into Firefox 3 Beta 3 later this week in order to reproduce this bug with another profile but I'm not sure whether I will have enough time...
