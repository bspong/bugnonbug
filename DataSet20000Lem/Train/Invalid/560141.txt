There is a lot of bug in this new version of Firefox on my mac :
1 - Firefox 3.6 doesn't support anymore the PHP page (when they are offline).
2 - With a flash content we have to add the line 'object { outline:none; }' in the cs document to doesn't have the dotted line.... (it is really ugly)
3 - Firefox 3.6 crash a lot of time when i use the search bar (with google), not allways, but when I have a lot of tab open It happens often.
4 - I don't now if it is the fault of my plugin "newtaburl" (with firefox 3.5 I never had any problem) but, a lot of time when i click on a link a google page appears (my home page) instead of the real link.

Sorry for my bad English, but I am so tired of this new version of Firefox, I think that I am going to install the 3.5 version, a better version....



Reproducible: Sometimes
