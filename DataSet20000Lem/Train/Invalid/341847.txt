Firefox, on 1st launch,appears HUGE on the screen approx 900x600 - Cannot add search engine either/doesn't remember previous setting on upgrade / php handling
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-GB; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

1) On launching, ever since approximately January 06 (with 1.5.0.2??), Firefox doe NOT 'remember' the old window setting but launch in huge approx 900 tall x 600 wide browser window, which I then resize to suit. On quitting and relaunching
it re-opens in odd (900x600) window.

2.) Whenever an upgrade is produced, all search engine stored have vanished. And on the current version, it completely FAILS to add any new engines, despite "ok" -ing it and restarting.

3.) .php handling seems odd. Safari+Opera (e.g.) cope with flash in a php webpage, but Firefox doe not seem to. (see http://www.hornybloke.com)

Until V 1.5.0.x I made Firefox my main browser. It ha lost a great deal of the appeal a it seems to be handling more awkwardly and slow.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. upgrade e.g. V 1.5.0.2 to .3 (and see that all search engine have d
disappeared in the new version

2. quitting and restarting firefox brings up bad elongated window. (but NOT on an Intel based Mac)"

3. check www.hornybloke.com, try and click on the flag (which have got a link) and try the same in Safari = firefox ignores the script (but ONLY on that first php page); whereas e.g. Safari take it.


Actual Results:
same

Expected Results:
I expect Firefox to "remember" search engines.

I expect Firefox to "remember" the size of the window preferred

I expect Firefox to return to a smooth browsing tool
