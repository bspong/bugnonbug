Arial fails to render when assigned via CSS
Using CSS, when I assign Arial a the font-family value, Times New Roman is
instead rendered.


1) See the sample page. I've narrowed it down to that HTML snippet.

Expected results: The text is displayed in the Arial fontface.
Actual results: The text is displayed in the Times New Roman fontface.
