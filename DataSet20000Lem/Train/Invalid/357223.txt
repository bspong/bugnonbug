In random time my Antivirus (NOD32) report that Mozilla is threading to run a dialer or trojan.

Please search for a solution.

I have to note that my systems' is now unstable and my antivirus can not delete this dialer-trojan.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I am just opening www.google.com!
