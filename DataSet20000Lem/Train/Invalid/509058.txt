Installing Skype 4.1.0.141 cause an automatic install of a specific Skype tool icon on the upper right hand corner in tha main page of Firefox. No connexion problems, nor surfing problems, BUT when I needed to send an Email with a Gmail account, It took a lot of time to send a single sentence and, moreover, the speed of my screen card (GEforce) ha dropped down to the lowest level never seen. This way, I think that there is a very awful conflict between the last Skype version & Firefox toolbar. Happyly, clickin on it permit to uninstall this .... skype tool. The problem is that the first thought of average people will be suspecting Firefox. It took some time before I found the guilty. Conclusions: Firefox is perfect, but the user of both Firefox & Skype MUST be warned. I am normally french speaking. So, do not hesitate to ask me more precision if necessary. In this case, I could find hep from friend to translate in better english. Thanks for all.
