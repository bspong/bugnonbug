Timing out
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; eMusic DLM/3; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 3.0.6

Immediately after the update, Firefox stopped loading page saying they "timed out". This is not a network problem a I wa on Firefox browsing site right before this update and also tested with MSIE to make sure I could get place there, which I could. It's not any particular site. It's ALL of them. I even tried restarting the computer, which had absolutely no effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the browser
2.Enter a URL and activate it
3.Get frustrated when it time out.



Um, it should have loaded the page exactly a it wa doing BEFORE the update?
