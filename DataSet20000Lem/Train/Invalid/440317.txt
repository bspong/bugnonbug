when you right click on a web page or a blank page at a certain point(usually the top left area of the page, not the links), the right-click memu item will be automatically activated, most of the time so annoying, without seeing the right-click menu.Even worse there's no cut,copy, or paste item to select, when right click in a text box.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a blank page and right click the top left area, and of course the right-click menu will appear where the cursor is at the center.
2.try more click on a wider area.
3.then at some point the right memu item will be activated without being selected.
4.or try this page:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&format=guided
right click in the text box"Details" at right area, some item will automatically activated,and no memu appears. Even it appears there's no such command a cut,copy or paste.
Actual Results:
at some point the right-click memu item will be activated without being selected and so no menu will appear a usual.Even it appears there's no such command a cut,copy or paste.

Expected Results:
the right-click menu should be appear below or above the cursor a usual to avoid such bug.and add cut,copy or paste command when right click in a text box.

This bug is so annoying that I can hardly enjoy my surfing when I use the right-click to perform some commands.

I hope this bug will be fixed immediately. I'm a huge fan of firefox 3, but this bug really really piss me off or I have to switch back to firefox 2 again.

Thanks for your concern and your hardwork.

Best wishes,
Dan
