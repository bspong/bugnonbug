A problem with CSS. The link show up white on my site even when I label the code with a class.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

Technically that is what's supposed to happen. But I classified the link so
that the link I have in my toolbar are white (I labeled them CLASS="1") and the
link on the bottom of my site are teal (I didn't label them).
Firefox might not differantiate between class in Cascading Stylesheets either
that or Firefox automatically label the code if it have not found a label.
(Sorry for using the word label so much)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Refresh.
2.Tried a different page.
3.Went offline then online then refreshed

Actual Results:
Nothing have changed.

Expected Results:
The link on my site supposed to be teal.

I didn't encounter this problem when I wa using IE.
