When I type in the location bar, a list of suggestion appear only if the number of character typed so far is odd. If the number of letter typed so far is even, then nothing appears. For example, if I type the word "firefox", the autocomplete suggests appear when I have typed "f", "fir", "firef", or "firefox". However, if I have type in "fi", "fire", or "firefo", then no suggestion at all appear in the location bar. This occurs for all word that I try.
