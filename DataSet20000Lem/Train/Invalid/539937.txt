Memory error prevents normal program termination
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7

Only after downloading the latest version of Firefox (3.5.7), the program no longer terminates normally. Regardless of site visited, closing the program result in the following error message: The Instruction at "0x10064419" referenced memory at "0x00000024". The memory could not be "read". Click on OK to terminate the program.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the browser
2. do normal site visit - any sites, email, etc. One site or dozen.
3. When done for the session, click on the upper right "X" to close the program. Firefox always responds with the same error message and the instruction to "click on OK to terminate".
Actual Results:
My regular desktop screen appears with the error message window in the middle of my screen. I must click OK to complete closing Firefox and see my full desktop screen again.

Expected Results:
In all prior version (before 3.5.7), the program always closed gracefully and returned my full desktop screen with no error message and no further action required on my part to complete closing the program.

No theme have been applied to this or any other version. All setting were the defaults, with no customizations. System is a Dell desktop, running XP with all current service pack and updates.

Does not appear to cause any serious problem, (no known data loses) just the annoyance of having to stick around and go through more step to close the program.

Workaround is to accept the error and click OK every time.
