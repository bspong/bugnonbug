Cache hit on 304 request result in blank page, but view source work (NoScript extension)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3

After initially loading the page, subsequent visit to the page (via link, Cmd-R refresh, address bar, and bookmark) would result in a blank page being displayed. However, a view-source on the page reveals the page's HTML source code in it entirety. Clearing the cache would subsequently result in a 200 status code and the page displays, but the blank page would return after this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://dof.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/Ultimate.cgi (or http://dof.heavengames.com/static/pix/v1/css/custom.css or http://cache.boston.com/universal/css/bcom_hp_styles_update.css )
2. Refresh the page.
Actual Results:
A blank page should show up after the first or second refreshes.

Expected Results:
The page should load in case of the first link; the source code to the CSS should load in the second and third cases.
