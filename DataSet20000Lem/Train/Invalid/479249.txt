The default installation path is wrong on 64 bit Windows system
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/1.0.154.48 Safari/525.19
Build Identifier: version3.2a1pre

On 64 bit Windows system the 32 bit application install in \Program Files (x86) whereas native (64 bit applications, like Minefield) should install in \Program Files (I use XP x64 but I guess in Vista or 7 there should be something similar). So I don't understand why Minefield attempted to install itself in the Program Files (x86) (I guess the installer ha been copied verbatim from the FireFox counterpart).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have / install a 64 bit Windows OS
2. Download a Minefield build from here: http://wiki.mozilla-x86-64.com/Firefox:Download
3. Attempt installation and check the default installation folder offered
