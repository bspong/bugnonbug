Vista Home Premium
4GB internal memory
Firefox 3.5.2

If I leave an website open (s6.travian.nl, dutch travian game) and I come back to my PC 30 min. later, the PC ha an blue screen. This happened several time with Firefox 3.5.2 (NOT with Internet Explorer 8), this did not happen with 2GB of internal memory. 2 week ago I changed my memory from 2x 1GB --> 2x 2GB. Only with Firefox and with several minute active the system crashes. This can't be an hardware memory problem (would I think)

There is nothing active like stopping the screen or the harddisk after several minutes. The system stay active.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start Firefox 3.5.2
2. s6.travian.nl (do some change to my village)
3. wait 30 minute
Actual Results:
blue screen

Expected Results:
working firefox
after starting the system and starting Firefox, it asks to recapture the website (wich succeeds)

I have some attachment with name like c:\windows\minidump\Mini090609-01.dmp

I now use Internet explorer if I sit longer on the internet.
If I am no longer then 15 min on the internet then Firefox work fine.
To me it seems like an memory leakage in combination with 4GB internel memory
(2x2 GB DDR2 667MHz memory from Dane Select)
