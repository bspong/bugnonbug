alright. i don't want to start a IE v firefox battle here or anything.

example:

<a id="test" href="#test">test</a>
a:active { background-color: blue; }

this work in IE, but only work in firefox/chrome while the mouse button is depressed (or so it seems at first).

the actual issue is caused by the browser resetting control focus after the url changes. which mean the active link is no longer active, and the :active effect disappears a soon a you release the mouse button. this can be seen by the fact the url only change after releasing the button.

if focus count be retained if the url changes, but no post/get ha been made, then it would open up the door to a bunch of cool 'css onclick' effects.

this is obviously not a html/css spec, it is something the browser is doing, and it is breaking the 'active' nature of #ids in the URL.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click link, url doesnt change yet, active effect is observed
2. release mouse button, url change to new #id, active effect and control focus are reset
3. proceed to bollock up site with javascript? no way. ;p


Expected Results:
focus should not be reset on the active control when browsing to a href="#id". this will eliminate this behaviour.

would be so much win, if this actually worked cross-browser and not just in IE. it is a cool effect.
