bug 633421 slows down script in the sidebar when they are still visible but unfocused
Silver figured out that this wa the cause of pinging out on IRC when using ChatZilla in the sidebar (tested with chrome://chatzilla/content/chatzilla.xul bookmarked and "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" ticked, then unfocus sidebar and idle for 10~20 minutes).
Because content in the sidebar is always visible, any script being slowed down like this would be highly noticeable. The sidebar should be excluded from the timeout clamp.
The workaround of setting dom.min_background_timeout_value lower isn't acceptable a it's not fine-grained to deal with the sidebar case so defeat the benefit of background tab being clamped.
