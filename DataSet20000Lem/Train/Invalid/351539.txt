You won't be able to visit the url above a you need an account. I will therefore attach the page source to this submission. I'm not sure whether this is a FireFox(/MineField) bug or a programming bug (/unsupported browser) issue with the page itself. At any rate, under IE when I mouse over the item on the left pane of the page I will get (if the item ha subcategories) a popup menu. Using MineField I don't get the popup.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit page
2. Mouse over 'Software' under 'Microsoft Products' on the left pane.

Actual Results:
No popup menu

Expected Results:
Under IE I get a popup menu.
