menu suddenly empty
I reboot into a different operating system and when I booted into Windows again,
all the menu in Firefox (and Thunderbird too) stopped working. When I try to
open a menu (or right click) I see what look like the menu but with all the
item being empty. (The height of the menu look correct, but it seems empty and
hence the width is almost zero)

I tried reinstalling Firefox, and it doesn't help. The Firefox directory wa
removed completely between reinstalls. I have also tried renaming my profile.
That did not help either.

This make Thunderbird somewhat unusable for me at the moment. (I can get by in
Firefox with shortcuts). However, I am unable to do some thing in Thunderbird
without using menus.
