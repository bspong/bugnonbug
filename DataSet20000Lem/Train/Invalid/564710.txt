Downloading a .WMV.

At first FF try to open it in Windows Media Player, so, in Tools/Add-ons/plugins I disable the WMP Plugin DLL.

Once this is done, FF give access to the file save menu. However, during the download, FF memory usage (Windows taslk manager) increase steadily, slightly faster than the currently downloaded byte count (Base64 expansion factor?). Needless to say, an instance of FF with 1.5GB of memory isn't that good for performance.

On the good side, if the file isn't too big (<600M) the download eventually terminates and the memory is reclaimed, so the leak isn't permanent (looks like FF u holding the whole download in memory).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Disable WMP plugin
2.Download big >200M WMV file
3.Monitor Firefox memory usage
Actual Results:
Memory usage steadiliy increase

Expected Results:
Memory usage should be kept minimal
