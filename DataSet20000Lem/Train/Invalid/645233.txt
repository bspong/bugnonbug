Middle clicking on the text link on that page will open them in a new tab while middle-clicking on the image will open them over the current page, which get darkened (like Mozilla Addons does).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Middle click on the before or after images.
Actual Results:
Image open over the current page.

Expected Results:
Image open in a new tab.

This only happens on middle-click and not on right-click->Open in New Tab, and doesn't happen on similar sites, like Mozilla Addons.
