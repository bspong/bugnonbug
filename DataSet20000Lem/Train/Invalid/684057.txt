Version level not recognized by facebook applications, yahoo etc etc

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 FBSMTWB
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

Loading facebook and then running the facebook app Words for Friends (a Zynga Game) the application complains that an old version of the browser is being run and suggests minimum levels, stating firefox 3.6+ or later and I am running 6.0.1 so it appears the app cannot recognize the version.

When I am on My Yahoo, I get a link at the top of the page to "get the latest version" which again suggests the web page is not recognising the browser version correctly.


Actual results:

the current version of Firefox is not recognized
