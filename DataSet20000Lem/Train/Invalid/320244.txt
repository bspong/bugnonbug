Firefox browser initializes to a McDonald's site, regardless of what is in the preference for start page.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

I am reporting this a a bug, since your product doe not conform to the documentation.
When I put my choice for a start page in "Preferences", I expect that page to appear every time I start the browser. BUT NO. Somebody in development decided that harrassing customer with the McDonald's start page would be acceptable advertising.
As a result, neither you nor McDonald's ha ANY SWAY with me whatsoever.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browser
2. Browser start with a McDonald's page instead of the page in "Preferences".
3.

Actual Results:
I get the McDonalds page.

Expected Results:
Browser should have started with "WSJ Online" rather than the McDonald's page

If this is your idea of advertising, grow up.
