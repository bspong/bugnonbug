The TXT file on this download page (URL ^) are ordinary small text file containing MD5 sum for the ISO downloads.

This one: puppy-4.1.2-k2.6.25.16-seamonkey.iso.md5.txt can be normally viewed in the browser, or downloaded. But any of the file with 'tar.gz' in the file name (and .txt at the end) lead to an error when trying to view it in the browser:
"The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because it us an invalid or unsupported form of compression."
Trying to download (right click, save as) result in a similar error message. Of course, there is no "form of compression" here at all. Downloading with Download Accellerator (DAP) go without a problem and save a normal text file.
