After clicking malformed URL (prefixed with "http://http//") then correcting it by removing one "http://", expected URL not opened.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12

I clicked the following URL in a link in a forum post (note the two "http://" at the beginning):

http://http//www.kickstarter.com/projects/709407864/the-talent-a-feature-length-motion-picture?ref=search

It seems Firefox acted a if I entered only "http://" a the URL and interpreted it a a search term, taking me to Wikipedia instead of the expected page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy and paste the following URL into the Location Bar:

http://http//www.kickstarter.com/projects/709407864/the-talent-a-feature-length-motion-picture?ref=search


2. Highlight the URL in the Location Bar, delete one of the extraneous "http://"

3. Hit the Enter key.
Actual Results:
Firefox first returned the following error:

"Server not found

Firefox can't find the server at http."

I highlighted the URL in the Location Bar of the same tab, removed the first "http://", then hit Enter. Firefox then took me to the Wikipedia page on the HTTP protocol (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).

Expected Results:
Firefox should've opened the corrected URL below:

http//www.kickstarter.com/projects/709407864/the-talent-a-feature-length-motion-picture?ref=search



Weird but not major issue, usually URLs are well-formed and don't have duplicate "http://" prefixes.
