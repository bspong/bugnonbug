I have some bookmark in the bookmark tab that when opened, they do not open in a new tab like some other bookmarks, they open right in the bookmark tab. You can see in the screenshot, on the left Firefox screen that where the bookmark tab is suppose to be, Firefox ha opened the webpage instead of opening the bookmark in a new tab. You can see on the right screen where the bookmark tab is and how that relates to it. It doesn't do it with all my bookmarks, but some do open in this manner.
