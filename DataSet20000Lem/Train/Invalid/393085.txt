When a new tab is created, memory get allocated. immediately closing that tab DOES NOT return the memory to the pool. Continuing to add and remove new tab simply monotonically increase memory usage under FF.

Once it get past approx 350K of memory, the UI slows down to the point that rolling over a link take the UI about 3 second to recognize and "enable" the link. same with buttons. any kind of click action on interface item requires an equal amount of time to process.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. notice memory usage
2.create new tab, immediately close tab
3. notice memory increase
Actual Results:
memory usage simply increases, and never go down.

Expected Results:
properly free the memory, so that window can reclaim it.
