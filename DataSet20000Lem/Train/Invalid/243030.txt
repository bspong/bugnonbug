CSS (1.0-2.1) "text-align:center" not supported.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

In the page http://www.nintendo-next.se/records/, the main table should be
centered according to CSS (1.0-2.1). In Mozilla the table is to the left on
the page. It kinda ignores the cs command. I have tried to do it in the .css
file and in the document by "style" tagging the div.

I worked hard to get the page xhtml 1.1 and cs 2.1 compilant and I wasn't
happy when it didn't work in every browser. The inheritance of "text-
align:center" work in table too. If I use it before the table. Everything in
the table becomes centered. Read the CSS documentation to get it right.

The rest of the page look great. And thanks for a great browser. I also
tested it with the latest build. And with version 0.8.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the webpage.
Actual Results:
The main table don't get centered a the CSS tell the browser.

Expected Results:
