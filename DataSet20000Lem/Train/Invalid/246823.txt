When using the Firefox DOM Inspector I tried to change some preferences. Clicking on the Ok button for the preference button doesn't close the window. It is unclear whether it commits change to preferences.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open DOM Inspector
2. Click OK
3.

Actual Results:
Nothing

Expected Results:
Ok should commit change then close the Preferences window.
