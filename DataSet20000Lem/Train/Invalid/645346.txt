Input type password's value can be read from Add-ons API. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a feature.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Firefox extension with this code inside for form submit event:
var e = document.commandDispatcher.focusedElement;
var pw = e.value.toString();

Actual Results:
If "e" wa the input type password the user wrote in, then "pw" contains the password entered by the user.

Expected Results:
"pw" contains nothing.

I think this is the most effective way to check whether this behavior is a bug or a feature. Excuse me otherwise.
