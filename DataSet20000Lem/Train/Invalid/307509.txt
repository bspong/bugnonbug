Pages will not load in firefox will work in other web browser
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.11) Gecko/20050728

When i start up firefox it doe not bring me to home page. When i type a
address in it doesnt search but say done. I always end up at a blank page. My
troubleshooting ha led me to: reinstall with restart, delete all firefox and
interent file adn then reinstall with restart, and this preference change

1.Type “about:config” into the address bar and hit return. Scroll down and look
for the following entries:

network.http.pipelining network.http.proxy.pipelining
network.http.pipelining.maxrequests

Normally the browser will make one request to a web page at a time. When you
enable pipelining it will make several at once, which really speed up page loading.

2. Alter the entry a follows:

Set “network.http.pipelining” to “true”

Set “network.http.proxy.pipelining” to “true”

Set “network.http.pipelining.maxrequests” to some number like 30. This mean it
will make 30 request at once.

3. Lastly right-click anywhere and select New-> Integer. Name it
“nglayout.initialpaint.delay” and set it value to “0”. This value is the amount
of time the browser wait before it act on information it receives.

This worked temporarily. But now i have the same problem i checked to see if
the value had been reset but they remain the same.

help!
