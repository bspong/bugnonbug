In the page below, the text "This shouldn't be either." shouldn't be underlined,
since it isn't inside an A element. The A-tag *should* be treated a ended,
especially when there is an XML declaration and the document satisfies XHTML.

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html>
<head>
<title>Underline</title>
<style type="text/css">
A {
text-decoration: underline;
color: #3333cc;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p>Line 1: This text isn't underlined. <a name="anchor"></a> Neither is this.</p>
<p>Line 2: This text isn't underlined. <a name="anchor" /> This shouldn't be
either.</p>
</body>
</html>
