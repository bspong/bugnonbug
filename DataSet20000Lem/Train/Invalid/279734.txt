The cell with the vallign property don't display a they should. The strange
thing is that when I remove the doctype it DOES work. That's a rather dirty
solution though.

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

(note Internet Explorer can't handle the vallign property at all, but the page
display perfectly in Opera (both with and without doctype))


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a html table using the vallign="bottom" property in a heading cell
2. Add the proper html doctype
3. Open in Firefox

Actual Results:
The text in the cell is not vertically alligned toward the bottom.

Expected Results:
The text should be on the bottom of the cell, even if it is a heading.
