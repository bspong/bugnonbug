i WILL NOT dig endlessly thru crap after crap after crap after crap filling out
this and filling out that to simply tell you that this otherwise good fireox .9
browser ha a problem!

change your practices! this is the LAST time! no more!

NOW. the toolbar repeat itself, no skin, skin, doesn't matter. got 3 nav
button, google search & url address area and can't see all of any of it,
especially the address bar which is of paramount importance. and for same reason
you can't simply grab it and move it or right click and close it like in IE, i
know IE sucks, but not there fellahs....

then i go to download extensions. pick the one i like. close browser. launch
browser. hang for 49876543907 day while loading extension that could "take a
minute" yeah right. so i uninstall the browser COMPLETELY. know how many time i
installed & uninstalled & reinstalled, rinsed, lathered & repeated, just hoping
to get a default firefox only to fail? no le than 15!!!!

okay?

i ERASED the folder. DUG thru the registry. IT STILL LOOKS FUCKED UP! IT STILL
HANGS. thank god you guy have a safe mode for it, or it would've never loaded
so i could get my bookmarks, WHICH should be gone, but aren't if i uninstalled
it and erased the folder, which worry me where you hide the bookmark & why.
fuck, use a folder, put the url in it, how the fuck hard is that? don't hide it
in the reg! damn. or in %whatthefuckever%. fuck.

play ball, dammit.
