Apparent missing s. s followed by t 'merges' the two character into 't' only.

Any page (this included) where t is followed by s (e.g. most), the s disappears
leaving a visual 'mot' Even typing it is the same. AS soon a the t is finished,
the s disappears. Font change make no difference.

Copy the text and paste into another application and the s 'reappears'.

Weird, and very annoying.
