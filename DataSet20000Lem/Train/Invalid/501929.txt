I use the Comodo Firewall Pro, Since I startet checking my firewall this morning
Some sever attack came up. They averaged every 20 min. The IP address is,
192.168.1.254.They are UDP Port Attacks I do not know if that will be helpful. But I uninstalled the Firefox 3.5. Reinstalled the next earlier version. Then the attack stopped. I am not totally sure if the attacker just gave up. Or there is a hole some where in the Firefox 3.5. I hope this is helpful. I am not really a TECH. So good luck
