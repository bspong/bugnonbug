Up and Down arrow key act identical to Left and Right arrow key
Seen on Deer Park 1.1a

-Go to Options (Prefs) dialog
-Use the Up and Down arrow key to change Main Menu selection
Also:
-Go to Options | Privacy (or any category that ha multiple tab in the content)
-Tab into the content
-Use the Up and Down arrow key to change Tab selection

tested results: The Up arrow key behaves same a the Left arrow key; it selects
the next Category/Tab to the left. The Down arrow key behaves the same a the
Right arrow key; it selects the next Category/Tab to the right.

Expected results: I'm not sure if the above behavior is intended or a residual
effect from this winter rework of the Options dialog. I'm also no expert on
keyboard/accessibilty functionality. But it seems to me the Up/Down arrow key
should either do nothing or behave the same a Tab/shift+Tab when focus is on
the Main category menu or on content Tabs in the Options dialog.
