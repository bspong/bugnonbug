There is about an inch of boder with a red "^" on the extreme left hand side. I removed all the extension and themes, the uninstalled and re-installed Firefox 1.51 and I can't seem to get rid of it. I did not have this in Firefox 1.07. I even uninstalled the latest Java 5 update 6(from Sun) and re-installed it. The browser work fine otherwise, but my viewing window is reduced by this border

Reproducible: Always

2.
3.
