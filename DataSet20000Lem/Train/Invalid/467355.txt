After a successfully ssh connection to a linux server with X forwarding I launched firefox without any problem with rendering on the client workstation.
Problem appears trying to reach local address stored on the /etc/hosts on the server: it seems that the firefox read /etc/hosts on the client machine, if resolution cannot be done, then request is forwarded to the default dns server specified on the client, and not the server

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.ssh -X to the server
2.launch firefox
3.goto a local address stored on the server's /etc/hosts
Actual Results:
Wrong resolution, the request is forwarded to the client's default dns server

Expected Results:
Resolution should be done by the host in which the process runs, not the host in which the process is rendered
