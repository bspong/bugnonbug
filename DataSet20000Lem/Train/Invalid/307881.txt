Lock option in about:config only lock setting with the default value
With the introduction of the new Prefdialog a new option in about:config wa
introduced: Lock.
If we want to lock setting which is modified, the default value is always used.
This seems unlogical to me, because not for everyone the default value is the
best value to use.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open about:config and search for a setting, e.g. xpinstall.enabled. Dubble
click this setting so that the value change (in this case to false).
2. Click with the right mouse button on xpinstall.enabled and choose for 'Lock'

Expected result: The pref xpinstall.enabled is locked with value false.
Actual result: The pref xpinstall.enabled is locked with value true (the default
value)
