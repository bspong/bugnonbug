I apologize beforehand -- this is a TabBrowser Extension related bug
(http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_tabextensions.html.en). Yes, I should have read
about the problem before I downloaded a third-party extension. Moving on --

Even after removing the extension, every grey portion on the window of not just
Firefox but my Finder window have pinstripe running across them. I will attach
a screenshot.

Does anyone know the file I need to edit to restore this to normalcy?
