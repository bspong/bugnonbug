I've been using firefox for about 10 mnths now and prefer it to ie7 etc, but have 1 issue that is in all the version i have used and hence there are some incompatibility with my website, which is amateur, and built with the html editor in microsoft word 2003. The problem - i made the link with different font color and didn't underline them - now firefox underline them automatically, and add default colour which i cant change affectively, also when i select the "do not underline option",it doesnt work for my site, but corrects all other sites. Also after using firefox it ha caused some of my page in internet explorer, a well a firefox, to show incorrectly and are blurred - some font - not link - have changed in my chart - Charts Page - http://members.westnet.com.au/destuneable7/sita.rep.html .Another problem is associated with HTMLSlideShow - http://members.westnet.com.au/destuneable7/Amanda%27s%20trip%20to%20Australia/default.htm ,which is a Microsoft Power Toy for adding slideshows to web site - it wont function properly with firefox - it works, but u have to manually move thru the slides, a the play button doesnt appear.
Hope these aren't nuisance problems, a i know u have a lot of work going on at the moment with firefox 3 and u possibly cant account for some program not functioning correctly, but i thought i might mention it.
Thanking you, Richard
