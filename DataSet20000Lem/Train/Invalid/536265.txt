I have ff3.5.6 and i am now unable to get into my gmail. I have disabled all of the addons/plugins i had and still unable to....
safe mode did not work for me either.

i put in the username & password and then the page return to the login page with the fill in area blank

i have tried different gmail account and none are working...but i do have access via an itouch and I.E. so i know that the password are correct....


Reproducible: Always
