application/x-httpd-php type refusing to refresh
Firefox will not try to see if the content of an URL ha changed after it get a
file of type application/x-httpd-php. This type came from a badly configured web
server (the type wa defined, but the php engine wa disabled). After removing
the php file and replacing it with a normal .html, the URL would result in the
index.html, instead of the index.php. This wa verified with elinks.

But firefox would bring up the Save As dialog for the index.php. The only way to
clear it wa to clear the cache.
