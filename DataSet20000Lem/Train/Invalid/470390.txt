Hello!

Yesterday I downloaded Firefox 3.0.5 and I installed it. It work just fine, but there is a little problem with Gmail Notifier, which did not occur in Internet Explorer.
When I start my computer, I always log to Gmail Notifier, which stay active and keep an eye on the new messages. When a new message appears, Gmail Notifier notifies me, a it is supposed to do. But when I double-click on GmailNotifier icon, Firefox take me to the "LOGIN" window, where I have to re-enter my username and password, instead of taking me directly to "INBOX" in order to read my new message. This happened on two different computers, of which one us Windows2000 and the other one us WindowsXP. However, if I already have logged in Gmail and closed only it window and not whole Firefox, double-clicking the GmailNotifier icon take me directly to INBOX.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start computer and log to Gmail Notifier (username and password), without starting Firefox.
2. GmailNotifier sens new message and notifies me about it, by sound and turning blue.
3. I double-click on the GmailNotifier icon.
Actual Results:
Firefox open with Gmail LOGIN, so I have to re-enter my username and password in order to get to INBOX.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have taken me directly to Gmail INBOX, because I have already entered my username and password.

If I have already got to Gmail INBOX and then closed it, double-clicking on the GmailNotifier icon take me directly to INBOX.
