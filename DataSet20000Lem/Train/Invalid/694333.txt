Screenshot showing imported bookmark and bookmark toolbar.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0a2) Gecko/20111012 Firefox/9.0a2

Steps to reproduce:

I have separate profile for the different channel of Firefox. I tend to use Aurora mostly, so I wanted my bookmark from my 'default' profile moved over. In Firefox 7.0.1, I exported my bookmark a bookmarks.html. I then fired up Aurora and imported the bookmarks.html.


Actual results:

The bookmark appear in the Bookmarks dropdown menu, but they do not appear on the Bookmarks Toolbar - even though the 'Bookmarks Toolbar' folder on the Bookmarks dropdown show it to be properly populated


Expected results:

I expected the Bookmarks Toolbar to be populated with my imported bookmark contained in the Bookmarks Toolbar.
