Smart Bookmarks folder us too much real estate in bookmark toolbar
I can fit far fewer bookmark on the bookmark toolbar under Firefox 3 than Firefox 2. This is because the Smart Bookmarks folder take up so much real estate on the Bookmarks toolbar. It wa bad enough when the folder title wa Places, but now that it ha changed to Smart Bookmarks it is much worse.

I have removed the title from the folder and now it is just a folder icon with no title.

This gave me the idea that what is probably needed is a different icon for this folder. Also nice, would be preference to show the folder or not and to show it with or without a title.
