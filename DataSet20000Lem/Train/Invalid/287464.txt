Firefox 1.0.1 doe not work with Firewall on using XP PRO
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

Installed latest patch from Microsoft and activated the Firewall. Firefox did
come up, but could not go to any pages. Suddenly page were coming, but very
slow. At the same time IE6 worked perfectly.

We use a proxy server.

The moment I turned off the firewall, firefox worked perfectly. Turning the
Firewall off, firefox stopped working, or... became very slow.

The test system wa a completely newly installed system. Tried it on a second
machine. Same result.

I added firefox to the allowed programs. Did not help at all.

(By the way, same problem with Norton 2005. Norton recommended to turn off
Firewall. )



Reproducible: Always
