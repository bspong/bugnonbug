Show first-run guide for new Firefox 4 everything
Firefox 4 introduces Firefox Menu, Tabs on top and hide Bookmarks Toolbar by default. As far a I talked with ordinary users, they will surprised at the drastic change and will have trouble with using firefox.
What they ask first are almost always "where is the menus?", "where are my bookmarks?", "how to show menus?", "how to switch back to the old style UI?"

Until they understand they should click new top-left orange Firefox menu, they cannot open config window, cannot open their bookmarks. If they cannot understand new Firefox Menu soon, they'll stop using Firefox 4.

I believe Firefox 4 have to do 2 things:
- User must be able to understand new style UI *easily*.
- User must be able to switch back to old Firefox 3.6 style UI *easily*.
# easily mean "without any other person's help" or "without google search"

One option to make it easy is, show first-run new page which includes:
- How to use new Firefox Menu
- How to switch back to old Firefox 3.6 style UI
