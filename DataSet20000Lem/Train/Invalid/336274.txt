I cannot open a second window, whether I type control-n or click on File/New Window. Nothing happens when I try. I can open multiple tabs.
Come to think of it, javascript popups don't do anything either, even if I don't disallow popups.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on File/New Window...wait...
2. Try control-n...this doesn't work either
3.

Actual Results:
No new window is opened.

Expected Results:
A new window.
