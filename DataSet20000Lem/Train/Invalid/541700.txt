If you visit any web page and zoom-in to acquire larger font for ease of
readability. A page reload (refresh user generated) reset the font size to prior
levels. (I have not verified this behavior when server side initiate a reload)
This behavior wa introduced in the 3.6 rollout (3.5.7 worked fine)
If a user establishes a viewing preference for their ease of use, the localized
preference should be retained.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load any page (using tab mode orientation)
2.zoom in to enarge font
3.reload current page
