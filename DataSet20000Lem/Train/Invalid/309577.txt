Where doe Firefox go when you put http://mboedick.orgh in the URL bar?
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4

I went to http://mboedick.orgh by typo today. It load some site but I can't
figure out what the actual site is (it's not a valid URL and doesn't work in
other browsers). If Firefox is doing behind the scene guessing when invalid
URLs are typed, it should indicate that it is and not leave the invalid URL in
the URL bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type http://mboedick.orgh in the URL bar.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Some bible site loaded.

Expected Results:
Indicate that the URL is invalid and go to a guessed URL.
