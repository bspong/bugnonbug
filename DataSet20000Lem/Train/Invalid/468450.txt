Firebug 1.3.0b5 doesn't show the XML HTTPRequests anymore
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20081207 Shiretoko/3.1b3pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20081207 Shiretoko/3.1b3pre

I don't know if that's the right place post that bug, but anyway.
Since around one week (since Shiretoko replaced Minefield, I can't see the HTTPRequests.
That's very annoying, because I use it a lot... So I can't use Shiretoko for that part of my job.
Anyway, I still have the beta version of Fx 3.1.
I don't know if the problem is on the Fx side or the Firebug one, but I hope someone will know answer me.
