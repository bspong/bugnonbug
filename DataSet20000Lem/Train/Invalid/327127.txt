When visiting www.webwereld.nl or other site with flash content, Firefox sometimes freeze completely, where not even the window is repainted when you move another window over it. In some of these cases, glibc also print message about corrupted pointer on the console:
*** glibc detected *** corrupted double-linked list: 0x0930d9a0 ***
or:
*** glibc detected *** free(): invalid pointer: 0x0929e4d8 ***

It is clearly related to the Flash plugin only (version 7.0r61 and 7.0r25). I can reproduce the problem with only the Flash plugin installed, and with a fresh ~/.mozilla directory without any installed extensions.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox with installed flash plugin on the commandline.
2.Go to a website with lot so flash, such a www.webwereld.nl.
3.Click on a few article headers.
4.Restart Firefox if it doe not freeze after a few pages.
Actual Results:
Sometimes Firefox freeze and/or message about corrupted pointer will appear on the console.

Expected Results:
No freeze and no message about corrupted pointers.

This is on a Debian system with libc6-2.3.5-13. The windowing environment seems to have an influence. On a KDE desktop, the problem seems to occur more frequently than with a desktop with the icewm window manager.
