There are two small-phi letter that are used for different purpose in math:
(a) curly small letter phi font (known from Latex a varphi)
(b) a miniaturized capital phi (known from Latex a straightphi)
According to the accepted definition of Unicode (see e.g.
"http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr25/#_Toc23")
&#x3C6; (&#966;) corresponds to (a),
and &#x3D5; (&#981;) corresponds to (b).
Firefox 2 us the correct rendering on Windows and on Mac. Minefield render correctly on Windows, but not on Mac where (a) and (b) are switched. The STIX font for mathml display correctly on both platforms.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open on Mac the attached file with Firefox 2: The rendering of the phi is according to the rule of unicode.
2.Open on Mac the attached file with Minefield: The rendering of phi is switched, except for the STIX fonts.
3.
Actual Results:
The pair of small phi letter is not rendered correctly according the Unicode specification on MAC by Minefield (except for STIX fonts)

Expected Results:
The pair of small phi letter should be rendered correctly according the Unicode specification on MAC by Minefield.
