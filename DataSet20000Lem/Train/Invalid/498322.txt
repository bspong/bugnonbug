Since the lastest upgrade, the bookmark function no longer works.

I have tried to use the Bookmark function by various mean and none of them have any effect. I usually only have to grab the tab of the page I am viewing and drag it onto a folder icon I have in my tool bar. (or by grabbing the icon from the URL address window and drag it). But that is not working. I tried using the Bookmark pull down menu and choosing "Bookmark This Page" but it doe not work either. I tried using the Ctrl+D shortcut and it still doe not work.

Also, while there are still the bookmark I have collected over time when I pull down the Bookmark menu... if I go to "Organize Bookmarks", then NO bookmark appear in the window that pop up. Even though there are hundred of bookmark in the pull down menu (categorized into subject folders).

Also, the History function show NO history at all.

Both of these function worked well before this last update.

Please advise, thank you in advance for speedy repair of this function.
