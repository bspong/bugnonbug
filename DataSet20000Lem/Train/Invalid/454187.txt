As reported here:

When browsing with firefox to most pages, the browser get completely stalled
for several noticable second when loading the page. The URL
http://use.perl.org/~davorg/journal/ is an example.

I tried it with a new user account running IceWM and the problem occurs there
too.

Example page that cause it are:

* http://www.gnome.org/

* http://www.google.com/search?q=platinum

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum

* http://www.skins.be/

* http://icanhascheezburger.com/

Other people on Mandriva don't seem to have this problem. It seems to be caused by complex operation in the fontconfig package. I reduced the number of fonts, etc., but it still get frozen / stalled / becomes unresponsive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new user account
2. Run IceWM
3. Start firefox.
4. Browse to the URL.
5. At a point the ticking clock will stop ticking and the browser will get

Actual Results:
Firefox freeze for second at a time.

Expected Results:
Firefox remains responsive all the time.

I'm using Mandriva Cooker and had this problem since a few week now.
