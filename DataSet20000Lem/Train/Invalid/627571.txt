I've been forced to finally download 3.6.

I'm repeatedly told that none of the add-ons, on the Add-On page, I choose, can be added, a they're not availble with the 2. versions. Which, I no longer have.

Oh, and all of my folders, and bookmark were gone! I've located backup folders. But, I'm unable to get them back up. There are no folder options.. in the bookmark place. (If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It's not an old saying for the heck of it.)

I first wrote about it in the 'Help' section, under, 'file a broken link.' But found I wa unable to send it a the only option at the bottom of the page was,
Cancel.
Nice, huh?
