I cannot get the Tools / Options / Privacy preference change to be saved. For me this affect any change to the Privacy area. Example: I try to set History to "Remember visited page for the last" 30 "days" or turn ON "Allow site to set cookies" on the Cookies tab then click on Ok. As long a Firefox remains open there is no problem, but if I close and reopen Firefox then the preference change are gone.

Firefox help say no update are available - so I guess that mean I am running the latest version. I did see one other bug report that looked similar but the resolution wa flagged a "Invalid" because the suggestion wa made to 'create a new profile'. Does this mean create a new Windows XP Profile? That would involve reinstalling many software package on the PC. Or is there a way to recreate a Firefox profile?

Any help or suggestion would be appreciated.
