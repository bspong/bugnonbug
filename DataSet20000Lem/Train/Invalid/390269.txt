Till last night Mozilla worked fine. This morning (31.07.2007) when I started Mozilla suddenly it wa closed and an error message came up warning me not to use Mozilla and use IE instead and giving me kind of threat. The message heading wa like this

"USE INTERNET EXPLORER YOU DOPE".

And the message body wa like the following
