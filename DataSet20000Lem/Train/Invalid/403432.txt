I searched through dozen of Bugzilla post but still didn't see one that matched my inquiry, so I apologize if this ha already been addressed. - -
I customized my toolbar by going to view/toolbars/customize. I successfully grabbed and dragged several tool to the navigation toolbar. Then I wanted to undo this and clicked the button “standard” (in the customize-window). Now if I view the navigation toolbar, I get a duplicate address and search bar. No way to remove the doublettes! In the contrary, trying to fix the problem by clicking the “standard”-button again, I got now three address and search bars!
Can anybody help me? Thanks and sorry, my English is not very good.
