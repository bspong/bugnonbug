When I click on some site that call up the Mozilla email window, it show my old emailaddress which wa dzldan@earthlink.net, my new address is dzldan@qwest.net. No place can I see where I change this. Not in preferences, noit in tools, not anywhere. What do I change to fix this, drive me nuts, I send email out using their site only to find out the reply went to the wrong email address.

Reproducible: Always




Some place there must be something to change that will allow me to use my new email address.
