There are a few issue that ocur when the 'Hide the tab bar' option is set in
Deer Park nightlies since 2005-09-02.

Missing status information:

2. Close the browser and start it again.
3. Notice that the navigation button are greyed out even though a page is
loading (you can't press the stop button, but you can use the keyboard shortcut).
4. Also, the progress bar in the status bar isn't showing anything and the two
swirly icon that show progress in the menu bar and on the tab itself don't show up.
5. Open a new tab, move back to the first. The toolbar button are now correct.

Tab won't close:
