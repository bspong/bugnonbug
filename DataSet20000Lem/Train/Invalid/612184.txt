CSS centering break based on order in HTML
Consider a container element that hold three contained element positioned left, center and right. As the example below illustrates, whether the contained element are rendered inside the container element or outside the container element depends not upon the CSS for each of the contained elements, but rather on the order in which they appear in the HTML.

Note that both the HTML and CSS for the example pas W3C validation.
