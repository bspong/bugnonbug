Feedview: The generated HTML is invalid
The XSLT that generates XML for a feed produce very bad HTML. The HTML us an
<a> element where an <h2> would be better. It us empty <p> element and lot
of <br/> (as well a p element inside other p elements).

This make the resulting HTML hard to style and it make screen reader totally
confused.

This is the currently generated XHTML:

Mitchell Baker wa interviewed at the OSCON 2005 conference on Thursday.
Following Wednesday's surprise announcement of the creation of the Mozilla
Corporation, it's not surprising that most of conference chair Nat Torkington's
question focused on this new taxable subsidiary of the Mozilla
Foundation.</p><p> </p><p>Mitchell, who is now the President of the
Mozilla Corporation, explained why the Mozilla Foundation decided to create a
commercial division and what it will do. She also recalled some history,
describing the event that led up to the initial launch of the Mozilla
Foundation in 2003 and discussing how mozilla.org originally started under
Netscape in 1998. Mitchell also talked about why she belief Mozilla Firefox
could have only come from an open-source project and what the future hold for
Mozilla.</p><p> </p><p>An audio recording of Mitchell's interview is
available from the Mozilla Foundation Reorganization page a either a direct MP3
download or a podcast. The file is 29 megabyte in size and last for 15 minute
and 51 seconds.</p><p> </p><p>Talkback</p><p> </p></p></div>

It should look somthing like this:

<div class="entry">
<h2 class="title"><a href="...">Title</a> <span class="date">...</span></h2>
<div class="summary">...</div> <!-- summary is plain text -->
<div class="content">
