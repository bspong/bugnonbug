Page rendering hang upon reference to doubleclick.net in a JavaScript SRC

The page should load completetly, but in Firebird the page rendering hang upon
reaching the <script> tag with src containing "doubleclick.net". The page's
content after the Google logo is not displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firebird.
2. Visit http://ssrl.library.ns.ca/~megatron/tests/small_example.html

Actual Results:
You see some text, followed by a Google logo.
Page rendering hang at the <script src="...doubleclick.net...">, so that the
page's content after the Google logo is not displayed. The status bar display
"Connecting to ad.ca.doubleclick.net..."

Expected Results:
The entire page should have been displayed.

This problem occurs whether Firebird is in Quirks, Standards, or Almost
Standards mode.
It seems to be caused by the use of the tag <script language="Javascript"
src="xxx">, where xxx contains "doubleclick.net" (eg. "ad.ca.doubleclick.net",
"ad.uk.doubleclick.net", etc.).

If the "doubleclick.net" part in the src is changed or removed (try
"doubleclock.net", "doubleclick.not", etc.) the page load correctly.
