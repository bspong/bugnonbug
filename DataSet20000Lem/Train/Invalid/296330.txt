I accidentaly put some icon in the main toolbar (the one with

File,Edit,View,Go,Bookmarks...) and I cannot move them around or reset that toolbar.

Just have a look at it:

And you can't drag these icon back onto the Customize Toolbar window like u can
do with most other icon :-(



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move the Bookmarks star icon from the Customize Toolbars popup window to the
main text-only toolbar (i also moved the Yahoo! toolbar setting icon)

Actual Results:
Icons get stuck there and won't go away! :-(


Expected Results:
I expected a reset of the toolbar, or to be able to drag them away.
