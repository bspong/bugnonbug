When I open the window for customizing the toolbars, it doe not work right. You
can't scroll up and down to choose icons, some of them are cut off, and there
are no cancel/ok/apply type buttons. At the bottom of the window, it says, in
red print:
checkbox id="compact-tasksMenu"
label="&tasksMenu-label;"oncommand="updateCompact" and maybe a few other thing
that are cut off.
Since there aren't any button to close the window, I have to restart the X
Window system (I'm using Linux) to get rid of it. It's kind of annoying. :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firebird
2. Right click on a toolbar
3. Click on Customize


Actual Results:
The customize window opened, but did not display correctly. I had to restart the
X Window system (graphical interface) using ctrl-alt-backspace or logging out
and then in again.

Expected Results:
Correctly displayed the Customize window.

I'm using the default theme. The window displayed fine in Firebird 0.6.1.
