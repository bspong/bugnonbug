Strict compliance mode rendering trigger
Firefox 1.0.7 on WinXP.

URL http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-ios.shtml
render in strict compliance mode

whereas this one render in quirk mode:
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-lan.shtml

however, source show the exact same DOCTYPE for both:

<!-- here start --><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0
Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
[...]

When saved on local filesystem, both page render in strict compliance mode, so
I'm thinking perhaps a timing issue cause Firefox to hit a bug and sometimes
render in quirk mode.
