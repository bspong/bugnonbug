My 2Wire modem kept resetting ever few minutes. My ISP provder thought it wa a bad modem and sent a new one. it wa not the problem. Many folk thought it wa an apple update to it op system that wa causing the problem. it too wa not. ISP sent a TECH to check our line in our house and it too wa not the problem. After uninstalling everything firefox(app, plists, bookmarks, settings, all file in o x library associated with ffox) and then clean installing FFox my 2Wire modem problem disappeared.

Reproducible: Always
