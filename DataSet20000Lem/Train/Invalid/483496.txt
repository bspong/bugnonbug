Some PDFs not opening in browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Search Google for "Google SEO guide pdf"
2. in the second or third result you will find link to pdf
3. Click that link
In the resulting dialog what should Minefield do, click on open with Minefield. Shows error.
Actual Results:
Error. IE7 start Adobe PDF viewer in separate window but there seems to be no way to open the PDF inline in the same tab same browser session like this PDF
http://data.getafreelancer.com/project/400935/MACHEN%2C%20POWERS%2C%20DISQUE%20CHARTERED%20-%20SOS.pdf

Expected Results:
Display PDF inline if I choose open with Minefield. I have addon showing Adobe Acrobat 9.0.0.332 Adobe PDF plugin for firefox and netscape. If something wa corrupted in that plugin, then the second PDF link I gave here wont be showing so nothing is wrong with the plugin itself.

When full window PDF open like in this URL

Ctrl+D doesnt function. The PDF open a document propreties window for this key press
Alt+D doesnt go to address bar. But in IE7 Alt+D go to address bar.
