http-authentication doe not send username/password to page in the same directory

Since the recent version (0.6.1) http-authentication is partially broken.
Firebird 6.0 did not have this behaviour.

On a site I use the following page to log-in "/login.php". This work fine.

After logging in, password and username are correctly submitted to page in the
directory below (like /editor/index.php)

But the password is not submitted to other page in the same directory (like
/documents.php). Also /logout.php doe not work, because it never detects that
the user ha already been logged in
