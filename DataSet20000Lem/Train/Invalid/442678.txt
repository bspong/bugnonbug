Running a 32bit system with Ubuntu 8.04.1 . Ebay companion is erroneous in thinking it ha been installed on a 64bit system/version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Ebay Companion
2. Restart Firefox
Actual Results:
Same error a previous.

Expected Results:
Companion should work, a I am using a 32bit version of Firefox rather than 64bit like it mistakenly thinks.

There is a current workaround for Ubuntu users. In a terminal executing the following command solves the issue in 99.9% of cases, those that do not work usually a a result of user error.

cd /usr/lib
sudo ln -s libnspr4.so.0d libnspr4.so
cd ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default
rm xpti.dat compreg.dat
