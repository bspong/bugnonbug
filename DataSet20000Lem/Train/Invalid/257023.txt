delete key should delete selected bookmark in bookmark menu and toolbars

If you navigate the Bookmarks menu with the keyboard (alt+b, then arrow keys),
there is no way to delete the selected bookmark. You must switch to the mouse,
right click the selected bookmark, and then hit 'd'. Same behaviour in the
bookmark folder on the toolbar.

The delete key should delete the selected entry.

Also, the bookmark menu/folder should not collapse when deleting a bookmark.
This make it very very difficult and frustrating to delete more than 1 bookmark
from within a subfolder or three. I suppose I may need to file a seperate bug on
this.
