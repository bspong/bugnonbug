Am running Firefox 3.6b4.
The following add-on ha worked in other versions:
( LogMeIn, Inc. ) Remote Access Plugin 1.0.0.464
It doe not with 3.6b4, which report it a incompatible.
Don't know if the plugin would help or not, fact is: the F10 key is not functional, although it is needed many times: During my LogMeIn session I access a Linux RedHat accounting program where the F key are all necessary.
All this worked with Mozilla 3.5, and 3.6a


Reproducible: Always
