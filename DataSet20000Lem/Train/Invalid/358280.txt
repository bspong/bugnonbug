New download and full install of Firefox 2: I've set the browser to open all request in new tabs. It always reuses the same tab. I've set the pref and exited and set the pref and entered bookmark and entered new site in the address window. Nothing ha helped to open the new site in a new tab. Right click will open a new tab.

Reproducible: Always
