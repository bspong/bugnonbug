http://JesusnJim.com/z/xhtml-css-uc-element-name-test.xhtml

tried these test with DIV cs element name in upper case.


Actual results:

div tag content that should be red is not red. server is set up to properly serve up xhtml. DIV cs is not accepted but div is. cs is not supposed to be case sensitive I am told. but in ff 5.0 it only accepts lower case. not so in other browsers.


Expected results:

should have showed red text where it say "this should be red" and accepted the DIV element name cs for the div element.
