The option to clear personal data on close firefox doesn´t work
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.9b4) Gecko/2008030714 Firefox/3.0b4

When the option "clear personal option on close firefox" is set, it doesn´t work because after close firefox and reopen, I still have access to the history pages..
And if I press the button "clear now" it doesn´t work too.. because I still have access to the history pages.

PS.. The option "keep history for days... " is unchecked...
