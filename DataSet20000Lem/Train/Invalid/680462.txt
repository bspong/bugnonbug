Images do not carry cooky set by script in head
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_0) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/13.0.782.112 Safari/535.1

Steps to reproduce:

When I set a cookie via a script in the head of the document, subsequent image in that document do not carry the cookie when they reach the server. Because of this, it's impossible to send image with information about the client, such a screen resolution, allowing the server to return an appropriate image size for a particular device.

Note that this approach is becoming common in Responsive Design implementations.


Actual results:

The following demo reference a mobile-friendly image in the source by default. A script in the head set a cookie specifying whether the device is small, medium, or large. This cookie is not included with the image when it hit the server.

This readme describes what's taking place in the demo: https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images/tree/cookie-driven


Expected results:

All other browser that I've tested will include a cookie set by JS in subsequent page requests. Unfortunately, it seems Firefox is sending this request without the cookie attached, meaning the image will not be routed appropriately until a page refresh.
