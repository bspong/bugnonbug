Infobar doesn't allow copying selector of inspected element
When I'm using the Inspector a lot, I find myself constantly switching back and forth between it and whatever editor I'm using.

Originally I thought it'd be good to copy the selector to the clipboard when "pinning" the inspected element, but that's a bit forward - could lead to unexpected dataloss for the user from their clipboard.

However, clicking the selector popup itself is a secondary action which would have to be done intentionally. Could also consider a click'n'hold menu there too, I guess, but that's even more steps, and is prematurely optimizing for >1 action to be available.

Not discoverable, but also not in the way. Might be cool to do an nsIAlertService notification indicating what just happened.
