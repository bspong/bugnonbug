The DVD drive and CD drive have disappeared from the "My Computer" device with removable storage. this occurred after installing Fire4fox 2.0.0.7 onto the XP operating system. Tried 'System Restore' option on WinXP with no success. Occasionally the two device will reappear, and when I checked them with the 'Device Manager', it wa indicated that both burner were functioning. When the DVD/CD device reappeared I put a blank CD in the device to burn some data onto it. The system crashed with the message of "MACHINE CHECK EXCEPTION' and several technical info codes, which I wrote down. I wa not able to find a source for what those code meant. I tried returning to the Mozilla browser before @.0.0.7, but still could not retrieve DVD and CD burners.
Checked the "event Viewer" in administrative Tools and a number warning and code red event appear to have happened, but don't know what a lot of that stuff means.
Also, Linux which is on a partition, is now stuck at the "checking battery" line of uploading.
Checked OS with antivirus and sbybot, and there were a couple of thing which had to be removed to the "chest", but no malware appears at this time.

Reproducible: Always
