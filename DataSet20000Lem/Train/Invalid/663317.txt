I am using an OLD version of FIREFOX - why because I like it. Now every time start up I get a HELPFUL UPDATE PLUGINS screen.

DAMN you aholes you are getting no better than Microsoft with your helpfulness.

I don't want a NEW version and and I don't want to be reminded. If I have to change I will just switch to Chrome out of spite to you guys.

DON'T do what Microsoft doe and force your help on users.

And if you're wondering why I am puttint this here instead of on the feed back back for Firefox - it's because I can't submit my complaint until I upgrade, which is exactly what my complaint is.

LEAVE people alone. Make a better product available. If I want to be a jerk and keep my old version, so be it. And people should be able to submit comment without having to be on the latest version.

DAMN
