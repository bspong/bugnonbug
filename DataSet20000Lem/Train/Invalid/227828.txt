The top navigation is the area in question. When you mouse-over any of the
navigation images, it make a white vertical line on top of the image directly
to the left of the redrawn image. This also happens in Mozilla and Galeon.
This doe NOT happen in Konqueror or Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.cornerspeed.com/kasey/fb_bug/index.html
2. Hover over any of the top navigation link
3. If you open a new tab and come back, the line go away.

Actual Results:
A white line appears on the image immediately to the left of the redrawn
(mouse-over) image.

Expected Results:
Don't make a white line. This may mean redrawing the image to the left of the
redrawn image, but I'm not sure why this should be necessary.

I have noticed this in Mozilla for some time, so I assume that the same code
that Mozilla us wa used for mouse overs, so the bug wa transferred to Firebird.
