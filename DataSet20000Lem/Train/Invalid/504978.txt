XMLHttpRequest reponds with Cteonnt-Length instead of Content-Length while the status = 0 and readyState=4
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1

After creating an XMLHttpRequest and sending it, the readyState of the request is set to 4, and the status is 0. The responseText is empty. If you view the Response header for the request in FireBug, you will notice that the response header for the Content-Length is incorrectly spelled a "Cteonnt-Length", causing the request to fail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an XMLHttpRequest and send it.
2. Load the page in browser.
3. View response header in FireBug
Actual Results:
XMLHttpRequest status is never set to 200, and responseText/XML is null.

Expected Results:
Set Cteonnt-Length to Content-Length and set the responseText to the data from request.
