The division operation (XPath), a an expression to an <xsl:number> tag, always return an integer, rather than a float (when applicable).

E.g. <xsl:number value="250 div 100)"/> return 3 instead of 2.5

Note: Likely a core Mozilla issue, not just Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load attached test case XML file in browser
2. View the results.

Actual Results:
The value returned on screen are rounded to the nearest integer value.
~ = "repeated"
2.5 becomes 3
55.55~ becomes 56
22.22~ becomes 22

Expected Results:
The value returned should not be integer values...
2.5, 55.55~, 22.22~ etc.

This is a very important issue, in the future of SVG for Mozilla, a "dynamic" graphic will often depend on some simple math in the XSL, to generate SVG content. (This is where I discovered the issue... a (3 * 100) != 250, and thus my graphic looked quite strange)
