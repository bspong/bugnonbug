Frequent black screen and Firefox 4 becomes unresponsive
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Several time a day since upgrading to Firefox 4, Firefox will become slow and unrseponsivie, and eventually the content area will turn black. The Toolbars and tab still display but do not function. Firefox will now outright crash on me sometimes a well, just completely close and dissappear. This never occurred before Firefox 4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I am not sure how to reproduce this issue other than simply using the browser for an hour or so. It happens several time a day, but I have not seen a pattern in any specific page or action that cause it. There are similar report of black screen in other bug reports, but they mention thing like playing video or viewing content in full screen mode.

This is probably the closest bug, but is marked a resolved, and the user state he can change tabs. I am unable to change tab once this issue occurs:
