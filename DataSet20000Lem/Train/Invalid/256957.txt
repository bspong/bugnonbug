The site http://midgardmanga.keenspace.com/ display incorrectly in the latest
branch nightly. This happened a while ago to me but it went away after
upgrading. Now it's happening again! The background is all white, and you can
only see a bit of yellow text. It's supposed to have a black background with a
tree image and white text. Works in MSIE, miraculously.
