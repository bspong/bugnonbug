I noticed after updating to Firefox 2.0.0.8 that when I click Send to>Gmail the window pop under the current Firefox window and the tab on the main window get switched.

I really hate this behavior. I'm not sure who's at fault (Google or Firefox so I'm submitting it to both bug lists) but I'd like a fix and until then I'm going to try and roll back to Firefox 2.0.0.7. I looked through Firefox's release note but didn't see anything useful.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click Send to>Gmail in Google Toolbar
2.Watch what happens
3.Try it in 2.0.0.7
Actual Results:
I click Send to>Gmail the window pop under the current Firefox window and the tab on the main window get switched.

Expected Results:
It should open a new window on top of the current session and not change the tab selected.
