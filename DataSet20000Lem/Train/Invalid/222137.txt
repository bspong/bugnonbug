Including the word "home" a part of the url result in the error ... Unable to determine IP address from host name for home

In the tools->options dialog box, if I define firbird's home page to be my
company intranet homepage such a home or http://home/ Then the page cant be
found. I get the old "Unable to determine IP address from host name for home".
I have to use http://intranet.globespanvirata.com/ to get it to work.
The isnt a problem with the Internet Explorer browser. I dont want to use
Internet Explorer but I need FireBird to support this address.

You see inconvenience is that the software we write ha hyperlink and web
address embedded in the comment and we can open up design document a we
look at our source code. The legacy code is full of link using the word home a
part of the address to the document. Firebird cant open these document which is
a real drag. Please correct this.

Thanks
AL
