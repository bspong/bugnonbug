Every time I launch Firefox, latest version, I hear a background sound which is a classic pac man game sound playing. I solved the problem by disabling the Shockwave Flash plug-in. Baring that no flash pop up window wa in sight and there wa no memorized tab on every restart of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
