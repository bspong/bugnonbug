After updating my Flash Player to version 10.1.53.64 I recognized that video on YouTube were only playing the audio but no video. The control are still functional, so I'm able to start and pause the video.

If I click the lower right corner to maximize the player the video and audio is available. If I switch back to normal mode only the last frame of the video is displayed.

Same if I open Adobe's "About Flash Player" Page (http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/).

Both Flash object are not loaded. But if I load them directly they are displayed. Example: http://www.adobe.com/swf/software/flash/about/flashAbout_info_small.swf

This happens only with Firefox. If I use Safari 5.0.1 (6533.17.8) everthing is fine.

I'm using Mac OS X 10.6.4 Build 10F569.
