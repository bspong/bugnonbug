When a document contains a block that ha 'position: absolute' and a bottom or top property (typically zero or a small distance), it should be absolutely positioned in relation to the bottom of it's containing block.

It work for the top property, but for bottom, the position is not calculated according to the position of the end of the containing block, but according to the viewport, which happens to be used to make up the initial containing block, the containing block of the root element.

The CSS 2.1 spec is clear on the bottom property: ``For absolutely positioned element whose containing block is based on a block-level element, this property is an offset from the padding edge of that element.''

Reproducible: Always
