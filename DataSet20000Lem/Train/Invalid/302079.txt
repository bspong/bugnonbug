In many (but not all) links, where I wa previously able to open link into new
tabs, this function no longer works.

As an example: with your browser configured to load URLs into a new tab with
middle-click or ctrl-click, go to http://linuxtoday.com, and then middle-click
on any story link in the middle of the page. Expected behavior is that the link
should open in a background tab, but instead no link are opened, and nothing
happens. This had worked correctly up through Firefox 1.0.4 (did not test under
1.0.5). This doe not happen on *all* URLs, though. On the above mentioned
site, if you middle click on a *sidebar* link, this will load correctly into a
new tab a expected. Also, on link that do not work with middle/ctrl-click,
right-clicking and selecting "open link in new tab" will work a expected.

LT is not the only site where this happens, have experienced it on various other
sites. But LT is the easiest place to duplicate it.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Be sure browser is set to open link in new tab (default behavior in FF?)
2.navigate to http://linuxtoday.com
3.middle-click on a story link, no link will be opened
4.middle-click on a sidebar link, link will open in new tab.

Actual Results:
step 3: nothing
step 4: opened in new tab

Expected Results:
step 3: open link in new tab
step 4: open link in new tab
