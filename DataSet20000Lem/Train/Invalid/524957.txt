When reopening a session with many many tab (80+) firefox seems to load the page mostly on a tab-by-tab basis instead of fetching all HTML/CSS/JS first and then loading the heavy-weight content (images, flash, pdfs).

Since i have many image-heavy page in my session it can take several minute until everything is loaded. I'd like to browse the remaining (mostly text-based) page before everything is done loading.

I propose an option to queue the request globally based on expected content-type instead of queueing thing tab by tab. Or if it's not possible to do based on content-type then at least load image last, globally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many tab
2. Enable session restore
3. Restart Firefox
4. Trace the order in which content is fetched (e.g. with the live http header extension)

Actual Results:
Watch how not even the HTML is fetched for some tab until other tab have loaded completely

Expected Results:
The basic page being fetched/rendered first before the fluff is loaded
