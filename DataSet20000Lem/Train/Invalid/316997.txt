An unnecessary GET request for favicon.ico is issued when a form is submitted.

This occurs for each form submission I make in the same browser session. Doesn't seem to be limited to form submission either.

Was using form on HTML page on local PC with local webserver (IP address used in form wa 127.0.0.1).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create (any) form in an HTML page
2. Click submit
3. Firefox submits two GET requests.
4. Repeat in the same session
5. Note that number of redundant query for favicon.ico!
