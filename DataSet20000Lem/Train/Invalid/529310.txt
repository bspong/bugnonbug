Firefox 3.0.1 reliably crash for me when I try to save the WAV file at http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/majshf.wav .


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/scales.html

2. Go to the linked text "Tuning Shift WAV file" near the bottom of the page. (It should link to "http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/majshf.wav")

3. Click on the link (regular left click). A box pop up asking if you want to play the WAV file or save it.

4. Choose the save-to-disk option.

5. Crash :-).

Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, leaving me with a window for sending a crash report to Mozilla.

Expected Results:
I expected it to save the WAV file :-). (It did not -- I guess the crash happens before any saving.)

The first time this happened, I filled in the talkback crash report form, and it wa submitted a http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/349cf637-b638-4c98-bbb7-cfd3e2091117 .

I looked for dups, but https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=crash+download+save+wav+file give "zarro boogs found".
Taking out the "wav" show two bug (386512 and 441052) that do not appear to be related to this problem.
