error message at startup: "Error launching browser window: no XBL binding for browser"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031030
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031121 Firebird/0.7+

When I attempt to start Mozilla Firebird for Win32 11/20 or 11/21 build (Note
that since there were no official 11/20 builds, I wa using an unofficial one),
I receive the error message "Error launching browser window: no XBL binding
for browser". After clicking okay, the browser window stays, I can click the
menus, and the Windows button (Maximize, etc.) work. However, no response is
generated when I click on any toolbar button or type anything in the location
bar and press enter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Mozilla Firebird 11/20 or 11/21 build for Win32 under WinXP SP1.
Note that since there were no official Win32 build for 11/20, this wa an
unofficial build from some forum, compiled with MSVC optimized for SSE. The
11/21 build, however, wa official. The bug is the same whether the zipped or
installer version is used.
2. Launch this version of Mozilla Firebird.
3.

Actual Results:
I received the error message "Error launching browser window: no XBL binding
for browser" and the browser did not function.

Expected Results:
functioned normally
