The first <ul> after <h2> or <h3> header get an extra line of vertical space, but the second occurance of a <ul> in a particular column of a table doesn't get the extra blank line. Refer to the vertical space before 'Preliminaries' and 'Bullish' in each of the three column in the specified URL, then compare to the vertical space before 'Covered' in the third column. The 'Covered' <ul> doesn't get the extra space, despite similarity in the surrounding HTML structure. No floating <div>'s or other complexitites required.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
refer to the URL above


Expected Results:
Consistent spacing regardless of where the <ul> occurs.

Can't seem to code around it.
