There wa a bug about keyboard shortcut before, but I can't find it anymore.
Here's what I think should work in Firebird:

1) Cmd-M to minimize (there is already a bug open for this).
2) Cmd-Shift-Left/Right to change tabs. PgUp/Dn is not nearly a
convenient/conventional on mac (esp powerbooks).
3) Ctrl-Enter to autocomplete www.[location text].com and Ctrl-Shift-Enter to
autocomplete www.[location text].org. This work on the Windows/Linux
versions... one would expect the Mac version to work similarly.
4) Delete (Backspace) to go back. This is present in Safari and IE and is really
handy.
