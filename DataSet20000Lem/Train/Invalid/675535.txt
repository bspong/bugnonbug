iGoogle doesn't reload (Aurora and Nightly)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:7.0a2) Gecko/20110730 Firefox/7.0a2
Build ID: 20110730042035

Steps to reproduce:

Logged on to my Google account. Selected URL: http://www.google.com/ig



Actual results:

After page load completed, selecting page reload button had no effect. Selecting "Reload" from "View" menu also had no effect. I attempted to clear cache. I attempted to re-boot the system and again clear cache. These step did not ameliorate the problem. The problem occurs with both Aurora and Nightly. It doe *not* occur with Firefox "beta". It also doe *not* occur when the user is *not* logged on and the specified URL yield the default white Google screen.


Expected results:

Selecting the Reload button, or selecting View==> Reload, should yield a refresh of the page view. (This is important when new information is available on the page, such a stock ticker updates, weather changes, RSS feed updates.)
