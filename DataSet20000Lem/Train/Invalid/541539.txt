Installation of extension and persona not working (because xpinstall.whitelist.add always get reset).

xpinstall.whitelist.add and xpinstall.whitelist.add.36 are emptied.

This prevents persona from being shown when hovering over them at getpersonas.com.
That way using this nice feature is discouraged due to the missing preview.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the FF preference and make sure there IS a value in Security > Warn, when website try installing extension > Exceptions.
E.g.: FF 3.6 set these default values:
addons.mozilla.org
getpersonas.com
Set them.
about:config says, that the value (xpinstall.whitelist.add) are empty.
Opening the preference menu again, they are still in this field there.

2. Close FF and start it again.

3. The value in xpinstall.whitelist.add and in the field are empty.

Actual Results:
xpinstall.whitelist.add and also xpinstall.whitelist.add.36 should still be set.

Expected Results:
The value I set should still be there.

Worked in FF 3.5.

Looking in about:config FF note the empty string a "changed/set by user" and I can set them back to the default. This is then also displayed in about:config.
But after a restart these value are again gone.

As this break the preview of the major feature personas, I set this bug to "major".
