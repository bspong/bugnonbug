The link provided a an example might not always be online since it the
testserver I run on my own computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a html page with a div that contains ='newsb'
2. In an external style sheet create a class like this one:
.newsb:first-letter {
font: 180%;
float: left;
}
3. Link to the stylesheet so it get applied to the html page.

Actual Results:
While IE 6.0 Renders the page properly Mozilla Firebird will totally ignore the
pseudo class, it render the first letter of the newsb class a it render the
rest of the text.

Expected Results:
It should have made the first letter in the <div class='newsb'> </div> 180%
bigger then the default font size of that class, or it's parent class if the
newsb class doesn't have font-size defined.
