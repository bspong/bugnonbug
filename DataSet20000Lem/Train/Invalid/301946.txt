on page that have JPEG image (my.yahoo.com), the image download but do not
render on the downloaded page, though there is an appropriate amount of white
space indicating the browser belief an image is present. right-clicking on the
image white space, and selecting "View image" enables a second window to pop up,
with the image visible.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto my.yahoo.com
2.
3.

Actual Results:
page downloads, image appear to download, white space is visible, but no image
is displaying

Expected Results:
display image instead of whitespace.

To ensure this is not a "system dll" related issue, I have also tested with IE
on the same machine. image display properly in IE. so the issue is related to
firefox and/or some firefox / xp interaction. I am running XP with SP 2, latest
automatic update installed, IBM T40 1 GB RAM.

I have window firewall off, no antivirus/antispy software currently running.
machine ha been swept for spyware and viruses.
