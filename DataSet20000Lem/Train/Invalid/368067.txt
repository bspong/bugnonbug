If you leave your Homepage blank and then set "When Firefox starts:" to "Show my window and tab from last time" then it will not show your window from last time, it will only show a blank page when it load like it is set to "When Firefox starts: Show my Homepage".

This only happens when the Homepage is left blank. A workaround for this bug is to set the homepage to "about:blank"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit > Preferences > Main
2. Change the setting "When Firefox starts:" to "Show my window and tab from last time"
3. Set the Home Page field to blank (Not the word blank, no content in the text box)
4. Close Firefox Preferences
5. Open multiple tab and go to different website
6. Close Firefox
7. Open Firefox
Actual Results:
When Firefox is reopened, there are no tabs. There is only 1 blank page.

Expected Results:
When Firefox wa reopened, there should be tab open with the website that were in them before Firefox wa closed
