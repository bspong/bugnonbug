Some time ago IE9 beta and FF4.0 beta HW-accelerated font rendering look the same (fonts wa much bolder and wider than in non HW-accelerader case), but it seems IE9 drop the whole idea to render via direct2d or fix it somehow, so now they look normally (old way) in IE9 release and still much bolder and wider in FF4.0RC1. Please fix font back to mach IE9 (HW-accelerated) and all others (non-HW-accelerated). Right now only workaround is gfx.direct2d.disabled=true
