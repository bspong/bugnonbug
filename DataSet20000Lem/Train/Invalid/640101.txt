Spreadsheets of >100 line are loaded in 2 steps: first the first 100 lines, and only then the rest.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a big spreadsheet using Google Docs (>100 lines; mine is ~700 lines). It may be required to create it with older version of FF (< 4.0rc1-build1).
2. Open it with 4.0rc1-build1.
3. Google will load the first 100 line and only then the rest when it work fine (FF 3.5.x / <=4.0b12 / Chrome), but with 4.0rc1-build1 it doe not try to.
Actual Results:
With 4.0rc1-build1, the rest of the line are not loaded and the web site "freezes" - it's not possible to edit anything.

Expected Results:
The entire spreadsheet should load.
