Though it worked fine in previous build of FireFox, in recent build I have
been unable to submit a form on my online banking website. It work in other
browsers, so I don't think it is a problem with the site. When I press a button
that is an image that submits the form, nothing happens. Unfortunately I can't
supply a way for you to see the page in question, a it requires you to be
logged in to my bank account. But here is the source code of the image-based
button:

<input type="image" src="/images/submit.gif" id=image1 name=image1>

Thsi is within a form that is called thusly:

<form name="trans_1" id="trans_1" action="/scripts/sdk/adinetin.dll"
method="POST" onSubmit="return submitonce(this)">

And there is also some long JavaScript associated with it at the beginning of
the document. Any reason why this would not work in the current build?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into online bank.
2. Start a transfer.
3. Fill out the first form and click "submit."

Actual Results:
Nothing happens. The image is selected, but you're not redirected to a new page.

Expected Results:
I'd go to the next screen, where I am allowed to transfer money from one account
to another.
