FIrefox doe a dns lookup on all link in a page. Dialup user will not be happy with that feature. I wrote my own home page with +200 link and firefox 3.1b2 check all link anytime I get back to my page or when first starting up.
Verified the above using wireshark not to mention seeing complaint in var/lib/named/var/log/default.log about bad addresses.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create any page with bunch of link
2. disable all check for update
3. firefox index.html
Actual Results:
$ tail /var/lib/named/var/log/default.log

Expected Results:
I do not expect any dns lookup until I click a link.

Need a setting to disable web page dns lookup on all link in the page.
