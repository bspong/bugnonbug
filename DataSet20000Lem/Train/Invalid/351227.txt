I set the preference "select new tab opened from links" to unchecked. I have "new tab in most recent windows" checked. I click link with left mouse button and it open in a new tab, but that tab opens. If I click the link with the middle button, it open in a new tab, but the new tab doe not open. I would expect both button to behave the same with these settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1."new tab in most recent windows" checked
2."select new tab opened from links" unchecked
3.click link with left mouse button

Actual Results:
open in a new tab, but that tab also open and the original tab is no longer in view

Expected Results:
open in a new tab, but the new tab doe not open for viewing, but original tab remains in view.
