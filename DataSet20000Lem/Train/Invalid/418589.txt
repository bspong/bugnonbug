With autoscroll enabled, middle-clicking activates autoscroll a expected. Under Firefox 2, middle-clicking a second time would then deactivate it (as would left or right-clicking).

Under Firefox 3, middle-clicking a second time ha no effect. Autoscroll remains enabled until the left or right mouse button are used. As this is contrary to the behavior of most applications, I can only assume it is a bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on autoscroll option
2. Middle-click
3. Middle-click again
Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
Autoscroll should deactivate with the second click.
