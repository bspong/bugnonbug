Firefox will only save the file name of web page rather then the titles.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Firefox save the file with it original name without giving you the choice to change it.

Expected Results:
To be able to save the file and edit the name of it if I want to.

I know about save target a but that's annoying to have to go through two step when it could be just one like with IE. It's also a pain to have to hunt for a file among a mass of stupidly named files.
