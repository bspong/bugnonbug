In any Yahoo group to which I belong, if I click on the "Photos" area listed on
the upper left menu, I can navigate the photos, see their captions, but the
photo themselves do not appear. Not in Thumbnail, Slideshow or "closeup". If
I right click for the context menu and then select "view image" I am able to see
that single image. Going back to the (say) thumbnail view of a collection of
photos, again there are no photos. The latest Mozilla browser work fine.

If this turn out to be specific to my machine or account, I can give you my

security policy.
