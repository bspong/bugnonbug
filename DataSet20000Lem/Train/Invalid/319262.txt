Memory leak... If opened for 2.5 hours, memory usage (which already is high) go up from about 100MB to 210MB or so... Performance of the system is affected very badly. Loading page get slower and slower, system start hanging. When uncaught, memory leak lead to hard reboot (power off - power on) leading to data corruption and loss). I have to restart fx every 2 hour (unacceptable workaround) to avoid any 'accidents'...

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:
minimal and effective memory usage.

system is ubuntu 5.10; installed using tar file. Marked security issue a bad memory handling is a very 'nice' door for exploitation...
