Firefox prompted me to install a new update and I told it to wait until the next restart. I started the program, it installed the update, and when Firefox opened I got an "Unable to connect" error. I thought it wa my internet but Internet Explorer work fine. No security program whatsoever and my Windows firewall is disabled so I don't think anything I am aware of is blocking Firefox from connecting. Thought it might be the Norton Internet Security program that came preinstalled on my computer so I deleted every trace of Symantec including register keys. System restore did not solve the problem either. Tried uninstalling Firefox 2.0x and installing version 3.0 but I still get the same error. This is with every website.

Reproducible: Always
