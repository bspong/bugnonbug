Expected Results:
Click to work. :)

DOM inspector ha the box model for both IMG and A shifted south almost all off the actual image display location. I don't see any suspicious offsets, floats, etc. in the DOM. Source say the A's are float:right vertical-align:bottom. No odd borders, etc. Hmmm. IE just allows click on the area that overlap the image and the box model location. FF allow click on an area of the full image vertical size. GIF file don't contain Y offsets, though, that I know of.
Hmmm.

Ah. The image is a 1x1 black dot. The "more" that's shown on-screen must be the ALT="more" value. Nice that the browser decide that a 1x1 image isn't good enough, so the ALT text should be shown.

So, the problem is that the box model of the image doesn't include the location of the ALT text. Probably 'cause of the align:bottom and the IMG tag giving the explicit height. Or maybe the problem is that the ALT text isn't aligned at the image itself. (Which would make the site look ugly until they fixed it.)

Anyway, it look like the box model is shoved down low by the align:bottom, the HEIGHT value clip the top. And dead area is the result.
