The Places default folder from a beta 1 profile, will exist in bookmark toolbar after being updated to beta 2. This seems redundant that there is both "Smart Bookmarks" and "Places" in the same toolbar.

Should the behavior get rid of Places Folder?

See screenshot

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install fx3b1, clean profile
2. update to fx3b2 using "betatest" channel
3. open beta 2 with the same profile
4. Verify "Places" folder exists in bookmark toolbar
Actual Results:
Should Places folder be gone after update?

Expected Results:
Places folder exists in Bm toolbar
