Firefox seems to create a really tiny window, that cannot be resized and doesn't have the menu enabled.

see? no menu, but it's there... don't be misleaded, the selected window is not "Enter A Bug"...


While writing this report, i managed to click on the window. Initially with no result, except making the window/line disappear, but only until i would select it again with the dock menu (even though wa not visible with Exposé at this point) and make appear again.

Eventually, by clicking the lowest part of it, it expanded to the minimum dimension allowed for a window, that is a wide a the three colored button + gray long button and it's height is a much a to show toolbar + bookmark bar.
I expanded it and here is the result: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/624230/firefox-bugreport/screen4.jpg
Observe the window's objects... i didn't change ANY setting, but still the addons component are slightly changed...

From this stage I could close the window and solve the situation, without quitting.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Cannot really reproduce it, I realize it occurs when I try to quit, and the session manager ask what do since there's more than one window open.

Another way I realized that it occurred wa when i tried to click on the dock icon with the program already launched but without any open window. Instead of opening a new window, it would just do nothing, since a window wa already open.



Problem occurring since updating to 3.6 (on Mac OS X 10.6.2) on a 15" MacBookPro5.3
