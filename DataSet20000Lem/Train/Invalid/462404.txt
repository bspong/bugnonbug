Dialog Immediately Before Firefox crash firefox-bin
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1

I know this is really obscure, but I wanted to get it entered for review. Something ha changed in the firefox script in 3.1b1 that disallows it to be run immediately after a zenity dialog. I have always alerted user running beta build here that they are entering a product not currently in production. The following script cause Firefox to crash every time:

#!/bin/ksh

/opt/gnome/bin/zenity --info --text "Here come Firefox 3.1"

/u/firefox_beta/firefox/firefox

If I comment out the zenity line, it work perfectly. Here is what I get on the command line:

This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
(Details: serial 554 error_code 3 request_code 20 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X error are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
