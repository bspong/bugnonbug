My Firefox browser will not resolve this URL: www.hillbillyhomecompanion.dynalias.com. It will resolve this one: www.hillbillyhomecompanion.com. First one us DynDNS name servers. Second one us 1&1 Internet name servers. Firefox will also display the page if I enter the IP address.

IE will resolve either, Chrome will resolve either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type www.hillbillyhomecompanion.dynalias.com in the address bar.
2.Hit Go or Return or however you do it.
3.
Actual Results:
Server not found

Firefox can't find the server at www.hillbillyhomecompanion.dynalias.com.

Expected Results:
I expected to see my home page. I know the server wa up because I'm sitting next to it.

I have contacted DynDNS tech support. No luck. I thought that you would like to know that Firefox is not resolving URL's via DynDNS name servers.

This is probably not even a bug with Firefox but something external.
