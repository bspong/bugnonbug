If you use the Phoenity skins/themes and make a lot of bookmark at the top (or
just enough to create the 'expand arrow' it seems to cause the browser act
jittery. you'd notice it, because it jumps.. only way to stop it is to make it
so you don't have the expand arrow.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a Phoenity skin
2. Add a lot of bookmark right at the top, until yo uget the expanding arrow.
3. Watch the browser act jittery

Actual Results:
It act jittery, but it's usable.. and annoying.

Expected Results:
Just add the expand arrow, without the jittery. Only Phoenity skin cause it,
so far.

Does not occur with default theme that I notice, just Phoenity
