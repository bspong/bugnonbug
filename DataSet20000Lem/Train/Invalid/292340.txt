Browser hang when first loading
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

I just upgraded Firefox on my work PC and home PC. They are running Windows XP
Professional and Media Center respectively. After clicking the red upgrade
button, I went through the process of upgrading to 1.0.3. The installation
process went through fine, but after it finished when I opened Firefox, it just
hung while trying to finish displaying the skin of the browser. The same bug is
present on both computers. If I close and reopen, sometimes I get the same bug
and sometimes I don't. Sometimes in trying this, I can't fully close Firefox
without killing the process.

As for the exact point that it hangs, it open the window and is able to draw
the dropdowns, the address bar (forward, backward, refresh, etc.). After that,
it show a blank grey area where the "personal toolbar folder" bookmark
display. I have my tab set to not display when there is only one tab. Then the
rest of the page area is just blank white.

My homepage is the default
(http://www.google.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official).
If I try to open Firefox by going directly to another site with any sound, I can
hear it, but still get no display.

I am also unable to open any new tabs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox after reboot or after Firefox ha been closed completely
2. Look at display
3. Repeat

Actual Results:
Roughly 3 out of 4 time reproduces the bug.

Expected Results:
Opened normally and finished displaying the browser and any page loaded.

It seems to hang rather than crash.
