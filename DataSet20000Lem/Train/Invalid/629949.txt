Hi,

I noticed that in the latest nightlies the session restore failed to work after minefield restart but it wa with out an obvious pattern, but with the latest build the situation became weird !! it never restore my tab unless i go to Menu > History > Restore Previous Session after minefield run !!! only the pinned tab and one tab with my home page loaded at first!!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close minefield
2.start minefield
3.
Actual Results:
only the pinned tab and only one tab with my home page loaded

Expected Results:
my previous opened tab to be loaded
