Merge any description annotation when replacing bookmark
When we add description/note annotation (bug 318817) there will be a problem if the user ha two separate bookmark with descriptions, and change the URI of one to the URI of the other. Probably what we can just cat the string together (maybe with a newline separator?). It's difficult to say what the user expects in this case, and this way they at least won't lose any data.
