Your Help / Search finally yielded a helpful entry below--BUT that website cannot be found. An error message results.

That is--You said the latest upgrade is 2.0.0.20 for our old Mac 10.3.9 (old box, but that's all we have here). But that cannot be found, and the only link to a download site is broken/can't be found.
---
Impossible to get real help in finding an upgrade to our 2.0.0.7 (Yes, slooow.)

Even more elaboration: This gent (the-edmeister, 27046 posts) said "Download 2.0.0.20 from here.
http://releases.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/2.0.0.20/mac/en-US/
" but that site cannot be found.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. search. search more. search wider and deeper.
2. find blog entry a above--the one that failed/can't be found/broken
3. after 15+ min., give up (oh, yah--after more searching Help and so on, and on)
Actual Results:
Pretty much a above; just cc into the big slow on top the purported website that supposedly ha the desired 2.0.0.20.

Expected Results:
Same.

Gosh but it's goo you guy/gals provide Firefox for us. I wish your Help section wa a excellent. It is, however, slow and trouble. In a gunfight, it would be shot up plenty by the latest local young wannabe punk.
