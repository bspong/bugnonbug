Solution for 99% firefox CRASHES. Simple, but you'll need to work it out.

Hi. First of all, I want to say I'm sorry if my writing isn't that clear (I'm Brazilian). Let's go to the bug report. I use MAC/OS, and firefox for years, but he last 6 month that wa a nightmare. Firefox 3 crash everytime. Everyday I wa looking for an update that could solve my issue. Every update, a new hope, but the problem persists. Last week, I had a simple idea, that wa to delete my actual profile, and create a new one. OH MY GOD, THAT SOLVED THE PROBLEM! I COULD USE FIREFOX AGAIN, and that wa the happiest day in web in my whole life. BUT, that wa a problem. I had to search the web to learn how to manage profiles, and that wa not easy. I had to open terminal, and go along the way to folders, and there I was.
SO I SUGGEST TO YOU - TURN ON THE OPTION TO CREATE A NEW PROFILE AFTER AN UPDATE, OR MAKE SOMETHING THAT AUTOMATICALLY CREATE THIS NEW PROFILE AND TRANSFER THE USER SETTINGS. AFTER CHANGING THE PROFILE, FIREFOX NEVER CRASHED AGAIN. I KNOW THAT IS IT, BECAUSE BEFORE CREATING A NEW PROFILE, I'VE UNINSTALLED ALL MY EXTENSIONS, DELETED ALL BOOKMARKS, TRIED TO CHANGE ALL SETTINGS TO DEFAULT, AND SO ON. ONLY CREATING A NEW PROFILE (NOW WITH THE SAME EXTENSIONS I HAD), SOLVED THIS PROBLEM. TODAY, I'VE REGISTERED HERE, JUST TO SAY YOU THAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. OPEN FIREFOX 3 ON MAC OS.
2. NAVIGATE FOR 1 - 2 MINUTES
3. CRASH.
Actual Results:
CREATED A NEW PROFILE, AND TRANSFER THE OLD SETTINGS TO THE NEW PROFILE.

Expected Results:
SOLVED ALL(LLLLL) THE PROBLEMS. I'M A HAPPY FIREFOX USER AGAIN.

PLEASE, CONSIDER WHAT I'M SAYING, BECAUSE I LOVE FIREFOX, AND UNFORTUNATELY HATED IT FOR ALMOST 6 MONTHS OF CRASHES. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE IT FOR MORE THAN 2 MINUTES. AFTER SOLVING THIS, IT'S EXTREMELY CONFIDENT.
PLEASE, I WANT A REPLY FROM MOZILLA ABOUT MY REPORT.

THANKS.
