Major system failure
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.7.1) Gecko/20040707
Build Identifier: Firefox version 0.9.1 and 0.9.2

When using the latest two build of Firefox the system would spomtaneously
restart. This usually occurred after being on for some minute and when
clicking on a link in Firefox. This did not occur with previous build and I
have not managed to reproduce this with any other application, including IE and
Mozilla browsers. It ha become such a problem that I uninstalled the app.
This is a pity a I think it is great. After the reboot, the only message I get
is that Windows ha recovered from a major problem. I stress that this only
ever occurred when running Firefox and clicking on a link on a web page (any site)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Browse for a short while
3. Click on a link

Actual Results:
Spontaneous reboot

Expected Results:
Obvious!
