When a page is loading normally, the status bar text read "Transferring data
from <siteDomain>...". If that tab is closed (NOT the window), the status bar
text remains a "Transferring data from <siteDomain>...", although the page is
no longer loading.

This is a problem because a user could think that Firefox is still loading
something when it isn't.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. make sure the tab bar is opened so you can close the tab
2. navigate to any page (pages with many image or a large size preferred)
3. while the page is loading, close the tab

Actual Results:
status bar text is "Transferring data from <siteDomain>...", but the page is no
longer loading

Expected Results:
reset the status bar text to some default value (i.e. "Done")
