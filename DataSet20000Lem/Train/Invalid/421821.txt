Incorrect key mapping/binding - several key swap roles.

Sometimes, after Firefox ha been running for a while (a few hours, say), it swap the role of the @ and " keys, and the ~ and | keys, while the \ the ` and the # all move to key that shouldn't produce them.

The keyboard mapping is unaffected in other application that are running at the same time (e.g. text editors).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot Windows Vista Home Premium
2. Run Firefox.
3. Use computer a normal for a few hour (mixture of: web browsing with Firefox and possibly other browsers; document editing with MS Word; listening to music with Windows Media Player; text editing with oXygen, PSPad, Notepad, etc).
4. Try entering data into a form in Firefox.
Actual Results:
Most times, I find that the " and @ key have been swapped (which will certainly catch you out if you're entering your email address!)

Expected Results:
I expect the @ key to put an @ character in the form, not a " character. And vice versa. Also, I expect the backslash key to put a backslash in the form, not a #, and I expect the | key to print a | and not a ~ , etc.

In short, I expect the key to produce the character printed on them!

I'm running Firefox in Windows Vista Home Premium on a Macbook 2.13GHz 2GB RAM via Leopard Boot Camp.
