"I wish I could only remember that URL."

I wish there wa a way that Firefox wa better at helping me with this.
History in IE is by URL.
History in Opera is grouped by domain. Nice!

Wish Firefox would add this a an option in a future release.
Maybe a title or url radio button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open your Firefox browser and hit Ctrl - H.
Actual Results:
Shows a list of Titles of web page I have visited.

Expected Results:
Should show URLs. or give me a choice of URLs or Titles. Just my opinion.
Or is there already a plug-in that solves this?
