I hate Microsoft. I like open source. But if you can't fix Firefox to actually
LAUNCH within le than two minutes, I will delete it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Wait two, three, maybe four minute
3. Wait some more

Actual Results:
Firefox launch

Expected Results:
Lauched in le than two to four minute

Your bug tracking system is great. Probably. I don't know. This isn't a fucking
bug. This is fucking feedback.

Feedback should be handled separately. Maybe you geek don't understand that,
but feedback is a different beast than bug reporting. This may or not be a bug.
But it's DEFINITELY feedback. But you have no FUCKING FEEDBACK system, so I have
to report it a a bug. Some "open source" system you've got. I'd love to make
Firefox my browser of choice. But if it can't open/launch in le than two
minutes, and if it can't actually find a fucking website when my WiFi network is
connected, who the fuck care if it's Microsoft or not?

Oh, by the way, Thunderbird doe the same damn thing. I'll be damned if I'm
going to fill out a separate "bug report" for that. You need a damn FEEDBACK
forum, idiots.
