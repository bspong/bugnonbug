keep child window (?) in modal state when called from other dialogs/instances

Open the firefox > Preferences dialog. From the Downloads tab open the view and
edit action dialog. This dialog / window is independent (?). You can
access/close the preference dialog and even the firefox window. [In my system
at this stage firefox eats up c. 30M of memory. - that's another issue]

So, why can't these window (extensions/themes/Actions on files) given a
dependent state (modal state ?) like the dialogs, in normal applications. As
the case of Download Manager is, it might be right to keep it current behaviour
since, some user would like to close the main window and keep only his downloads
continuing.

[It might not be a bug but may a necessary enhancement.]
