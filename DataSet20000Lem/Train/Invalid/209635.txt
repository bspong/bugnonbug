When I tried to install a new theme (Breeze) and then remove it the result wa
an empty row in the list of theme to use. At the same time I tried to install
a theme (Brushed) which seemed to be ok but never showed up in the list of
themes. The theme wa downloaded from
http://texturizer.net/firebird/themes.html.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
(This is how I happend to do it. I'm not sure that it will explain more.)
1. I installed the theme Breeze which worked fine.
2. I installed the theme Brushed which according to the information I got
worked fine but did not show up in the list.
3. I removed the theme Breeze.
4. There is now a gap in the list of theme to use.

Actual Results:
There is a gap in the list of theme to use. Here is an image that show the
problem: http://neofob.com/temp/themes.jpg

Expected Results:
Removed the theme. Possibly it's the theme (Brushed or Breeze) that is fawlty
and then Mozilla should be better to handle the exeption.
