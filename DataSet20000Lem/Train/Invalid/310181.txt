I wa using Firefox 1.07 on Windows XP-SP2 and wa about to report a couple of
problems(bugs?) regarding tabbed browsing and Adblock. Then I heard about
version 1.5 beta, so I downloaded and installed it, in the hope that the upgrade
might somehow solve the problems, but they are still there. They are:

1 - Even though all tabbed browsing option are correctly configured, the
program continues to open each web page separately, loading and reloading on the
same window in the typical Internet Explorer style unless I specifically
right-click and select new tab every time I wish to change to a new page. I'm
not sure, but I think this behavior became more evident after I installed
StumbleUpon and the Google Toolbar in Firefox 1.07.

2 - There are certain advertisement that Adblock apparently refuse to block.
The transparent Adblock label doesn't even appear on such ad to give you the
option to block them. You can confirm what I say if you open www.clarin.com (the
page in Spanish of an Argentine newspaper) and try to delete the advertisement
that appears on the rightmost column. The ad will remain there no matter how
hard you try to remove it.

Thanks in advance for your help.
