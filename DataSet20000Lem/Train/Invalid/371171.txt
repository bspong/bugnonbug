snap of bad page

See the enclosed pic.

I wa viewing Axel's preso. I got a few slide in a hit the button in the bottom right to go back to the start. It look like a 0 with a backslash through it.

When I hit the button, I go to a page that look like a couple of other page mashed together.

I can hit the URL again and everything go back to normal.
