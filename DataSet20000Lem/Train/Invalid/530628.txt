Check the page in the URL field, do a search for any text, for example "crusade" with crtl+f (NOT google search box in the top right corner but the mozilla find feature). It simply doe not work.

I've resorted to using IE for browsing now that page search is broken. No idea if it's relating to wiki page only or simply everything, but this used to work!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page
2. Search for any text on the page, for example "crusade"
3. Firefox report nothing found and beeps, while it's plain to see the text is mentioned multiple time on the page.
Actual Results:
Find fails to find any text on the page

Expected Results:
You should be able to use the find function to search the text on the page!

happens every time
