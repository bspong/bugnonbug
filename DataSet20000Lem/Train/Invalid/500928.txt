www.edmunds.com, Select SUV, (if prompted, enter any legit zip code). Select for instance all SUV's. From this point forward, any filter selection (left column - price, size, engine, etc) will cause 'your result are loading' and the browser will never return. Previous Firefox works. IE 7 or 8 works.

Further, if you attempt to submit "Report Broken Website Site..." - it fails similar to bug 480517. Error detail "Invalid SysID"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. See detail
2. Select new vehicle (I used SUV), and get to point of filter option (left column) Any selection of filter cause the browser to never return.
3.
Actual Results:
Never return from "Your Results Are Loading" after any filter selection.

Expected Results:
Show vehicle that met selected filter options.

This is a major site. I searched on Edmund Edmunds edmunds.com and didn't find a bug report - I'm surprised. Perhaps an extension that I have?
