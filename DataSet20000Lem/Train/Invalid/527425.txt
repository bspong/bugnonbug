I viewed the above pdf with Firefox 3.5.5. My Preferences setting is "always ask", but the pdf came up in a builtin viewer anyway. If I hover over the icon in the pdf viewer, I get thing like:

"Klicka for at skriva ut den har PDF-filen eller sidor av den"

which is Swedish, I think. I don't speak Swedish, and if Swedish support is installed anywhere on my machine, I'd like to fix that. The PDF is in English. (And parenthetically, why doe Mozilla force all kind of language pack on me, thus making me waste time disabling them? I only have English and French enabled.)

I verified the URL is just a pdf, by downloading it with 'curl' and viewing it with 'xpdf'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Click on link to that URL

Actual Results:
1. Firefox fails to ask my wish and enters builtin PDF viewer
2. Viewer think I'm swedish.

Expected Results:
A query box, "view" v "save file" etc
