This is a strange bug, i guess

just -sometimes-, when firefox is maximized, i can hear a strange sound, it like the ''high frequency'' sound, that disturbing sound


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Only sometimes, and a i've seen, nothing different that i do that would make it happen

it just sometimes




but when i minimize firefox, it doesn't sound anymore, only when i maximize
and it isn't always that it's happenning, only sometimes

This is a strange bug, i guess

just -sometimes-, when firefox is maximized, i can hear a strange sound, it like the ''high frequency''sound, that disturbing sound

just now, before i get this ticket, it happened.

i guess i'd better try to express it in my 1º language - Portugueese

thanks for your attention! :-)
