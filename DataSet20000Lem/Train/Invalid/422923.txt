Make the back/forward dropmarker have up and down arrow
I made a suggestion on da.firefox and beltzner suggested I file it: it wasn't clear to me when the new back/forward button landed that the dropmarker menu went both forward and backward. This wa even more confusing because it's next to the forward button, and I wa thinking "where's the back menu?".

My little suggestion wa that the dropmarker have both up and down arrows, to make it clear that you can navigate in either direction.

Yes, this is not "standard" UI... you'd probably want to make the menu drop "sideways" and have your current history position next to the mouse horizontally, instead of dropping down.
