I am receiving an error message that the Ancestry.com image viewer is not a compatible add on. That message came up unprompted after the new version wa loaded. I have also received it when opening a image they have loaded in their program and they have asked to put in the image viewer.

Reproducible: Always




The software should have allowed the add on so that the image can be viewed in a full page size
