Just an fyi I got a pop up window when my option box is checked to block pop ups


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.staying logged on for long period of time, close firefox and found pop up
underneath


Actual Results:
It happened on two separate computer using version 1.02 (Closing the pop up
just caused it to open it to the site. I used the task manager to close it the
second time.)

Expected Results:
prevent it from poping up in the first place.

I did a screen capture and placed the pop up on a .doc, the url is visible at
the bottom of the popup. I want to send it to you but can't find a way. It is
trivial but if one can make it then others will soon find a way to defeat your
pop up protection. I find it most useful feature, Windows IE make being on the
net a very frustrating experience. I find the exchange of information far more
important than commerce when surfing the web.
