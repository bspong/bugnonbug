I have built web page on my computer using iis5.1 built in window xp; i cannot access these page because mozilla firefox browser is asking to provide a password for the site ( http://localhost ); a i hit enter, the error is -2146893039 (0x80090311).
If using Netscape and IE page are running perfectly.

Yet, if i access using mozilla firefox the same page stored on a server, they are loaded are running.

I mention that for my compouter i did not provide a password to log in yet the serveres are protected by passwords.

So, the error -2146893039 (0x80090311) is related to blank password for my computer? If so, is it a bug?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I have web page stored in the public folder created in xp by ii 5.1
2.trying to use mozilla firefox to ace them I am asked to provide a password
3.hitting enter that cause -2146893039 (0x80090311) error

Actual Results:
In Windows XP, create any page and try to launch it using ii 5.1 service:
http://localhost/whatever.asp
That won't go unless providing a password for the site, required by mozilla firefox browser.
If no password is typed in, this error is generated:-2146893039 (0x80090311)
Note: i do not know if that is related to the fact that no password is provided to log in window on localhost.

Expected Results:
-2146893039 (0x80090311)

the software shoul not ask for a password to acees the localhost web site, because that is already protected by iis5.1 administration
