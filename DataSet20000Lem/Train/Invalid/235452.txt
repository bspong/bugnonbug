firefox 0.8 seems to completely ignore cs font-size when specified in em unit
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When specifying font-size in an external style sheet (haven't tested on placing
right-in the page), firefox seems to totally disregard any class with
font-size's specified in em units. I can use general (x-small) or px definition
and it work fine, but em unit are totally disregarded and it just set my font
size based on what my browser setting is at. IE recognizes the em definition
properly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Specify font-size for a class in em unit in an externally linked style sheet
2. Enter some text in a p tag assigned the appropriate class
3.

Actual Results:
My font-size specification wa totally disregarded. It rendered the font at a
much larger size than specified.

Expected Results:
It should have rendered my font at a much smaller size like IE does.
