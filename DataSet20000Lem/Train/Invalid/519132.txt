I noticed alot of ppl here report the behavior from flash and FF (3.0/3.5). However, I believe this behavior ha little to do with FF and more to do with Flash Player plug-in. I have gotten the same problem when my flash wa updated. Since I download and not run the app. plug-n directly, I had an old version (or should I say Rollback lol). When I uninstalled the flash plug-in and restarted my computer then added/installed the (so called old version/Rollback) flash plug-in, problem solved.
Here's my 2 cents, can u verify if this behavior is attributed to recent flash update bringing new incompatible issue or behavior within the FF browser?
LOVE this browser!! and seamonkey too!! Have a good one, and Keep Up The Good Work.
Suny

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just open a flash embedded video
2. notice behavior
3. click refresh, see if that improves thing (sometimes it does)
Actual Results:
a per description above. This problem need to be verified by those in the know. (Yep, the FF expert @ Mozilla-- hurray!)

Expected Results:
just play flawlessly??

Just FYI, my 2 cents, and hopefully something to keep y'all busy till the coming Holidays lol
