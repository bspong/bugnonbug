The old Firefox 1.0.6 worked perfect. When you click compose or reply it would
move the cursor into the reply box so you could just begin typing. This new
version it doe not.

Also when you click Bookmarks, right click any entry and select Delete the
bookmark menu is not re-selectable right away. When you delete and go to click
Bookmarks again to select another entry (either to go to that bookmark or to
delete another) you click it, and it highlight a if it is going to drop down,
but doe not. Then you click bookmark again, and it unhighlights a if it wa
closed. Third time you click it, it will work fine.
