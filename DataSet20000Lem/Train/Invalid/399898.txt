Within the new Places folder on the bookmark toolbar, there is a "Most Used Tags" container. Under this, your most used tag will appear and you can see the bookmark associated with these tag a the menu are expanded out.

Right now, when the final bookmark are shown, the title are not displayed, only the favicons. The link work but you won't know what you are selecting. See attached screenshot.

This wa seen on Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007101504 Minefield/3.0a9pre but I saw it in yesterday's build, a well.
