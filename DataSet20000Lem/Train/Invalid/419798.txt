Adblock Plus broken on trunk
After updating my trunk tree today, I found that Adblock Plus stopped working. It wasn't blocking ads, the toolbar button disappeared, and I got gob of console error like:

this.boxObject is null" {file: "chrome://adblockplus/content/sidebar.js" line:
711}]' when calling method: [nsIContentPolicy::shouldLoad]"

Backing out the recent checkin for bug 402982 fixed the problem. Not sure if the problem is with that patch, or if Adblock Plus is doing something wrong that just happened to work before. In any case, it's a popular extension so someone need to fix something. :-)
