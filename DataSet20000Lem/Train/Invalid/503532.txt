When the tab-switching widget is active Ctrl-K (Cmd+K on Mac) ha no effect, but it should either have the same effect a Ctrl-F (or Cmd+F) and search open tab or close the widget and search current search engine (such a Yahoo). If it will search tabs, the search box should change from user-selected search engine (eg Yahoo) and to tab-search engine (with right logo and such).
Tab search should maybe list in the drop-down at the searchbox (and either point to some about:tabs?q=search page or pop up the widget).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open 3+ tab
2.press Ctrl/Cmd-tab and release tab (but not Ctrl/Cmd)
3.press K (Ctrl/Cmd and K should now be held down and no others)
Actual Results:
[Nothing happens]

Expected Results:
A:the "search tabs" box should be activated [note:Ctrl-F already doe this]
or
B:the widget should close and the search box (by default on the right side of the awesomebar/URLbar) should get the focus
