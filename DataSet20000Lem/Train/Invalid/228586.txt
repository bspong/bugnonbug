The current tree view in the "Add Bookmark" dialog is limited to 6 lines. This
is a pretty small amount of space, for something a complex a a tree view. To
truly use the tree view effectively, we need to show more lines.

How many lines? I do not know. Internet Explorer show 10. However, what
factor we should use to determine how many line to show a default, I am not sure.

Reproducible: Always
