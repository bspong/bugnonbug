Add support for the M3U file format using the QuickTime plugin

I have manually added the following line to my 'pluginreg.dat' file to get Firefox to use the QuickTime plugin to play M3U files, it seems like it should just be part of the distribution:

60:audio/x-mpegurl:MP3 Playlist:m3u:$

If this ha already happened and during one of my upgrade this file wa not updated I apologize; in that case perhaps the fact that it didn't should be entered a a bug :)

I will attach the relevent section of 'pluginreg.dat' that is currently on my machine.
