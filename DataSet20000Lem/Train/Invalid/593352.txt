hi,

i testet firefox 4 and respected that gopher doesn't work any more. I find the idea to remove gopher very very bad!! Gopher is history! And Gopher is brilliant. Becouse you can have just informationes. gopher ha many advantage to http! And the implementation of gopher protocol in firefox is (from file size) very small. because that it don't give troubles.

i think many people will agree me!
