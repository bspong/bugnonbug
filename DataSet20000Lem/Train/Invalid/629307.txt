This preference wa set to false by default in the behavior change introduced by bug 592822. As I am not comfortable with my session always being saved without warning, I have tried changing the preference back, but the pref change ha had no effect. On my laptop running Windows Vista x64, using the same nightly, the pref work a expected - could this be a problem with my profile?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.warnOnQuit to true in about:config
2. Start a session with multiple tab
3. Close the browser
Actual Results:
Get the warnOnQuit dialog box asking you what to do.

Expected Results:
Browser close and automatically save my session.

Bug 550559 sound somewhat related, but that doesn't explain why the pref work a expected on my laptop. I'd rather not trash this profile if at all possible.
