X server crash during Java plugin rendering when content is scrolled (/clipped?).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=2097
2. Resize the browser window (make window shorter)
3. Scroll the plugin display (big black square with rendering) out of the top of the window
Actual Results:
X server crashes, the user is dropped to text virtual terminal and GDM restarts the X server (user graphical session is aborted and the user must relogin to do anything)

Expected Results:
Window should scroll normally and plugin should continue to render the result. X server should not crash.

This may be a java bug, X server bug, X server display adapter driver bug or a Firefox bug. The same page work fine with Google Chrome with the same plugin.

Environment:
Ubuntu 9.10 amd64 (running on Intel Core 2 Duo)
intel X4500 display adapter (Q43/Q45 integrated, pci device [8086:2e12])
$ apt-cache policy sun-java6-jre xserver-xorg-video-intel xserver-xorg | egrep '(^[^ ]|Installed)'
sun-java6-jre:
Installed: 6-15-1
xserver-xorg-video-intel:
Installed: 2:2.9.0-1ubuntu2.1
xserver-xorg:
Installed: 1:7.4+3ubuntu10

The only hint of crash in the X server log is
ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log
(the space at the start of the line is in the log, looking around with Google suggests that the actual log should be following:

Saw signal 11. Server aborting.
ddxSigGiveUp: Closing log
ddxSigGiveUp: re-raising 11

I don't know why my log ha only that line.)

Setting Severity: Critical because this loses all unsaved data in any open application in user's X server session. I'm also able to reproduce with Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.8) Gecko/20100214 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.8
