Just reporting that Minefield is correctly recognizing the new Adobe Flash version 10.2.152.26. I am not noticing any issue with the Alpha Blend code that I believe ROC implemented (this involved black rectangle being drawn with no visible text). The new Flash version is being correctly reported in "about:plugins" and on the official test site (http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/). Version 10.2 Flash doe not resolve the Flash plugin bouncing problem being experienced in bug 626245, meaning there is an issue with the Minefield code. I don't have a lot of experience with the code, but am thinking maybe Minefield is setting the Flash container area too big / too small, so when you scroll the page and it is redrawing the content, it is not drawing in the correct location (hence the overlapping being seen).

Reproducible: Always
