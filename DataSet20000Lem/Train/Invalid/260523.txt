Because this UI is missing, you cannot subscribe to (new) page change on a site
automatically. This is obviously only a UI bug. Pages subscribed with earlier
version are still saved correctly in the bookmark file.

This functionality wa working correctly until very recently (v.0.9.1+).
It seems to be new with 1.0 PR. I couldn't find an existing bug discribing this
issue.
It seems to be a cross-platform bug. It occures on Mac OS X and Windows 2000
(both tested), possibly on other platform (untested)?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Bookmarks Manager and select a specific bookmark
2. select the Properties... menu (or right-click)


Actual Results:
the Properties window only display the first left tab (Info), the others are
missing

Expected Results:
it should display 3 tabs: Info, Schedule and Notification
