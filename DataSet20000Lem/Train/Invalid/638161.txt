Hello,

I had to use beta 4 because 3.6.16 will not open a window nor allow searching. I don't want to use beta 4 because it doesn't allow me to use my Norton toolbar items.

Further, I had 3.5.12 and it crashed... I tried opening it up again and I got an error message about a js.(file) not being found. So, I reinstalled .12 and I still got the same thing. I then went to .16 to upgrade and like I said, it wouldn't let me pop a new window or allow me to do a search in the default search box.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
