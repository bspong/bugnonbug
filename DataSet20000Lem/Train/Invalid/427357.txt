I've got a few problem with Windows Live services:

1) Firefox can't load any information when browsing Live ID account and crash after another click on any link on that page. (http://accounts.live.com)
2) Firefox crash when browsing Windows Live Spaces. Both problem may be connected with being logged in Live ID account.
3) Firefox can't load the content on Live.com personalized page. It doesn't crash at least this time.

Reproducible: Always
