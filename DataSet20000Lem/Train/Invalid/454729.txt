Inconsistent Image Handling: image sometimes display & other time download

When using Google Image Search (or any other site with clickable thumbnails) and clicking on the thumbnail to see the full-size image, Firefox will sometimes display it in-browser like it's suppose to. But other time a window will popup asking if I want to "Open with..." or "Save File" (the same dialog box you get when you download an archive, like .zip).

I have several theories:
1)Images with file name containing space instead of "%20" or "_". (unsure)
2)Images with file name containing "+". (unsure)
3)Images hosted on bp0.blogger.com, bp1.blogger.com, b2.blogger.com, b3.blogger.com... etc. (always reproducible)

I'm having trouble proving (or disproving) #1 & #2 above because it's hard to find file online which meet above criteria.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.To reproduce theory #3: go to images.google.com
2.Enter "bp0.blogger.com" in search field
3.Click on any thumbnail
4.Check to see in the top frame (under "See full-size image") if it really is hosted at bp0.blogger.com. If not, go back and keep clicking thumbnail until you find a file that is.
5.Click "See full-size image"
Actual Results:
Dialog box pop up asking if I want to "Open with" or "Save File".

Expected Results:
Image open in Firefox browser.
