ff 4 b10 doe not display any web page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: firefox 4 beta 10 upgrade (from b9) on 2.2.2010 08:30 CET

After the automatic update from B9 to B10, ff 4 b10 started, but could not find/display any web pages. It seemed to load, but did not display anything - not even the "beta 10 installed" page, or the home page, or google.com.

B9 used to work flawless.

I proceeded and downloaded the B10 package from the FF site (via 3.6.13, which is installed in a different directory on the same Win7 system), and installed that one over the installation. No change in behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start ff 4 b10
2. enter url
3. wait and see.
Actual Results:
see detail - no reaction.

Expected Results:
see details.

display the web page loaded from the url entered.
