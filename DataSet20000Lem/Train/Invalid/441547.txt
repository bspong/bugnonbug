Hello Development-Team!

I've found a Bug in Mozilla-Firefox. This Bug happens sometimes when I saved Bookmarks. Some FavIcons are very Big, some have the normal size. The Big one is 100x100 Pixels big. That's not normal and it look very ugly ;)

Thanks,
Alex

1. Save a Bookmark in Bookmark-List (Try to use www.serienjunkies.org). It's important to save the Bookmark in a Directory to see the bug.
