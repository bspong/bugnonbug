I had not used the browser yet this morning, in fact the first thing a do is check the snort log. I get this alert often and I think it is coming from Firefox 3.1b1 which wa open on my kde desktop. The browser wa idle.

Using the search tool in the browser pointed at google doe not trigger this. I do not have a google menu bar from google installed on the browser.

Since snort doe not tie to a particular process I cannot be 100% certain that this alert if coming from Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install snort with default rule set to monitor home_net
2.start firefox and leave idle
3.check /var/log/snort/alert for mod jrun overflow
Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
No alert for mod jrun overflow attempt should be found
