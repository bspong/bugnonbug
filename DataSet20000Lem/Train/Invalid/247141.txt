Firefox requires patch on very recent OS
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040615 Firefox/0.9

I'm running Firefox 0.9 on Solaris 9, Update 5, which is a very recent update
release of the OS. When I launch Firefox, it display a dialog box with the
following message:

The following patch need to be updated to higher revisions:
patch 112785-34 (or higher), currently installed patch 112785-33
("X11 6.6.1:Xsun patch)

This seems like a bug since it's such a recent release and the filename in the
contrib directory is firefox-0.9-sparc-sun-solaris2.8.tar.gz. I assume that any
patch required for Solaris 8 would have been roled into Solaris 9 by now.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Solaris 9, U5
2. install Firefox 0.9
3. launch Firefox

Actual Results:
Displays the following message:

The following patch need to be updated to higher revisions:
patch 112785-34 (or higher), currently installed patch 112785-33
("X11 6.6.1:Xsun patch)

Expected Results:
launch without an error message
