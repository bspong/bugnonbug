If I paste text past the limit in a multi-line editbox, unexpected behavior ensues

The website is the situation I encountered the problem in. The edit box for
"Card Message" is limited to 250 character (see URL) - if you paste text into
that edit box through firefox on windows, and that text is larger than 250
characters, you will see the whole message paste successfully. Then if you hit
any key on the keyboard (try an arrow key), you'll see it truncate the text
appropriately. It should have done this immediately when the text wa first pasted!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to website above (or presumably any website with a character limit on a
multi-line edit box)
2. Paste text that's too long into the box
3.

Actual Results:
Watch it then truncate the text only after you hit a key on the keyboard (while
keyboard focus is on the edit box).

Expected Results:
The software should have immediately truncated the text when it wa pasted - at
no time should a text box display text larger than what it is allowed.
