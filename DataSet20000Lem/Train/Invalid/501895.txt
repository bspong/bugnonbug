The "Getting Started" button in the default toolbar doe not have an icon.

Like I have said in the title, it doe not work. The first time I noticed and clicked on "Getting Started", the icon popped up. After trying it on a clean computer again, it doe not show the icon even by clicking on it. In total, there ha been one time where the icon did not work in the beginning but showed up after clicking on it and the other two time where it would not show up even by clicking it.

Operating System Used:
-Windows 7 Build 7260- 1 time work when clicked, 1 time doe not work even when clicked
-Windows 7 Build 7264- 1 time doe not work even when clicked

Reproducible: Sometimes
