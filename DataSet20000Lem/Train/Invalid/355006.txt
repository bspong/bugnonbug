Opening tool option menu nonfunctional in Firefox 1.5.0.7. Do not get a menu when choosing "Options" on Tools menu. Some non-functional writing (General, Privacy, Content, Tabs, Downloads, Advanced) appears above tab for the old option on the menu and three button appear on the browser window in the lower right corner ("OK," "Cancel" and "help"). Foxfire then freezes. Choosing "Cancel" allows escape from freeze, but cannot change any "Options" because this occurs every time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Choose Tools
2.Choose Options
3.

Actual Results:
Firefox freezes. Choose cancel to escape problem, but cannot change any options.

Expected Results:
The option menu should have opened, I think. Cannot change any setting in firefox such as: Download folder, deleting cache, removing history, etc...

No error message is given.
