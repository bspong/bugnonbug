Firefox cause Windows XP to have a stop error and restart
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5
Build Identifier: Firefox/2.0.0.6

After I installed Firefox 2.0.0.6 Windows XP would start up and then restart after it experienced a serious error. The window error report said that the stop error had something to do with a driver conflict.

I know it wa Firefox 2.0.0.6 causing the error because after I installed 2.0.0.5 again - no more serious error and restarting.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Firefox 2.0.0.6 installed
2. Wait a few minute
3. Windows restarts and then say it ha experienced a serious error
Actual Results:
It happens every time on my computer. I have had it happen 5 time to me. I don't know how to reproduce it. All I know is that for some reason my Gateway with Windows XP doesn't seem to like the newest Firefox version.

Expected Results:
Software should have not made my computer have a stop error and restart.
