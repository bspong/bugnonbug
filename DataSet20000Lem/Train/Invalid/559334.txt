On the Financial Times website some columnists, including Martin Wolf, have comment underneath their word of wisdom. On my Mac these comment are visible in Chrome 5.0.342.9, Opera 10.10, and Safari 4.0.5 (6531.22.7). But not in Firefox 3.6.3: the comment just don’t appear.

I apologise for the high-level nature of this bug description.
