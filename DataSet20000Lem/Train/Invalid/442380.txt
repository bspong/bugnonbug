When opening a pdf in this particular website, I get the dialog box that asks what application should be used (Acrobat Professional) and if I want Firefox to always handle these type of file in this manner. I check the box (in fact it is checked when the dialog window opens), but everytime I open a pdf in this site the dialog box reappears. Firefox is not saving my preferences.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Choose to open a report a a pdf on website
2.Firefox preference box appears with check box checked
3.I hit okay and the PDF open
Actual Results:
I get to the PDF, but each time the dialog box appears even though Firefox asks me if I want to always open these file (pdfs) in this manner. Yes! I do.

Expected Results:
I should be able to open these pdfs without the dialog box appearing since I've checked the box that asks if I always want Firefox to open the file in this manner.

This is a password protected site, so you won't be able to access it. Obviously, this may be an issue with the site and not with Firefox, but it is a Firefox dialog box that appears.
