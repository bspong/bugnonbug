installed firefox directory under /usr/local. When I run /usr/bin/mozilla, it open firefox instead.
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Linux Firefox/0.8

Downloaded 0.8 for linux (rh 9). Unarchived to /usr/local. I have Mozilla
1.2.1 under /usr/bin, and want to be able to keep on using it - at least for
email. When I run firefox, it open fine. When I run /usr/bin/mozilla, it
open firefox! Even if I delete the firefox directory, it still open a window
with "firefox" in the titlebar. And I can't run /usr/bin/mozilla -mail
successfully either. If I reboot, after deleting firefox, I can run mozilla
again. How can I get linux (kde) to run both browsers? The kde desktop browser
link also run firefox instead of mozilla even though it is pointing at
/usr/bin/mozilla.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.run /usr/bin/mozilla with firefox installed on the system
2.
3.

Actual Results:
firefox open instead of mozilla browser or mozilla messenger.

Expected Results:
mozilla browser or messenger should have opened instead of firefox.
