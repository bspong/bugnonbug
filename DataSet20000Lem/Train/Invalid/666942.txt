I feel it is a bug to change the version number of Firefox to version 5, there is no major difference and although I know what you are trying to do, I feel that changing the version number will not make me any more or any le likely to want to use the browser.

Therefore, Firefox 5 ha a bug in it's version number, a it should still actually be Firefox 4.x.x

Reproducible: Always
