A "Redirect Notice" appears when clicking nearly any Google search result

After visiting google.com and searching for a term, clicking on nearly any search result take you to a page with the following text:
================
*Redirect Notice*

The previous page is sending you to _http://digg.com/_.

If you do not want to visit that page, you can _return to the previous page_.
================

I suppose this is intended to fight Phishing redirection attacks, but a of Firefox 3 Beta 5, the Redirect Notice is shown for all search results, including clearly non-phishing result such a digg.com and yahoo.com.

This doe not occur in:
Firefox 2.0.0.13
Firefox 3 Beta 4
Internet Explorer 7

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://google.com
2. enter the search term: yahoo
3. click the first result (should be Yahoo! aka www.yahoo.com)
Actual Results:
You arrive at a Redirect Notice page instead of www.yahoo.com. You may click through to yahoo.com or click to go to the previous page (the search result page).

The URL of the redirect notice page is: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2F

Expected Results:
It should have taken me to http://www.yahoo.com, since http://yahoo.com is clearly not a phishing site.

I suspect that google's javascript for Firefox 3 Beta 5 is triggering google's own phishing protection, possibly due to google's javascript url rewriting (which is described in Bug 229050).

This also occurs with other non-phishing results, such a clicking the first result for "digg" or "microsoft corporation" google searches.
