Sometimes, I try to press the back button, and a small square appears at the bottom right. After that, clicking on it doesn't do anything. (Sometimes the main back button still work but the arrow doesn't, sometimes neither.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate through at least 6 or so pages.
2. Press the arrow next to the back button.
Actual Results:
The back button stopped working.

Expected Results:
The back button should show the page you've navigated through/go back.
