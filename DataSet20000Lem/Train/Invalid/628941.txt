No more "Do you want Firefox to save your tab for the next time it starts?" warning after beta 10 update.

I just update from firefox 4 beta 9 to beta 10. Firefox restored my tab and group after update, but when I close it and restart it, tab or group were gone!

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:
Firefox should ask me if I "want Firefox to save your tab for the next time it starts?"

It appears that browser.warnOnQuit and browser.warnOnRestart have been set to false somehow during update. Setting them back to true restore the expected behavior.
