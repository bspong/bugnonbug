Not only ha it gotten worse since Firefox 2, it frigin sucks!, Sure displaying CSS is still better, but it doesn't help if it stalls, lag up and just becomes plain bothersome.
Issues found:
It look a bit better, but always did
Uses more resources, it not suppose to be worse in term of memory usage if it an upgrade.
Stalls up if a website is taking too long to respond, meaning if you try to do something else while retrying a connection to a site you know works, it'll crash the browser.
Browsing hotmail got worse because you force it into the light version.
That stupid thing you added for the address bar is useless, you type in h
and get the http:// of everything! wtf!?
h use to bring up hotmail immediately from the drop down of the history of urls.
Media: try viewing a flash or something that us javascript mainly in the page and watch this bugger stall up.
Try viewing avi file or something like that, they automatically play in Firefox 2, with little lag, odd crashes, now it 8/10 try of viewing direct medium it just stalls!
Over all, I think you guy rushed this version of your browser for your stupid world record, nobody will care next month if you hit a world record or not, I know I'm being mean, but come on.
I loved Firefox 1 and 2, and still do 3, because it still beat IE no matter how you look at it, but you can't rush perfection, I hope the patch for 3 fix a lot of this stuff, if not, consider making everyone downgrade a another world record(Most consecutive downgrade in 24 hours) a your next goal, because I'm severely disappointed by this release.
