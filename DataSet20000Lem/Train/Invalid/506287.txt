I wa working on a website for a friend who owns a Chinese restaurant. I started noticing that some of the page were acting a though the "link"ed cs file wasn't being read in. I tracked it down to the HTML file having been saved out a unicode, but the cs wasn't.

I had to insert some chinese character into the CSS to force Visual Studio to prompt me to save the file out a Unicode, then remove the chinese.

Here is an example where the HTML is unicode, but the cs isn't:

Here is and example where both the HTML and CSS are unicode:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an HTML file which us a Link'ed CSS file.
2. Save the HTML file out a unicode but the cs a non-unicode
3. View the web page and notice that the CSS didn't come in.
Actual Results:
The web page doesn't utilize any of the style defined in the CSS

Expected Results:
I expected the web page to use the style in the CSS

It might be a "little" more complex then that. I copied the file locally to my machine:
1. The HTML which wa marked a Unicode
2. A CSS file not marked a Unicode
3. A CSS file which wa marked a Unicode (identical to #2)

If the HTML referenced #2 it looked bad, if it referenced #3 it looked fine.
However if I opened up the non-unicode CSS file in Notepad, and then did a "Save As" to make it a Unicode file... it STILL didn't work. So I'm not sure how the local Win7 file system is marking a unicode file differently then Visual Studio is to an FTP'd location.
