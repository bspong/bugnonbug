The Loading bar in the status bar at the bottom of the page on the right won't disappear I noticed when you right-click on the application from the task-bar,

It's not a bug so much a what I would personally classify a a small coding conflict, but it's good to note,

Also the same problem exists within Thunderbird and I'd suspect other Mozilla Products

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Firefox Window
2. Type an address in the location bar and hit return,
3. Before the page finish loading, right click on "Your Website - Mozilla Firefox" in the taskbar
Actual Results:
watch a the loading bar is never destroyed

Expected Results:
The loading bar would be destroyed (small code error that could contribute to future bug due to messy code or something similar)

It's not a much a bug a it is something that I'd reccomend looking it
