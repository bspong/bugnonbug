When I copy a link from a forum that is wrapped around to more than one line,
open a new tab and then paste the link, it is opened correctly because the
newline character are stripped due to the editor.singleLine.pasteNewlines
config option. When I drag the very same link to the tabbar to open a new tab,
the browser behaves a if the config option is not active.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. enter about:config and set editor.singleLine.pasteNewlines to 0
2. Select a link that is wrapped around in a forum and contains newlines.
3. Press Ctrl+C, Ctrl+T, Ctrl+V to open this link in a new tab
4. The page is loaded correctly although it ha newlines

5. select the very same link again
6. drag the link to the tabbar to open this link in a new tab
7. the newlines are not stripped and the web server sends error 404

Actual Results:
the newlines contained in the url are not stripped

Expected Results:
newlines are stripped due to config option
