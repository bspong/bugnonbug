After 3 attempts, Windows XP X-64 crash while installing 2.0.0.1 update for Firefox. If I click HELP>CHECK FOR UPDATES... and then click DOWNLOAD & INSTALL NOW, the progress bar will reach about half the way and freeze. A few second later, the operating system will be come unusable and CTRL ALT DEL doe not function to terminate the task. The operating system entirely freezes. I'm obviously not updating to 2.0.0.1 after 3 attempt until this get resolved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. HELP>CHECK FOR UPDATES
2. Click DOWNLOAD & INSTALL NOW
3. Wait ...
Actual Results:
WINDOWS FREEZES.

Expected Results:
Installed the update and restarted Firefox. Instead, after a hard reset, I get a non-functional Firefox, needing to reinstall from scratch.
