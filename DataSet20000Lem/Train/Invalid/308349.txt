FF 1.5b1 show up a version 1.4 in WinXP "Add/Remove Programs"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4

Installed FF Beta 1 on a new XP machine. While going to uninstall Opera,
noticed that the entry for Firefox reads:



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox Beta 1
2. Go to Control Panel -> Add/Remove Programs

Actual Results:
3. Observed "Mozilla Firefox (1.4)"

Expected Results:
Should see "Mozilla Firefox (1.5)"

It can't be expected that an end user will remember in a few month that there
wa no official 1.4 release. If someone had installed 1.5 on a machine, they
may accidently remove it sometime later, not realizing that it is their current
browser.
