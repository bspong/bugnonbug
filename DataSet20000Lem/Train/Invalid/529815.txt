Hello,

I've been using Firefox 3.6 Beta for a few weeks. Yesterday I upgraded to the latest one, Beta 3, and I noticed that none of the new Windows 7 integration feature are working any more.

This mean that if I open multiple tab (which I do all the time), hovering on the icon of Firefox in the taskbar doesn't show all the tabs, just the one that I used last time.

This may not be a major concern, but it worked very well in Beta 1 and Beta 2, and to be honest, this great feature wa one of the reason (the other being Personas) I switched to using the new version of Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox on Windows 7.
2. Open multiple tabs.
3. Bring the mouse pointer to the Firefox icon on the taskbar.
Actual Results:
Aero tab preview don't appear.

Expected Results:
Aero tab preview should appear.
