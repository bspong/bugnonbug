Using Mac o 10.3.8, and a Lynksys web camera type WVC54g v.1.1. I can access the camera's web
page on the local network but cannot see the camera output. The camera's internal webpage (it is a
stand alone device) tell me that I can only see the video stream using internet explorer, or if I am use
netscape I must use Lnksys's own viewer software, which is of course window only. Mac version of IE
also doe not display image so this may not be a bug but a 'feature' of MIcrosoft's crippled Mac
products. The video is said to be mpeg 4 but clearly they do something strange to it a mpeg 4 should
open fine. Sorry if this is not a bug but a feature....
