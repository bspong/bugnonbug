Firefox doesn't display warning while opening malicious page in a new tab.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier:

I recently received an email from ebay asking me to update my contact details.
I think the mail wa sent from a malious location. So, when i clicked on the
link, firefox warned me that i wa trying to open a website which can be
malicious and when i clicked OK, it opened the website in a new window.
But, when i right-clicked on the same link and opened the page in a new
tab it gave no warning. I think, it should have displayed the warning
while opening the link in a new tab.
