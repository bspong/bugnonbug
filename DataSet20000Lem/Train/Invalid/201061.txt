Phoenix suddenly started responding VERY sluggishly, even though CPU usage wa
very low. So I closed it, using the top-right window icon a usual, and it died.
But when I tried starting it up, it claimed the default profile wa already in use.
It seems that the lock are still being held on the profile.
