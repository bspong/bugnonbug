I have used Mozilla for many year without any problem until a couple of week ago. I have a keyboard that ha been functioning properly, but I recently noticed that I can't use my 'page down' and my 'arrow down' key to scroll up/down a I used to use them when reading a page/article on the INTERNET.

Before these 2 problem arose, when I used to use the 'down arrow' key, the page would scroll down one line each time I hit the key. The same for the 'page down' key, except the screen would move down one page at a time.

Now the 'page down' key sends the screen to the end of the article OR NOT move the page at all.

Now, 'down arrow' key cause the entire screen to scroll instantly to the bottom of the page.

NOTE: These 2 key function properly when I use Internet Explorer! Which I don't want to use. Thank you for your attention. Gary
