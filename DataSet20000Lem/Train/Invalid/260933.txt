I really like the tabbed view style. However, I don't like to close some of the
tabbed view one by one. I suggest the following enhancement: user can select a
group of consequtive tab and close all of them together.
My proposed operation would be:
1. User opened serveral tabbed browser window.
2. As tabbed browser window for one topic would be gathered, user can select a
group of tabbed browser window by left-clicking the first desired tabbed
browser window (to mark the start position) and moving the mouse rightwards
while still keeping down the left mouse button to select other tabbed browser
windows.
3. After the selection, user can then right-click to get the pop-up menu and
select "close Tab" to close all the above selected browser windows.

By allowing user to close a group of tabbed browser windows, it will greatly
speed up the UI operation and bring more convenience.
