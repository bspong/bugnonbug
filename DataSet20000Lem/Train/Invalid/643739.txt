Many Firefox Features not working
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I installed Firefox 4, and with multiple options, I can use them once or not at all and they become greyed out. This includes the forward and back buttons, the edit toolbar button, and even, when it's enabled, the whole menu bar. Restarting Firefox reset these options.
Also, I don't have any favicons in my tab other than the default folded over page.
When I first log in to Firefox 4 I cannot see any of my bookmarks, and it take disabling the bookmark bar and re-inabling it to see them. Upon launch, tab do not appear at the top of the window, and it take disabling the feature and re-enabling it to cause them to appear in their proper location.

In short, the upgrade is, for me, really buggy. Did I do something wrong?

3.
Actual Results:
As described. Many feature are greyed out, including forward and back buttons, and even the entire menu bar, when I can even enable it.

Expected Results:
A working version of my browser. :)
