When I decided to go back to the 3.0.11 version after trying the 3.5r3 beta I noticed on http://www.google.com when typing Google use to show search suggestions. However now even with the suggestion setting turned on on the Google preference page it will not show suggestions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have 3.0.11 installed
2.Install 3.5r3 beta
3.Reinstall 3.0.11 to remove beta
Actual Results:
Couldn't see Google's search suggestion

Expected Results:
Google should have shown a drop down list automatically once you start typing a search
