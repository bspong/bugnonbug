Normally, to go back to the previous page, you can hit command-left. This normally work fine. But if I do a search for a word on a web page, and that word is highlighted, I then can not use command-left unless I click on the page again (causing the word to lose the highlight).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304901
2. Hit command-F to bring up the search bar
3. Type "surround" (you should see the word surround highlight in the box on optical digital audio.)
4. Now try typing command-left to go back to the previous page. Nothing happens.
5. Click on the page, causing the word to no longer be highlighted.
6. Now try typing command-left to go back to the previous page again. You go back to the previous page
Actual Results:
You don't go back to the previous page

Expected Results:
You should go back to the previous page

I've also tried the same browser version on XP SP2. The problem doe not occur on that machine.
