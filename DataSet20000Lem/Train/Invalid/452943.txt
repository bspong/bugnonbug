RE: HAUTE SECURE AND HAUTE SECURE POST UNINSTALL SURVEY
0: HAUTE SECURE IS VERY ILL BEHAVED AND IS A LIKELY CANDIDATE FOR THE LABEL "MALWARE" THE VERY SORT OF THING IT PURPORTS TO ARREST
1: hAUTE SECURE IS too restrictive OF ME and NOT OF ITSELF.
2: HAUTE SECURE IS A VERY ILL BEHAVED PROGRAM iT WILL NOT PERMIT UNINSTALATION IN A NORMAL FASHION AND GO AWAY QUIETLY WHEN I CANNOT GET IT TO BEHAVE OTHERWISE!!!
3: HAUTE SECURE IS PRESUMPTIOUS AND THEREFORE POSES SECURITY RISKS NOT ASSOCIATED WITY WELL BEHAVED PROGRAMS WRITTEN BY THE SORT OF CAUTIOUS CONSIDERATE PROGRAMMERS THAT I TRUST TO MANAGE MY TRANSITION THROUGH THE INTERNET: PETER NORTON, MOZILLA AND THE LIKE. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS ILL BEHAVIOR IS THAT HOUTE SECURE STARTED iexplorer(IE) without my permission TO MAKE THIS COMMUNICATION POSSOBLE WHILE I WAS TRYING TO INSTALL A PROGRAM!!! I know this becauseIWOULD NOT START THE INTERNET UP WHILE TRYING TO INSTALL A PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH!
ALSO I DO NOT USE IE BECAUSE IE IS PRESUMPTIOUS AND ATTEMPTS TO DO THINGS WITHOUT BEING ASKED TO DO THEM!!!!!
ALSO IF HAUTE SECURE WISHES TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME THEY CAN SEND ME AN EMAIL if AND ONLY IF I HAVE CHECKED THE APPROPRIATE BOXES ABOUT THE LEVEL OF COMMUNICATION I AM COMFORTABLE WITH DURRING INSTALLATION PROCESS!
4:Sifi.com rewind would not run. CBS.com would not work. AND OTHER VIDEO SITES THAT USE ADOBE FLASH PLAYER DO NOT WORK!!!!
It need to possible to accept the risk with a major source of MEDIA with MOUSE CLICKS!!! NORTON DOES NOT RESORT TO COPYING NUMBERS!!! NOR SHOULD YOU!!!
5: I AM WARY OF A PROGRAMMER THAT PUTS DELAYS IN ITS PROGRAMS AND RE-POPS IT UP DAYS AFTER UNINSTALLATION! WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER ILL BEHAVED THINGS IT MAY CONTINUE TO DO AFTER UNINSTALLATION!!!
that is my experience with HAUTE SECURE. It leaf me feeling insecure about the intention of the otherwise very capable programmers!

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:


I am very confident that it is intentional behavior and thus will reproduce!
1.Install HAUTE SECURE
2.UNINSTALL HAUTE SECURE
3.WAIT FOR A FEW WEEKS OR LESS
ON A FUTURE REBOOT IT WILL COME UP STARTING IE (THANKFULLY NOT FIREFOX!!!)

Actual Results:
Difficult to remove!
come up with a survey on a timer of some sort in IE!! after "removal"
I do not have the technical expertise to determine if it doe anything truly evil but it behaves badly like I would expect of malware and I told them so a shown in the detail box!

Expected Results:
Uninstalls and leaf no trace of itself in my computer.
perhaps encourages me to visit thier website to report my trouble a part of the uninstall process.
NOTHING AFTER UNINSTALL IS COMPLETE!

I am only warning about this because opera is/may be incorporateing haute secure into their program and there are significant issue that would make me take a second look.
I would like to believe that Haute Secure could be one of the good guys!
but they have enough in common with the bad guy that i would read the code line by line and edit it to make it well behaved before i would let them in to the Mozilla family of anything!
