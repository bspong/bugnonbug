Full screen mode doesn't cover taskbar in Windows

When I enter full-screen mode in Firefox (by pushing F11 for example), the Windows taskbar cover the bottom portion of the window. It would be nice if full-screen mode acted more like a PowerPoint presentation and didn't have the bottom part of the screen cut-off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Have taskbar set to "Display on top of windows" and not set to "autohide"
3. Enter full-screen mode in Firefox
Actual Results:
Taskbar cover bottom portion of full-screen'ed Firefox window

Expected Results:
I would expect full-screen to cover the taskbar a PowerPoint and OpenOffice Impress presentation do.
