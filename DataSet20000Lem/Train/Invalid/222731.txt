wow... I wa really stranged to find that... perhaps because of a bug? or wa it
intentional?, Mozilla Firebird reactes to the add.NetscapePanel function with an
"Add Bookmark" dialog, instead of adding a Sidebar Panel (WebPanel it's called
in FBird, i guess...). I have heard and noted that Sidebar Panels aren't fully
implemented (the sidebar look like a horrible imitation of M$IE's personal
bars), but what I've never thought before wa that it wa going to react in a so
incoherent way. It doesn't look a a Linux-specific issue, but I marked it a
LInux-only just cause I haven't tested it in M$ Windoze. If the idea is to
implement a way of auto-adding bookmarks, I will be necessary to implement the
M$IE's addBookmark function, a it's sadly a standard... Perhaps not recognized
by the W3C, but every website us it.

3.Wow! Too much IEish, don't you think?
