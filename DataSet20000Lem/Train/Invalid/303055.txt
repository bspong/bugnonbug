By performing (at least) one specific set of tab maneuver Firefox (Deer Park)
can be thrown into tab confusion a described in the step to reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Open Firefox and navigate to any website.
2) Open a new, blank tab. Optionally, navigate to a site within the new tab.
3) Reverse the order of the tab by dragging/dropping. It doe not matter which
tab is dragged.
Actual Results:
Both tab now display the content of the active tab (that is, the tab that wa
active at the time of dragging). Reloading or renavigating within the
then-inactive tab ha no effect (i.e. cannot load a different page), and the tab
sometimes cannot be closed without restarting the browser (though this final
behavior seems rather rare).

Expected Results:
Moving tab should only affect the order and not affect the content of the tabs.

Using default theme, occurs with and without TabBrowserPreferences extension
installed.

I have also verified the bug with three tab (in this case, dragging the first
tab to the middle).
