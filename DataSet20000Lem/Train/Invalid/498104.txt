Firefox is fully blocked a soon a launched, just afetr upgrade to 3.0.11 ( spinning color wheel)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060214 Firefox/3.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060214 Firefox/3.0.11

Just after upgrading, Firefox is blocked and is blocking my computer. This happened to me at the previous upgrade a well.

The solution is to remove all Firefox file from "application support"; then firefox work fine ( but problem: lost all bookmark and password etc..)

Reproducible: Always
