When I click on a link with the middle mouse button, some tab open with the same page. And when I close a tab with a middle mouse button, some tab are closed with the tab I clicked on.

Reproducible: Always

1. Click on a link with the middle mouse button
2. Some tab appear (if any : do the first step again)
3. Try to close a tab with the middle mouse button
Actual Results:
There is some tab open with a single click (with the middle mouse button), and there is some (random) tab closed when you try to close one tab with a click (with the middle mouse button)

Expected Results:
Just one tab should be open with a click, and one tab should be closed with one click
