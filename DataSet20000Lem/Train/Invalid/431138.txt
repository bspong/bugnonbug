I have a few extension (all are Firefox 3 compatible per the authors) but occasionally when starting Firefox 3 beta 5 the extension that are set to load in the status bar do not load. To get them to load I must disable one of the status bar extension (doesn't matter which one) and then restart Firefox in order to get all of the status bar extension to work again. This happens maybe once out of four or five startup of Firefox 3 beta 5. The area affected is the right side of the status bar (if that make any difference). I cannot reproduce this on my Mac running 10.5.2 and Firefox 3 beta 5 using the exact same extensions. This appears to only happen with my Windows XP SP2 machine.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. When extension to not load I must disable any one of the status bar extension and restart Firefox 3 beta 5
2. Once Firefox 3 beta 5 restarts the status bar extension again work properly and I can then re-enable the item I previously disabled.
3. Restarting Firefox 3 beta 5 again to re-enable this extension doe not reproduce the issue. All extension (including those in the status bar) load properly. It may take another four or five restarts of Firefox to reproduce the issue, but it is reproducible with time.
