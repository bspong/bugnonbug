When I go to a website, any website, copy a portion, and go to my word processor, using Microsoft Works, 9.0 , if I use control V or the paste option under edit, it close my word processor and I have to open it again.

This doe not happen if I 'paste special'... nor doe it happen using Internet Explorer, so I am assuming it is a problem within FF.

The computer, a Dell, is only a week old and ha done it from day 1. Dell say the problem is on your end. CAN YOU HELP ME?!?!
