I visited a website from a google search result, and it automatically downloaded and tried to install a virus, my AV stopped it.

It came from this search result, though the second load of the page no virus attempt occurred again.

I have had this experience a number of time over the past few months. The first actually killed my PC, I had to reset to a 6 month old image.

Hope you can find the hole in FF that allows a website to install without the user being notified, requested or anything.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a website
2. It installs something without a popup or alert of any kind
3. AV stop it, but not all AV's seem to catch this.
Actual Results:
A virus attempt to install
A fake AV website appears


FF should not allow a website to secretly install anything, ever.
