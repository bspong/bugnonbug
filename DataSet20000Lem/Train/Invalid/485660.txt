As the title, the dialogbox is not showing what it should show, the button for confirm and cancel etc. are all missing/hiding/sank. It seems that the box is not big enough to show them all. But I can still hit ENTER to confirm and ESC to cancel.
ps: I've installed some addons for downloading, DownThemAll and FlashGet. They are shown in the box, but the button for confirm and cancel are gone.
