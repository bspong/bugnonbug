var x = window.open doesn't work correctly in 2.0.0.4, but fine in 1.5
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

Executing the following three line of JS should open a new window:

var popWin = window.open('bar.html');
popWin.focus();
void(0);

When this is done inline between <script> tags, it doesn't work in 2.0.0.4 but work fine in 1.5 and IE 6/7. Oddly, if you put them in a function and call the function through an onclick, it doesn't work.

This is a bug basically because the syntax of the var popWin = window.open() statement is correct and yet 2.0.0.4 (firebug) reply with "popWin ha no properties" when you call popWin.focus immediately afterward.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.var x = window.open('anyurl'); x.focus;
2.execute this inline between <script> tag
Actual Results:
Firebug errored out with:

popWin ha no property
Line 14

(Line 14)-> popWin.focus();)

Expected Results:
A new window should have popped up.
