Latest Minefield break the open tab on middle click feature on.

This all worked fine till i updated to 20100226

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Middle click on a link.
Actual Results:
Selection box surround the link rather then opening it into a new tab.

Expected Results:
New tab should've opened.

This is on a Logitech Cordless Mouse.
Logitech doe not provide driver for this mouse under window vista or 7, so there are no button modifier available.

The middle button work fine to bring up the scroll cursor, it just opening link in new tab thats not working.
