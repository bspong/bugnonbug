malformed URL / Link in .aspx page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I use Fox to connect to a company website [behind a password protected point..]. The company "elects" to support the website for IE user [despite that 60%+ use Fox]. Generally, this is no problem. However, now and then quirk arise. A recent change in one of their page's content, with an .aspx URL, creates a title bar of links, duplicating the title bar on other page in the website.

However, on the .aspx page, in FOX a malformed link is created for some of the URLs on that page, malformation which do not appear if using IE7

For example: The coding [on view selection source in Fox]
<a href="https:%5C%5Ccompany.com%5CPageView.asp?PageType=S">

The link appears a this on IE
https://portal.company.com/PageView.asp?PageType=S

and in FOX, there is an ODD doubling of the URL to this:
https://portal.company.com/apps/announcements/\\portal.company.com\PageView.asp?PageType=S

I have amended the above domain to portal."company".com

It behaves somewhat like what happens [all be it not quite...] when one identifies the wrong base page.

When I contact the company web manager, he note that the particular page which generates this error is now in .aspx [a .NET creation] and since they don't "Support" FOX, they aren't going to worry about it.

So I put this to the crowd, here:

What is it that ha FOX mis-craft the URL ? Or, alternatively, what non-standard coding is leading to the FOX mishap?

Note that when I hover over the URL [not clicking on it] the mis-crafted URL appears on the lower left in it mis-crafted form [and try to link to it...].

Further examples: These four URLs are huddled together on the page [again, I replace "company" for the domain]:

<a href="http://www.company.com">Home</a> |
<a href="https:%5C%5Cportal.company.com%5CPageview.asp?edit_id=14">Contact Us</a> |
<a href="/PageView.asp?PageType=R&amp;edit_id=28">Legal</a> |
<a href="https:%5C%5Cportal.company.com%5CPageView.asp?PageType=L">Admin</a>

"Home" and "Legal" work,
"Contact Us" and "Admin" are malformed in the fashion, above, when hovered over or clicked on.

Also, on that page:
<a href="https://portal.company.com/PageView.asp?Org_id=88888">

This doesn't:
<a href="https:%5C%5Cportal.company.com%5CPageView.asp?PageType=S">

Is this caused by the %5C instead of a backslash in the page coding?

Any suggestion you all have would be appreciated.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to an aspx web page with URLs on it.
2. Or, alternatively, go to a web page with " %5C " in the coding, for backslashes?
3.
Actual Results:
I get unexpected formation of the URL for link on that page
