I intended to install latest nightly build parallel to my normal FF in order to file a bug and read the guideline carefully. During the installation I wa not prompted WHERE to install the new version. It forced itself on top of the old installation and ruined it, i.e. I can no longer run FF 2 - only this Minefield 3.07.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Downloaded the install exe file.
2. Ran it.
3. Was told that my add-on are not compatible with the new version. I.e.: No option to cancel install or choose directory to install in.
4. Can no longer run old FF2.
