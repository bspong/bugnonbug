When using Ctrl^F to find a string with wrap on, Firefox get all the word that
contain this string, rather just the string. This mean if we want to find “ear”
in a whole word, Firefox doesn’t skip the word like tear, hear, which contain
the string.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ on Firefox 0.8 browser
2. Press "Ctrl^F" key and search for “out” with Wrap option checked
3. Notice “about”, “without” are also treated a found.

Actual Results:
With the wrap on, all the word contain the string are retrieved.

Expected Results:
With the wrap on, only the word that are exactly the string should be retrieved.
