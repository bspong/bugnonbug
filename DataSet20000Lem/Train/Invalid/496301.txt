Nesting a link within a span within a link cause the html to be rendered incorrectly.

This HTML:

<a href="#">
<span><span>
a<a href="#">b</a>c
</span>d</span>e
</a>

Renders correctly in other browser but not in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the specified url in Firefox
2.Go to the specified url in Opera, IE etc
3.Compare
Actual Results:
The letter a is enclosed in both set of span (you can see this because the tab have border in my example.)

Expected Results:
The letter a, b and c are enclosed in the first span. The letter d is outside of that span but still within another span. The letter e is outside of all of the spans.

I know that people should not enclose link within link but they often do in thing such a nested navigation menu etc. This error only seems to occur with spans.
