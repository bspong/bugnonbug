Web Console cleanup: "StopIteration" is not thrown properly in the Web Console storage
In ConsoleStorage.displayStore(), we do "throw new StopIteration()". This will fail (and doe in the unit test if there aren't enough node in the output); the correct way to spell this is "throw StopIteration".

Not marking this a post-Firefox 4 since this is a bug (albeit a bug only in code that's unused), not just a refactoring.
