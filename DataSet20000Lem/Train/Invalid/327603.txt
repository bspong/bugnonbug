User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

Tested with Firefox 1.07, 1.5, 1.6, AI Roboform 6.0.8, AI Roboform Toolbar for Firefox 6.6.2


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Roboform >

2.activate Upper Toolbar (by clicking on the "Roboform" option in menu "Tools" in IE - upper toolbar is displayed >

3.Install Firefox >

4.install "AI Roboform Toolbar for Firefox" (any version - using now latest - 6.6.2) :

5.Roboform Toolbar is displayed and can be activated through the Toolbar Context Menu. Only option displayed in toolbar are "Roboform Toolbar" (when clicked it enables the Lower Roboform Toolbar), and "Close" (when clicked it close Roboform Toolbar).

Actual Results:
It is absolutely impossible to activate the Upper Toolbar (http://www.roboform.com/manual.html#controls).

Expected Results:
In IE6, a "Roboform" option is inserted into the "Tools" menu, whitch activates the Upper Toolbar when pressed. That option is not present in Firefox.

It might be possible that the menu item only appears in Firefox when IE6 is not present on the system, or Roboform is not installed for IE6, but that is not an option, a i use also IE6 in my work.

The Lower Toolbar in Firefox cannot be used easily because of another problem of Firefox (described in another bug - will post the bug number here after creating it).
