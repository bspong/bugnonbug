I have tried to 'Organize Bookmarks' using the Bookmarks Menu. I sorted them alphabetically, in A-Z order. When I do this, the bookmark appear sorted in the right-hand side Library view, but they do not appear sorted on the left Bookmarks display, nor do they retain their sort order once I quit out of 'Organize Bookmarks'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Using 'Organize Bookmarks..."I sort my bookmarks, which are archived under Bookmarks Menu
2.They look sorted in the Library
3.I quit out of the Bookmarks Organizer and the Bookmarks still unsorted
Actual Results:
Save bookmark under 'Bookmarks Menu' (the last one added appears at the bottom of the list.) Use the 'Bookmarks' menu item to 'Organize Bookmarks). Select the Bookmarks Menu on the left and Use the sort icon to sort the folder in order from A to Z. They will appear sorted in the Library view on the right-hand side. Quit out of the Bookmarks Organizer and the bookmark will once again appear unsorted. (e.g. the sorting did not stick!)

Expected Results:
frustration.
My bookmark remain out of order and I have no way to sort them effectively.

sort the bookmark alphabetically a it claimed it would.
