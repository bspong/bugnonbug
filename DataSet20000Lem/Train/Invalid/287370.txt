Quite oftenly by opening some page in web site (for instance
http://www.sharereactor.ru/) , FireFox sudenly stop loading page and all my
Win2K freeze compleatly. I have to reboot my system by presing RST button.
That happens not so offenly (can be few time a day). In case if browser is
switched off this freez situation hapens never.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open for instance this web site (can be some other):
http://www.sharereactor.ru/ I've tested thsi site twise - both time same esult
of freeze system.
2. Whait till web site will open. It's seam system freeze by the end of
opening this site (open icon stil runing, web site seems near to be open
compleatly).
3. Stop opening web site, no respond from mouse and keyboard, system freezed.

Actual Results:
:o) What happend?! You waiting-waiting, then deciding to press RESET button..
Worst thing is that you loosing all work you've done on this current point of
freez ..

Expected Results:
This situation of freezing window system hapens ONLY by browsing web sites.
Browsing by FireFox - shouldn't couse system freez.

My Windows Event Viwer says:
1) The browser ha received a server announcement indicating that the computer
WHOPPER is a master browser, but this computer is not a master browser. [MRxSmb,
13.11h, Warning]
2) The browser wa unable to promote itself to master browser. The browser
will continue to attempt to promote itself to the master browser, but will no
longer log any event in the event log in Event Viewer. [BROWSER, 13.11h, Error]

That's a last log message before system bacome to be compleatly freezed.
