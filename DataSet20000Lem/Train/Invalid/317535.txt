There is very long and aggravating delay opening PDF file if you prefer NOT to open them in browser, ie. disable PDF plugin from download actions. It appears Firefox is blocked during the entire time the PDF file is downloaded for the helper app (acrobat reader or ghostview), which can be long time for big manuals/catalogs. Try the digikey complete catalog for an example.

It is possible to sidestep the issue by downloading the pdf file, that is, by disabling any PDF support in firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.disable pdf plugin from download action
2.click on pdf file
3.choose "open with" default application

Actual Results:
10 minute delay during while FF is completely blocked

Expected Results:
download start on background and firefox becomes accessible immediately
