When I click Mozilla Firefox, I get Alert: The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

After I click the OK in the alert--the page is displayed.
I can get the bookmark to open. The URl is not
displayed. It doe not look like my original home page.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click Mozilla Firefox in the Start Up list.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The Alert appeared.

Expected Results:
To find the Firefox Home Page.

I can get the page using Internet Explorer; however,
I usually need to download IE again for it to work.
This is too much trouble. I think there is
conflict between the two browsers.
