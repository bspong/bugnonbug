When using cs float it doesn't corrently render the page.
The result is that the float'ed div is one line down which it shouldn't be.

The workaround is easy. The example used here is the cs border, there might be many more.

Border used to bypass the bug, just ignore it.

The bug can be avoided by adding the following in the css:

div {
border: black solid 1px;
}

I am sure that there are many more way of bypassing this bug.
