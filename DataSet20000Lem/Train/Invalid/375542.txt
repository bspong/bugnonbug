Anytime Anthy input mode is active in SKIM IME, opening a new window in firefox will freeze firefox. This doesn't happen in other (GTK) application i tried, but it doe happen in mozilla too. Goes for any webpage popup, preferences, page setup new window etc. Doesn't happen in file->open file window. Opening in another active input mode and then switching to Anthy works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Anthy input mode in SKIM
2. Open firefox
3. CTRL+N
Actual Results:
Firefox freeze

Expected Results:
Open the new window without freezing

No themes, happens in mozilla too.
