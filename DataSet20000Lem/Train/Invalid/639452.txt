I am contacting you in order to check if the license of Mozilla Firefox allows the possibility of creating an installer "customized" or "personalized"with issue such as:
- A preconfigured own theme
- selected preset
- Certifying Authorities
- etc.

This is not to modify the source code, just want to distribute the latest version of Firefox is preconfigured with the required need of a website we are developing public body to function properly.

In the event possible, and being a public body, we want to know all the recommendation and requirement we must meet to make a distribution of the product in the term discussed with all the guarantees.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always
