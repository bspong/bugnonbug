I'm using 3.0.6. Somewhere along the update path from FF 2.x I lost the ability to look at XML file in treeview using the nice default stylesheet. You used to display a message "The XML file doe not have a stylesheet associated with it" and you would render it.

FF 3.0.6 appears to interpret the file a HTML (or something, but since it's all <elements>, nothing displays.)

That's sad because this wa such a useful feature.
