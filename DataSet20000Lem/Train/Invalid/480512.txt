after the update to the version 3, Firefox increasingly crash down (which means, it is freezing, and I had to kill the process in the task manager), and after a while, even the problem message system doesn't work - it simply shut down. And I got some blue screen which I could remove, but yesterday, it wa completely unpossible to reboot the system, so I strated in the safe modus and deinstalled version 3 and installed version 2.0.0.20 - now the system is working again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start version 3
2. work with it
3. firefox freezes, a blue screen appears
Actual Results:
a blue screen, only removeable via safe modus

Expected Results:
work ??? send a problem message to mozilla.org? not produce a complete system crash?
