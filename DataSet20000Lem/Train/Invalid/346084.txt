On Mac OS most ctrl+... function are remapped to meta+.... and all font-related keyboard shortcut are. However on the new 2.0 beta1 the font-resizing using the mousewheel is still set for mousewheel.withcontrolkey.action instead of mousewheel.withmetakey.action

Observed with fresh install using a newly created clean profile.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Fresh install on OS-X
2.Create new profile using the profile manager
3.Press ctrl and scroll the mousewheel, press metakey and try again.

Actual Results:
Using the ctrl+mousewheel font will resize, using meta+scrollwheel the page scrolls, no font-resizing occurs.

Expected Results:
ctrl+mousewheel should scroll the page, no further effect expected.
meta+mousewheel should resize the font.

default config preference should be set to:
mousewheel.withcontrolkey.action = 0
mousewheel.withmetakey.action = 3
