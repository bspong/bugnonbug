No preference available for disabling extension added from the registry
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

I find that add-on seem to install themselves without permission via the registry under:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Firefox\extensions

I attempted to look for a way to disable this type of extension adding, but found that there is not any way to do this. The annoyance is when there is a random add-on that appears and I can't uninstall. The concern is if malicious extension can run without warning. I know in nightly it specifically prompt you to enable/disable, but I would prefer a single value where I won't have to worry in the future.

Sorry if this is not how you are suppose to file this (my first time filing something). I looked around for any other report similar, but I didn't find any.

Thanks



Expected results:

Insert a simple pref into about:config that is something like:
boolean extensions.checkRegistry = (default true)

and if false, skip the registry addon check/install
