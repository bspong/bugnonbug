Javascript is not executed in jsfiddle.net
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110916 Firefox/9.0a1
Build ID: 20110916030907

Steps to reproduce:

After bug 684178 wa fixed I wanted to use jsfiddle.net again.

- Enter "alert('foo');" (without the double quotes) in the JavaScript area under http://jsfiddle.net/
- Press "Run"


Actual results:

Nothing


Expected results:

A JavaScript Popup with an alert message with the text "foo" should have been opened.

This work in Aurora:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:8.0a2) Gecko/20110916 Firefox/8.0a2
but not in Nightly:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110916 Firefox/9.0a1

Probably a Javascript bug.
