cs file not correctly loaded
Hi,

i use firefox since his fist release, but in this time there wa no update
which fixed this bug....

i have a w3c conform cs stylesheet an in opara an IE6 it is correctly loaded
and the page works, but with firefox i have several problems.

for example, dimension data are not correctly displayed, the scrollbar is not
working (i do not mean an colored scrollbar, i mean the scrollbar itself is not
there!)
a php loop which list some data in several box doe not become it border,
the border are all on the first box instead

there are many more, but i don't know why mozilla/firefox doesn'n support cs
correctly

I hope u'll find the bug i mean

sincerely yours
eMs
