Hello,
I am not a "Techie" just computer literate. I have multiple issue that began when I did the last update to Firefox. Let me first say if you have any problem understanding what I write feel free to contact me at mccandlesstrekkies1@yahoo.com or @hotmail.com
I tried multiple time to install and set up an acct. of Spark, but because the pop up window don't always come into view and I have no idea what my Server address is I wa not able to finish it.
I am running Vista and have a satellite internet connection with no permanent carrier like Comcast or Timewarner to hook up to. Some call it piggybacking I guess.
Problems: 1. When I click on an item that states: "Print or Enlarge" a new window or tab pop up but it is always blank. This wa not a problem previously before the last update wa downloaded and installed. Please help me fix this.
2. The small icon that I had in my toolbar for me Fav's like my email sites, shopping, maps, etc. are no longer there. I have been through the "Toolbar" and there is no place to get them back or fix the issue. The choice for what now go into the toolbar is very limited.
3. Firefox seems to be crashing a lot since that last update a well. I know that this ha probably already been reported, but if not, here it is.
4. Here are some of my note from the problem I have been having: "Since last update, when I click on "Enlarge" on pics, on websites, the pic doe not come up, only the window? Or the “Print This Article” I have it set to open a new window so I can proceed, but the content never appears in the new open window? In addition the small icon on the toolbar for my email and most visited site have disappeared. I have gone into the toolbar tab and there is no way to fix them, it seems that over ½ of the option for the toolbar are missing? I am confused about all these change that occurred after the last update. Please help to correct.
Thank you for helping me and all the others who are in need and very frustrated.
