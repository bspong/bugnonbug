in RTL build, underscore is ordered strangely in some chrome text input field
This might be due to not setting up my desktop a a proper RTL environment, but FWIW:

If you enter a string beginning with an underscore into certain textboxes (e.g. the search bar but not the location bar) most of the character preserve the order of entry but the underscore is moved to the end of the displayed string.

Where You Enter You See
------------ --------- -------
Search Bar _ABCDEF ABCDEF_
Location Bar _ABCDEF _ABCDEF
