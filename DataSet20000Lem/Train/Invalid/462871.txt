Under Linux (Unix Firefox (and also Thunderbird) should output send print job in PDF to the printing system and not in PostScript

I am Till Kamppeter, leader of the OpenPrinting work group at the Linux Foundation.

As you can see on the page referenced above OpenPrinting ha agreed on switching
from PostScript to PDF a standard print job format. This decision wa made
between printing system and driver developers, application developers, desktop
developers, and many major printer manufacturers.

I want to ask you whether you can switch from PostScript to PDF a print job
output format in the upcoming 3.0 series of OpenOffice.org. This should not be a
big change a OOo is already capable of generating PDF via the "Export to PDF"
function. This code could be re-used. It could also be done in a way that it is
run-time configurable whether PostScript or PDF get generated with default set
at build time.

This doe not require all distribution to switch to a PDF-centric workflow a
CUPS ha a pdftops filter and so it convert the PDF input to PostScript if it
doe not have the filter for disrectly working with PDF.

As you can also see on the referenced web page, KDE and Qt application already
send job in PDF and OpenPrinting ha organized the development of the CUPS
filter for the PDF printing workflow.

Debian and Ubuntu already include CUPS package with PDF-based printing workflow.
