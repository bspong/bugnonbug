Firefox 3.0 crash Xorg 1.3 when scrolling

Linux version Mandriva 2007.0. Kernel 2.6.22. xorg version 1.3.0. Nvidia video, 7800GS, driver 173.14.05 (most recent driver).

I installed the firefox download a a system wide installation, placing it at the location required by my distro (/usr/local/firefox and /usr/lib/firefox-3.0). I also symlinked the firefox executable in /usr/bin to point to /usr/local/firefox/firefox.

At this URL:

http://www.softwareforlandlords.com:2082/frontend/bluehost/stats/lastvisit.html?domain=softwareforlandlords.com&ssl=0

grabbing the vertical scrollbar with the mouse and dragging it to the top cause X-windows to crash repeatably.. This result in a complete restart of the user session.

Unfortunately this URL is a statistic page with a hosting service. Specifically this is the "recent visitors" utility on the cpanel implementation at bluehost.com and it can only be accessed via password. I do not know if the problem would occur on some other cpanel installation or not.

If you wish, I can make local copy of the page and make it available.to you for testing, but this requires that I construct an archive and attach it...give me an email address to use and I'll do it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to that URL (or perhaps a similar one)
2. grab drag bar, pull to the top.
3. BOOM!
Actual Results:
Hard crash of X.

Expected Results:
window scroll to the top.
