CSS and Classes - Firefox doesn't recognise classes.

I create class within my style sheet and the browser fails to recognise them.
Instead it applies the formatting to each instance. In the above example, I
use nested table and only want to have the border (with no top) to appear for
the outermost table. It work fine in IE. Firefox should be able to recognise
different class a it's such a handy design tool.
