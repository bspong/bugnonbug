I saw others have reported this same problem but on other operating system so I am opening a new ticket with mine -- 64-bit Windows 7. As others have reported, all system sound functional, all medium player file functioning properly, only when streaming video in Mozilla Firefox that I get no sound. Began after Firefox upgrade to v.3.6. I tried multiple fix by uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, Java, etc. Nothing worked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade to Mozilla Firefox version 3.6
2. Attempt to open any streaming video, ie. those located on YouTube.com
3.
Actual Results:
Video works. No audio.

Expected Results:
Video works. Audio works.

As stated, there are multiple ticket open for this problem across all platforms. I only opened a new one because I did not see where anyone else had reported it on 64-bit Windows 7.
