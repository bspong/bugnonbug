Hello

I would like a file based session saver.
This mean that the session should be saved into a file. So you could copy the file on a memory stick or a memory card and can take this saved session file with you. For example to open your saved session in firefox on another computer.
Since several year this feature is integrated in opera browser.

Reproducible: Always
