URL bar history-based completion feature not functioning
With previous versions, when I typed "goo" I would begin to see suggestion for google URLs from my history. On recent trunk builds, no such suggestion occur. The URL bar recieves my typed text, but doe not display a list of possible completions. Using the arrow key to move up and down doe not help. Pressing the down-arrow on the far right hand side of the location text-box (just next to the padlock icon) doe not seem to respond or do anything.
