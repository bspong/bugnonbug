Can't use keyboard command when focus is on java applet
Seen while testing Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1a1) Gecko/2008072510 Shiretoko/3.1a1.

STR:
1. Visit site. Java applet will be missing, but that is expected.
2. Put focus on the Java applet (center of the page).
3. Ctrl+T or any other keyboard command.

Expected: A new tab would open or the keyboard command would be initiated
Actual: The menu flashes.

As soon a you remove focus from that area keyboard command work fine.

The same thing happens in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070206 Firefox/3.0.1 when I place focus on the java applet shown.
