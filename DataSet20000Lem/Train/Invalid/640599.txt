I downloaded this Toolbar 1.0, it came with IncrediMail and didn't give me the option if I wanted it or not. It installed itself and then wanted me to change my home page, search engine everything to it & then it froze up, freezing up my computer. I had to hit control alt delete to end 3 sessions, it kept coming back. I tried hit new session, it still came back. I went to my program I couldn't remove it there. I went into my control panel and there wasn't anything to remove. It wouldn't let me go into tool or add ons. I had to use a force uninstall to remove the crap IncrediMail came with & then I had to uninstall 4,0 and reinstall it again.

I went to the site where I got this & there are terribel review that I should have looked at first. The guy Bobby who developed it is removing the bad review & leaving the good ons, but there are hardly any good ones.
