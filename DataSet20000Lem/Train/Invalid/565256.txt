Searches hijacked by Bing/Bing Toolbar
We're seeing a number of user complain about keyword.URL search turning into Bing or their default search engine being set to Bing. A number have also complained that they suddenly have a Bing Toolbar (some may have removed -- although possibly just hidden -- it and are seeing the left-over search redirection.

Some clue point to Facebook a being the source of the unwanted Toolbar:

"I wa on Facebook and a video wa posted. O tried to open the video and FTV Player popped up and want to update. The Bing Search bar wa installed in Firefox at this time and I cannot figure out how to remove the unwanted search bar.
Facebook wanted to upgrade the FTV player on 05/03/10."

AND

"I cannot get rid of a tool bar. It is a bing tool bar. I got it after my facebook account wa phished. I also am seeing popup window when I search google."

I know this is almost certainly not the right place for this issue but it give u somewhere to talk about it and figure out exactly is going on.
