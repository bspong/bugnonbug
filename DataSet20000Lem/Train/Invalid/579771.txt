Tabs do not respond to any action/commands right after coming out of the sleep mode. The top menu item do work.

The only way that I have found to unlock the tab is to open a new window and start "private browsing" and then stopping the "private browsing" session. This will reload information to each tab that wa open on the initial window that froze. I do have to enter a password to get the computer to come out of the "sleep mode".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Computer go into the "sleep mode"
2. I enter a password to get the computer to come out of the "sleep mode.
3. Bring up the Firefox application that display the window with all tab that were open but tab do not respond to any commands.
4. Open new window
5. Open a new window and start "private browsing"
6. Once the "private browsing" session ha started
7. I then stop the "private browsing" session
8. Bring up the window with the frozen tab which will show that all tab are being reloaded.
9. Continue a usual

Normal operation continue a usual
