None of the accesskeys seem to function in Firefox 2.0 RC 3 (though I know this is not a final release). I've tested this on several dozen website which use accesskeys, but just listed one a an example. ALT + A on that site should take a user to the accessibility page and the rest of the link have accesskeys, a well, but none of them work.

Again, note that this is for Firefox 2.0 RC3, a accesskeys all seem to work fine in Firefox 1.5.x
