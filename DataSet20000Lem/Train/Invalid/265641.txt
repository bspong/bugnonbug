Heya,

I wa just wondering if there is any chance if the why you are warned about a
popup will be reverted back to the old way (just a symbol in the right corner
)? When I'm expecting a popup ... I'll look in the corner. Maybe the user can
miss some usable info? Can happen ofcourse .., but I liked the old way more. I
find the new way too intrusive.

just my way of experiencing it ...
