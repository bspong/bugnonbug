I use the following code to retrieve nsIZipReader objects. It ha been working well in FF 2.0.0.4, SM 1.1.2, and NS 9.0b2. I recently tried to retrieve an nsIZipReader in FF v3.0a7pre with the code below.

var zipReader = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/libjar/zip-reader;1"].
getService(Components.interfaces.nsIZipReader);
zipReader.init(zipFile);
zipReader.open();

Instead of successfully retrieving the nsIZipReader the following error wa thrown.

Error: zipReader.init is not a function

Perhaps the nsIZipReader interface ha changed in the latest trunk?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Retrieve an nsIZipReader object using the code listed above.
Actual Results:
An error wa thrown stating that the init method could not be found.

Expected Results:
The nsIZipReader should have been initialized with the zip file and then opened.

This problem only started appearing in v3.0a7pre. The code work well in other version a well a other browsers.
