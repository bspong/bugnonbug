Had problem with 2.0.0.9 that it froze my taskbar on XP, especially when used with Word. So uninstalled/reinstalled and that reduced the Firefox window to 3/4 of the screen height when it should have been full screen. Tried everything to restore the full window size, 2.0.0.10, 2.0.0.11, uninstalls, reinstalls, removed every mozilla, firefox and 2.0.0.9 from the registry and any file that look like it might contain this parameter, but 2.0.0.11 wa just the same on re-installation. But 3 beta cured it! Thanks, Nigel.
PS All XP updates, Office update installed until this happened. All the s/w is straight, not hacked. Avast! anti-virus and Zone Alarm firewall.
