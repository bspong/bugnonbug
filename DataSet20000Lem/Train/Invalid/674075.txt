Geolocation continues to work in Google even when turned off in Mozilla
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

Google informs me of my location on the sidebar. When clicking the link to turn it off, Google say geolocation cannot be turned off from Google, for Mozilla users, because Google obtains location info from Mozilla. It offer a link to a page explaining how to turn off geolocation in Mozilla. I followed the direction precisely. I tried both denying access solely to Google, and turning off geolocation in Mozilla altogether.


Actual results:

Google continues to show my location in the sidebar of search, even when I have denied access to my geolocation information from Mozilla or turned off Mozilla's geolocation feature.


Expected results:

Google should have stopped showing my location.

If the problem is needing to clear cookies, Mozilla's instruction page need to explain how to do that (without also deleting my saved password for a couple of sites). If this is a Mozilla bug, please fix it. If it's a Google bug, maybe someone could send them an official message from Mozilla (they might listen better).
