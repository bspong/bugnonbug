It would be a very handy feature to be able to add domain to the Pop-up Allow
list from a menu in the menu bar. There are quite a few site I go to that
require pop-up for log-in's or processing creditcard purchase online, or other
reasons. As it stands, I have to go into Tools --> Options --> Web Features -->
Click Add --> and type or paste the domain name in, to allow popups from these
sites.

It's really not that big of a deal, but it would be a very nice option to have.
