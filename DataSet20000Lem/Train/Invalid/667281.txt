Tab tearing no longer work properly in FF5

In FF4 I wa able to tear away tab from one window on to another, or on a blank space to create a totally new window. This feature is broken in FF5. Dragging away to create a new window creates a blank new window. The tabs, however, stay in the initial window and are "locked" (can't be closed, and if focused out, can't be refocused).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox, create a new tab and go to any URL. (You should have 2 tab now.)
2. Drag the second tab onto the desktop, in order to create another window.
3. Voilà!


Actual Results:
A blank new window is created; the original tab stay the original window.

Expected Results:
A new window containing the previous tab is created. The tab is no longer referenced in the original window.

Maybe relevant add-ons: Tab Mix Plus 0.3.8.6
