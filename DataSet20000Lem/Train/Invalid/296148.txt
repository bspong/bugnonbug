When clicking on a flash .swf file, instead of loading and playing the flash in
the browser window, you are prompted to download the file. Once it downloaded
the browser try to play it from the local file which of course it can not
because the flash file is looking for data that is on the website only.
When viewing this URL with IE, another window open and the flash file is played
in IE directly off the web server.
