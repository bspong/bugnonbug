Everytime there is an addon update, I update those addons, and then Firefox's homepage load when you first open up firefox, but upon starting up a new tab, the tab lost it startup information, and then just go to an (Untitled) blank page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Automatically update the addons that need updating (This is the only time the bug occurs, when addons need updating)
3.Open a new Tab

Actual Results:
Blank page occurs instead of my prefered setting (home page)

Expected Results:
Homepage should show up just like when firefox first start up.

I went into about:config and changed a setting for my Tabbrowser Preferences addon, the extensions.tabpref.homePageButtonTarget to 1, 2, and 0 to open up the homepage everytime a new tab is opened, and this didn't work. I uninstalled the addon, and purposely installed an older version of a different addon, allowed firefox to update itself, and it did not load the homepage in a new tab.
