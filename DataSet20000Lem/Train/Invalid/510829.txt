Missing "X" icon to blank the tab if only one tab is open

In previous version I got used to clear the actual tab by pressing the close icon (the red X). In Firefox 3.5.2 I can't do that anymore, I have to open a new tab to clear the first.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 3.5.2
2. Visit an URL and don't open another tab
3. Try to blank this first tab somehow
Actual Results:
It's not possible to blank the tab if no other tab are open

Expected Results:
There should be an icon to close the tab, even if no other tab are opened

I think it's a major feature to blank a tab therefore I set the severity to "major".
