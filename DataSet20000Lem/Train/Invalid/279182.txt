When rendering a webpage with table that have border greater then 1 and with
bordercolor tag the gecko rendering engine will still render the default
color of table borders. I don't think I really need to include this like a an
example, I know everyone that us Firefox ha seen this but here you go
http://civilrebellion.com/firefox_error.html

I have seen this problem a lot and is one major reason I have not used
Firefox. I have however been rather forced to make web page that are bloated
just to make sure they render correctly in Firefox and I know this is a
problem with the gecko rendering engine it is something that should be
corrected I am re porting this here so it can be fixed on a grander scale then
I feel I can do but i am also willing and going see if I can correct this
problem if someone can just point me to the hidden location that the source
code is stored at.
