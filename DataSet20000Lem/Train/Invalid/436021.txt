ignoring image width and heigth if image cannot be loaded

When image (file) declared in <img src=""> cannot be loaded (for any reason - i.e. 404 for example), Firefox ignores width and height (either specified by <img widht=""> and <img heigth=""> or by <img style="width: ; heighth:">). It doe not display image (or rather it placeholder, a image cannot be loaded) or reserve space with exact dimensions, page developer set. In place of that it only display placeholder / reseres space enough to display <img alt=""> text with current font. This sometimes lead to a complete disorder or even chaos on page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. place any <img> on any webpage,
2. set it src="" to non-existing file,
3. set it width and heigth (either directly by <img width=""> or by CSS),
4. see the result
Actual Results:
Firefox reacted a described above - it reserved space / displayed placeholder for non-existing image file with incorrect width and height. Exactly specified width and heigth wa ignored.

Expected Results:
Firefox should respect width and height set for image by page developer in all situation - even in those, when proper image cannot be loaded.

Since this bug is related to parsing HTML, I think it will show up in any version of Firefox run under any OS.
