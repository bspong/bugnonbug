-install-global-extension doesn't work on Firefox 3.

1) Although no error is found during installation (as root) when Firefox is started (as an user) we get error and the extension is not available for the user

2) If the extension jar/xpi is unzipped, and the extension ID is looked up on install.rdf, and the folder is created accordingly, the extension do work globally

Conclusion: the installation mechanism with -install-global-extension got broke from 2.0.0.x to 3.0.x

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.choose and extension
2.install it a root, eg:

/usr/local/firefox/firefox -install-global-extension quick_locale_switcher-1.6.5.9-fx+mz+tb+sb+sm.xpi

3.launch firefox a a user
Actual Results:
Firefox complains that the install.rdf file is not present or is incorrect

Expected Results:
I'd expect Firefox to start without special messages, and the installed extension to be available.

This is critical for Linux system integrator because:

- we need to make firefox available on different languagues in the same package
- the default skin look *really* bad on KDE, so a global theme is necessary
