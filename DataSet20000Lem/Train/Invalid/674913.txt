Cannot drag and drop a tab from a normal window to a fullscreen window
Build id: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0a1) Gecko/20110727 Firefox/8.0a1

STR:
1. Launch Firefox on a clean profile
2. Have two Firefox window available one in fullscreen mode and one in window mode
3. Drag a tab from the window in normal mode and drop in the tab strip of the fullscreen window.

Expected result:
3. the DnD is possible

Actual result:
3. the DnD is impossible

*Notes:
This issue is present since the landing of the tab animation feature -> bug 455694 which mean it's a regression if not an intended behavior
Is this blocking bug 455694? (see comment 304 in bug 455694)
