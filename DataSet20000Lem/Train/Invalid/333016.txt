Subscriptions view is horked, doesn't update correctly
There are error and strange behavior in the subscription view.

When you right click on a subscription folder, go to "Get Info" and press OK: The folder try to add itself a an observer again, making it get double update message which really mess thing up. Also, the folder are all reset and are closed.
