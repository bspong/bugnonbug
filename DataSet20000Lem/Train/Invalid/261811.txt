When a new window is opened with no toolbars, the new static toolbar with the
urlbar ha multiple problems.

The biggest problem is that if the urlbar ha been moved to another toolbar then
it is not displayed in the new window.

The next problem is that toolbar customization is allowed. Customization should
be disabled for toolbars when the window is in this mode.

The third problem is that, while toolbar button are hidden, toolbar separator
not not hidden. Perhaps toolbar separator should be given a class of
"chromeclass-toolbar-additional" like toolbar button have so that it will be
properly hidden. An alternative, but le elegant, possibility is to add a
selector to /global/content/xul.css for these separators.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. View > Toolbars > Customize
2. Move "Location" urlbar to the "Bookmarks Toolbar."
3. Place some separator on the "Navigation Toolbar."
4. Exit toolbar customization.
5. In the browser, click a link which open a new window with toolbars disabled
(e.g., gmail contacts).
6. Notice that the toolbar is visible but the "Location" urlbar is missing.
7. Right-click toolbar and notice that it is customizable.
8. Notice that the toolbar separator are visible.
