Seemingly random Blue screen of death crash when using firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

After reboot Windows reported with their bug report that the error wa caused in:

Intel PRO/Wireless LAN 2200BG adapter software (w22n51.sys)

Restarting Firefox after that cause same crash. Using Firefox Bugzilla report cause same crash. Can only bring Firefox back up in safe mode.

Reproducible: Sometimes
