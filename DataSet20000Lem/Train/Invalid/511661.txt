The staff log in at the above URL doe not properly login

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log onto above website
2.Enter Same Password and User name a always
3.
Actual Results:
The device act a though it is logging in showing PHP message for about a second

"Processing Login....
Click here if not redirected by your browser"

Then it return to the login page without showing an error

Expected Results:
I expect that after a second or two of showing that message it would log in; even giving enough time to click that message would be sufficient.

This only happens when I enter in the correct user name and password when i enter a wrong username or incorrect password I get a different message almost immediately that show underneath the login box showing "Invalid Username or password"

I also have the same problem on IceWeasal

This problem is not present on Seamonkey, Opera, Konqueror, or IE.
