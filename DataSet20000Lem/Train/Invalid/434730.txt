Can not add node to DOM (with JavaScript) generated via XSLT

I have an XML document with an attached XSLT which creates xhtml. In the XHTML file there is a JavaScript file assigned which try to add a node to a div. Adding text node or changing attribute do work.

If I save the generated XHTML in a file and open this file in Firefox, the Script work fine. So I think there is a problem with changing the dom of a genereated document with XSLT.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create any XML file and attach an XSLT file which creates an XHTML file with JavaScript content
2. The JavaScript content should query a node (e.g. div, getById)
3. Try to add a node (appendChild)
Actual Results:
Added node is not displayed and not accessible for further JavaScript access.

Expected Results:
Node should be displayed an be accessible.

IE work fine with the example. Safari ha this problem too.
