I have been having trouble with the Search engine lately where I put in my search term in window and I get very poor results. I have put in some request for "Martin Cabinets" or a certain restaurant, but I get a single page of result that are usually some kind of sponsored links. When I looked at the page more closely, I saw something strange in the light blue bar near the top of the screen that is labeled "Web" and on the far right side it showed the time it took to get the search results, the number of result found, a well a the term used. The problem i see is that it say "sex" for search term when I used nothing close to that word. I can repeat the search and get the proper results, and I have had trouble replicating the problem, but it ha occurred at least 3 time with different search terms.

I have fully scanned my computer with AVG Anti-Spyware 7.5, AVG Anti-virus 7.5, and Lavasoft's Ad-ware 2007. Everything say that my computer is clean and I have not really noticed any other problems. I don't know about programming or HTML, but I can generally work around Windows and other program with out problems.
