Inconsistent toolbar customization behavior

When customizing the toolbar button I get strange behavior, including:

* The "new tab" button disappeared from my toolbar after the upgrade to 4.0,
and is nowhere to be found in the customization dialog. (I upgraded an XP
system and did not lose the "new tab" button there

* Toolbar button display when in customize mode but disappear when dismissing
the customization dialog. This seems to depend on where the button are
placed.

* Clicking "restore default set" restores the "Stop" and "Reload" buttons, but
when dismissing the customization dialog these two button disappear (see attachments).

Reproducible: Always
