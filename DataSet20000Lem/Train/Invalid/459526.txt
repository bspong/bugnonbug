Problem with flashblock involving some flash object not appearing after clicking the placeholder.

When I click on the placeholder, sometimes it will display flash file
perfectly and other time it will show nothing but an empty space. Reloading
the page often fix the problem. Disabling flashblock and reloading the page
always fix the problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Completely random, but often happens on http://www.youtube.com/ and http://www.freesound.org/ among other sites.
Actual Results:
Flash did not display when clicking placeholder in flashblock.

Expected Results:
Flash should have appeared after clicking placeholder in flashblock.

I use the default theme.
