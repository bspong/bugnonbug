auditmypc.com popup checker doesn't always score 100%
While I wa looking around making sure Firefox wa secure, I ran into a pop up
blocker test on www.auditmypc.com . I am using a Windows XP PRO w/ (Firefox 1.0)
computer. Pop Up blocking is ENABLED in my Firefox browser. Out of 9 different
test, the browser passed 7 of them, giving Firefox a rating of 85% for pop up
blocking protection, which mean it is not completely secure from pop ups. The
two test it failed are a follows: User-launched HREF-method popup allowing = Failed
User-launched Delayed-method popup allowing = Failed (If there is a way that you
guy @ Mozilla Firefox can fix this problem, please release an update to Firefox
As soon a you can.) I appreciate your concern. God Bless.
