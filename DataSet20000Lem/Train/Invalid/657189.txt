When I close a pinned tab, the focus go automatically to the last viewed tab. Then, if I clic on the closed tab, it re-opens. Finally, when I display the "group preview window", the closed-and-reopend pinned tab now ha 3 icon instead of 1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close a pinned tab (with CTRL + F4 or right clic, since CTRL + W is disabled for pinned tabs)
2. Clic on the greyed icon representing the now closed tab: it re-opens.
3. Go to the group preview window. Now there are 3 icon for the closed-and-reopend tab on the right sidebar of each group.

Actual Results:
3 icon

Expected Results:
1 icon

It isn't related to the number of groups. Since I had also 3 group opened, I thought it could be, but I have checked that and it's not.
