When I clicked on a link to view an Adobe pdf file firefox either went into a continuous cycle of start stop page loading or else simply crashed. This happened whilst trying to view any pdf file on any web site. Additionally, while using firefox on google image search. clicking on image resulted in an error saying that the image couldn't be displayed because it had errors. I found a hint from a user in a forum about the image issue and tried turning skype number highlighting off. It fix the problem, so I tried it with the PDF issue to with the same reult, pdf file download fine with skype number highlighting turned off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.After installing firefox, download and install Skype.
2.During installation choose to install the skype plugin for firefox.
3.With number highlighting turned on try to view a pdf file or (jpg) image file (i.e. do an image search and then click the thumbnail to actually open the image full size).
Actual Results:
PDF's will crash the browser or lock it into an endless start stop page loading cycle, image will display error, "the image "http://www.*" cannot be displayed because it contains errors.

Expected Results:
The software should have loaded the pdf in the browser window. The image should have been displayed full size in the browser window.

I'm having these problem with all of the latest version of Firefox, Adobe reader and Skype. Due to the popularity of Skype I would think this is an important one to get sorted, specially a it is not clear at all that it is a buggy extension causing the problems.
