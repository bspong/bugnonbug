With Nightly build dated after Feb 22, when I do Tools Options it doe not come up.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0+

Tools option with earlier version will let you set the options.
With the latest version, it come up with a little box at the top with

General Privacy Content Tabs Downloads Advanced.

Just those word no button or tabs.

If the screen is larger than 800x600, you can also see OK and Cancel button
in the lower right hand side (with 800 x 600 it is off the screen).

You can press Enter or click ok if you can see it to continue.

Going back to the 22nd version that I have, it work fine, or going to the
released version, but the nighly build still show the same problem. Even tried
completely removing Firefox, and same results.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools
2. Options
3.

Actual Results:
Get what should be the tab button at top, and OK/Cancel, but no window to update
any of the options.

Expected Results:
To have the Options screen show up with all the options.

I've download a number of nightly build to see if it ha been fixed, but still
get the same results.
