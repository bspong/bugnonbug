Gmail fails to redirect to Google Calendar with "The page isn't redirecting properly" [solved by deleting cookies]
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

I wish you folk would stop dickering with Google and come up with a work around for the known issue of Google Calendar's failure to launch. It is obvious from my end that Google expects a new window to be generated to publish the Google Calendar it and not a new TAB. It would be a delight for you to fix this issue if you can do so.

A penny for your thoughts...
