when accessing Bookmarks, I am prompted to add a new Bookmark

When I click on Bookmarks the option to add a new Bookmark come up without me clicking on the option to add a new bookmark. This is quite annoying. Also, you need to add the option of sorting bookmark by name if there are several listed in folders. For example I have 21 Folders under bookmarks, and the 21 folder have 10's if not 100's of URL bookmarks. The option to right-click and choose "sort by name" under each folder need to be made available, not just under the main listing of folder and URLs when you first click on Bookmarks. Internet Explorer ha this option and older version of Firefox did a well but for whatever reason you revoked this option. Please add it back in!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Click on Bookmarks
3."Page Bookmarked" Dialog box pop up without clicking on the Bookmark This Page option.
Actual Results:
The confirmation dialog box for "Page Bookmarked" come up.




It should just list all of the bookmarks, folders, URLs, etc without prompting to bookmark a page. This happens with either the default theme or modified theme.
