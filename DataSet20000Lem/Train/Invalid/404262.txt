Because I make theme for people with visual impairments, I provide distinct feedback whenever an item in chrome is hovered over (:hover and [_moz-menuactive="true"]) and clicked-on (:hover:active and [_moz-menuactive="true"]:active). I skin the menu and menuitems in the menu bar and in the dropdown menu of the context menus, the menu bar and bookmarks. I also skin the icon of every native menu and menuitem except for the main entry on the menu bar.

In fx2, the icon and the background color change when they are hovered over or clicked on. In fx3, there is inconsistency in the behavior of the View > Sidebar > [selections] child menu and the View > Zoom > [selections] child menu.

In the View > Sidebar child menus, the first time or two you click on Bookmarks or History, you will see the icon and background color changes. Then you will see only the hover changes; the active change stop happening for both icon and background color.

Interestingly, when you click on a selection in the child menu, the parent menu show the active state in both icon and background. This is normal behavior, but it show that the system is responding to the click.

In the View > Zoom child menu, generally the Zoom In and Reset menuitems show the active effects, but not always. Sometimes the Zoom Out show the active state, but then stop doing so. The behavior is inconsistent.

In the main window context menu, when a frame is present, the context > This Frame > View Frame Info menuitem doe not show change when it is clicked on, though the parent This Frame menuitem doe show the changes.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install SphereGnome or SphereGnome_Big (preferably the latter)
2. Choose to use the theme; restart Firefox.
3. Click on a menuitem in View > Sidebar or View > Zoom; or go to gmail, right-click on the mail list, and click on This Frame > View Frame Info.
Actual Results:
Selected menuitems fail to show active state changes.

Expected Results:
Selected menuitems should show active state changes.

The initial coding for the icon wa :hover:active. This wa changed to [_moz-menuactive="true"]:active in an attempt to respond to the failure to show :active changes.

I have also tried :active alone, without :hover or [_moz-menuactive="true"] in the code for those items.

The code for the active menuitem background is in menu.css. The code for the menuitem icon is in menuIcons.css.

The version of SphereGnome that ha coding for Zoom (fx2 wa enlarge and reduce text size) is here:

I will post a copy of SphereGnome_Big in a few minutes. The two differ in that SphereGnome_Big ha separate hover state for almost all icons, where SphereGnome generally ha only normal and active.
