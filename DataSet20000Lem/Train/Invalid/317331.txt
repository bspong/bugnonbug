Using Windows XP Media Center Edition. Had to go back and install ver. 1.0.4 which doe work. In 1.0.6 and 1.0.7 with my usual 3 tabs, the first say "locating" and the next two say "loading" with the little circling arrow. All other feature of the browser seem fine. No trouble on my Windows 2000 profession machine. Software company have reported their software will not work on Windows XP Media Center Edition. Symantec say no go for Norton System Works and Intervideo asked me to reinstall the special version Win DVD Creator that came with my HP, since the new version would not work on Windows XP Media Center Edition. I guess if this is important, it would be worth testing on XP Media Center Edition. By the way, it would still not run in -safe-mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 1.0.6 or 1.0.7
2. Run browser
3. Wait for site never to load

Actual Results:
No special steps. Just install a usual using defaults.

Expected Results:
Browser sits their trying to load. All other thing like help, about, bookmarks, etc. seem fine. I feel XP Media Center Edition is the culprit.

Latest download just obtained today (2005.11.21). No error report appear like the one that can sometimes be sent to Microsoft. I have closed Firefox and gone to the task manager. Firefox is still there and cannot be closed. The only way to get rid of it is the restart my computer.
If there is anything I can do to help track the problem, let me know.
