Some embedded flash video are very slow, out of sync and drop frame
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

Starting with FF4 and later, I'm having trouble playing embedde video on some sites.
The video look more like a slide show.
In FF4 and FF5, disabling hardware acceleration and session.restore in about:congif helped. In FF6, it doesn't. I'm using the latest flash plugin which wa automatically undated last week.
The change in about:config
browser.sessionstore.interval;3000000
browser.sessionstore.max_resumed_crashes;0
browser.sessionstore.max_windows_undo;0
browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash;false



Actual results:

I openned this video
http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/20125-home-alone-3
I have a 10mbit connection and the video is entirely buffered.
but it is almost impossible to watch: too many frame are skipped. On the other hand, other site


Expected results:

The video should run fine, a it doe on the same machine under other browser (both IE7 and Chrome). Moreover, portable FF3.6 run this video fine on the same machine.
