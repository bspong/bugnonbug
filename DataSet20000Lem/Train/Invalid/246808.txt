Doesn't render app type of 'x-weblogic/internal' the way FF 0.8 used to.

WebLogic 6.1 server us a web based admin console. This admin console (for
some strange reason) present the browser with mime type 'x-weblogic/internal'
rather than text/html.

Firefox 0.8 ha always recognised this a a web page and ha rendered the admin
console just fine. With 0.9, I get a popup asking me how I'd like to handle the
mime type (which is fair enough) but the only option available are to download
the file or to open it with an external app. No simple 'Just try and render it'
option.

Pls let me know if there is any other specific detail you'd like about this case
- screen shots, raw HTTP response using wget, etc etc.

Cheers!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up WebLogic server 6.1
2. Browse to the WebLogic admin console.

Actual Results:
Rather than rendering the web page, I am prompted about how I'd like FireFox to
deal with the response.

Expected Results:
Rendered the page - OR provide me with an option to render, given that the MIME
type wa non-standard.
