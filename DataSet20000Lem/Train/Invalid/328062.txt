Memory leak is still really bad!

I'm getting REALLY sick of Firefox crashing MULTIPLE time a day!!! I'm in it most of the day and end up losing A LOT of information that is sometimes difficult to return to.

The reason for the crash - Firefox (curr. ver - 1.5.0.1) is not releasing memory and will even continue to eat memory when I'm not doing anything. Even using a memory manager doesn't help.

Last night, I closed all but one tab (which had very little on it) and it still said that Firefox wa using almost 200MB of memory!!! When it crashed the last time, it wa taking up over 300MB of memory!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox, browse somewhere
2. Open a couple of tab with link
(check memory in Task Manager)
3. Open a few of the link from those page (so that some page stay static while others continue to load)
(check memory in Task Manager)
4. Repeat a couple of times, opening and closing tab
(check memory in Task Manager)
5. Repeat step 3-5 for about 3-5 HOURS
(check memory in Task Manager)
6. Close all but one tab
(check memory in Task Manager)

Actual Results:
Current memory in use by Firefox, with 4 tab open - 206,516K (fluctuating between 201,180 - 206,800)

Expected Results:
Making a list/log of the various memory checks, you should find that the memory will sometimes drop, but not significantly.

With only a single tab open, Firefox should eat up very little memory (10MB-50MB), but instead it fails to release the memory.
