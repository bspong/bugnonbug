Browser stuck when using website with "#" in the URL
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The Firefox browser decides to stop responding to all website request and click when on website with # in the URL. For example, https://mail.google.com/mail/#sent and http://www.facebook.com/home.php?ref=home#/friends/?ref=tn stop responding and loading the remaining content after accessing the page. It sometimes works, but other time stop responding. I have been told that it start to load again after a period of time (1-2 minutes).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access website, such a http://www.facebook.com/ or https://mail.google.com/
2. Click through page and folder until non-responsive
Actual Results:
The browser stopped responding to load requests, Task Manager show firefox.exe using 48% CPU. On certain occasions, the browser returned to it normal state after 30-60 seconds.

Expected Results:
Loaded the web page correctly without non-responsive browser. Stable version of Firefox from http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ work on a Windows XP machine.

Windows 7 RC1 (Build 7100) 64-bit (x64) running latest beta build of Firefox 3.5.2.
