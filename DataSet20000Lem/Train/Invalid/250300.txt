I am using a Compaq Presario 1510US notebook computer running Windows XP
Professional recently patched with SP2 RC2 from Microsoft. All other
application have been running without incident. I have 512MB of RAM, and
Task Manager report 162MB of available RAM at the point of installer
failure. I have successfully installed Firefox 0.9.1 on other computer I
own, including an IBM Thinkpad running Win2000 SP4, and a homebuilt Windows XP
Professional machine, also runing SP2 RC2.
