User Agent:

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-img-element
2. Try creating/switching to new tab etc.
3. Open a link in new tab.


Actual results:

2. Fx becomes unresponsive, explicitly allocated memory increased by about 170 M (source code is about 4 M)
3. Becomes unresponsive again, allocates additional memory (> 100 M).


Expected results:

2., 3. Behave smoothly. Abort rendering with error message, when rendering take more than a certain predefinable amount of memory.
