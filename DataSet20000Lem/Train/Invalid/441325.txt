Firefox ha hijacked control of Dreamweaver CS3 WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!

I am really, really upset here. Firefox 3.0 ha apparently taken over my computer's file extension naming. In Dreamweaver, where the file type is listed, e.g. .jpg, gif, etc. instead of .html, I now have the word 'Firefox Document'. I DID NOT give Firefox permission to do so and I would like instruction a to how to remove this immediately, or I will remove Firefox from my system in hope it remove it. This is PIRATING control of my computer. This is absolutely unacceptable behavior on the part of Mozilla's programmers!!! I am also going to send this on to Adobe's Dreamweaver team, a I am sure they are going to be very interested in this

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.All I have to do is open Dreamweaver's Files dialog box.
2.
3.



Simply stated .html or .htm or other standard file type naming convention, and not have turned into an advertising forum for Mozilla's Firefox. Firefox DOES NOT OWN HTML!!!
