When I try to open a link to a file such a an avi or mp3 (see link and click the "click here" link for the mp3) instead of opening a new tab firefox open the download file manager. It still give me the option of whether to download, DTA, TDTA, or open with program, but FF absolutely will not let me open the file in new tab or window. I have looked at the file association menu under the tools/options/downloads/manage file type and it ha mp3 on there a both an audio file and core medium player file but they both say to open with the vlc medium plug in. When I try to remove the core file part it refuse to allow removal. I only have a few active medium changing extensions, are there any that cause this kind of thing?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click the link to the file
2.or try right clicking and open in new window.
3.or try open in external application (ietab).
4.or try middle clicking.
Actual Results:
the "what should fire fox do with this file" dialog box open up.

Expected Results:
New or blank tab with a medium bar and the mp3 start playing and downloading.
