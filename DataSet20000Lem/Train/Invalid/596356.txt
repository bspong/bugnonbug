A virus using a dutch tool logged and saved all my mozilla firefox saved password a well a other program like messenger] and sent them out. A watermark in one of the virus file lead me to tool-store.info, this is where the tool for stealing the password is found.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. get the virus
2. see 1
3. repeat step 1-3
Actual Results:
Passwords get sent out, someone else access my crap, spread the virus claiming to be me

Expected Results:
password should be encrypted, and not sent out.

a simple encryption is something along the line of taking each letter of the password and applying a calculation like: chr((ord(LETTER) - 6)). That is of course EXTREMELY simple, but even that's better than nothing.

Note: flagging severity a critical, "causes you to lose data". This is the logical fallacy of equivocation, being that this is not what you meant at all by that line, but you do lose your passwords.
