Putting the address bar in the menu bar on Windows 7 (when it's hidden) make the address bar inaccessible
STR:

1. Go to the toolbar customization dialog.
2. Drag the address bar to the menu bar (which is hidden by default).
3. Close the add-on customization dialog.
4. Press Ctrl+L. Nothing happens, and the Open Location dialog doesn't pop up either. The address bar is no longer accessible, unless you make the menu bar visible (which currently crash Firefox -- bug 640652), but that's another story!
