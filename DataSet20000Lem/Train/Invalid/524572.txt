When pressed "New tab" Fast Dial open a new tab. In a recent version of Firefox, address bar contained "Fast dial" text. When clicked on bar that text disappears and the text cursor wa put on 1st position ready to input a new URL.
Now after creating a new tab the address bar is empty. If u click any place free of fast dial icon the address bar fill in "chrome://fastdial/content/fastdial.html". Since, u need first manually delete all that symbol before entering a new url from keyboard. Not a good idea. If tab leaved a is(containing chrome://fastdial/content/fastdial.html in address bar) and switched on another when switching back soon it's address bar already contains search bookmark and history - now it's ok !

Reproducible: Always
