I frequently leave Firefox running on my computer for long period of time (overnight) because I sometimes pause a video on hulu.com to finish watching the next day. Leaving firefox running cause a window task (ashServ.exe) to build up a huge VM file, sometimes over 400,000 KB in size. Closing Firefox doe not get rid of this huge VM size - only restarting the computer get ashServ.exe to shrink back down in size.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox to one or more webpage
2. Leave running overnight
3. check Windows Task Manager to see VM size of ashServ.exe
Actual Results:
ashServ.exe expands VM usage to over 400,000 KB

Expected Results:
When Firefox is closed, VM Size of ashServ.exe should shrink to under 100,000 KB
