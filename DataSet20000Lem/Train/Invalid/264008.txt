Compare:
http://www.car-hire-car-rental-car-hire.com./ (with dot at the end)
http://www.car-hire-car-rental-car-hire.com/ (not dot, correct domain)

If dot is appended at the end of domain, wrong (random?) domain is being displayed.

In this case, if you use URL with dot, New Longton All Saints School is
displayed, otherwise the correct car rental website.

1. Enter URL: http://www.car-hire-car-rental-car-hire.com./
2. Incorrect website is being shown

Actual Results:
Incorrect website is being shown

Expected Results:

should be shown

Strip the dot at the end
