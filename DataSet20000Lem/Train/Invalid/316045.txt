Command-line option to open URL in a new window (on Windows)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051107 Firefox/1.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051107 Firefox/1.5

When using the command line to start FireFox you can't use the -new parameter and an Url
e.g.
firefox.exe -new http://www.getfirefox.com/
if you use -new first it will open a new process but not the url and if you enter first the url it will use the latest window.
You can change the option in the advanced settings, but I want to switch between them with the command line

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a shortcut
2. Add -new "http://www.getfirefox.com"
3. Run the shortcut

Actual Results:
It open a new window without the new url

Expected Results:
That it open the new window with the given url
