infected with virus/trojan while browsing with firefox

In the hope of safer browsing, I wa visiting a an example, some site returned by Google. I wa also running a trial ver. F-Prot antivirus, including it's real-time protector.

Firefox ain't so safe a it seems, or they found some way to specifically exploit it. Even though I'm using the latest. Or the exploit work by fooling the fox and calling up some IE routing which is then penetrated fully.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to Google. search for "crack".
2.visit the first 10 results. maybe browse a little in them, do a search ...
3.

Actual Results:
I can't be very sure, because I am not eager to repeat the process.
I got infected with 2 known virus/trojan, detected and stopped by F-Prot, and also got infected with 3 others that were not detected by it and got them stuck in the registry startup, had to reboot in do mode, scan with antivirus (deleted a few infections) and delete some of the file it didn't find and clean up the registry.

This win98 is fresh install, so i'm sure it wa infected just now.



I suspect either Firefox ha some security hole that these script exploited, or it could be fooled into launching, without asking, IE, which then in turn wa like swiss cheese.

Sorry I can't provide more info, but I am not eager to get infected again, and maybe be unable to contain it next time.

I'll submit the file that got onto my hdd (those that were left after the antivirus found and deleted some)
