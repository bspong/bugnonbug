When I discoverd the problem it wa about the URL http://feeds.nos.nl/nosnieuws, in de meantime it is fixed but I saved the actual RSS feed a XML file, so i could report it.

The bug is in the Live Bookmarks.

The RSS feed is attatched to this bugreport

As you can see in the pre-last item there are a few strange symbol in the discripton. These symbol cause the error.

Using a file with the XML code above regenerates the error 'Could not load feed...'

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save the errorous XML code on your local disk, or on a server
2. Add a new Live Bookmark, use the local disk file a URL, or enter the URL from the server where you saved it (use file://LOCALpath when you stored it local)
3. Try to open the just created live bookmark. It say 'Could not load feed'
Actual Results:
Instead of the item from the RSS feed it say 'Could not load feed'.

Expected Results:
Normal RSS values, a with any other live bookmark

Render the RSS feed properly
