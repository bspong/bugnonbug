Ff3 reimplements "Text Zoom" feature to behave like Opera "Page Zoom".

But the new Text Zoom - which zoom whole page - ha a serious problem: it zoom whole page.

Origin of "Text Zoom" feature lie in habit of (let's call them) web designer to set very very small font on web site they are responsible for, making them pretty much unusable. With "Text Zoom" it wa still possible to read the web site content at font size suitable for anybody's else eyes.

Newer "Page Zoom" break that. It zoom whole page what not only increase font size (and consequently length of the page) - but also increase width of the displayed page.

I have tested several suit of HTML documentation I use on daily/weekly basis and most of them become unusable because page width doesn't fit my screen anymore. In 3 out of 5, zooming doe increase page width which make document practically unreadable.

It work perfectly with Ff2.x. But in 3.x - not anymore.

Thus, an option to allow for "only text" zooming - iow "Increase Font Size" - would be very very desirable.

P.S. Unfortunately I cannot supply openly available examples. http://FT.com/ could have been an example - but they have recently started using readable fonts, so I normally need to zoom it only once (single Ctrl-+) and page width still fit my 1280x1024.

Reproducible: Always
