Using a shorthand closed anchor element (e.g., "<a href="foo" />) erroneously
slurps in later content, making the a part of the link. I found this while
trying to use generated content (using CSS) to create the link and later
content would show up a part of the link. It look like's it's generating a new
element box because if you create a :before pseudo-element in the CSS, it get
applied to the later text a well (see http://www.zanecorp.com/bug/index4.html).

Interposing another anchor element make thing act correctly. This is
demonstrated in http://www.zanecorp.com/bug/index3.html.
