recreate the "Smart Bookmarks" folder if both places.sqlite is corrupt (or missing) and bookmarks.html [1] is missing.

this part of the fix for bug #406094 wa backed out due to Ts / Txul regressions, see bug #406735

[1] note, we currently recreate places.sqlite from bookmarks.html, but we
should be using bookmarks.postplaces.html, if it exists. see bug #406114

Also note, at some point we'll be restoring backup from .json instead of .html
