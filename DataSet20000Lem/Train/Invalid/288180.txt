Firefox start up well but since I updated to V. 1.02 I cannot open this link and others
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de-DE; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050321 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de-DE; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050321 Firefox/1.0.2

Had installed V. 1.01 first. No problem opening all link from the former IE -
Favourites.
Updated to FF 1.02: Now, I cannot open any link. Even Firefox's SafeMode doe
not help. Using the IE-browser version of my DSL provider German T-Online I have
no problem accessing all URL's and Favourites
FYI:
Work on WIN 2000 Professional 9.0.6926 SP3, GERMAN version (Firefox is GER, too)
Use ADAWARE SE Build 1.05, SpyBot 1.3 (updated 2005-03-03),
ZonealarmProfessional 5.1.039.004 installed. Didn't change anything in these
programmes' setting after updating. Firefox 1.01 worked absolutely fine with these.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Type URL or select from my Favourites list
3.Firefox tab say "Loading" (site) but nothing happens

Actual Results:
What I described above.

Expected Results:
Connected me to the URL in the address line
