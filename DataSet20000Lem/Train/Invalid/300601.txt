If a page ha an empty stylesheet href (<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="" />), the current page is downloaded again, and used a a cs file.
OK, this is an error in the html file, and the href is used a a relative link
to the current location (except when it begin with http://, etc.), but an empty
string could also mean: "no cs file, please".
And if the page doe some server side functions, it could be a bad thing to load
it two times.
