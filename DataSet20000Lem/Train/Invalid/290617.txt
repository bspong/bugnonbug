(I am accessing this site using Safari)

I just installed Firefox1.0.3 on a Mac G4 Powerbook running 10.3.9
10.3.9 wa installed yesterday. Firefox 1.0.3 today.

I have been successfully using Firefox (1 -1.0.2) up until now.
However, now Firefox load to an empty page albeit one that ha the right name for the site on top. The
URL window is empty. I can't access the search panel either. I removed the localstore.rdf a suggested
in another help section and restarted Firefox. Same problem. If i use the print page command, the page
print a normal. It's just invisible on the screen. I restarted the computer altogether and Firefox then
opened okay but once quit the problem returns. No other browser is affected, just Firefox

Thanks in advance for any help.

Reproducible: Always
