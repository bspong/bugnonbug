on going to g-mail the page load partially then give me the following error:
Some Gmail feature have failed to load. If this problem persists, try reloading the page, using https, using the older version, or using basic HTML mode. Learn More.

Started with update to firefox 3.5.7

G-mail work in IE window so not a huge problem.

Reproducible: Always
