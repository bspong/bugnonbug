Gmail usually crash after I log on, it happens when the webpage try to load the chat portion of the site. I can't stop it from loading. Facebook crash when people send me a message. Youtube just crash firefox.
When I say crash, I mean that it stop responding.

Reproducible: Always




Bug occurs on any theme. I wa using a soccer theme on Personas. Other plug-in I had were skipscreen greecemonkey with a youtube auto buffer, facebook cleaner (removes ad etc), I also used site launcher. This started pretty randomly.
