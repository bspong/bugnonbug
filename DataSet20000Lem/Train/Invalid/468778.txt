I have started using mobile broadband so image first come in low quality, which can all be improved by pressing SHIFT+A - however, rollover image from the background of the web page do not increase in quality to a higher resolution so roll-over button or image-swap set-ups look really ugly .... is there any way to force highest quality in these pre-loading images?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use mobile broadband
2. Use SHIFT+A to improve image quality
3. Roll your mouse over any dynamic jpg image; like a roll-over button or an image swap map
Actual Results:
Underlying image remain very low quality

Expected Results:
Ideally, one would hope that on SHIFT+A all image associated with the page would be increased to high quality not just those being shown ....

I searched a many bug report a I could in various forum - a lot of people have this problem but I could find no offer of a fix - the whole mobile broadband/SHIFT+A (all shown images) or SHIFT+R (a single image) issue is annoying but understandable, however maybe a SHIFT+[some other letter] need to be created that ups the quality of underlying image .... ??
