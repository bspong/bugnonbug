Some GIF image retrieved, but not displayed
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox retrieves the image above, but display nothing.
Same behaviour in Firefox nightly 20050117.
Mozilla suite nightly 20050117 doe not display this behaviour.
If image is retrieved with wget and loaded in Firefox via a file:// URL, it is
displayed properly.

No ad-blocking proxy in use, no "load image for the originating website only"
option in use. I have sniffed the wire and verified Firefox is actually
retrieving the image data from the server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Paste "http://www.rabbit.org/graphics/banners/top.gif" into address bar.
2. Hit <enter>.
3. Watch lack of image after load complete.
4. Retrieve image with wget, save to disk.
5. Drag saved image to browser window.
6. Watch it be displayed properly.
Actual Results:
GIF image failed to render when loaded from HTTP URL.

Expected Results:
Image should render identically from HTTP URL a from file:// URL.

Some other image on the same website display the same problem:
http://www.rabbit.org/graphics/banners/hrs-info-l.gif
http://www.rabbit.org/graphics/banners/top.gif
http://www.rabbit.org/graphics/banners/hrs-info-r.gif
http://www.rabbit.org/graphics/banners/bottom.gif

However, other, similar graphic on the same site work fine:
http://www.rabbit.org/graphics/logo-footer.gif
http://www.rabbit.org/graphics/homepage/right.gif

I have not determined what factor influence whether Firefox will render a given
image or not.
