Hello, if I go to the site named above and want to just search for some term
from the small box, Bugzilla says: "Invalid Bug ID

'search term' is not a valid bug number nor an alias to a bug number. If you are
trying to use QuickSearch, you need to enable JavaScript in your browser."

I find this quite stupid a I already do have JavaScript enabled, and no
site-specific block installed. Also, when I go to the extended search
page and query from there, I get the big "Please stand by..." in the
middle of the canvas which is also JavaScript driven. Since it work
with FF 1.0.2, I assume that somebody "tuned" the JS detection code to
especially piss of user of the suite (it worked for a long time, until
it broke a few week ago).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org using a Mozilla suite browser
2. enter a few word in the search box above the picture of the ant or bug
3. hit 'enter'

Actual Results:
I get this error message shown above.

Expected Results:
I expect to get a list of bug shown, or a page saying "nothing found".

This problem ha also hit me on other site which use Bugzilla. A patch for all
user should be published.
