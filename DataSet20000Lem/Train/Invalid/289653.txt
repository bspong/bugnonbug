Error Code -8101 and IDEA say Mozilla doesn't support manual SSL and Verisign
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Can't get the page to open, and ended up using MS Internet Explorer. Here is
the last exchange with IDEA's tech folks:
