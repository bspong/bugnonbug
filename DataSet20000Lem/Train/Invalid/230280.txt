in dual/secondary/multi monitor configuration with secondary monitor on top of
primary, a firebird window in the top monitor exhibit extremely strange
behaviour - clicking in a non-action area (ie non-hyperlink) of a loaded web
page in approximatelly the upper and middle half of firebird will sometimes
(~20%) cause firebird to scroll-down (just le than that of a pagedown) and
select text from where the cursor wa clicked to the bottom of the current
viewport, same horizontal position a the cursor

this only occurs when the entire firebird window is in the top screen. moving
same instance of firebird entirely to the lower screen prevents this behaviour

i run a dual head configuration with xinerama (xdpyinfo report a single screen
of resolution 1600x2400, but it is 2 x 1600x1200 verticallly aligned)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.move firebird to top screen
2.click in approximatelly the upper middle area of the viewport
3.might not happen the first time but keep clicking around
4.not perfectly reproduceable (clicking in the exact same spot might not cause it)

Actual Results:
viewport scrolled down and selected text

Expected Results:
nothing except obtained window focus
