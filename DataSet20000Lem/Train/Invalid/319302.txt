Hi, I downloaded 1.5 recently and everything wa fine until yesterday. out of the blue while surfing the web I noticed the scroll bar wa missing and all the web page looked like they shifted to the right, and would continue off the browser without a left/right scroll button on the bottom. I switched monitors, redownloaded and installed 1.5 and still the same problem. clicking on the top right minimize/enlarge button doe nothing. netscape and ie both are fine.

Reproducible: Always

1.everytime i open firefox it is messed up
