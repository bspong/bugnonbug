Firefox Opens but is not accessible

I had Firefox 1.0.4 installed, and whenever I would open mozilla from an
external link, no page would load and the application would be in basic freeze.
I could still use the Minimize/Maximize/Exit button on the top right, but the
toolbars are inaccessible, and the page area is blank. I tried reinstalling
1.0.3, and then uninstalling and installing 1.0.4, it doesn't work for this
either. I can (usually) open it from a shortcut, though even that doesn't always
work. However, using "-safe mode" doe always work to at least get the browser
open. Once it open and works, I have no problem navigating around.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use link from other source (eg; messenger program MSN/GAIM/AIM/ICQ)
2.Mozilla Opens Incorrectly and remains inaccessible




Expected Results:
Opened normally
