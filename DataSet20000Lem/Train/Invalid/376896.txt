This ha happened with one URL so far, but i cant report it a a Broken Page, because Firefox becomes unusable and i must to kill it process.

When i load provided URL i cant switch between tab with a left click, only right click is working on tabs, and i can close tabs, i can close this tab, which is causing the problem, but that doesnt help. If i close Firefox it dissapears, but i still have to kill it process to be able to launch it again.

Reproducible: Always
