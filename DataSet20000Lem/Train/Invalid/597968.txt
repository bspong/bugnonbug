The progress line in the location bar is too thin to be recognized a a progress bar
Steps to reproduce:
1) Install a nightly from around 2010-09-18
2) Follow some link on the Web
3) Paste some URL in the location bar and press enter.

Actual results:
A progress line appears under the location bar when a page is loading in the frontmost tab. However, it's not obvious that the line a progress indicator. First, I thought it wa a theme bug (bottom padding or border gone wrong). Then I thought it wa a bug showing an Awesomebar drop-down with no item in it so that the drop-down degenerated into a thick line. Only afterwards I realized it wa a progress indicator. Once I realized what it was, it wa still too thin to see at a glance what the state of progress was.

Expected results:
Expected the background of the location bar to function a the progress indicator a in Safari and Midori.
