click on an (computer) auction, click on enlarge image (upper left) zoom this new popup window with STRG+Scrollwheel (where the image is), now the background window (the auction itself witch is in background) will be zoomed in the save zoom-level a the popup window.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See "details".


Expected Results:
I think the auction-window (background window) should not be zoomed, this is a bad side effect!

No special cosmetic firefox-changes!
