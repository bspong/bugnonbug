onDeleteURI event constantly firing

I am an extension developer, and the extension observes the onDeleteURI event. In the newest version of firefox, if I just run firefox and leave it idle, after a while, it keep sending and re-sending... say every 500-2000 miliseconds the same onDeleteURI event (for a page I don't even have open). Other than the fact that I don't need to _do_ anything to make it fire, I'm still trying to hunt down anything else about the bug, so at the moment I don't know if it's mac specific or if it's related to any other add-on I have installed, but none of the addons I use should be deleting anything from the place system. I uninstalled about a third of my addons so far and the bug keep firing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run firefox with many tab open
2. Have javascript installed that will run "alert" or "dump" whenever an onDeleteURI event come from the place system
3. wait
Actual Results:
event come repeatedly

Expected Results:
nothing should be happening
