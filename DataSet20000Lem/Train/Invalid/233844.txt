bookmark - when a page get updated and the schedule see that it show me a
dialog in which there are 2 buttons: OK and Cancel.
OK - works.
Cancel - doe the same a the OK... that mean open the page in a new window.

Hint... a checkbox will be good asking if to open the page in a new tab... (!??)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. do some bookmark
2. wait for the page to get updated (.html files... example:
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/updates/1/SRPMS/
3. when the dialog appears hit cancel for NOT opening the page.

Actual Results:
behaves like OK button and the page opens.

Expected Results:
NOT open the window

this behaviour it wa long before, but I didn't payed too much attention a most
of the time I hit the OK button.
