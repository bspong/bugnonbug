This is a severe problem for us, and could prevent our company from being able
to use our product in MAC enviroments (being that Firefox is the best browser
available for MACs, and other browser had more serious issues).

This is an issue with the Crystal Viewer and i-net's software, we only use their
software to enhance our own. We are also trying to work with the developer at
i-net to identify where the problem is.
