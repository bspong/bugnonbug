If I click on a picture it doe not show the pic I clicked on but it show
another picture (always the same picture).
I tested it with IE6 and it worked, so I think it's not a bug of the website.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://alfa-forum.com/showthread.php?t=30744&page=2
2. click e.g. @ the link "Galeriebilder von pedi" from the user "Pedi" (under
the signature)
3. the link lead to the site posted above.
4. then just click on a picture


Actual Results:
Another picture is displayed and not the one I clicked on

Expected Results:
the specific pic on which I clicked on should be displayed
