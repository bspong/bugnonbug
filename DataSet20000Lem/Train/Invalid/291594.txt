It's REALLY weird. Basically if I hit "Clear All" in the Privacy tab, then
click the power button [not shutting down properly], all of the cleared data
returns.

I suppose you could group this into the same category a the data that is lost
on a bad shutdown, but in this case, it come back :P

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools > Preferences > Privacy, and click Clear All
2. Hit your power button [bad shutdown]
3. On restart, check your privacy -- all information will still be there

Actual Results:
All of my information wa still there.

Expected Results:
It should have been gone, _forever_.
