The structure of the table wa confused later that I placed the table in the style display:none and the style of the table display:inline with the Javascript.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
<style type="text/css">
<!--
.s18{border:2px outset # 000000;width:150px;height:120px; }
.s17{display:none; }
-->
</style>

1. To make a table in the HTML with any content inside of it.

2. To place CSS .s18 and .s17 in the table
it twirl the command Javascript >
document.getElementById("TABLE").style.display="inline";

3. It place .s18 of the CSS in the Tag <td> of the table and it only place .s17 in the table.
it twirl the command Javascript >
document.getElementById("TABLE").style.display="inline";
Actual Results:
In procedure 2 the result is of a table with missed dimensions, different of the CSS .s18 and with the content that wa in the table of the side of it are or partially it are.

In procedure 3 the result is finally the waited one.

Expected Results:
The result would have the same to be in the two procedures, the table would have to leave in the dimension placed in the CSS .s18.

To tell an error with a translator of text is VERY difficult! How much to bug, I took 30 minute more than to deduce this problem, HORRIBLE for programmers!
