Having your history set to be remembered for 136678387 day or higher cause the browser to clear the history. Having it set to 136678386 day or lower doe not cause this issue.

Every time you restart the browser the history will be cleared, history is only held onto durring the session.

Tested with the 1.5.0.1 en-US release, reproduciable everytime.
