Can't disable "domain guessing" when proxy is enabled

I can't seem to disable the "domain guessing" feature in Firefox. In about:config, I've set "browser.fixup.alternate.enabled" to false, and "keyword.enabled" is also false. Yet typing "blah" in the address bar still directs me to "www.blah.com", rather than just giving me an error (which is what I want).

However, if I disable my proxy, the setting seem to be respected, and "blah" give me the appropriate error. So it seems a though using a proxy somehow negates the "browser.fixup.alternate.enabled" setting.

I've tried this in 2.0.0.6, 2.0.0.12, and 3.0b3 (all on Linux), all with the same results.

Reproducible: Always
