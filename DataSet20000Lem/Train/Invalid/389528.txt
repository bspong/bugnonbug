Lost Bookmarks and some setting after upgarding NoScript to 1.1.6.06 on Firefox 2.0.0.5
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: SP2

When I opened Firefox (2.0.0.5) I got a prompt to upgrade NoScript to 1.1.6.06. Allowed this upgrade and restarted Firefox a requested/prompted. On restart a number of thing have changed.
1. The Bookmark tool bar is empty, and doe not allow me to re-add links.
2. Using a bookmark from the dropdown doe nothing. I had to add the bookmark icon from the options, click on it (opens a sidebar with the bookmark on it) and use these entries.
3. Because I can't use the bookmark toolbar I un-checked it, and promptly lost all my bookmarks.

I then deleted and removed Firefox and Noscript, did a re-install at 2.0.0.3, but got the same results.
Tried a download of 2.0.0.5 from the website and installed, but still the same.
Firefox is now a useable a IE, so don't know what to use (although latest IE look better)

Questions are :-
a) How can I get the personalised toolbar back for bookmark ?
b) Why are the bookmark listed on the dropdown menu not working ?
c) Why doe NoScript always cause these type of issue when it is upgraded (happened last upgrade, but I managed to recover OK)
