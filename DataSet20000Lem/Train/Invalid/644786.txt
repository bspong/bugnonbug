Firefox icon is removed from all shortcut and EXE when desktop shortcut is deleted
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I don't think this is a Windows 7 issue, but it might be...on Win7 x64 with Firefox 4.0 installed, right after I delete the desktop shortcut that is automatically created during install, the Firefox icon disappears from everything (Start menu, the EXE in Program Files(x86), taskbar, etc.) If I restore the trashed desktop shortcut, the icon come back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 4 on Windows 7 x64 SP0
2. Delete the desktop shortcut
3. Launch/close Firefox (possibly a few times)
Actual Results:
Eventually you should see that the icon disappears

Expected Results:
The icon should remain linked to all shortcut for the program.
