There are three div tag in the #main div. In the linked page. Each one contains
an h3 followed by a paragraph.

The following rule is only applied to the first paragraph, for no apparent reason.
#main h3 + p{margin-top: -60px;}

This doesn't happen in Opera nor IE6 + Dean Edwards IE7 0.9 (although there are
other nasty rendering bug in IE)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Load the linked page, the bug is exhibited immediately.

Actual Results:
The paragraph of the first div is the only one to get the -60px margin

Expected Results:
All paragrapphs should get the negative margin, since they all follow an h3 tag.
