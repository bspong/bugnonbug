User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)

When I right-clock on a link and try to Open In New Window, nothing happens, no new window opens. This problem started after the latest update (it wa not present in the previous version). Open In New Tab appears to work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to a website with link (e.g. Yahoo.com)
3. Right click on any link and select Open In New Window

Actual Results:
No new window appears

Expected Results:
A new Firefox window should appear displaying the linked page

Using default everything (theme and whatever). I will try to revert to previous version or else use IE until this bug is fixed.
