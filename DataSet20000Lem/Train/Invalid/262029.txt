I am receiving frequent error message to the effect that..."fash plug-in performed an illegal operation, it is highly recommended that you restart navigator."

I have read the knowledge base about this particular problem, and wa unable to
find a "fix" that related to my particular problem. After some experimentation
I wa able to determine that the problem wa d/t NPPGWrap.dll (the Microsoft
ActiveX Portability Container)and/or MsnChat45.ocx which I had installed to
enable me to chat, via Firefox, in the MSN groups. The problem wa the result
of one or the other or the combination of the two. The problem wa quickly
resolved by deleting these, only to return if reinstalled. The component
themselves worked ideally for chat, however, quite seemingly, caused this
"secondary" problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit MSN group
2.d/l and install NPPGWrap.dll
3.Return to MSN Groups and "run and install" MsnChat45.ocx

Actual Results:
I will begin to get the above "flash plug-in error message" several time a day
when visiting my homepage, http://www.rr.com/flash/index.cfm (I seldom visit
other flash sites). I normally receive the initial error message very shortly
after I install these plug-ins. I had never had a problem w/ these error prior
to installing the above mentioned plug-ins, which were also the last one I
installed.

Expected Results:
Ideally, I would like to be able to install these without receiving persistent
errors, and the need to restart Firefox on each occurrence. However, I wa very
happy to have resolved the problem, and thought I'd post so that this issue
might be known.
