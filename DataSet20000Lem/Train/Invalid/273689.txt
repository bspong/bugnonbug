User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox 1.0 (and Mozilla 1.7.3) cannot handle stylesheet selector that are
numeric. Opera and IE do not have this problem. And forgive me if I am wrong,
but I don't think the W3C CSS spec state that numeric selector should not be used.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a page style with a numeric stylesheet selector
2.view the page in firefox

Actual Results:
style with numeric selector are ignored.

Expected Results:
style with numeric selector should display
