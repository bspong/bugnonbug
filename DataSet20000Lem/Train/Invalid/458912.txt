Customize Google ha usually worked well for me. But since I upgraded to Windows XP professional, it doesn't work like it should. If I enter any word in the Google search box, none of the usual multiple choice appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Type letter into search box
3.Get frustrated because no choice appear
Actual Results:
No multiple choice

Expected Results:
Multiple choice should have appeared

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Customize Google, but same result.
