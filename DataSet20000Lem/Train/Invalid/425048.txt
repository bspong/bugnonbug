Open a find and search for a string that there is more than one occurrence of on the page. Hit Alt-N to take you to the next string and nothing happens. Click on the next button using the mouse and you're taken to the next string.

This broke in either the late beta 4 or early beta 5 days.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to a page
2.Hit Ctrl-F to start a find
3.Enter some string that there are multiple occurrence of on the page
4.Hit Alt-N to try to go to the next occurrence
5.Watch nothing happen.
