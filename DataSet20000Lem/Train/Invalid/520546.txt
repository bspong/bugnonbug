Don't know if this particular problem ha been reported or not, since there are a lot of memory leak bug listed and I don't have time to sort through them. Since this problem ha existing on this computer since v3.0.x and is still seen in 3.5.3, it appears to be an open bug or not reported. If it is a duplicate, please disregard.

Issue: When FF is first opened, it ha anywhere from 8-10 saved tab that it opens, and consumes about 88MB of ram according to task manager. After a week or so of usage, with FF remaining resident (I just leave it open), this value climb up to a much a 800MB, with about the same amount of open tabs. System becomes sluggish due to paging, so I exit out of FF and start over. Once in a while, FF remains in task manager after it ha been closed until I select it and use End Process.

I don't know if this happens on other computer or not - haven't tried. This computer ha 2GB of ram and a lot of stuff running at all time (multiple desktops, Outlook, Opera, syslog, two RDP session and a VNC session or two, with MySQL in the background.

Reproducible: Always

2. leave FF resident (do not close)
3. monitor RAM usage
Actual Results:
Memory usage gradually climb until the machine becomes sluggish.
