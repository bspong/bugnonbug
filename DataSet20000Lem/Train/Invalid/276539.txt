Bookmark Mismanagement
Something just went on the fritz...I cannot manage bookmark at all!! The
Separators don't stay where you put them, and if you move a bookmark to another
area of the list, it reshuffle everything. This ha never happened I wonder
if I just reboot, will the world be sane once again?!?!

Help!!

Thanks, and Happy New One!
