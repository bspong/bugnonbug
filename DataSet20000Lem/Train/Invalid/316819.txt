start and crash widthout warning or error
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0; FDM)
Build Identifier: all

I've installed Win. 2000 Prof., and Firefox... every thing worked fine.

I tried to download a NTFS file on a FAT partition (c:\) and when it wa downloaded and opened the system blocked (I didn't know the that the file wa only for NTFS - we are talking about the Services For Unix 3.5 archive) I figured that is because on this file, deleted it from dwonload folder... Now the Firefox crash after start of the program (freezes up to be more specific)

I guess it is because of the download link in the downlod window of the Firefox. I tried uninstall, reinstall of version 1.0PR, 1.0.7 Stable, 1.5PR and it happens the same. I even deleted the Mozilla key form registers...

Please help for I hate IE!

Reproducible: Always
