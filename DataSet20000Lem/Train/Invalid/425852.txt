1passwd Integration: Firefox must ask for permission for each keychain item.

SecurityAgent asking for permission to access a keychain item

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9pre) Gecko/2008032704 Minefield/3.0pre

Not bug 106400, but resolving it will possibly fix this a well.

In Camino, 1passwd asks for the password to access the keychain once. Then every 60 minute when access time out. However, every use extends the 60 minutes.

In Firefox (Minefield), every request of the keychain (for a previously unused login item, per login per domain) produce a dialog box:

-----
Minefield want to use your confidential information stored in "example.com" in your keychain.

The authenticity of "Minefield" canot be verified. Do you want to allow access to this item?

v Details
Keychain: 1Password.keychain
Application: Minefield

[Always Allow] [Deny] [Allow]
-----

This is annoying.
