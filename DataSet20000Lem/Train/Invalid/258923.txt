New layout design in Firefox 1.0RC not user-centric

Just checked out the 1.0RC and noticed the design is not a user-centric or slim
a 0.9. I consider problem area a Web Search command under Tools menu a well
a the Mail tie-in to thunderbird (Many people may not have, and it's
annoying). Also, if I have a FF 0.9 open and try and run 1.0RC (double click
'FF1.0RC' .exe, 0.9 open instead.

On the plus side, extension update checking seems more stable and the browser
seems to be at a good point (other than above) to release FF a 1.0 (meaningful
only to non-techies I spose)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:
Remove the offending entry from the crowded tool menu, they aren't applicable
to everyone and I don't think another websearch feature is necessary. FF wa
originally built for speed and responsiveness.
