about:neterr and javascript url
couldn't make an exploit from this, so it may be invalid.

it is possible to invoke "about:neterr" chrome when location is
"javascript:", which potentially may be misused probably if it is possible
to inject in the chrome document.

done via:
<a href="javascript:alert('got called');;var a=new Error();a.toString=function() {return {toString: 'Components.classes'}};a;">click1</a>

'click2' in the test kill the context menu in neterr chrome after clicking on
'try again'.
