I have only been attempting to create webpage for a month now, but I have
recently been alerted to the fact that my webpage doe not render properly when
surfer are using Firefox. There doesn't seem to be any problem for folk using
Explorer. Could you please tell me what I'm doing wrong or if there is a patch
that I can put in the HTML code to make Firefox recognize the css?
