To open a link from the sidebar in a new tab (for example from a link-list you
bookmarked to open in sidebar), you can drag it onto the tab-bar. If the tab-bar
is full, you can drag it onto the close-tab-button.
Dragging a link from a normal tab to the close-button creates one tab (as
expected), while dragging a link from the sidebar onto the tab-close-button (not
sidebar-close-button) creates two!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla Firebird
2. Create a bookmark, for example to "http://mozilla.org", and check
the box titled "Load this Bookmark in the sidebar" in the bookmark prefs.
3. Open the bookmarked page in sidebar by activating the bookmark.
4. Open another tab in the main window or uncheck the "Hide tab-bar when
only one web-page is open" preference to show the tab-bar.
5. Drag any link (for example "Make a Donation") onto the tab-close-button
which resides in the upper right corner of the tab-bar.

Actual Results:
Two tab spawn, each loading the url of the link that wa dragged.

Expected Results:
Firebird should spawn only one tab to open the link.

I found this bug using Mac OS 10.3.2,
I could not reproduce it running 2004-01-16 on Windows XP
