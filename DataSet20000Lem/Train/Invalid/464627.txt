I hit some weird key combination, and it set firefox a my background. I can't get rid of it now!

So I wa looking up a spoof of "Hey there (rhymes with delilah)" (don't know if i can say it on here...), and I thought it would be on this one website, I've been to this adult-film website before... so it's not like they put a virus on my computer... then i hit ctrl enter (to open in a nother tab in firefox) and accidently hit some other random key on my keyboard at the same time.

then BAM. hardcore porn, on my desktop. A screenshot of firefox is now placed there. I closed out of firefox, and that site is still there. Then I noticed that if I would change something, like sscroll down or open a new tab or highlight something etc., the change would reflectt on my desktop.

Titlebar still say youporn though.

Thanks
