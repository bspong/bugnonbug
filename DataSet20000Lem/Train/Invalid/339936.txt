we are developing this site. it worked on both IE6 and Firefox. When we uploaded it, we set it in a sub folder a is visible in the link. now the site work fine in IE6 in this new place. But when we view the site in Firefox, the image don't appear and the link also give an error of file not found. In the code, we are using "../otherfolder" type link for image and simple link for the paths. I have been unable to test it in linux or Mozilla. Please advise.
