Hello,

first of all: I am sorry that I can only present you a picture of the bug(?).
As you can see on the picture there is a table in the middle which is divided
into 3 TD (HTML-Table-Element) parts. All of them got a left, right and bottom
border. The bottom and the right border are black, but the left border is
grey. And that's the problem. I define the borders' color with:
<td valign="top" style="border-left:1px outset #000000; border-right:1px outset
#000000; border-bottom:1px outset #000000;"> !
You can see i exactly tell the browser by border-left:1px outset #000000; to
display it in black color but it doesnt.
Maybe I am a bad coder, and the syntax is wrong, but other browser e.g.
Konqueror are displaying it the right way.

Kind regard and greeting from germany,
Christopher Speer
