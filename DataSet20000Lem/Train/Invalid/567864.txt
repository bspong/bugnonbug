not able to login using Estonian ID-card
Using Estonian ID-card (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_ID_card) I can login into bank, but on some page FF3.7+ show this kind of error:

1. Load https://www.krediidiinfo.ee/index.php?okood=
2. Press "Sisene ID-kaardiga"
3. Get:

Secure Connection Failed

An error occurred during a connection to www.krediidiinfo.ee.

Renegotiation is not allowed on this SSL socket.

(Error code: ssl_error_renegotiation_not_allowed)


Using FF3.6.3 is just fine on the same computer. And 3.7a4, a5pre doe not work.
