Sometimes, some <p> and <a> tag seem to be stripped from the page http://experts.about.com/e/x/x/X86_assembly_programming_in_real_mode.htm when loaded in the browser from internet.

The problem is clearly checkable in the DOM inspector. In the case of the mentioned URL, when the problem occurs, the layout of the page is also affected by automatic carriage return to avoid an horizontal scrollbar (no carriage return and an horizontal scrollbar is added in IE), and the lack of interpretation of some embedded <a> links.

However, the View-source always display the missing <p> tags.

Haven't encoutered the problem on any other site, neither when the mentioned faulting page wa saved and loaded from a local drive.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit the page at http://experts.about.com/e/x/x/X86_assembly_programming_in_real_mode.htm (the bug is easier to check within the DOM inspector)
2.Check if some <p> or <a> have been stripped from the actual document structure
3.If not, reload the page until encountering the problem
