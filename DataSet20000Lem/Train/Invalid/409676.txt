Although there is no "Sort by [...]" menu option for "Tags", "Location", "Visit Date", "Visit Count", "Keyword", "Description", "Added", or "Last Modified", clicking on those column or using the "Views" toolbar button doe not change the order in which the bookmark are displayed after the "Places Organizer" ha been closed.

I believe this to be a major bug because some user (such a myself) do not use the "Places Organizer" exclusively when navigating to their bookmarks. I typically use the "Bookmarks Toolbar" (and occasionally the "Bookmarks" menu) to navigate to my bookmarks. Having my bookmark already sorted by name when going through the menu and folder make finding thing __much__ easier.
