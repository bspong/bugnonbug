Styles of external css-File ignored in a W3C-valid web-site
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Opera 7.54 [de]
Build Identifier:

On this Page "http://vcity-c825.uibk.ac.at/staedtebau2/forschung/24h/001_.html"
the Styles defined in "http://vcity-c825.uibk.ac.at/staedtebau2/forschung/24h/
images/style.css" are ignored.
The Page IS W3C-valid.

I found the same Problem with Netscape 7.1.
There wa no Problem with MSIE6 and Opera 7.54

There wa also no Problem if I've used an Apache-Server from which the Site wa
loaded. There WAS a problem with SAMBAR-Server, and i've heared that it's the
same Problem with IIS-Server too.

In the Browser-Cache I saw that the Styles were loaded.

I've removed the DOCTYPE-Declaration like you see in "http://vcity-c825.uibk.ac.
at/staedtebau2/forschung/24h/001.html" to solve the Problem.


Reproducible: Always
