Firefox not supporting W3C's CSS1 recommendation for formatting
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I use percentage to define the size of font and table widths, a recommended
by the W3C to be compatible with increased font size in browser window (for
those who require larger font-sizes to read web pages).

However, Firefox is not supporting this. Such definition in my style seem to
be ignored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View above web-page in Firefox
2. View above web-page in IE
3. Look at page source styles.

Actual Results:
same problem, even with current build and nightlies

Expected Results:
certain font should be smaller than the surrounding fonts.
Tables column should be equal.
