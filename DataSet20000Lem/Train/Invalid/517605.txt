I want to talk about a problem I'm having a I type this bug. While loading Firefox, it seems like Windows chop off memory to the program, making it take eon to start up. When it finally load (around 25 MB in memory, checked in Task Manager) it take a pair of minute to become responsive again. Sometimes, while navigating, typing, downloading, switching tabs, or scrolling (that is, while doing anything you'd do with a browser), Firefox get stuck with no reason whatsoever - sometimes 30 seconds, some others 5 minute or more. Often the computer will show an alert telling that virtual memory is too low. Other times, script in website will be stopped by Firefox, or the user will be asked if it want to stop the script - to worsen thing up, when it does, it switch automatically to the problem tab, and switching tab take forever to start with. Biggest offender are YouTube videos, and any website with Flash. My computer ha 256 MB of RAM and Windows XP; that can be the reason for it, but I'm unsure since it work completely well sometimes. Sometimes it will happen with only Firefox (with only one tab open), the Firefox Preloader, and the antivirus (Avast Home) loaded - again, when it get stuck, "memory chops" are to blame. Any ideas?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox in a computer with 256 MB of RAM and Windows XP Pro. Also install Firefox Preloader, just in case.
2. Start up Firefox like you would usually do.
3. Browse the Internet like you would usually do.
Actual Results:
Sometimes, the computer will behave like usual. Other times, Firefox (and sometimes all other programs!) will begin to get stuck for long period of time, work again, and get stuck cyclicly.

Expected Results:
Firefox should run smoothly at all time - not get stuck for minute in a row. It's basic usability.
