With enough tab open for scrolling to be required, scrolling is animated even when the the browser.tabs.animate preference is set to false.

Strangely enough, animation doe not happen for the very first scroll, i.e. when you add the tab that cause scrolling to be needed. Adding more tab or switching cycling through tab will be animated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.tabs.animate to false in about:config
2. Keep opening tab until scrolling is needed (and observe tab opening a new tab is thankfully not animated)
3. Open another tab
Actual Results:
Existing tab scroll to the left, with animation

Expected Results:
Existing tab jump to the left
