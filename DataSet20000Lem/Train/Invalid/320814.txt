I have been trying for sometime to get Firefox 1.5 to accept the mouse gesture by StrokeIt to work in this browser. There are various work arounds in the forum but none of them cure the problem. For now I have reverted to 1.07 until maybe the issue is cured. It work correctly in this version.

Regards
