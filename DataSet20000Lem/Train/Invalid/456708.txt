The password manager doesn't ask to save password. I checked and there is no exception for that site.

More, also another site ha similar problem:

https://cbasic.eni.it/up-cns/LoginUp-Consumer.jsp?TARGET2=https://www.eni.it/it_IT/reserved/home-shadow.page

In both cases, I can't check if the password manager fill in username and password detail properly, because it doesn't store them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. simply try to access with a casual login and password, password manager should ask to save them.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
"Save password?" popup doesn't show.

Expected Results:
As usual, I sould choose to save the password for that URL.
