When I have Firebug 1.6 installed in Firefox 3.6, when editing a rich-text field, such a when composing a new message in Gmail, I cannot use the standard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+cursor key to select whole word at a time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.6
2. Install Firebug 1.6
3. Navigate to a rich-text field, for example composing a new message in GMail
4. Type some words, and attempt to select a whole word at a time using Ctrl+Shift+Left or Right.
Actual Results:
Nothing happened when I tried to select a whole word.

Expected Results:
The text cursor should highlight all character from it original position in the text to the end of the word.

Using Shift+<cursor key> to select one character at a time worked fine. Using Ctrl+cursor to skip the text cursor a whole word along or back worked fine. Also, when I reverted to Firebug 1.5.4 this bug did not occur, so it's specifically a problem with Firebug 1.6.
