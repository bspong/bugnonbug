Microformat-Do not allow parsing of script inside a microformat tag
Created attachment 294097
testcase

I've looked around a bit, and I don't see anything addressing this. However, it seems like something that we should not allow.

However, since Microformats are merely extra us for the span tag, perhaps this is not necessary and is an invalid bug.

Either way, I thought I'd file it for discussion.

= Steps to Reproduce =
1. Browse to the attached testcase
2. View the alert

= Expected Results =
Semantically speaking, the hCard should not allow a script to be used for the given name of a contact. So, this script should not be executed

= Actual Results =
The alert fire just a it would from a standard (non-microformat) span tag.
