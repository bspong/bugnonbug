If Firefox is left up (ie not closed first) when the machine suspends (to RAM) on Windows Vista Home Premium SP1(32 bit), after a period of time in suspend, spontaneously restarts. When Vista come back up it report having 'recovered from a serious error'. The session restore work fine and the page restore to where they were. I do not have an exact amount of time a to how long it take before it cause the machine to crash but it is approximately 30-60 minutes. The machine suspends without problem when Firefox is closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up Firefox.
2. Place the machine in suspend.
3. Wait 30-60 minutes.
Actual Results:
The machine crash while suspended.

Expected Results:
It should not be crashing.

This problem is not new in RC2, but ha been around since at least Beta 5. However, I did not trace down the exact cause (believing it to be general Vista instability) until last week.
