Steps to reproduce:

When browsing to https://bugs.mageia.org, the HTTPS certificate is refused. The certificate display window bear an uninformative message : "Could not verify the certificate for unknown reasons". This is totally unhelpful and doesn't let me make an informed decision about this certificate.

Expected results:

Explanation of the actual error/failure when verifying the certificate.
