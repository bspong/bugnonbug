Feedview: store default stylesheet URL in externalCSS preference
Currently we compose style from the default stylesheet and a user-supplied one,
if any. This mean user who want to create a completely new look for feed
have to override all rule in the default stylesheet, while user who just want
to modify a subset of the look have to provide only the relevant rules.

We could instead store the default stylesheet value in the preference so we use
either the default stylesheet or a user-supplied one. Then complete new looker
wouldn't have to override all rule in the default, merely provide their own;
and subsetters would have to copy the default stylesheet rule into their
stylesheet.

The latter approach is better, since it involves no complex analysis of existing
rules. The worst case is a file copy or cut and paste, whereas the worst case
for the current approach is carefully parsing the default stylesheet to
determine what every rule doe and whether/how to override it, plus debugging
problem by examining the interaction of your rule and the default ones.

We should adopt the latter approach. As a side-effect, it fix bug 303049.
