This bug ha seemingly presented itself with subtle variation on numerous occasions, but happens probably le than 10% of the time. Probability of occurrence seems to increase when opening/running firefox after the system ha been running for longer period of time, that is to say, the bug is more likely to occur if firefox isn't started a soon a I boot up.

On opening/running firefox (a completely new instance, no other instance running) firefox window opens, toolbar is drawn, tab are opened, but before my two home page even begin to render, my whole computer freezes/hangs, with no input available (the mouse doesn't even respond). Most of the time the computer remains in this state with the HDD led fully lit/blinking super fast. However on other occasion window present with the BSOD and print some memory dump information.

Eg.
STOP: 0x0000009c (0x00000004, 0x8054d5f0, 0xb2000000, 0x00070f0f)

Then I must restart
