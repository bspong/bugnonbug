Have been using firefox successfully for some time. Yesterday I wa informed that an automatic update wa ready and I accepted it. From then on, firefox would not work at all. the screen came up, but not the (Google) start page. A message at the bottom said it wa looking....

I tried to uninstall Firefox through the Control Panel, with a view to reinstalling it subsequently, but I wa informed repeatedly that it wa already "running", even though no icon appeared at the bottom of the screen, since I had, in fact, turned it off. It wa suggested I delete it through Task Manager. I found five instance of it on Task Manager, none of which responded to my repeated effort to delete them. I am stumped!

Reproducible: Always
