web page Time out, using AOL
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; AOL 9.0; Windows NT 5.1; FunWebProducts; iebar; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

I searched Bugzilla and I couldn't find anything close enough to this. I have a
Windows XP AMD Athalon 64? processor. I had problem with IE using Earthlink in
the past where page refused to load, so I switched to AOL Dial-up. I
downloaded Firefox on www.downloads.com. For some strange reason, the only page
that will load on Firefox is http://thesims2.ea.com. any other page (even
http://start.mozilla.org!) say that the operation timed out when attempting to
contact (e.g. http://start.mozilla.org) I don't know if this is a bug or not,
but some feedback will be greatly apperiated

Reproducible: Always




bug still occurs with the Defalt theme.
