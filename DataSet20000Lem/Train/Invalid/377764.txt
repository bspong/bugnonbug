Text cursor is present on all webpage a if my ffox wa a readonly text editor.
It is good for selecting text without mouse usage, bot sometimes disturbs me.
e.g.: cursor key do not scroll the page immediately a I press any of them,
but only when cursor would go off the screen, and then the viewport follows the cursor.
Browsers always scrolled the content immediately a I pressed a cursor key.
I would appreciate if I could switch between the old and the new scrolling style.
A good choice would be for it to depend on the state of Scroll lock switch.
-> See how MS Excel scroll content by cursor key when Scroll lock is turned on and off.
Thanks!
