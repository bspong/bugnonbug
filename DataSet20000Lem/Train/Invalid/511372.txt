firefox crash during dongle check when our internal reporting module is accessed
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.2

This used to work correctly right up to Firefox 3.5.1

The module read a HASP4 USB dongle (http://www.aladdin.com) via a Java applet. This dongle is used for two-factor authentication in our reporting module.

Once 3.5.2 is loaded, Firefox crash without any error message on clicking the login button. This also affect all other browser loaded in the same system. Due to this, I wa confused a to whether this wa a bug in Firefox or in Windows. However, after several system restores this is confirmed to happen only when 3.5.2 is loaded.

On Chrome, aside from the browser crashing, a Windows "Data Execution Prevention Error" is shown on the screen. Adding Firefox and java to the list of excluded program did not help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update Firefox from 3.5.1 to 3.5.2
2. Login into the reporting module

Actual Results:
Firefox window close and doe a session restore when started again

Expected Results:
Allowed the applet to read the dongle and send the data to the server.
