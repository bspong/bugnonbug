If a site is slow to respond, Firefox terminates the attempt and show "done" with no content.
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040217 Firefox/0.8.0+

This is not specific to the Mozilla.org site, but because it wa slow today it
made a good example.
If a site is slow to respond, Firefox evidently time out the connection - the
time seems very short when thing are busy ~ 1 min. The error is that the
operation is indicated "Done" in the status bar.

An error indication should be signalled.
The timeout period should be user-settable.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter an address in the location bar ( type or select bookmark ).
2. Watch the "growler" growl. Wait until it stops.


Actual Results:
If the site did not respond quickly enough, the status bar indicates "Done." but
the page is blank.

Expected Results:
Error box "The connection timed out because <URI> did not respond within ss
seconds. Check the address and try again later."
