"click" event in addEventListener is unreliable when selecting text
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; Q312461)
Build Identifier:

The "click" event from addEventListener is normally generated when you drag
select text and let up the mouse button. BUT, if you start dragging in one
paragraph and let up in another, OR you drag across a link, then the event is
never generated. (The "mouseup" event doe seem to work OK.)

gBrowser = top.document.getElementById("content");
gBrowser.addEventListener("click", browserClickHandler, false);




Reproducible: Always
