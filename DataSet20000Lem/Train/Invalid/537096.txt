The version of firefox I'm using now is what I USED to use. When I downloaded the latest recommended update my Volume icon disappeared from the notification area of the taskbar, and when I open taskbar "properties" the "Always Show" option for the Volume icon is grayed out and unselectable.

Also, I DID have thumbnail of my most frequently visited site pop up when I opened up a new tab. I really liked that feature, but since installing that Firefox update I just get a blank page when I open a new tab.

I did a "System Restore" to get my Volume icon back - and it worked - but I'm still not getting the thumbnail of frequently visited site when I open a new tab.

Can you please let me know what caused these little glitches?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. LOL - just turn it on. It's that simple.
2.
3.


Expected Results:
LISTEN. I LOVE FIREFOX - I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE I SPEAK WITH - BUT UNTIL I GET AN ANSWER TO MY CONCERNS I WILL NOT BE UPGRADING TO THE NEW VERSION.

THE THUMBNAIL THING IS PRETTY TRIVIAL, BUT I NEED!!! THE VOLUME ICON ON MY TASKBAR AS I SWITCH BETWEEN USING AND NOT USING HEADPHONES QUITE OFTEN AND MUST HAVE A WAY TO ADJUST THE VOLUME!
