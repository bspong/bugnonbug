running OSX 10.2.8., with IE a previous browser. After installing firefox,
tried to import Favorites. Dialog box say "Import preferences, bookmark
etc...from:" but doe not list any place from which to import. "next" button
doe nothing.

This may be the same bug a 268581, but that report doe not specify whether
there wa any content listed before the "next"button failed to do anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.pull down file menu
2.choose import
3.

Actual Results:
dialog window doe not contain any source for import

Expected Results:
list other browser (safari, IE) along with component (bookmarks, password
etc) with option to import or not import those component

I trashed and reinstalled firefox and the problem repeated. Download showed up
a download.mozilla.dmg.gz, not download.firefox etc.--is there a difference?

Note: I am tagging this a a major bug because it wa this feature that enticed
me to try to switch at this time. Without it the switch is not worth it to me.
