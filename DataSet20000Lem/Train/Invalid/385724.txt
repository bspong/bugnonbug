TITLE tooltips sometimes stop appearing

Example page where TITLE attribute isn't displayed properly

On some pages, TITLE tooltips display fine in Firefox. However, for a reason I can't determine, they don't on others. I've attached a sample page, the AMO editor's extension queue, which exhibit this problem.

When the page is loaded and you mouseover an image with a TITLE attribute, Firefox will display it in a tooltip. However, move your mouse to another image, and it won't. I've modified the tooltip code in my browser, and determined that the problem isn't work the window.FillInHTMLTooltip JavaScript function; that get called when the tooltip SHOULD be popped up, but even if I set the code to always display 'test' and return true, it still doesn't get popped up. The problem seems to be at a lower level.

I tested this with Firefox 2.0.0.3 on Windows XP.
