If the image is on a file server "//fileserver/foldername/image.jpg" the <img src="//fileserver/foldername/image.jpg"> doe not work and display a broken image. This feature work in IE and Netscape.

I have noticed some web site where the image do not show in Fire Fox, I believe this is most likely the reason why. I will add comment to this when I find some public examples.
