FF1.0.1 report error in xpcom.dll when any page with flash load
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050223 Firefox/1.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050223 Firefox/1.0.1

Upon loading a page with any flash content (I used www.miniclip.com a an
example, but any page with any flash content will reproduce the error) a dialog
box pop up with the following error.
"The procedure entry point ?get@nsDependentCString@@UBEPBDXZ could not be loaded
in the dynamic link library xpcom.dll"
This bug is very minor, a pressing OK close the dialog box and flash content
load properly, but it can get very annoying, especially with the amount of
flash "Free iPod" style ad that are cropping up all over the internet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 1.0.1 using the default theme, no extensions, and the Flash
plug-in
2. Navigate to any page with flash content (i.e. www.miniclip.com).


Actual Results:
Dialog box noted above pop up once for each piece of flash content embedded in
the page. Pressing OK to each dialog box will load the flash successfully.

Expected Results:
Load Flash without error.

Neither a reinstall of Firefox nor a replacement of xpcom.dll ha solved the
problem.
