<label> tag do not forward the mouse focus or loss of focus to it associated
control (clicks are forwarded correctly, however). Evil IE seems to have
performed this correctly, so it wa quite a shock that Fx did not.

Page 239 of HTML/4.01 specification
(http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224) state "When a LABEL element
receives focus [p.241] , it pass the focus on to it associated control."

Labels become part of their associated control. When hovered, the control must
act like it is hovered (including the normal outline around it and the JS
onmouseover and onmouseout functions).

Example:
<input type="checkbox" id="checkbox_id" />
<label for="checkbox_id">Label for Checkbox</label>

Full example at http://pro696.homeftp.org/label_flaw.html.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://pro696.homeftp.org/label_flaw.html with javascript enabled
2. Hover over the checkbox
3. Look at the textbox ("Checkbox is hovered")
4. Hover over the "Label for Checkbox" label
5. Look at the textbox

Actual Results:
Nothing happened

Expected Results:
The mouse hover over the label should have been forwarded to the control,
activating the onmouseover attribute of the control, running the mouseover()
function of the document (see the document's source), changing the textbox's
value to "Checkbox is hovered". Also, the checkbox should have been highlighted.

See the HTML source for the document (http://pro696.homeftp.org/label_flaw.html)
a well. No comment have been made to it, but you can see the javascript source.
