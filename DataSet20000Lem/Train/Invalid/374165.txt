No tab parent set when link opened in background (middle-click, context menu)

The intelligent tab order used when browser.tabs.selectOwnerOnClose is set to true seems to be broken. When clicking a link on a web page via middle click (CMD+click on a mac) or context menu (open link in new tab) and closing it again (close button/CMD+W) the tab isn't set to the originating one but to the tab next to the closed one.
Contrary, if the specified link is just clicked with the left mouse button (and ha target=_blank / unknown target set), closing the new tab DOES select the owner on close correctly.

The problem seems to have surfaced with the update to 2.0.0.2. I've recreated this behavior on OS X 10.4.9 (PPC) with a new profile and all extension disabled. Additionally, I've tried several web site to see if it is affected by page content, but it seems like this isn't a site/source code-specific problem.

Since I'm unable to test this one on Windows, I've set HW/OS to Mac/OS X. If Windows user can reproduce this bug, please edit the entry accordingly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open link in web page via CMD+click or "Open Link in New Tab"
2. When new tab appears, close it via CMD+W or the close button
b)
Do a in a) but open link with <a target> set to an unused name.
Actual Results:
a)
On close, the tab next to (as in displayed tab order) the recently closed tab is selected.
b)
On close, the tab from which the link originated is selected.

Expected Results:
In a) the active tab should've been set to the parent tab.
