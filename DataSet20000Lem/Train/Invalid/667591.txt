Canvas shadow fill entire image/context with shadow-color in FF5
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I set the shadow color on an image.


Actual results:

It fill the context / overwrites the images.


Expected results:

The shadow should wrap around the content. I noticed this issue while using easeljs and traced it back to the shadow properties. It worked on ff4/safari/chrome/etc..
