Though scrolling with the middle wheel of the mouse work (rotating it), clicking at all doe not (pushing down). FF doesn't autoscroll or allow for tab to close or open by clicking. It doesn't seem to aknowledge the clicking of the button at all. I'm using a Logitech M-RAA93 (labeled a HID-compliant cordless mouse) mouse with a Logitech driver version 9.78.0.0 (the most recent). I'm on a Laptop.
