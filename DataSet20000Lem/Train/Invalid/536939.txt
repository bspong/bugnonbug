using dd-wrt firmware on a linksys router (or other router), cannot use firefox to upload firmware (.bin files). Google Chrome work perfect for this. firefox break in the middle or at the first third or fourth (can't remember).

I suspect there are others having problem with uploading files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.find a router. especially one that ha dd-wrt on it.
2.flash the router with new firmware, using FF to upload the new firmware.

Actual Results:
after about 1/3 of the file is uploaded, it just up and quite uploading and act like it is done. hopefully you won't brick your router.

Expected Results:
should upload the whole file and then router may or may not reboot.

the file are only about 3MB-7MB each.
