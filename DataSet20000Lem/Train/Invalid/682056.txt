User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

Saved copy of Host Script from http://webmailnotifier.mozdev.org/scripts/ listed a "mail.com" to my computer from which I loaded this script file under Web Notifier's "options" tab and properly entered my log-on & password then loaded data onto Web Notifier, result appearing among the other listed & activated e-mail accounts, (yahoo, for example) that do work.


Actual results:

When I move the cursor onto the Web-Mail icon in my menu bar, I get msg: "mail,com: not checked", ("Yahoo: 6").


Expected results:

The msg should have shown "mail.com: 13", ("Yahoo: 6") because, at the time, there were 13 unread email in my mail.com acct a well a 6 unread in my yahoo.com acct. Yahoo work but it wa among the list of choice to add without having to get involved with scripts. Script had to be added to get mail.com to appear among the choice to select, which doesn't activate in Web Notifier apparently due to a bug(s) existing in the code in the Java script file a listed on webmailnotifier website.

Can you fix and get back to me with a corrected program at: ossargkcir@yahoo.com?

Thanks,
Rick Grasso
