At my school (HCC) when I try to log onto the school wireless network I get this message, "Firefox can’t connect securely to hccwgw.hcc.edu because the site us an older, insecure version of the SSL protocol." After I use the virus (IE) to log in FF work fine. I really hate having to use the virus to log in. I have tried to disable SSL completely, but doesn't help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I have no idea how you guy can reproduce this without driving to Tampa, Fl and trying to log onto the network yourself.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
I get the stupid message, "Firefox can’t connect securely to hccwgw.hcc.edu because the site us an older, insecure version of the SSL protocol."

Expected Results:
It should let me log in and not give me that stupid message.
