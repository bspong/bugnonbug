I have poor eyesight so use "control/scroll wheel" to increase font size on web page where necessary.

In Firefox 2 the text becomes larger and wrap so all the text is visible. In Firefox 3 RC1 it act like IE and spill over the page on the right hand side of the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open web page
2.Increase text size
3.Watch a text spill off the right hand side of the screen rather than drop down to next line!
Actual Results:
See above

Expected Results:
Text on web page should wrap a in Firefox 2.

Maximum text size should not be limited.
