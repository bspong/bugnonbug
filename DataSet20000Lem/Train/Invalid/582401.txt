I have the same (or similar) error with with Firefox 4b2. On startup a dialog
box pop up with the message TypeError: Components.classes[cid]is undefined.
When I click OK the startup completes, and any previously opened tab are
displayed. However if I open a new tab and select a website from the drop down
history list or type in the name of a web site I want to go to and press enter
nothing happens. Beta 2 is currently unusable for me in this state.

Reproducible: Always

1. Start Firefox 4b2 after upgrading to it from 4b1
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Cannot go to another web site by opening a new tab

Expected Results:
