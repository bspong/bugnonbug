Firefox doe not properly display my Gmail inbox. Emails are not clickable, nor are they in a list format. The button on the side, such a "Inbox", "Sent", "Trash", are not there either. The only form of navigation I do appear to have is on the bottom of the screen. The page appears in mostly text form, a if there ha not been any coding done to create some sort of UI.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Mozilla Firefox
2.Load Gmail.com
3.Log in
Actual Results:
The page display a described.

Expected Results:
Displayed the page a it is supposed to be displayed; Internet Explorer doe this.

It is obviously the new version of Firefox that creates this problem, a the old version wa fine. I have searched both the web site and in Google to find others with the same problem, but have not found anyone, so I assume this problem is rather specific, not general.
