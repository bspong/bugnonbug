When writing HTML, sometimes you use alt tag inside of image tags, that way if the image doesn't load or the link is broken, it will say in the place of the image what you put inside of the alt tag. In IE or Safari it will work but not when I test it in Firefox. Please work on this!!!

PS The image tag is <img src="imagename.extention" alt"Test Image">

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a page that ha an image that ha an alt tag in the image code.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Nothing Happens, the alt tag is not displayed

Expected Results:
The content inside of the alt tag should be displayed if the image is missing or broken, or if you hover over the image with your mouse. Try it in IE
