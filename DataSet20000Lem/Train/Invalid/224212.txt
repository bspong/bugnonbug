Hi, First of all, Great browser. I have one problem, the Chemdraw net plug in
doesn't work properly. It allows you to draw chemical structure in your
browser. The drawing palette doesn't show up. The plug in work properly in
Netsccape 7.1 and IE6. Help! Here is the website I'm trying to use! Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to use the Chemacx website
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Even with the plugin installed, the drawing pallette woudn't show up

Expected Results:
a drawing pallete should have shown up allowing me to draw different chemical
structure

This website I'm trying to use allows to search for vendor for specific
chemicals. Makkes my life a Chemist much easier. I like the firebird browser
and would like use it exclusively and I can do that if this plugin work properly.
