I am new to this and I have come to a point in the build where I need help.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:7.0a1) Gecko/20110618 Firefox/7.0a1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:7.0a1) Gecko/20110618 Firefox/7.0a1

Hello! I am not sure if I am directing this question to the right place,
but here goes:

Okay,

I am new to building Firefox. I have the 64x AMD Nightly build, but I am only
trying to build the 32 bit firefox right now (I have taken head when warned
agains the x64((((Even if you're on 64-bit Windows, do not use the
start-msvcX-x64.bat file (unless you know what you're doing). Those file
are experimental and unsupported. See the Build:MozillaBuild For x64 wiki
page)))).

So I find myself wanting of advise.

I wa following the build instruction and this is a far a I have been able
to get so far. Can Anyone help a newbe?

I wa following instruction here on the page::::::::::>

Building Firefox

First, if you're on Windows, you'll need to start work in a directory
with no space in the path (e.g. don't use "Documents and Settings").
You can pick any other location, but the root of C: is handy:

cd /c

Now let's grab the latest source code from Mozilla's Mercurial code
repository. This may take a while, it's a lot of code!

hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/

To start the build, cd into the mozilla-central subdirectory (created
automatically by the previous command), and run:

make -f client.mk <================< HERE

This step will also take a while, depending on your system and OS.
Linux build on a fast box may take under 10 minutes, Windows build on
a slow box may take an hour...............


following instruction at this point, I get the following output
