The Resolution Date is a "Resolution Date" type customfield, where the date is populated automatically when the resolution is set for an issue. However, in the department candidate issues, even though the resolution is being set on resolving the issues, the resolution date is not being set. Setting of resolution date should be a JIRA functionality which is not working properly here. I will be working on this issue more deeply.

As suggested by Subodh, the problem may lie in the fact that for other IT issue (not candidate issues), on resolving the issue, an Issue Resolved event is being fired and the resolution date is getting set here. For the IT candidate (and other deptt issues), a Generic Event is being fired, not the Issue Resolved Event, and the resolution date is not getting set. I will be changing the workflow to fire a Issue Resolved Event.

Thanks,
Madhur
