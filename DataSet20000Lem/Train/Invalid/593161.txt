Most of my addons do not work with 3.6.9, or 4.4 betas. So far 4.4 is the most depndable on site like facebook and farmville. 3.6.9 crasshes regularly on those sites. I love imagezoom but it will not work with either of these versions. Neither will load Google's language program.

Reproducible: Didn't try
