Allow extension to only provide a glyph icon on OS X

Example of glyph and glyph + toolbar button shape

It would be great if extension only had to provide the monochrome glyph section of a toolbar button, and Firefox would provide the outer button shape if requested. This should help with making sure the toolbar button look consistent on OS X. Obviously this should just be optional for extensions, otherwise they can style their toolbar button anyway they want.
