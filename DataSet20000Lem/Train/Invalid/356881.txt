Data corruption on disk make firefox folder/files inaccessable, window initiate disk check on next reboot.

I am running Vista X64 RC1 build 5600 and Firefox X64 1.6a1. After using FF for a day or two, the firefox shortcut stop working and when I try to access the folder window report that the datat is corrupt. There is no other file on the disk that are also corrupt or any other data corruption issue with my running of vista. Windows initiate disk chech when I reboot, and repair or deletes many/all of the firefox files. Many can be found after the reboot in the C:\found.00x\dir000x.chk folders.

It is strange that the only file that seem to be corrupting are firefox related.

Also, when disk check completes, window report that there wa insufficient space for the master file table bitmap architecture to be repaired.

cheers.
