SSL server chain not resolved (broken) by Firefox (sec_error_unknown_issuer) with a known root CA .
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091109 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5

Go to https://testcb.application.equipement.gouv.fr/, Firefox issue a warning "sec_error_unknown_issuer" although the root CA (PM/SGDN - IGC/A) is present in Firefox and all the intermediate CA chain is sent by web server.
=> This warning is not issued with Internet Explorer, openssl s_client or Opera (with root CA added to Opera).

This website is authentified with a SSL certificate included in the following chain :
website certificate (testcb...) > AC Serveurs > AC Ministere > IGC/A
- The upper (root) CA is included in Firefox build.
- intermediate level are send by Apache web server.
=> Firefox resolve the first level only (AC Serveurs) and ignore others levels.

Links to this CA and host certificate :
- Root CA : build in Firefox.
- Other certificate for test : https://testcb.application.equipement.gouv.fr/certificates.zip

Reproducible: Always
