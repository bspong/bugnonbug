I click on the Bookmark Menu. It fully and regularly opens, and so do
subfolders. I point my mouse on any bookmark, and the URL is correctly shown in
the status bar. So I click on the bookmark: I expect the Bookmark Menu to
disappear and the page to load. The Menu in fact disappears; unfortunately, the
page won't load, not it URL appear in the address bar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on "Bookmark" (between "Go" ad "Tools")
2.Choose any bookmark of your liking.
3.Click on it.

Actual Results:
Bookmarks menu disappears. That's it.

Expected Results:
Bookmarks menu disappears, page load in the browser and it URL shown in the
address bar.

I had some difficulty in updating from Firefox 0.8 to 1.0, I must admit. Maybe
it's the Operating System. For example, I had disabled the extension RSS reader,
even uninstalled it, but it still showed in the sidebar! (then I resolved the
problem). Also, the menu bar frozen at a point.
