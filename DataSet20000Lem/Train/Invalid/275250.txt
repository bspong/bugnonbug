Undo + Sort end up delete bookmark [@ RDFContainerImpl::RemoveElementAt]
Combination of undo and sort deletes bookmark accidentally.

Steps to reproduce.
1. Open bookmark manager.
1. Create a folder which ha 2 bookmarks.
2. Sort the folder.
3. Reorder these bookmark with drag and drop.
4. Sort the folder
5. Undo

Actual Result:
The folder ha only one bookmark. The other is gone.
Expected result:
Nothing happens.

I'm not sure which should be fixed: transaction or sort function.
Seamonkey's sort call transactionmanager.clear(), btw.
