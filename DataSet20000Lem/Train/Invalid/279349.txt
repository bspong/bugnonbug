Favicon not shown in location bar when fetched from HTTPS URL
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b) Gecko/20050121
Firefox/1.0+

When the URL for the favicon is an HTTPS URL, the favicon is ignored, and the
generic globe icon is shown instead.

This is a recent regression, it work in Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X
Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8b) Gecko/20050113 Firefox/1.0+
