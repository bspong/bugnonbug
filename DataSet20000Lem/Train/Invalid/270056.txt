When I click on the scrolling wheel on a Microsoft IntelliMouse to activiate or
deactiveate the mouse scrolling(*), if the mouse cursor happens to be over a
hyperlink it will open it in a New Tab. In Internet Explorer, one can click
almost anywhere on the current webpage to activate/deactivate the mouse
scrolling, even it is on a hyperlink. However, in FireFox, I have to be
cautious a to where I click the mouse wheel so a to prevent opening a New Tab
(and subsequently having to close it).


(*) Mouse scrolling being I don't have to turn the wheel to scroll up and down
or left and right on the page. All I have to do is move the mouse around and
the page will scroll accordingly after it ha been activated.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Depress the mouse wheel over a hyperlink and it will open
2.
3.

Actual Results:
A New Tab appears with the hyperlink that I just clicked on.

Expected Results:
Nothing (at least that's what happens in Internet Explorer).
