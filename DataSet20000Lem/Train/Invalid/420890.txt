3 tab are open and the last one is active.
Open the Tools/Options... to set a new Home Page.

Minefield will catch the url of the first tab instead of the one active!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few browser's tab on different website
2. Go to menu: Tools/Options... in the "Main" tab
3. Click on "Use current page" button to set the new Home Page
Actual Results:
Minefield will catch the url of the first tab instead of the one active!
The first tab on the left, not necessarily the first one opened.

Expected Results:
Set the Home Page to the active tab URL.
