right hand column link within a div within a div with an id are not clickable, work in IE
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If I remove the id from my right column div then the link in that column work I finally managed to fix it by putting an invisible link at the end of the div ??? this seems like a firefox bug. The html and cs all validate.

I made copy of the front page of the site to try to fiddle with it to see if I could fix it

with the div all link below the subscribe box are broken ( i even gave the id for the div a new name -- newrcolcontainer )
