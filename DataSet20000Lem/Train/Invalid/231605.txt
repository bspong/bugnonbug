I have set a local file which is my default home page for Firebird, stored in
C:/. I have made Firebird my default browser. However, when I press the Internet
AccessDirect key on my Dell laptop (Inspiron 2500), Firebird load but instead
of going to the designated home page, 'Resolving host %1' appears in the status
bar, and the browser go to mozilla.org instead.

Is there a way I can get Firebird to go the correct home page (it is definitely
set correctly in the preferences)? When I run Firebird manually, it correctly
go to my set home page.

The AccessDirect software is configured, I understand, to simply run the default
browser when I press the 'i' key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a Dell laptop with AccessDirect keys, press the 'i' button to access the
Internet and start the default browser.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
See 'Details' description above.

Expected Results:
Instead of going to the mozilla.org home page, Firebird should have loaded my
designated home page, stored locally on the C:/ drive.
