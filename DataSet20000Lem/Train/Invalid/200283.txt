Phoenix fails to render FTP icon (internal-gopher-*)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4a)
Gecko/20030401 Phoenix/0.5

======CAUSE

OK. After Bug 83774 landed, browser can't draw
<img src="internal-gopher-menu"> at all.

It should be converted to:
<img src="resource:/res/html/gopher-menu.gif">

file: call MOZ_NewTXTToHTMLConv()
However ftp: doe not seem to call it.

view-source:file:///C:/

view-source:ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/

We should also call it in FTP case a Mozilla does.
