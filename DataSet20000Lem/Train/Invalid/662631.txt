When I visit Planet Mozilla, Firefox stop updating the chrome and canvas
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0

This doesn't happen every time I visit the page (and seems to work fine on my Linux machine). When I visit planet.mozilla.org the initial drawing appears to complete a normal. However when I scroll, only a small portion of the page is updated, and the rest remains a it wa last drawn.

I can resize the window and the drawing is still not updated (though when I mouse over thing that have :onhover attribute, they are redrawn.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit planet.mozilla.org
2. Do anything that would cause Firefox to draw something new (scroll, resize window, etc)
3. Observe bug
