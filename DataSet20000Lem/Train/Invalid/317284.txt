new url request take over existing tab
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; Maxthon; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50215; FDM)

You really should look at the maxthon browser; I know they are overall not a good, a they are basing it on Internet Explorer, but they have several innovation (such a never opening a new window) and also when application send a request for a page, it doe not load in the current tab unless it is blank. I do not see an option to change this in firefox.

I think it is good that you have individualized extensions, but maybe you could offer other user the option of loading the plugins that another user downloaded, just to avoid messing with the website (I know they are not large files).

Besides a few other small thing that Maxthon feature - a small notepad, too many options, and superfluous support for multiple tabs, I think that your browser is for the most part more stable and render page better.

Please email gatoatigrado@myrealbox.com for any feedback. I don't know where else to post this besides bugzilla.
