Memory leak when adding a function to PlacesUIUtils
Created attachment 547558
example extension that show the leak

I'm getting these leak with the example extension:

Summary:
Leaked 0 out of 0 DOM Windows
Leaked 22 out of 67 document
Leaked 0 out of 7 docshells
Leaked content node in 37 out of 84 document

It turn out that PlacesUIUtils.randomfunction = function() {} is causing the leaks.
I don't know why it happens.
PlacesUIUtils.jsm is placed here:
http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/places/src/PlacesUIUtils.jsm

I need to override a method from lacesUIUtils in an extension that I made. I'm surprised this is causing leaks.

I guess maybe what I'm doing is just bound to cause leaks?
