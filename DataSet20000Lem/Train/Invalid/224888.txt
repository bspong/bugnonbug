Firebird work very slow until I initiate Java Plug-In for Internet Explorer
loading by loading some page with java applet at it.

To be short. I load Firebird – it work very slowly (even mouse cursor hang for
half of a second). If I first load IE and then open some page with Java Applet
(Java Plug-In loading) and then open Firebird then it work Ok. That's it.
