Please could you re-consider the use of S a an access key so that existing application that have made use of it a accessibility accesskeys, knowing that it wasn't currently used, don't have to be changed to use one of the ever-diminishing set of usable keys.

Reproducible: Always




This seems to be new in Firefox Beta 2.
