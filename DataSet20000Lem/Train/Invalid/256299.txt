Bookmark Manager, remove part of context menu
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040819
Firefox/0.9.1+

repro:
1. Open Manage Bookmarks
2. Rightclick on a folder in the right pane
Context menu
- Open in tab
--> Why, this is where the bookmark are for, not the Manager ?

- Manage Folder
--> Why, you can manage the folder from where you are
--> Opening manage the folder pop up a bookmark manager window with just that
--> folder , it's unclear what this part adds. Also unclear if you try export
--> bookmark if it expert just the folder or whe whole file

3. Open the folder
4. Rightclick on a bookmark
-Open
-Open in Window
-Open in Tab
--> Again not the Managers job

-New Bookmark
-New Folder
-New Seperator
--> Only belong to the folder context menu, not to the bookmark context menu

5. doubleclick on a bookmark

This open the bookmark
instead it should open the property dialogue.

If needed I can split this in seperate bug
(in case of partial WONTFIX)
