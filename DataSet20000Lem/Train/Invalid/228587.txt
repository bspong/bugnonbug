I'm not sure if this is gonna be a good idea or not, but I've found myself
wanting to add page to the toolbars many times, but not having any simply way
to do it. I would have liked to just using the "Add Bookmark" dialog.

So, I suggest that we add the toolbars (the one you can add bookmark to) to
the tree view in the "Add Bookmark" dialog.
Each toolbar that the user ha created would be on the same level (in the tree)
a the "Bookmarks"

For additional useability, you might consider using a different icon to
represent the toolbars a opposed ot the bookmarks. Perhaps just change the
color from yellow to something else? or draw something fancy?
