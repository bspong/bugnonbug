I have file extension mp3 set to be handled by quicktime plugin to play sound within the firefox tab. It play fine.
However, in the latest v3.6.4 the quicktime plugin should run in the separate process plugin-container.exe but it still run in the firefo.exe process.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In option set .mp3 extension to be handled by quicktime and to play mp3s in-place
2. navigate to any mp3 url
To verify the bug either
3a. open task manager of window and end-task plugin-container.exe -> quicktime plugin is not ended
3b. in window vista or window 7 open volume mixer and verify that firefox process is outputting sound and not plugin-container
Actual Results:
Quicktime plugin run in the firefox.exe process.

Expected Results:
Quicktime plugin should also be run in the plugin-container.exe process.
