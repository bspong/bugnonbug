I have an somewhat obscure problem with firefox's built in spell checker.
If generate an html file from an xml+xsl client side transform, the spell checker is disabled. However, if I take this same generated html file, save it a a .html file, and then view it, the spellcheck doe work.

I have tried version 3.0b2

I am guessing it ha something to do with the spellchecker not being able to pick the right dictionary. I have tried everything I can think of. Any help would be greatly appreciated.


Reproducible: Always

1. create xml file with xsl stylesheet to generate html page
2. have <textarea> control on generate page

spell checker doe not work on this page:
http://zipobase.com/spellcheckbug.xml

same page saved a html and viewed:
http://zipobase.com/spellcheckbug.html

firefox built-in spell checker doe not work

spell checker should work. (shouldn't it?). If I use firebug to save the generated html file, and then reload it, the spell checker doe work.
