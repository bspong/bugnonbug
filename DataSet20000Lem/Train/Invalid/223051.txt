Consider this a "parabug".
Down at the bottom of this screen there are "My Requests" and "My Bugs". I
reported two bug in the past few day for Firebird 0.7, one today. But both
these canned query return Zarro Bogoos. But one of them is 222980. I forget
the number of the other, and I'd like to find it again, see if there is a
workaround or something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click "My Bugs"
2.Click "My Requests"
3.

Actual Results:
Zarro Bogoos

Expected Results:
Find at least #222980
