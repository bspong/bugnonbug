When right clicking on a folder in the main bookmark list the first option in the context menu is "Open in Tabs". Clicking on this won't open that folder in tabs.

Yet, if I click on the "Open in Tabs" entry at the bottom of the listing of bookmark in that folder - Open in Tabs function normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Left click on Bookmarks
2. Right click on a folder
3. Select "Open in Tabs" on the main context menu
4. Nothing happens

5. In the submenu that open (with all the bookmark for that folder visible) click on the "Open in Tabs" item at the bottom of that menu.
6. Firefox then open the full folder of tab normally.

Actual Results:
Firefox didn't open the tab that I wanted open

Expected Results:
I expected all of my bookmark to open in tab in the current Firefox window

This occurs on several of my system and occurred within the last 2 or 3 updates.
Could be related to another bug report that I intend to submit where the "Open in Tabs" selection only open a few bookmark and then stop at a bookmark that point to a file on my local system.
