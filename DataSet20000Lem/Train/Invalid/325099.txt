predefined textarea text not displaying

When I go to a Web page with a <textarea> element, and within that element there is some text, that text doesn't appear in the text area.

For example,
<textarea style="background-color: #FBE765" rows="25" cols="80" name="note">This is a note.</textarea>
render an empty text area.

The only workaround I know of is to use a reload link of one sort or another ON THE PAGE.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a page that ha a <textarea> like I described above.
2. Go to it.
3. Look at the rendered text area.




I am using SUSE Linux 10.0. I had installed the MozillaFirefox package (which installed Firefox 1.0.6), but later downloaded Firefox 1.5 and installed it in my home directory. (Also, I am new to Linux.)
