The addres bar seems to not update correctly in some cases. For example go to
http://www.imageshack.com then click the link http://www.imageshack.us inside
the page. Address bar will not get updated. Or maybe is it the correct behavior
because of the server imageshack.com? Because when you're browsing it address
bar never get updated a well. But at least changing server (com-->us) should be
indicated.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.imageshack.com
2.Click the link http://www.imageshack.us
