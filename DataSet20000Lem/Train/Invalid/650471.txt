The browser doe not remember the tab I use in a previous session.

All I know is that I used to be able to close one browser session and restore the application later with all my tab a well. No, what I'm talking about is not Mozilla crashing. I legitimately close the window, and then restart it normally, but now, FireFox doe not remember my tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Simple, open a few pages, all in different tab of course
2.close the window
3.open the program again
Actual Results:
Nothing, none of the tab will be available in the new window.

Expected Results:
exactly what I put, nothing.

I know this is an unorthodox way to contact the developers, I couldn't find another way. There doesn't seem to be a general email address to do that, not that I could find.
