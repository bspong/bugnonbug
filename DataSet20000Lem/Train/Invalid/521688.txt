I downloaded ver 3.5, and had repeated system crashes, boot up stopped before bios beep. Could only get access when starting in window safe mode. Uninstalled ver 3.5, system working ok. Have now rolled back to ver 3.0 - working ok, no system crash a yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download ver 3.5
2.start up using window vista
3.connect to internet
Actual Results:
It ha taken me a week to sort this out. Multiple attempt to get system to get past the bios beep, so I could start up in window safe mode. Finally managed to get in, and uninstalled version 3.5. Computer booting up ok now, and rolled back to FF ver 3.0, working ok at present.

Expected Results:
System booting up normally. Using FF ver 3.0, able to use all browser function and no crash have occurred yet.

Using an Acer Aspire M5640, with intel core 2 quad processor. Windows Vista - home premium. No error message appeared, just couldn't load window vista, would stop just before the first bios beep. When it did get past, had to load in window safe mode, let everything load - do any uninstalls ( last uploads - which wa FF 3.5) then reboot normally. Sometimes would load and could connect to internet, other time it would crash again. Once I uninstalled FF ver 3.5, everything is back to normal. Please email me if more information is needed.
Thanks
