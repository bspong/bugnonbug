I'm currently using Firefox 3.04 (beta) with the color tab plug-in ... The only thing bothersome about this app is that the tab sometimes get 'lost' ... (That , and the browser seems to 'choke' when too many (over6!) are opened ... Also , using openoffice , I find the task bar @ the extreme bottom right of the screen , get muddled beyond recognition ... Oh yeah , I'm using OpenSuse10.2 ...
This app also take 'forever' to simply boot one address @ time ...
