Steps to reproduce:

Type 'abc' and enter in the location bar.


Actual results:

Firefox tried to resolve it a a domain name, and I am redirected to my ISP's ad page for invalid domain.


Expected results:

I should see Google search result for 'abc'. However, this work for more than one words, e.g. 'abc abc'. This is under Ubuntu. However, it work fine under Windows for one or more than one words.
