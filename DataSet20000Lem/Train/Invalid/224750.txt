Clicking on an empty space on a webpage requires there to be text, and then place an invisible cursor

The problem is two-fold. If I select some text on a web site and want to
deselect it, I need to single-click on a *text area* or else it doesn't deselect
it. But if I click on a text area, it place an *invisible cursor* there.

This is problematic when you want to do a CTRL-F search on a web page after
having highlighted some text (possibly by using CTRL-F). In effect it force me
to go back to the top of the page and click on a blank text area to start a new
search from the top of the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1a. Find a word that is repeated twice on a page.
2a. Highlight a word between those two occurrences.
3a. Left-click outside that word but still between the two occurrences.
4a. Search for the repeated word.

1b) Highlight a word on this very web page used to submit a bug report.
2b) Left-click in the area to the right of the box that say "Hardware platform"

Actual Results:
a) Finds the second occurrence instead of the first one.

b) Does not deselect the text.

Expected Results:
You should be able to click anywhere on the text page and then be able to CTRL-F
to search from the top.
