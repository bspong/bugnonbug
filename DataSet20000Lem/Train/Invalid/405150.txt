[bookmark doesn't show up until restart?] "Trying to get a result node for an invalid bookmark identifier" assertion when adding a bookmark
"Trying to get a result node for an invalid bookmark identifier" assertion when adding a bookmark

after the wallpaper fix for bug #404928, the crasher should now assert like this:

###!!! ASSERTION: Trying to get a result node for an invalid bookmark identifier: 'Not Reached', file /Users/sspitzer/Desktop/trunk/mozilla/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavHistory.cpp, line 4875
WARNING: NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv) failed with result 0x80070057: file /Users/sspitzer/Desktop/trunk/mozilla/toolkit/components/places/src/nsNavHistoryResult.cpp, line 3163

if this were to happen, I think the user would create a bookmark, but not see it until restart.

I forced this to happen by passing in a bogus aItemId, but I have not figured out how it wa happening to end users.
