Top crash site, entirely flash, kill back button and corrupts download manager.
I wa investigating the site, because it wa on the top crash URL's for 3.5.2.

I couldn't crash it, but the site killed my possibility to go back, even when I click very fast on back button.

Maybe, corrupted back button is related to crash, but that is speculation.

- Go to site.
- The right of the middle, contains a column with picture and some text.
- Go to the bottom of that column.
- Click on '>>' or '<<'.
- I can't go back to the site I wa visiting before, except when I use dropdown menu.
