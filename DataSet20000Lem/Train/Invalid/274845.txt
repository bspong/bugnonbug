Cannot delete previous search word from google autofill
I cannot, unlike in Explorer, delete previous seaches from the autofll dropdown
(that appears under the seach rectangle a I begin typing in letters) when
using Google. With Explorer I would just hit the delete key on my keyboard.
This doe nothing in Firefox. Nor doe the backspace key. How do I delete
previous word(s) from the autofill dropdown in Google, when using Firefox?

Thanks.

Chris
