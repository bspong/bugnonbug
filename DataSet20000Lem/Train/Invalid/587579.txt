Our company ha multiple proxy depending on which IP subnet is used. My IP address is in the 10.0.* range of our Dutch office.

When FF4.0b3 is used with the "Auto-detect proxy setting for this network" setting, the proxy it auto-detects and will use is from a different subnet (1.5.*).

This result in entering the Internet on the proxy of our Hungarian office, a thousand mile away, and getting certain page that check IP location (Google) in Hungarian by default (checked with external IP checker).

When proxy is set manually, everything work normally. In Firefox 3.6 this bug is not present, and when "Auto-detect proxy setting for this network" is on, the proxy that is used is from our local Dutch office.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set "Auto-detect proxy setting for this network" to on in FF4.0b3
2.Restart browser
3.Check external IP adres (http://whatismyipaddress.com/)

Actual Results:
The external IP address shown is for the proxy of subnet 10.5.*, which mean FF ha selected the proxy of the wrong subnet

Expected Results:
The external IP address shown should have been of subnet 10.0.*, where my computer resides. This would mean FF would have selected the proxy of the right subnet.
