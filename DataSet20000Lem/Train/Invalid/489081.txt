If some web object set a tooltip, this tooltip is shown no matter where I place the mouse, even if I am already at a completly different site.

This is very annoying because it show tooltips all the time, so I have to place the mouse outside of the Firefox window if I don't want that. And also annoying is that the tooltip is wrong in almost all cases.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move the mouse over some object which show a tooltip.
2. Go to another site.
3. Hold the mouse cursor still (at any place).
