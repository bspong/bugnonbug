Firefox 2 and IE work just fine. However, 3.0 can not render the browsing tab.
For example, if you go to GALLERY and then WEDDINGS&EVENTS you'll see a main image and 8 thumbnail to the right. Underneath the thumbnail should be a count of all image in the gallery and the right count should be(at this time) 1of80
In FF3 however, it show 1ofUND and scrolling to the next page using NEXT function is not available.
This only happened after switching to FF3. All other browser work well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.dmitrimarkine.com
2. go to Gallery -->and pick any subgallery
3. Try clicking on NEXT to go to the next 8 image
Actual Results:
Nothing...

Expected Results:
FF should have shown the number of image in each gallery (eg 1of80 or 1of32)
Clicking on Next or Previous should scroll to the next/previous thumbnail
