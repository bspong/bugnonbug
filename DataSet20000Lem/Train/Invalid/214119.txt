Helper application GUI doesn't show any mime types.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030721 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

I just upgraded from a late May Firbird nightly build, to the July 21 nightly.
My old build allowed me to edit mime type using the Mozilla preference GUI at
chrome://communicator/content/pref/pref.xul . The July 21 build allows me to
bring up the Mozilla preferences, but none of my defined file type are shown in
the Helper Applications section. Deleting mimeTypes.rdf ha no effect.
