The Back and Forward entry in the Context menu are great for navigating
webpage since it doesn't require the user to move the mouse all the way to that
small piece of screen real-estate at the top. Unfortunately, moving back and
forward more than one page requires opening the menu several times.

How about making the Back and Forward entry submenu containing a history of
the Back and Forward pages. Even nicer if you could make the entry just
"History" and Backward history menu would pop up to the left (in left-to-right
language settings) and Forward history menu would pop up on the right. But I
guess the widget don't support that.
