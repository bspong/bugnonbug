The page, referred in the URL above, request a window medium player plugin and offer a link for download it. After installation, the page continues to request the plugin and doesn't show the video. The same page work well on Firefox 3.6

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Enter http://www.shopinvest.com.br/Home_Broker/default.aspx in Firefox 3.6 and you will see a video right above the title "VIDEOS DA SEMANA", but in Minefield it doesn't appears.
