I download a file (normally, NOT save as...) and try to open it (manually, or
with firefox) and I get an error about the file being corrupt.

This ha been happening on 90% of the compressed file I download, whether
they're the self-extracting, installer types, .zip, or .rar a well a videos.
It's been happening from multiple source (nvidia, asus, apple...). The error
message is different depending on the filetype/handler.

I wa thinking it could be a problem with my hardware firewall and it's checksum
offloading, but I can download fine with IE and everything else. It happens with
the firewall on and off, a well a with anti-virus on and off.

This MIGHT be a duplicate of 277105, but it's happening with more than just videos.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Left-click on the file to be downloaded
2. Save the file normally
3. Open the file

Actual Results:
Error message complaining about corrupt data

Expected Results:
Have valid data
