In Joomla 1.5.13, when you create an article and you want to add an image, a pop appears so that you can choose a picture. You click on a thumbnail but the image is not selected.
Normally, when you click on the thumbnail, the pop up should be reduced and a picture displayed in your text area. Instead, it seems that the JavaScript doesn't work and the scrollbar go on to the top.
The editor used is TinyMCE. It work with ie 6.
