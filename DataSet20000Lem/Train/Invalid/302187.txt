There is a shared section vulnerability in office product when trying to open
an office document with firefox. For example try to open a word document
attached in a webmail. firefox.exe process will create a son winword.exe
process. When creating this process a shared section is created called
\BaseNameObjects\Mso97SharedDgXXXXXXXX (the number may change I am not sure at
the present time). The right on this shared section are put on "everyone" for
delete/synchronise/query/modify. this allows to write arbitrary data and to
perform a Dos against ALL Office open applications.
As the firefox.exe process is responsible of the creation of the winword.exe
it is a firefox vulnerability. The issue is not present with Internet Explorer
for example.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open by instance a word document from firefox to create a winword.exe
process
2. Use for example Process Explorer (sysinternals.com) to identify the
\BaseNameObjects\Mso97SharedDgXXXXXXXX shared section and look at the right
3. Use TestSS tool from A. Cerrudo to write arbitrary data on this section

Actual Results:
DoS of all office application

Expected Results:
create the winword process with good right on the shared section
