When closing a tab (which is not the last tab), width of the remaining tab are not set correctly, which cause unused area in the tab bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try opening many tab (so that width of tab equal to min-width)
2. Close one of the tab (not the last one)

Actual Results:
Width of the tab are not increased after closing the tab.

Expected Results:
Width of the tab should be increased after closing the tab.

You should use middle click for closing the tab. The issue doesn't occur if you use Ctrl-W.

A simple workaround is to move your mouse a bit so that the tab bar is refreshed.
