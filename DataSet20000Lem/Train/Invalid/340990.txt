Consider changing the menu layout for Vista

On Vista Beta2 the new IE7 look (IMHO) way better than Firefox.
The interface is much cleaner und uncluttered compared to IE6 or Firefox. (you see the Interface by installing IE7 on XP SP2)

Firefox should consider using a more IE Like user experience on Vista
That would mean: massively cleaing out the menu bar and combine the most used item with the other bar (like the Tab bar)

(i dont know if Firefox want to change it Layout, but IMO it look really dated compared to IE7 on Vista)

Reproducible: Always
