The Big Fish Games Toolbar display a a blank, blue line in the latest Nightly build, but load fine in Firefox 3.6. I am not sure if this is a Minefield issue or if Big Fish Games just need to update their toolbar code to recognize Firefox version 4. Sometimes toolbar company won't update until official browser release.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Big Fish Games Toolbar from the above website.
2. Display the toolbar in Minefield using the Options menu or right-clicking on the top portion of Minefield (above the address bar).
