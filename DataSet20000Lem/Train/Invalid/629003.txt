Having the "Show tab preview in Windows taskbar" option checked and opening more than 20 tab creates a preview only for the last opened tab.

Reproducible: Always

Prerequisites:
- Options|Tabs -> Show tab preview in Windows taskbar is checked

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open 5 tabs, hover with mouse over Firefox button in taskbar and observe behavior
2. Open more than 20 tab and observe behavior again

Actual results:
- preview is displayed for the last opened tab

Expected results:
- even if there are more than 20 page opened, the list with all the opened tab should be displayed (if list is too big to fit screen, scroll button should appear)
