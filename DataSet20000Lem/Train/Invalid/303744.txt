multiple identical event on the same object are registered multiple times.

<html><head></head><body>

<div onclick="document.addEventListener('click', function(){alert('clicked!')},
true)">
clicking twice on this text and then clicking anywhere else result in two
consecutive alert boxes.
</div>

</body></html>

According to DOM Level 2:

f multiple identical EventListeners are registered on the same EventTarget with
the same parameter the duplicate instance are discarded. They do not cause the
EventListener to be called twice and since they are discarded they do not need
to be removed with the removeEventListener method.

Reproducible: Always
