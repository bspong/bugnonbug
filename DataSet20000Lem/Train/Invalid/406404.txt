Firefox 3 doe not send URL feed to external r readers.

Steps to reproduce the web:
1/ go to http://robert.accettura.com/feed/atom/
2/ in the subscription top pane choose an external app like /usr/bin/liferea-add-feed if you use Liferea

expected result:
feed is added into Liferea

actual result:
an invalid feed is sent, according to Liferea the url is just file:///

This work perfectly in Firefox 2, hence the regression keyword.
