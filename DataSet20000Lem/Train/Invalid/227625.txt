Ampersand in text form field is not escaped in URL

On the Yahoo! Finance "Enter Symbol(s)" form, if you enter a string that ha
both an ampersand and at least one space character, the URL generated when you
submit includes your ampersand a is (instead of "%26").

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://finance.yahoo.com/
2. Type in "s&p 500" into the "Enter Symbol(s)" box.
3. Press "GO"

Actual Results:
I get a search result for the symbol "s" because the unescaped ampersand split
the parameter up. URL: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/cq?s=s&p+500&d=v1

Expected Results:
The ampersand should have been escaped. The URL should have looked like this (I
think): http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=s%26p+500&d=v1

I've only seen this problem on the one form that I named in the "Steps to
Reproduce" section. Also, it only happens if there are space in the field. A
search for "s&p500" work fine.

The page did have some JavaScript but it didn't look like it messed around with
the URL.
