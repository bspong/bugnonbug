Without entering the master password, and simply cancelling it once when the page loads, and once again cancelling when pressing "Login", I am able to login to the secure website without ever entering the Master Password.

This defeat the purpose of having the master password at all. Have not tested this on other website yet, but if it work on one, it will work on others.

Again, I am able to login with my private Master Password secured credential without ever entering the Master Password!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to login web page, asks for Master Password, press 'Cancel'.
2. Press 'Login' buton, prompt for Master Password, press 'Cancel'.
3. I am now logged in...?
Actual Results:
I wa logged into the website without ever entering my Master Password, credential for the site were pre-filled before I wa prompted to enter the MP, and stayed that way even after I pressed cancel.

Expected Results:
The username/password field should remain blank/empty until the correct Master Password is entered.
