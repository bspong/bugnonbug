Go to Tools -> Clear Recent History, select time range Everything and tick every checkbox, then 'Clear Now'.

Then open a new tab, click in the address bar and type a letter such a 'l'.

Expected behaviour: because the history ha been completely wiped, no autocomplete suggestion will be shown by the awesome bar, or at most they will be generic suggestion not based on my browsing history.

Observed behaviour: on typing a letter a list of suggested completion appears, all of them site I have visited in the past using Firefox.

I flagged this a 'major' because surely clearing the awesome bar autocomplete is the #1 reason for the 'clear recent history' function to exist, and it's not working.

Reproducible: Always
