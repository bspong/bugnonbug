Major conflict with AdBlock addon and PeerBlock.

Build Identifier: 3.6.3

Sorry this is so long. I just downloaded FF 3.6.3 for Windows last night and added the NoScripts and Adblock addons while concurrently running Peerblock. Within a few minute my entire system went haywire, more precisely a complete system failure. I/O, CMOS, IDEport2, ACPI, TCP/IP, everything went haywire. The mouse and the cursor became unusable, it wa a though someone wa mashing on button or clicking repeatedly. When I tried to open FF again it literally opened more than a hundred terminals. Right click completely failed because it immediately closed. I couldn't use any program or type anything anywhere on my system. This behavior persisted even when I booted into BackTrack 4 and even under BIOS. The entire system literally became unusable. Then I wasn't able to even make it past the splash screen in most instances. During boot this wa accompanied by constant beeps. I wa able to gather some information, but not much before the complete insanity. I did see in FF something about a corrupted module. Peerblock also generated an error report indicating I/O error but because of the nature of this problem I wasn't able to really view or record either one. There were ton of ACPI and other error in EventViewer under Windows while all this wa occurring. More error than I had ever seen before. Finally my system wouldn't even boot unless I left it alone for some time. I also noticed excessive heat. Finally Windows prompted me, after removing and reseating the RAM, to the repair console. It found zero errors, absolutely nothing, generating 0x0 error for everything. but did indicate that it located the root source of the problem. When it started up both FF and Peerblock had been removed. Everything else wa fine. I'm using the system now without a single problem. I've been using Peerblock for more than six mos. without any issues. FF run beautifully under BackTrack 4. It seems to me this wa a memory conflict of some nature that corrupted the CMOS or some other memory modules, but I'm not that savvy. I would like to continue using both these program with Windows but if it's not possible; it's not possible. I'm not crazy and won't be installing and using both these program together again. This wa the most serious problem I've ever encountered, worse than any virus. Also, let me assure you this wa not a virus. Since I've gotten back on my system I've run three different AV engines. I am willing to try FF, with AdBlock of course, again and update how it goes. I may even try the alpha5. I know your busy, but please help if you can. Any feedback or help would be greatly appreciated. I will continue to support the Mozilla community regardless of this issue.

-Regards

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install PeerBlock v1.00+ build r320. Run it with default lists.
2. Install Firefox 3.6.3. Install AdBlock and NoScripts addons.
3. Search the internet with the two aforementioned program running concurrently.
Actual Results:
No special set up should be needed. Firefox wa selected a default browser. Search the web with both of those program with those exact build running. PeerBlock with default lists. Firefox addon AdBlock with english list. Avira Antivir wa also on.

Expected Results:
Complete insanity. Entire computer system becomes unusable. I/O, ACPI, TCP/IP error were just a few, but the main error seems to be an ATAPI controller error on device/ide/ideport2. Memory module become very unstable. Check the detail I posted.

Definetly not that.
