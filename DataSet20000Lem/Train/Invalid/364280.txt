Specified URL is a website that is leaving strange result when using the enclosed search function ("Sök produkt" in upper left corner).

When submitting the form using Fx 1.5.0.8 two additional 'x' and 'y' variable are shown in the URL, which value are correspond to the cursor's x y position over the image submit button. Some time these value are 0 when clicking on the image submit button.

These field are not present in the HTML-code, nor is JavaScript using.

(I'm the web developer for the site)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://flugbutiken.se/
2. Simply click on "Sök" button in upper left corner without typing anything into the box.
3. Watch the URL in the adress bar.

Actual Results:
X and Y variable are added to the URL, which value are correspond to the cursor's x y position over the image submit button. Some time these value are 0 when clicking on the image submit button.

Expected Results:
X and Y variable not present.

I suspect that add-on like "Web Developer" might be involved.
