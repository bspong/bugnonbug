When I enter a search string and click a google icon, it default to
www.google.ni - Niceragua?! which is infuritaing since I don't speak spanish. I
am currently in Norway, so I guess that someone typed. ni instead of .no ?

Ideally, however, since I am british, I would like an option to specify my
preferred google - www.google.co.uk

Keep up the good work, chaps.

best wishes,

Graham
