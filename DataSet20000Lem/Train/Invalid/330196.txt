"Copy Image Location" with RFC2397 (data: URI) image
Currently, "Copy Image Location" on a right-click on RFC2397 image copy a blank string into the clipboard. I think the menu entry should either be removed, or the current page URL be copied to the clipboard instead.

Example RFC2397 image: http://xrunhprof.free.fr/rfc2397.html
