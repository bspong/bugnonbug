Password Input Field Grows
When loading any site with a standard form generated username/password field, the password field (only) will grow in width by several pixels. The username field will remain the same width. This happens ONLY in FF 3.5/3.51 and doe not occur in previous FF version or any other browser for that matter.

No specific URL but rather any web site with a standard input field for username/password is affected.
