When applying an XSLT transformation, the content of <head/> (such a the title) get rendered in the main document window a if they were specified in <body/> if the output method is set to "xml". i.e.:

<xsl:output method="xml" version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" omit-xml-declaration="yes" doctype-public="-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd" indent="yes" media-type="application/xhtml+xml" />

Changing the method to "html" fix the problem, but this seems broken since XHTML is really XML rather than HTML (which doesn't require tag to be closed).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Request an XML document which link to an XSLT stylesheet that set the output method to "xml" and output's an XHTML document containing <head><title>Foo</title></head>

Actual Results:
The title appears in the main window a if it were part of the <body/> rather than appearing in the window titlebar.

Expected Results:
The resultant XHTML should be parsed a if it were received directly from the server.

Selecting the whole page and viewing the selection source show that the XHTML ha been generated correctly
