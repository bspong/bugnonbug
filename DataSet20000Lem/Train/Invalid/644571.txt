I install Firefox 4.0 by overwriting the directory of 3.6.15. I found several bug a follows.

1. I can not organize my bookmark in Firefox 4.0 because the bookmark manager disappers!
2. I can not open certain page which are shown on another frame via popup.
3. Please keep the menu order when right-clicking a mouse. The first item in 3.6.15 is "opening in another new firefox" and the second item is "opening in another new sheet(window)". But, 4.0 change the order! I believe that most people can not get used of it!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Installing Firefox 4.0 by overwriting the directory of 3.6.15.
