a window to add a new bookmark ha no title bar and non-center position when trying to add a bookmark. Bookmark is added automatically, even when escaping from the window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open any web page
2. add to bookmark (either through menu or ctrl+d)
3. window to add a new bokmark appears
Actual Results:
The window ha no title bar or a window border. The position of the window seems to be at the end of the address bar, not in the center of the screen or the main firefox window. If I don't interact with the 'add-new-bookmark' window, either by pressing escape or by clicking in the main window, the bookmark window disappears but the bookmark get added anyway. In fact, it seems to be added at the time I press ctrl+D, not when I click Done. Also, the button 'Delete' doesn't make sense, because I haven't added the bookmark yet, I am just contemplating adding.

Expected Results:
Version 3a7 worked fine and a expected. Unless I click OK on that window, I don't expect to see the bookmark in the bookmarks.
