For some reason I have a 1 1/12 inch grey border with a little red arrow in the lower left corner. No way to minimize or to get rid of it. Also my book mark on the tool bar disappear until i close it down and reopen the browser. I have netscape 8.0 and MS explorer. Just upgraded to service pack 4 for window 2000.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just open up the browser
2. I also get my favorite bookmark disappear sometimes.
3. I have to reopen the browser to get back the favorite bookmark in the toolbar.




I should have only a quarter of inch border on the bottom of the browser.
