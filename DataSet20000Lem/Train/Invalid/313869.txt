I have two FF window (A and B) open. When window A is active and I select text in window B (without first clicking in the title bar of window B), the text is not moved to the clipboard when I press command-c (copy) eventhough it seems window B is active.
I have to explicitly select window B before selecting and copying the text.

Reproducible: Always
