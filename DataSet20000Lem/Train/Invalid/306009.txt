Conversion of &amp; to & while opening links.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050524 Fedora/1.0.4-4 Firefox/1.0.4

The W3C XHTML 1.0 Strict Standard want all variable in a GET query to be
separated by &amp; and not &. Even if the user specifies &amp; Firefox make it
& and thus the newly opened page give the error of being "not compliant to W3C
XHTML 1.0 Strict"
By clicking on any image at
http://students.iiit.ac.in/~anurag_rana/pics.php?album=shop, we get a link with
problems. If we click on the "W3C validator" on that page, it tell u that it
not W3C XHTML Strict. If we change the link to "&amp;", it works. Really
annoying to see that a "correctly formatted" page is shown "not correct" because
of this so called "conversion of &amp; to &"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open http://students.iiit.ac.in/~anurag_rana/pics.php?album=shop
2.Click on any image.
3.
a.Click on the W3C XHTML 1.0 validator image on the page.
b.Change the & in the URL to &amp; and then click the validator.


Actual Results:
Case 'a' give bad result and 'b' give good result. (Refering to step above).

Expected Results:
The link opened with Firefox should not convert &amp; in the URL to &.
