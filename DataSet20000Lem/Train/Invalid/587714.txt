When invoking window.open(sURL,'_blank') from a popup, the tab doe not open in the current popup window. There are three simple page using only client side javascript to reproduce this error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a popup from a main page using window.open(sURL,'newwin')
2.open a new page from within the popup using client side javascript's window.open(sURL, '_blank').
3. the 3rd page doe not load in the correct window in a new tab
Actual Results:
1.open a popup from a main page using window.open(sURL,'newwin')
2.open a new page from within the popup using client side javascript's window.open(sURL, '_blank').
3. the 3rd page doe not load in the correct window in a new tab

Expected Results:
The 3rd page should open in a new tab within the same window.

Using the anchor tag and right clicking to open in a new tab doe not produce the error. There is no server side code used by the php pages. I also tried to maintain a variable referencing the popup window in the parent (calling) window that the code int the popup could use to try to load the last (3rd page) into the popup window, but this did not work.
