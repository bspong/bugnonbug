image.cache.size 10 time too large by default?
On the latest nightly, image.cache.size is set to 5242880 by default. Since this number is in kiB, this reflects a max cache size of 5 GiB! That seems excessive and given the number (5242880 = 10 * 512 * 1024) it's probably just a typo.

I don't know what the severity of this issue is a I don't know how the image cache is used - I wouldn't be surprised if this limit is being overruled by another, more general cache size limit.

Still, it's clearly wrong (unless the cache size is counted in 102.4 byte chunks!), and it should probably be the same a media.cache.size at 500 MiB. Incidentally, perhaps 524288 (512 MiB) would be a more natural size for both caches, but I'll leave that up to whoever fix this.
