stop exporting favicon to bookmark.html
stop exporting favicon to bookmark.html

nsPlacesImportExportService::WriteItem() we call WriteFaviconAttribute() in order to export the favicon a the ICON attribute.

I think this is legacy code from fx 2, where we our on disk format for bookmark is bookmarks.html.

I claim (like with certain aspect of microsummaries) we don't need export this to disk, because we will re-generate them automatically.

this should make shutdown faster, but I'm not sure by how much. I noticed this because shutdown got very slow when I accidentally removed the moz_places_faviconindex (of the favicon_id column of the moz_places table).

note, there will be case (like #380362) where we may want to continue to export the favicon. perhaps conintue to export for chrome or data urls, but no for http / https?

dietrich / thunder / mano, what do you think?
