Scotia Online (banking site) stall after loading the page header
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061019 BonEcho/2.0

Page rendering (or perhaps download), stall during the loading of Scotia Bank's online banking site.

This seems to be a Linux only bug. I have tried loading the site in various environment and the following load the site just fine:
- Firefox 2.0 20061021 window build
- Internet Explorer 6
- Opera 9.02 linux (on the same computer)
- Safari 2.0.4
- Firefox 1.5.0.7 Mac

The site stall on both at home (cable) and at the office (fiber) with 3 different system (Debian unstable, Slackware 11.0, and Gentoo) on the following:
- Firefox 2.0 20061019 linux build
- Firefox 1.5.0.7 linux

I posted about this issue on mozillazine, however one person using linux did not experience the problem, so I'm not sure what's going on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the URL
Actual Results:
Only the page header load (e.g. http://devrandom.com/test/firefox/scotia.png [they have updated their page design slightly since that screenshot wa made]). The throbber show that the site is still loading, but it never finish loading.

Expected Results:
The whole page should load and be displayed.
