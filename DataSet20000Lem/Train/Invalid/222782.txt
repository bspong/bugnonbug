1. Open tool menu
2. Select Options
3. Select "Web feature Tab"
4. Under Javasript, click the "Advanced" Button.
5. Look at the window

The First line of text show a "Move or resize existing wind..."

Opened a larger window. And the window must be resizeable. If someone is using
larger fonts, even if the window is made larger, it may not be big enough. All
window should be resizable, no matter how small or simple they are.

I have large font selected
