This happened after I installed 1.5 overtop of 1.0.7 without uninstalling 1.0.7 first. Either the status bar is too big vertically (or some blank space wa added beneath it), the bookmark toolbar is blank despite there being bookmark in the bookmark manager, the throbber won't stop spinning, and the help menu disppeared. The Stop button also is always active but won't stop the throbber. I also uninstalled all incompatible extensions, then uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox and there wa no change.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Witness the horror

Actual Results:
The layout of the browser window is off kilter in the way described in the details.

Expected Results:
It should look like how you would expect Firefox to look.

I had been using the Pinball theme before upgrading, and now it's using the default theme because the theme manager say Pinball is not compatible with 1.5. The computer is running Windows XP SP2 with no prior issue with Firefox.
