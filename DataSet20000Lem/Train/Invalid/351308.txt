If you double-click on selected text while shift is pressed, all content of the closest block-type parent container will disappear. Usually the closest defined background-color of a parent of the disappearing box will be used to fill. The bug is also triggered by double-clicking with Shift pressed when no text is selected.

This succeeds in making the content of textarea tag disappear, amongst others.Inside a table, only the clicked cell disappears. In lists, only the <li> element vanishes.

Any amount of text (even a small a a single character) will work, if many poential container are selected, only the clicked one will disappear. Multiple container can be made to disappear so. Using next/previous page button won't fix the problem, but reloading the page will.

It's quite possible therehave been report on this already, but I couldn't find them.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select any quantity of text on a webpage
2. Double-click on text (except links) while pressing shift

Actual Results:
see bug description abve
