Firefox 1.0+ instability and crash when Adblock block page load
Whenever Adblock prevents Firefox 1.0+ from loading a whole page, the active tab
dy and Firefox becomes unstable

To Reproduce:

1. Uninstall your previous version of Mozilla Firefox
2. If you did not delete the Firefox directory with Step 1, delete all content
in the directory, with the exception of the plugins directory
3. Install a Firefox 1.0+ January trunk build (exe or zip distribution)
4. Launch Firefox and install Adblock v.5 d2 nightly 39 from
http://adblock.mozdev.org/dev.html and restart Firefox
5. Import into Adblock the filter list attached to this bug report
6. Go to web URL http://finance.yahoo.com
7. Click the "Finance Home" link in the upper right-hand corner of the web site.
8. Wave bye bye to that tab. Not only is that tab now unusable, it cannot be
closed apart from closing the whole browser. Other tab can be opened and will
remain functional unless they also meet with the Adblock filter of death!
9. This is not specific to yahoo and will happen whenever Adbock kill the whole
window. To illustrate, open another tab in the same window and go to
http://www.wmplugins.com/ItemList.aspx?GroupID=1
10 Click the "Creativity Fun Pack for MP9S" link under the "Enhancements"
column. Now under "Download Sites" click the "Download Full Pack (2.7 MB)" link.
11. Boy, I sure hope you hadn't stopped waving bye bye, 'cause that tab is gone!
12. Are you ready for some more excitement? I knew you were.
13. Leave that window open and click the File --> New Window menu item for a new
Firefox window.
14. Go back to the Firefox window with the screwed-up tab and close the whole
window.
15. "What!" You say. Yes; that's right. You have just witnessed a Firefox crash.
16. This bug doe not exist in Firefox 1.0 and previous.
