Clicking on most of my non-HTTPS toolbar URLs go to www.google.com (search page), and/or provides a message of a Google error and some codes. Upgraded from 3.6.5. Have un-installed and re-installed (and re-booted) numerous times. User IDs and password table are available. finance.yahoo.com is my home page (and ha been for several year of upgrades). After clicking on a personal toolbar icon that us https, it go to the correct http site. Then, clicking on the "home" icon take me to www.google.com search page. I CANNOT GET TO ANY OF my non-https sites, even if typing in the URL line. Cannot use 3.6.6 - must use IE8.
