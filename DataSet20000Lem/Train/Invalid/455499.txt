"Foxfire can't establish a connection to the server at view.atdmt.com.
Though the site seems valid, the browser wa unable to establish a connection." Can you tell me why I keep receiving the above message? This occurs for other site also.

How do I know? I am contacting you for information and possible help in preventing this problem.I expect Foxfire to be able to establish connection with this and other site when my computer call for them. Do not tell me "the browser wa unable to establish a connection. Many time the message "connection failed" show up behind behind what I am trying to connect to however it doe go ahead and connect. I don't understand this either!
