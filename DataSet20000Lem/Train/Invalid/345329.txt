Keyboard accessibility of Subscription Options "Change" button
Env: Bon Echo nightly build 20060718

Description:

Keyboard accessibility of the "Change" button in the Subscription Options dialog (also known a the "Choose a Feed Reader" dialog) should not be included in the Feed Reader selection list.

The implementation is very misleading. The button is found in the first line of the list of available feed readers, under the "Use a Feed Reader" radio button. When the line containing the "Change" button is highlighted, the button is not selectable, a the highlight implies. You must still press Tab to get to the button before you can activate it.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Tools, Options dialog and select the "General" page.
2. Select the "Choose Feed Reader..." button to display the "Subscription Options" dialog.
3. Select "Use a Feed Reader" radio button.
4. Press "Tab" twice to move focus to the list of reader below the radio button.
5. Press "Up Arrow" and "Down Arrow" key and watch the highlighted focus move up and down the list. Press
"Up Arrow" until focus move to the 1st item in the list. This is the "Change" button. It should NOT be in the list a implemented!
6. Press "Enter" with the first list item highlighted. Instead of activating the "Change" button, the default "OK" button is instead activated, and the entire dialog disappears.

Expected Results:
With the Change button line highlighted, a user would reasonable expect the "Change" button to be activated, thus opening the "Subscription Options" window should open allowing selection of a file from the Windows file system. This doe NOT happen. To make this work, the user must first press "Tab" to move focus to the button. Then the button can be selected with the "Enter" key.

Recommended Solution:

Remove the "Change" button from the list a currently implemented, so user are not led to believe they are selecting the button when they are really not.
