I just installed Firefox .9 RC (on 2 machines). I have been running .8
1) when I start it up I get a .dll error (sorry i didnt record it)
Rebooting seemed to fix it. As doe uninstalling and reinstalling...
2) The new install wipe out your existing bookmarks. I keep mine backed up but
this is going to be very bad for the average user!
3) Side Note: the 1st and last screen of the installer still say firefox .8

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install on window
2. start firefox
3.
