This is from Bug 587908 Comment 43

If you:
* Stop mousing and your cursor is over a link
* Load a page and your cursor happens to e over a link
* Give a link keyboard focus

The target URL will remain in the location bar indefinately. After 5 to 15 seconds, the target URL should be hidden. It'd be nice if this delay were user configurable (or at least easily modified by an extension), but not necessary.

Also, once the target is hidden again, moving the cursor should not immediately show the hovered link again.

Reproducible: Always
