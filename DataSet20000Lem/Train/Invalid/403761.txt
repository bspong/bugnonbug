[10.5] Help menu open very slowly
In Minefield on OSX Leopard, a click on the "help" menu take about 10 second (!) until the menu actually open up.

This may be caused by something related to the "spotlight"-like field now present in help menu on OSX, but I don't know.

This is reproducible for me. Am I the only one having this problem?
