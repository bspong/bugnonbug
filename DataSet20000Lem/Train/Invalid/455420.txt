After having the Facebook page open for 20 seconds, Facebook chat doe not work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into Facebook
2. Take note of the Facebook Chat on the bottom bar and make sure it is enabled
3. After about 20 seconds, it will disconnect
4. Control-F5 will make it work again, where it will again disconnect after about 20 second
Actual Results:
The chat doesn't connect and you get the following Facebook error message: "Could not connect to Facebook Chat at this time"

Expected Results:
Chat should not stop working

I'm assuming it's something that with the AJAX that doesn't keep the connection alive. It work in IE and Google Chrome. I have JIT disabled.
