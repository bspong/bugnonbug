URLs with encoded character are shown with the original characters, but when I type anything other into the URL, the character are not sent the way they came from.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any article (or even main page) in chinese wikipedia.
2.Take note of the title
3.Add anything at the end of the URL
4.Press Enter
Actual Results:
The error page show symbol instead of the original title plus what you added in the URL after it.

Expected Results:
The error page should show the original title plus what you added in the URL after it.

It seems Firefox 3 Beta 4 will decode what wa sent (by links), but not encode them back in the same character set.
