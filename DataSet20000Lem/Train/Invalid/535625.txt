After using AIRMILES search, clicking on a heading result in "The Connection wa reset" error
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; GTB6.3; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.0.30618; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.5.6

I use the AIRMILES search process (which us freecause.com ) and Yahoo search engine.
After getting a list of results, when I click on one of the result it show "waiting for search.freecause.com", repeat this several times, then give the "connection wa reset" error message.

N.B. The problem first arose immediately after the previous update to Firefox were installed. It worked fine before that.

One possible difference with my system is that I wa not able to install Windows Vista Service Pack 2.

If I use Firefox to go to the Google website and do a google search. It work fine.

1.enter a phrase in Yahoo search box on the AIRMILES panel
2.hit "enter"
3.click on one of the result
Actual Results:
Problem loading page
The connection wa reset

Expected Results:
