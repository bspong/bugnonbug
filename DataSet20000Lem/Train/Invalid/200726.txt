The image manager window description say "sites from which image are or are
not loaded". This is a bit sloppy. If "load images" is checked you should write
"sites from which image are NOT loaded", if not checked "sites from which
image are loaded". I suggest adding the terminology "whitelist" and
"blacklist", in parenthesis, at the end of the related sentence.
