Work on improving firefox's acid3 and html5 scores, google chrome (and safari?) outperform fx in both acid3 and html5.

google chrome: acid3=100/100
html5=217 +10 bonus

Fx: Acid3=97/100
html5=190 +9 bonus

i put (and safari?) because many source on the net claim that safari outperforms both Fx and chrome in acid3 and html5

Reproducible: Always
