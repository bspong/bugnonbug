One of the ad currently in rotation at the URL attempt to install a piece of
spyware. This cause Firefox to display an unending stream of Javascript
dialog ("CLICK OK TO INSTALL IE PLUGIN") a long a the page is in view.

Furthermore a series of "missing ; before statement" error appear on the
Javascript console, although perhaps this is because the hijacker write poor
Javascript.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf to URL above
2. Reload a few time until offending ad appears
Actual Results:
Unending stream of spyware-derived javascript dialog

Expected Results:
Avoid said dialog

I realize there's only so much one can do if the user visit a shady site. (Of
course, it wasn't classified a a shady site in my book until this morning.)
But I wonder if this is real misbehavior in Firefox, i.e. if the dialog is only
supposed to come up once. For hopefully understandable reasons, I'm not willing
to load it in IE to find out.
