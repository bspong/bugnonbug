The tray select for a HP4500 leaf the tray you set it to and go back to auto select - even though you pressed save for that printer driver. The auto select will
not print without forcing you to go and press button on the printer - essentially the tray select feature is quitting by reverting back to auto select which doe not select correctly. I've tried many many way to fix this many way but can't. I've saved each individual driver variation but it still loos the Tray-1 setting going back to autoselect that is not working. This happens at random times.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to paper feed options.
2. Select tray 1.
3. Print.
4. Save the settings.
5. nest time you print it ha reverted to auto select but should be on tray-1.
