Firefox worked yesterday, will not work today.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to load from programs/firefox/firefox.exe...nothing happens.
2. Attempt to load from programs/firefox/firefox(safemode)...nothing happens.
3. Attempt to run a administrator...nothing happens.



I terminated some service (and put some others in 'manual' mode) in Vista yesterday to reduce it memory footprint. And (or course) I did not keep a list of item changed. Please advise which service or group of said Firefox relies on.

Explorer still work btw. :-(
