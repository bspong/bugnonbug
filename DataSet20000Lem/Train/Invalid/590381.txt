Upon restarting Firefox 4b4 from the last session (option set to : show window & tab from last time) with two window each with multiple tab open,one also including several app tabs,the window with app tab froze,as a result couldn't switch between open tabs,also some navigation bar button (bookmarks button & some custom one a feed and BetterPrivacy) were missing,moved back to the customization box.I had to close the window & restart the browser,also dragging lost button in the navigation bar again-on restart it all worked again,except tab order wa slightly altered.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open two windows,each with multiple tabs,one with several app tab (a couple of custom button should also be placed in the navigation bar)
2.set option to: remember window & tab from last time,exit Firefox
3.restart browser
Actual Results:
Buttons were missing in the navigation bar,after dragging them back in place the window with the app tab wa frozen:impossible to switch tabs,other function like bookmark still worked,close button worked making possible to restart the browser.

Expected Results:
Browser should reopen window & tab from last session,navigation bar layout should not change,tabs should neither freeze or shift position.

Tab candy enabled (button dragged to the navigation bar),but -apparently- not in use at the time this issue surfaced.
