This page text wa set in pt so a it overrrides users' browser setting and
allow them to read the help document. Many user set their text size to larger
or smaller by mistake and cannot properly read the site content after doing so.
In order to paliate this problem, a page wa designed with constant text size.
FIrefox seems to bypass the setting of the font size in pt and applies the text
resizing command from the browser, thus negating the usefulness of the page itself.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to provided URL
2.Set text size to very small
3.Observe that text becomes unreadable despite the font size value set to pt.



Expected Results:
The software shoudl allow text to remain at constant size whe set in pt, despite
the modification of the font size.
