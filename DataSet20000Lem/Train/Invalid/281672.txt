I'm generally running multiple firefox window a well a many tab between
them. I noticed that if you do File -> Exit on any of the Firefox windows, it
will ask to close the tab on the current firefox window and then on the other
firefox windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up 2 Firefox window
2. Open the Firefox window with multiple tab
3. Within either Firefox window click File -> Exit
4. Firefox will ask you to close the tab on the current window and then the other.
5. Clicking "Close Tabs" will close both windows.
Actual Results:
Both window close.

Expected Results:
File -> Exit should only close the current Firefox window.
