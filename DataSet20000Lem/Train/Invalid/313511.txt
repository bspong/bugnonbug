getCellText(row, column) used by tree view's doesn't appear to be working correctly in FF 1.5 BETA 2. Arguments have changed?

Works fine in FF 1.0.7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View attached testcase using FF 1.5 BETA 2
2.
3.

Actual Results:
No cell have text. JS Console generates error :

Error: this.columns[column] ha no property
Line: 87

Expected Results:
Tree should show data a defined in the 2d array, 'datatable' in the case of the testcase. getCellText() should return the proper value given the row and column from the 2d array.

This render several application Ive developed for organization useless, and Id imagine the same is for other remote XUL developers. Because of this Ive set the severity to Major.
