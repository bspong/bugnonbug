Screenshot with Fzirefox 7.0 B1 high memory usage

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:7.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0
Build ID: 20110816154714

Steps to reproduce:

I opened two sites:

www.gmail.com
www.filehippo.com

and the Firefox 7.0 beta 1 memory usage went upto 2.5 gb, though this version claim to have memory usage reduction and improvement


Actual results:

I checked the usage of memory in task manager and see 2.5 GB occupied by firefox with only 2 tab open.


Expected results:

firefox should not have used so much memory with 2 tab open.
