Kernel panic from Cisco VPN and internal network website
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110322 Fedora/3.6.16-1.fc14 Firefox/3.6.16
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110322 Fedora/3.6.16-1.fc14 Firefox/3.6.16

This is an annoying one to repro, but here's my info:
- Fedora 14
- No plugins besides the default
- Tabbed browsing disabled, google.com a homepage, otherwise default setting
- Both time happened on internal network (VPN) sites, but I access said
site all the time.
- Dell Latitude E6410 (hope it doesn't come down to that, haha)

Steps to repro:
1. Open a single browser window and go into about:config
2: Find browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash and set it to false
3. Close Firefox and reopen. (habit of mine so I'm sure it's saved)
4. Just browse for awhile like normally. Eventually the OS will kernel panic. First KP happened when clicking a link, second happened when clicking a button that take me to a different page. (no ajax tricks)

Happened to me twice before I changed the browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash setting back to true in a similar fashion, and it hasn't happened since. Both crash session lasted under an hour, whereas I've gone five hour since changing it without incident.

While it's a slightly outdated version of firefox vs. what's in the FC14 repository(by five days), the fix list didn't seem to acknowledge this issue.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
see details. reproducibility would be more like "happens every time, but take random amount of clicks/time"

Actual Results:
Kernel panic

Expected Results:
No kernel panic
