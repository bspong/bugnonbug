Opening the url http://www.rockbox.org/irc/rockbox-20050527.txt pop up Firefox'
download-dialog even though the webserving is specifying the mimetype
text/plain. The file includes 6 non-printable characters, but I don't believe
this warrant ignoring the mimetype specified by the server.

Reproducible: Always

1. Open url http://www.rockbox.org/irc/rockbox-20050527.txt
2. That's it
3. There is no 3.
Actual Results:
Firefox open it "Save or open with" dialog.

Expected Results:
Display the file-contents a text/plain a the server specified.
