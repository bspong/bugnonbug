status message field doesn't show additional detail other than link location

The Status Message Field at the bottom of the screen doe show link location,
but is missing additional detail that some link use. I noticed this on
http://www.kanjisite.com/html/start/jlpt/4/practice/index.html
If you click on any of the quiz listed there, the intended function of the
setup they have is to show the pronounciation and english meaning of each kanji
character in the message field when you hover over it. It also show the
pronounciation of the whole word when you hover over the small Japanese flag
(red circle) and the word's meaning when you hover over the British flag.
However, when I go there in Firefox, it only show "Done," which make it
impossible to use. I'm sure there are other site with similar errors, but I
can't think of any other example off the top of my head.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the website I linked or another website that ha a similar function.
2. Click one of the quiz titles.
3. Hover the cursor over a kanji image or the small Japanese/British flags.
Actual Results:
The Status Message Bar simply continued to show the "Done" message.

Expected Results:
The Status Message Bar should show a message with the pronounciation/meaning --
for example, if you click the Time Expressions #1 quiz, the first row should
show "ichi-one" "ji-hour" "ichiji" and "1 o'clock" respectively when you hover
the cursor over the first character, second character, Japanese flag, and
British flag.
