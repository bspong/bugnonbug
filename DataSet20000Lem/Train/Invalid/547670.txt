Since Upgrade from 3.5 to 3.6, Firefox is only loaded the first two directory in the startup list. I've tried moving the first two entry at the end (as below), rather than than at the being,in case some character wa causing the truncation, but still only the first two URLs are loading. No message about invalid URLs either - just two tab with the first two entries.
