localStorage cleared when clearing cache data only under some conditions, profile specific
STR:
1. have an offline-allowed web application that store some data to localStorage
2. open the "Clear recent History" dialog, switch to "Everything" and check only "Cache"
3. localStorages for all offline-allowed web application get cleared

Expected one of these:
a. localStorage is erased when deleting cooky only or better:
b. have a new section (check box) for deleting "offline application user data" because the localStorage data stored by an offline app is nigher a cookie nor a cache data; this should also be option for data in a structured database when we introduce it
