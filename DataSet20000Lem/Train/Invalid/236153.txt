firefox profile 'in use' if hdd is full
User-Agent:

Whilst working with Firefox, editing file and creating an extension, I found I couldn't start up Firefox... it claimed my profile wa in use. I assumed I'd broken something and went searching, taking about 10-15 minute (including a consideration of reinstalling Firefox) before I realised my hdd wa full.

Tagged this a a minor bug because I can't see it happening too often, however I consider tagging 'normal' since there is no workaround until you realise what's wrong.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill hdd to bursting point (ie cannot create anymore file - even 0kb)
2. Start Firefox
3. When profile manager come up, select your profile.

Actual Results:
Alert box:
Firefox cannot use the profile "Zarius because it is in use.
Please choose another profile or create a new one.

Expected Results:
Alert box should have informed me that I wa out of hdd space.

It assume that since Firefox cannot create "parent.lock" in the profile directory (due to full hdd) it assumes one is there already...
