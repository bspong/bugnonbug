In vBulletin, whenever I try to type in an alternate character (such a Alt+0189 for ½), the browser automatically selects the Forum Index link at the top of the page (in this case "Music & Musician Forums") after hitting Alt+01. Numlock is on, and other site (and forum software) allow me to create alternate characters.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Register a username on the Sputnik Music forums.
2. Enter any thread in any listed forum.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, which is where the Quick Reply box is located.
4. Type in Alt+1

It should move to the top of the page, click the forum index link, and go back to the forum index.

Actual Results:
It took me to the top of the page, clicked the forum index link, and brought me to the forum index.

Expected Results:
It should have allowed me to type in an alternate character such a Alt+1 = &#9786;

I'm currently using the Mostly Crystal (ver. 1.5.0.17) theme.
