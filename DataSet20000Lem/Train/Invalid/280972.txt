Three small, but essential navigation tool are missing in Firefox: an "Up"
button, a Clear location bar button, and a close button in each tab.

The Up button would be located around the Back and Forward button (to the
left), and function a follows when clicked:
1)If you're on a page with a query string in the URL, strip it and load the
new URL.
2)If you're at a page with a file at the end of the url, strip the file and
load the new URL.
3)If you're at a page with a directory at the end, go up one level, and load
the new URL
... or something to that effect; you get the idea.

The clear location bar button simply clear the location bar to allow you to
quickly and easily type in a new one. It would be located probably to the left
of the Location: label.

The close button on tab should, at the very least, be a configurable option
versus the "master" close button at the right of the tab bar, a it is now. I
would submit that the "master" close button make it easy to close the wrong
tab, a the button doesn't have any visual cue to which tab you are closing;
and it's easy to think "I want to close X tab" when that tab isn't currently
active, click the close button, and then, after it's too late, realize you
closed the wrong tab. Also, a tab button directly on the tab allows you to
quickly close tab that are not currently active without switching to them,
thus saving time.

I realize most or all of these feature are available in Extensions, but I
contend that these are basic, highly useful, and intuitive element of
navigation that should be included out-of-the box. Konqueror, for instance,
ha these control and I find I'm able to navigate much more quickly using
them.

Thanks for your time!
