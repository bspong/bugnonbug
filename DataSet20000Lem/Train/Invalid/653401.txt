I keep trying to update Firefox with the new 4. version, but it doesn't update! I download the program, and place the icon in the folder icon, a instructed, but nothing happens, and I remain stuck with my old 3.6 version. I constantly get prompted to update from 3.6, but that is also not successful What's going on here?

I'm running the latest version of Mac OSX (10.6.7)on my MacBook Pro.

I'll appreciate your help with this
