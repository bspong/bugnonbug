Hi,

i am using the bookmark synchronizer 3 plugin. My bookmark are synchronizing with the bookmark synchronizer 3 plugin. I do have a subfolder located in the bookmark toolbar folder. After the synch. is complete i can't access "properties" in this subfolder (with a right click). I only get: open, open in a new tab, open in a new windows. It doe work within windows, but i won't work in linux (i am using ubuntu, kubuntu. I've tried it with the ubuntu package and also with the source code from mozilla.com. Also i've verified it on two different machines.

When i am open a new Window everything work a usual.

I know this bug isn't that big of a deal. But it's a little bit annoying cause i use this subfolder for online comic witch change very often :D

Also when the bookmark are synchronized you have to restart firefox to get him recongnize the change (this also isn't needed in windows)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use bookmark synchronizer 3 plugin
2. use a subfolder in the bookmark toolbar
3. synchronize and try to access the property dialog directly from the toolbar

Actual Results:
only open, open in new window, open in new tab is avaiable

Expected Results:
everything including property should be avaiable

only seems to happen in linux
