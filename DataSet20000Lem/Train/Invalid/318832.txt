After building Firefox 1.5 final from source (Gentoo Linux), I found that it still ha the "Deer Park" branding all over it instead of Firefox; kind of undoes all the good work put in to advertise the Firefox brand.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build Firefox 1.5 final from source
2. Run Firefox
3. See branding, say "WTF is 'Deer Park'?"

Actual Results:
* The window title say "<blah> - Deer Park".

* "Help, About Deer Park" say "Deer Park version 1.5".

* "Edit, Preferences" say "Deer Park Preferences", "Deer Park should check
to see if the default browser when starting", "Determine how Deer Park
connects to the Internet" etc.

and so on.

Expected Results:
Firefox branding!

The file at fault appear to be:
./browser/locales/en-US/chrome/branding/brand.dtd
./browser/locales/en-US/chrome/branding/brand.properties
and possibly:
./browser/app/macbuild/license.r
