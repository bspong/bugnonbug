image onloads trigger more than amount of image on page

If I have 10 images, each with an onload event that increment a counter, the counter equal (much) more than the amount of image on the page.

It is working correctly in 3.6.3, IE8 and Chrome.

In the example I provided, the alert show the current tally of loaded image on the left, versus total image on page.

In any other version or browser, the tally max out at the amount of images, a expected. In FF 3.6.6 it go well beyond.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Female model
2. Click on a model to view portfolio
3. Let the image load and take not of the alerted amount
