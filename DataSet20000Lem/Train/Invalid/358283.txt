Opening a window using window.open () doe not make possible to get focus on a blured window :

opened_win = window.open (...)

onXXX = "if (opened_win != null) opened_win.close()" work
onXXX = "if (opened_win != null) opened_win.focus()" not (worked in previous version)

Reproducible: Always




Creating dialog with window.open is not really useful if the dialog disappears backside the principal window. And alert() are so small ....
