I have found this happening quite a bit - if you go to a particularly long page then Firefox will freeze until the whole page is loaded. Whilst frozen you cannot do anything, including changing tabs, using the menu or even switching back to Firefox if you move to another application. Once the page is loaded, Firefox tends to 'catch up' with whatever you've clicked.

The freeze only start after a certain amount of the page ha been loaded, i.e. a the page begin to load I can still interact with Firefox a expected, but when it reach a certain threshold the app freeze until the whole page ha been downloaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a long web page, e.g. the one in the URL field of this bug.

Actual Results:
Initially during the load you will be able to interact with firefox, but once it reach a certain point Firefox will freeze until the load is complete.

Expected Results:
No freezing. Firefox should work a normal regardless of the page size or content.
