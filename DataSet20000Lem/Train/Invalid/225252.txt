All of my dialog seem to be broken. They display what appears to be the
content of some semi-random buffer somewhere. I am working with a fresh install
of the GTK2 binary of 0.7

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firebird
2. Help->About Mozilla Firebird

Or

2. Bookmarks->Add to Bookmarks

Or

2. Edit->Find
Actual Results:
I get a strange yellow dialog with red text. The about dialog display just a
caret ("^") when I start up. It sometimes also say "0y" (or maybe "Oy", a in
"Oy Vey!") with a caret underneath. The caret make me think I am looking at
debug info from somewhere. The caret always is under the first letter.

The add-bookmark dialog say "dow.arguments[2];" and no bookmark is created.

The find dialog ha a longer string. I will post a screenshot. Right now the
find dialog is not coming up at all.
