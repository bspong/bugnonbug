From yesterday the winstripe button had their padding reduced to make them le
spaced out however the amount by which the padding ha been reduced mean that
in small icon mode the icon are tiny and quite hard to hit (see attached).

Could the padding be increased again slightly please?

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get new nightly
2. look at icon in small icon mode
Actual Results:
Icons now too small and hard to hit

Expected Results:
Icons should have a bit more padding on them
