Import Wizard fails to work when profile is in other path
I'm sharing Firefox profile for two machine and profile are on
F:\D&S\USER\Profile\Firefox\ProfileName . When I downloaded and runned new
nightly with Import Wizard it:
1) Displayed possiblity to import from Mozilla but failed to go on after
pressing button "next"
2) Created new profile in C:\Documents And Settings\USER\Application Data
instead migrating info about profile location from Phoenix one.
