When I open a link in a new window (holding shift) my toolbars move around
I have the following extension installed:
WeatherFox
Gmail Notifier
Adblock
FoxyTunes

When I open a link in a new window, Foxytunes (normally docked at the top) move
to the bottom. This cause the window to be too wide and doe not fit on screen
without moving the FoxyTunes bar somewhere. Screenshots available on request.
