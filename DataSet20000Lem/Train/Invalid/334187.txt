A new (to me, anyway) item in the Bookmarks dropdown menu, "Site Documents > "
lock Firefox when clicked. "Site Documents" doesn't appear in the full time (left side window) bookmark list. I can close Firefox with the upper rt corner X button, but it still appears on the running process (ctrl-alt-del) pop up. I can close it there.

Site Documents appears to be an index of all the page in the www directory. I'm not sure I like that. I have lot of unlinked page on my site, available only to people who know they are there. I don't want folk browsing my trash, if you know what I mean. I do like Firefox. Keep up the good work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click Bookmarks drop down menu
2.scroll down to "Site Documents"
3.click "Site Documents"
4.wonder how I can reinstall the prior version of Firefox

Actual Results:
Firefox locks, sometime totally, other time I can close the window, but the Firefox.exe process remains alive, in that I can't restart Firefox without going thru the ctrlaltdel close the process window. Other bookmark link work OK.

Expected Results:
I've never seen "Site Documents" before. I'd rather you didn't include an index function in Firefox.
