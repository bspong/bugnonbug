Since installing the Firefox 3.6.4 beta, Firefox will hang during attempt to watch video on site such a youtube.com (not exclusively). I am running the Flashblock 1.5.13 extension. After clicking on a Flash video to disable Flashblock, I click on the video, so that it will begin to play. As the video begin to load, Firefox will hang. I cannot induce any response from it by clicking on other tabs, menus, and buttons. The only way to close Firefox is through Task Manager.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit a website with playable Flash-based videos, such a youtube.com.
2. select a video to watch.
3. click the 'play' button in the Flash window to disable the Flashblock extension for that element, and click the 'play' button on the video.
4. if Firefox doe not hang, attempt changing playback option (advance playback, full screen, adjust video volume, etc.).
Actual Results:
Most often (4 out of 5 attempts), Firefox will hang a soon a the video start to load. If the video doe begin to play without hanging Firefox, attempt to 'fast-forward' or otherwise alter the playback condition may cause Firefox to hang.

Expected Results:
The video should play without causing Firefox to hang.
