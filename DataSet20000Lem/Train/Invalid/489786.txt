I woke up my mac from hibernation and firefox prompted me for an "update". There wa a problem with the proxy server and so when I told it to go ahead and do the update it failed. After fixing the problem, there wa no option available to:

1. Go back to the update dialog.
2. Request "check for update now" from preference or anywhere else.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Fail an update.
2.Attempt to go back to the update request.
3.Attempt to manually trigger the update check.
Actual Results:
If the update fails for any reason, you have to go to mozilla.com and manually download the update.

Expected Results:
"Check for update now" in preferences, like just about every other program with an update mechanism.
