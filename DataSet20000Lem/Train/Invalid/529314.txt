Problem is PERSISTANT. Problem span multiple machine
[WinXP, Vista, Win7 CentOS 5.4]


Steps taken to resolve the issue:

1) Deleted all cerficates from server
2) created CSR and private key
3) created certificate from CSR @ Cacert.org
4a) added Cacert root certificate to CA section of plesk
4b) added certificate generated from my CSR by CaCert.org

5) Tested https: Result -- Failure -- (Error code: sec_error_revoked_certificate)

6) removed all CaCert.org certificate from firefox, re-installed them from thier site pem's

7) tested https: Result -- Failure -- (Error code: sec_error_revoked_certificate)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IE Has similar problem, but is relegated to untrusted CA, but allows the user to continue forward to the website. Firefox however doe NOT allow the user to continue to the website.

Conclusion:

With valid, non-revoked SSL certificate installed properly on the server, and proper CaCert root certificate installed in firefox. I can only assume that Firefox is doing one of the following things:

A) Flagging CaCert certificate a revoked automatically
B) Trying to connect to ocsp.cacert.org and not being able to thus revoking the certificate locally
C) Confusing expired / revoked certificate with renewed, new, valid certificate

Or, CaCert ha inadvertently added valid cert to their OSCP responder, or creating invalid response wich firefox is interpreting a revoked certificate

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Re-create server certificate using CaCert.org a CA
2.attempt to access HTTPS site
3.
Actual Results:
Issue still prevalent

Expected Results:
Successful request to accept / review certificate in question or availability for client to proceed to site ignoring security concern

This is a fairly new issue. Latest update of firefox may have been the culprit, or perhaps issue with CaCert's OCSP responses.

I feel that SOMETHING is severely wrong. As client may chose to disreguard / disable OCSP setting in the future to gain access to thier favorite site again. This may not be a large issue to some, but to others such a myself, this issue could be detrimental to doing business, or securing user / user information digitally.

The server ha been fully functional for several years, this is a recent occurrence. No major change have been done to the software / hardware for over 6 months, issue presented itself 1 week ago, and ha continued.

HTTPS section of the site may not be accessable to client outside of the LAN. This is a security precaution, and should not interfere with SSL communications.

Server software:
CentOS 5.4
Plesk 9.3.3

4x Intel P4 2.8ghz
