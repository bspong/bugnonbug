The alert that appears in Firefox 2.0 when all downloads have been completed is
attached to the current location of the start menu. In previous versions, the
alert appeared in the lower-right corner of the screen, and this is still the
location if the start menu is on the bottom. However, if the start menu is on
the top of the screen, the alert follows it to the top-right corner. Since this
is a change specifically made for 2.0, I know there must be some way to change
it, but I cannot find anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move Start menu to top of screen or one of the side
2. Complete a download and allow the "Downloads Complete" alert to popup.
3. Observe changing location of the alert.
Actual Results:
The alert follows the location of the start menu.

Expected Results:
The alert should stay in the bottom-right corner.

Occurs in all tried theme with all tried extension combinations.
