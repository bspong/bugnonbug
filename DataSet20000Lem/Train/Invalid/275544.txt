Javascript RegExp: escaped closing square bracket in character class not recognised
First: apology for the double-submit, I hit enter by mistake.

Problem:

Trying to write a simple Javascript function to escape string in a
regex-compatible way, so eg.

'[foo]' becomes '\[foo\]'

I wrote a pattern like this:

var pattern = new RegExp( '([\]\[\}\{\^\$\*\+\?\.\(\)\|])', 'g' );

And nothing happens. But take the escaped closing square bracket out and it
work fine (except obviosuly, it ignores closing square brackets!). Seems like
it's interpreting the cloing bracket a if it's closing the character class.

Here's the function (broken in Firefox, work in IE:

function regex_escape( subject ){

var output = '';

var pattern = new RegExp( '([\]\[\}\{\^\$\*\+\?\.\(\)\|])', 'g' );
pattern.multiline = true;

output = subject.replace( pattern, '\\$1' );

return output;

} // END function regex_escape()

As a PS, you'll also find that if curly brace are entered in order '\{\}' it
will think it's an enumeration -- so you have to put them in reverse order
'\}\{', which works.
