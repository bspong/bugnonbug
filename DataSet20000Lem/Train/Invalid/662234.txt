What happens in browser right now:
1. After broswer restart all the tab duplicate
2. One instance of duplicated tab is inactive and can't be accessed. It doesn't respond to clicks, middleclicks, rightclick
3. After restart other tab instance is empty. Clicking "reload" helps.


Reproducible: Always
