Originally, I had my homepage set to http://www.google.com/linux. When I
re-opened Firefox, it automatically went to http://www.whatuseek.com. I have no
idea how or why. I've went through and cleared all cache and cookies,
everything else that ha a "clear" option. That didn't work. I've even
uninstalled Firefox, and deleted the entire /home/(me)/.mozilla/firefox folder.
Then I reinstalled, and even with an empty homepage preference, Whatuseek still
came up. Now, if I click on the HOME button, It will load in my choice for
homepage.

There is no reference for Whatuseek.com, except for in my History list. I
downloaded the Cookie viewer extention, and the only one I can see in there, wa
the Google homepage setting. I do get file for it in
/home/(me)/.mozilla/firefox/l7ndcnz4.default/Cache.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Hard to say. I'm guessing this is from a page that I've browsed along the way.

Actual Results:
http://www.whatuseek.com load up.

Expected Results:
Load up my selected homepage, not whatuseek.
