In Mozilla/Firebird when a style is applied to a <colgroup> or a <col> in a
table the style are not applied to the <td> element in those columns. The
only style that seems to be able to be applied is the background. Anything
affecting text, padding, margins, et cetera is not inherited by the cell in the
column.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Just try and apply style to a <col> or <colgroup>
Actual Results:
Nothing, except when you applied a background.

Expected Results:
The style applied to the <col> or <colgroup> should be inherited by the table
cell in those columns.
