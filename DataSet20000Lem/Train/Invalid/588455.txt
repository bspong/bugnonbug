Minefield 4.0b5 pre on Mac OS X 10.6.4 on iMac Intel Core 2 Duo 2,4GHz

It is not possible to drag and drop file from Mac OS X Finder onto a Java applet embedded in an HTML page.
This applet ha drag and drop capability that work well under Safari 5 or Firefox 3.6.x. This applet is a signed applet.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unfortunately, access to web page in which this applet is embedded is protected by a login, so there is no way to try it.
Actual Results:
Files dragged and dropped from Mac OS X Finder onto the Java applet interface are not "accepted" a dropped file (as if drag and drop wa not handled by this applet which is not the case).

Expected Results:
Under Safari 5 or Firefox 3.6.x, the same Java applet accepts file dragged and dropped from Mac OS X Finder, so I expect the same result on Firefox 4.
