After downloading latest version of FireFox several error occurred in my usual internet functions. I use Firefox a my default browser on a 1.5 meg broad band DSL connection from Quest telephone. We use Google for our e-mail and top tool bar item such a spell check and bookmark from mozzila. When we used to access my google e-mail several thing were in color we still have some item in color but many others are now grey scale. For example when we click "compose mail", before new rev. firefox today if i clicked the letter a in the send to box a scroll down menu in blue would appear of the most frequently used address from my address book and i would pick one right click it and it would appear in the send to box. Now that drop down list is light grey not blue and meld in with the background black list of mail in my "in box" and is not readable.
Also with the spell check feature if i wanted to spell check a posting i would make on a forum board on a website i used to get all the word google felt were mispelt high lighted in yellow--no more now they are just underlined in grey and the drop down choice are the same grey a the original letter making it unreadable. Same story in my "Market Watch" sample stock portfolio. Used to be the current price were flickering blue and now they are grey scale. We still get photo and drawing work in these website in full color. We tried removing Mozilla from our PC and redownloading the whole thing no help. Please do not force me to go back to inferior AOL.
