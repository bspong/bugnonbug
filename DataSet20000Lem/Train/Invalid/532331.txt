In the PrefPanel, you can show the password without typing any password.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
If you enter a Master Password, it ask you anytime you want to use a password.

Expected Results:
You have to enter the password just to see all the password but not to use it.

We could ask the user about level of security he needs.
It is le easy to read the password in the password input than to read it in the prefpanel without asking any password.

We could choose between secure (As now for each use, ask the password), middle (Ask the master password just to display the list of passwords), nothing (as now without asking anything)

Most of the user doesn't know that anybody can read there password.
I think we should ask for a Major password a soon a we save on password in the database.
