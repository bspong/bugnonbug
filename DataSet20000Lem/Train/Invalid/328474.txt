Once i visit a page a one above (www.americasarmy.com) window pop out and say "Shockwave Flash, the plug-in performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to restart Firefox".
Once i click OK and check "Do not show this warning again" i can continue browsing but animation made in Shockwave just wont be shown.
I've tried to play some game made in Shockwave and i CAN. It's just animation on web page then.
I've already reinstalled Firefox 1.5 and Shockwave 10 and it's still there. I've also installed ActiveX plugin.



Reproducible: Always
