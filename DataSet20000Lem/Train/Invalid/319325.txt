Versions of Firefox in the 1.0.x line had difficulty using the freetype library installed with XOrg-6.8.2 (& GTK-1.2). The fix I received here wa to disable freetype and enable Xft, even though the doc said Xft required >GTK-2. That workaround seems to work fine. FF1.5 configure error out with "enable Xft" and GTK-1.2. Your system requirement still say GTK-1.2 is a minimum requirement. Does that mean we can't have freetype fonts?

(No, please don't tell me to install GTK-2. This is a lightweight system on a Pentium-I and I really, really want to keep the overhead to a minimum. GTK-2 and it dependency are over twice a big a GTK-1! Some of u can't afford P-4's or Athlons.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install GTK-1.2, XOrg-6.8.2
2. Set .mozconfig to disable ftreetype, enable xft
3. Try to compile
Actual Results:
Error message that GTK-2 is required for Xft.

Expected Results:
Successful compilation a FF1.0.7 does!
