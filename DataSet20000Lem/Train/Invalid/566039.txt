User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3

When using my profile the session restore doe not work on Linux. When I afterwards use FF 3.6.3 for Windows the session doe restore.

Even when I make change (in tab and loaded pages) under Linux, they are not stored.

I made a test by deleting sessionstore.js and sessionstore.bak. But under Firefox they were not recreated, like under Windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Remove sessionstore.js
2. Open Firefox
3. Open a number of bookmarks, each in a separate tab.
4. Close Firefox.
5. Open Firefox (see the tab are not loaded)
6. Look for sessionstore.js, and see it is not stored.
Actual Results:
sessionstore.js is not loaded or stored, so the tab and loaded page are not stored after a session ends, or loaded when it starts, while it function under Windows.



Expected Results:
Tabs and loaded page should be stored after a session ends, or loaded when it starts, like under Windows.
