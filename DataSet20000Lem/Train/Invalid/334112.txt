Middle-clicking Places icon should open Places view
I'm searching for a way to open the Places window quickly.
Currently clicking Places open the popup. Then you need to go to the bottom of the popup and click Organize.
When you first do a search in the popup you also need to do two click to go to Places (see bug 333969) so this is a similar bug I think.
