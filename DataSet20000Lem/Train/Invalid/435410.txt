This problem happens only with FF3.0/Gecko 1.9 (nightly builds, beta5, RC1);
This error doe not happen with Firefox 2.x nor with Opera for Linux.

Test reproducible under with "safe mode" and with a new profile.

Tried to "diff" the HTTP Headers (using the FF extension "Live HTTP Headers") between FF 2.x and FF 3.x (RC1) and found a few differences, mainly that FF 3.0 report "text/html" whicl FF 2.0 report "text/plain" somewhere during the information exchange with the server (sorry, not an IT expert, I'm a physician!).
