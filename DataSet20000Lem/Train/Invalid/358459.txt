complete tabs/address bar/new window failure - minimal usability

After installing Firefox 2.0 tab have stopped functioning, opening a link in a new tab result in a new blank tab which cannot be closed. With a different tab highlighted, the address bar still only affect the first (only working) tab. The address bar doesn't update when a link is followed and the 'open in new window' button doe nothing. The backward button is constantly disabled (linked to the address bar problem?). I uninstalled all add-on but the problem persists.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install/Run Firefox 2.0
2.Open link in new tab/window
3.

Actual Results:
Tab fails to load page or window fails to appear

Expected Results:
The linked page should have loaded

I know this report is sketchy and probably useless, but firefox is completely unusable for me now and I've no idea why.
