PC FastForward is a new program out there. They slam your system with a setup from Lycos to alway take over your bookmarks. they install another unrelated setup called sidestep to take over the bookmark so that your setting for keeping your bookmark in a sidebar is ruined untill you figure out how to remove it. first go to add remove program then get rid of the PC FAST FORWARD in add remove programs. then close window reopen system. load firefox and lookunder history and get rid of a unknown program by the name side step remove it and you then can reload it all and have your sys reset. You have now gotten rid of Lycos and pc fastforward. take care dray
