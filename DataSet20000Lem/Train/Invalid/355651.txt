"Here's the diff I used in my analysis. For each chunk, I appended a comment
explaining the bug(s) it come from and whether we need to do anything with it
(i.e. apply a branch patch to the trunk).

To extract just those comment plus the file they apply to, run the following
command on this file:

egrep 'diff -uNr|@@' bookmarks-changes.diff"

I'll re-attach his patch.
