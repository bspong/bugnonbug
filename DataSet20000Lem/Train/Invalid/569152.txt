Personas have an Enable button that allows you to switch between them, but Themes do not. Currently, the only way to switch Themes that I have found is to close Minefield and open an older version of Firefox in the same profile, switch the Theme, close Firefox and then reopen Minefield. Sorry if this is a duplicate, I could not find a bug listed for this.

Reproducible: Always
