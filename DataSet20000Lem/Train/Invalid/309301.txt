Locationbar doesn't select entire url when gaining focus

In previous version of FF (<1.5) the url in the location bar got selected when
a user click inside it. With 1.5 this is no longer the case and that is
seriously wrong from a usability perspective. Mostly user want to type in a new
url and therefore the url need to be selected first before it can be cleared.
Now you have to click 3 time in the bar (or painfully aim at the icon in front
of it, which is by far *not* obvious) to select the url and to be able to
replace it.

Please fix this. It is wrong how it's done now.

Reproducible: Always
