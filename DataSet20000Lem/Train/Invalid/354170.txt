No field seem to be wrapped in the element properites window (the one that you get to by right-clicking on something on a page and selecting "properties" from the context menu). This make it difficult or impossible to view long strings, a you can only (easily) make the window a wide a the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with a link to a 200-character URL
2. Load the page, right-click on the link and select "properties"


Actual Results:
The window is not wide enough to see the entire URL--you have to stretch it.

Expected Results:
It should wrap, or maybe there should be a horizontal scroll bar.
