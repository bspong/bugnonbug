Firefox ha become buggy, not what I expect. Have downloaded and updated to Flash 10.x several time both through Firefox and at other site's prompts. Firefox doe not recognized 10.x Flash and is repeatedly hanging up on any javascript calling for new page. Plug-in updater say all are up to date. Maybe related is that Firefox will not open a new window, only new tabs. Frequently doe not terminated when Exit. have found instance in process of two firefox.exe but only one window open. After closing open window in normal way have to go in and terminate the second one before Firefox will open again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open add ons, attempt to update Flash. No update forthcoming.
2.Websites say only work with Flash 10, download now. Say yes, download & update. It's in program file but not recognized by Firefox.
3.This version,3.6.2 (who know when it came out, there are so many), will not open whatever javascriptvoid(0); call for



I block pop-up window and select on individual basis what to allow. Javascript enabled. Pages load automatically. Have a theme but happens with or without.
