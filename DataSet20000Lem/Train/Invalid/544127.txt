Since downloading Firefox 3.6 4 day ago,I frequently get the "Well, this is embarrassing" message. This happens when I am opening a new session. Not trying to restore previous session.

Also the pop up blocker is ignoring exception I put in. Turning off pop up blocker also doe not work. The tab freeze or hang when I expect a pop up new window. Some site I can get around the bug by opening in a new tab. But other site don't give this option.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start up XP (SP3)
2.Start Firefox
3."Well, this is embarrassing" message appears

Pop up blocker is a separate issue. Applies when using "Log In" to https://apps.standardlife.com/content/applications/portal/customer/customer_index.html
Actual Results:
Start up problem I get around by using start new session button.

Pop up blocker problem I cannot get around.

Expected Results:
Normal Start up of new session.


A new window should have popped up.

I also run Zone Alarm security suite version 9.1.008.000

10 day ago my computer refused to start window at all. I had to go back to an old restore point and then update all programs. This happened I believe, a a result of installing MS Office 2010 beta. Don't touch it!
