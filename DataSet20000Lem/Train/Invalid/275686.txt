Some suggestion for Items on the Help Menu

Firefox version of the Camino Bug 167428 "add access point from
Help menu to release note and readme (milestone-based)"

At present, the Help menu ha items:

[Help Contents][Promote Firefox][About Mozilla]

Examples of good help menu include Filemaker Pro

[FileMaker Pro Help][Contents and Index][FileMaker on the Web][Send
Feedback to FileMaker][Register Now]

and BBEdit

[BBEdit Help][BBEdit User Manual][Glossary Reference][Grep
Reference][Preferences][Search Reference][Bare Bones Software Web Site][Bare
Bones Software Tech Support][Register Your Copy of BBEdit][BBEdit Release
Notes][BBEdit Support FAQ Page][BBEdit Product Updates Page][BBEdit Developer
Info][Check for Update]

Now whilst there may be room for improvement on both of these, they do act
a pointer for what the Help Menu should contain.

I have not been able to find a Bug for suggesting item on the Help Menu, so
I am proposing to start this one, the idea being that people can add
their suggestion here.

[Firefox Help Cmd-?]
[Help Contents]
[Firefox User Manual]

[Firefox on the Web]
[Firefox Mozillazine]
[Firefox Support]

[Searching the Web]
[Finding Text on a Web Page]
[Web Development Best Practices]
[Troubleshooting your Internet Connection]

[Firefox Release Notes]
[Firefox FAQ]
[Firefox Updates]

There are a few other thing needed, but you will probably get the idea
of providing safe entry point into the Mozilla web site, access to
local documentation and simple guidance on using Firefox, and one simple,
appropriate way to seek support.

I would also suggest removing the link to 'Reporting Bugs' from the
http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/ page (my intended destination
for the sixth item on my list). There could be a new link created
to 'See Bugs Reported Today' which wa on the Suite, and I liked
for it proof that the process of pushing Firefox forward is alive
and well; and in this context, the suggestion that Bugzilla should
be read rather than posted to.

If possible, it would be good to have link to Bugzilla (particularly
any that might encourage submitting simple request a bugs) only from
page marked a Developer Info.

Nightlies and Debug build should include such info or link (something
which wa also in the Suite).

I have thinking on these line for over a year, and I wa hoping to
submit a complete patch to Camino (that project is Panther only); but
what stimulated me to post today wa coming across this message
on Bug 275362 "'Report Issue' in Help menu",

Comment #2

Bugzilla is a tool for the developer and it's no support database.
A "normal" user want support but support bug report are invalid.
A user must also read
http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html ,
check for dupe et cetera before he report a bug into bugzilla.

Your bug report also show that the bug reporting quality is not
very good: No Build ID/Version (such an entry could be already
added), wrong severity, wrong component.

which I suggest could be cleaned up (if necessary) and placed on either
a support page such a I one I mentioned above, or a Bugzilla page. I
wa looking for this text to paste into Bug 275037 "crash with webster.com
site".

Getting Support Requests out of Bugzilla (in the sense of not getting them
in here in the first place) is really a two way process, see these article
which may be a little elementary for the readership here:
http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/149/ and
http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1082/

(I am not sure that there is yet a Mozilla Web Development Best Practices
Page anywhere on the Web, again it is something that I have felt the lack
of for many months, but there is one for Safari which read a though
it wa written by a Mozilla developer originally ...)
