Getelementbyid('id').innerHTML="this" doesn't work unless "id" div tag already contain something...

The following html work fine:-

<div id='helpcontent'>Help</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--

var whichHelpPage="$helppage$";
opHtml="<font class='normal'><br>";

switch(whichHelpPage) {
case "home":
opHtml+="The Homepage consists of the following page squeezed
into one easy to digest bite:-";
break;
default:
opHtml+="The Homepage consists of the following page squeezed
into one easy to digest bite:-";
break;
}
opHtml+="</font><br><br>";
document.getElementById("helpcontent").innerHTML = opHtml;

// -->
</script>

But if you remove the initial content from the div at the top leaving

<div id='helpcontent'></div>

Then the getElementById("helpcontent").innerHTML method report

document.getElementbyId("helpcontent") ha no properties...

I /think/ this should be considered a bug and I've searched the list of known
bug but not come across this. Please forgive me for wasting your time if this
is one of those case where IE is too forgiving and that this is correct behaviour!
Cheers!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

2. Remove the initial content from the div and try again, it doesn't work..
3.

Actual Results:
Firefox report
document.getElementbyId("helpcontent") ha no properties...

Expected Results:
It should have substituted in the variable I wa passing in:-

document.getelementbyid("blah").innerHTML = htmlStuff

htmlStuff - into the DIV.
