On Mac, hover doe not distinguish between main button and dropdown
The new "pill" hover effect on the back/forward button always show a a user hovers over the button, with no differentiation for when they hover over the drop-down itself.

The pill effect should only be shown when the user is hovering over an area where a click will show the drop down instead of moving back a page.
