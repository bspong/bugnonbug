Fri 10th April 2009 wa working all day online. All wa well apart from two crash while opening new tab (reported via crash reporter).

Sat 11th April 2009 opened mail, received incoming mail. Opened Firefox and wa informed of a Babelfish update (1.83). Clicked 'install', then 'continue'. Went to my site, opened another tab or two and wa then presented with a 'time out' message. A few moment later a pop-up with exclamation mark said:

10.100.0.123 in use by 00:11:7c:0a:1e:9a, DHCP Server 10.100.0.65

Meanwhile my Mail software went offline a well. But only seemed to be my gmail account (although some from my personal domain were affected too).

I quit them both and restarted a few minute later. Began googling for info about DHCP problems. During which Firefox, at 10:25 gave me this message:

10.100.0.122 in use by 00:11:7c:0a:1e:9a, DHCP Server 10.100.0.65


Meanwhile my Mail programme wa still online and working away (imap account were still live), so I figured it wa a FF issue... and the only thing that wa different wa the new Babelfish 1.83

Disabled Babelfish and restarted FF. All seemed well except that several of the tab didn't open until I went to them individually and hit 'refresh'.

Then tried to reproduce the issue by enabling Babelfish and restarting... but it seems intermittment.

10:25am FF gave me this message: 10.100.0.122 in use by 00:11:7c:0a:1e:9a, DHCP Server 10.100.0.65 (Babelfish enabled)

Disabled Babelfish, restarted FF and browsed without issue for quite some time (trying to find out how to post a bug). Read about recreating the bug so enabled Babelfish again and restarted FF. Page Load Error problem occured again after perhaps 3 or 4 tab were open.

Restarted again at 11:27 and FF gave me this message while reopening: 10.100.0.123 in use by 00:11:7c:0a:1e:9a, DHCP Server 10.100.0.65

Disabled Babelfish again and browsed without issue.

Enabled Babelfish and began browsing again on 4tabs. Reloading one of them caused a 'Page Load Error'. Phone rang, came back at 12:22 to find:
10.100.0.125 in use by 00:11:7c:0a:3d:08, DHCP Server 10.100.0.65

Strangely it seems that I could click 'okay' and keep browsing this time (whereas before everything seemed to freeze).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable Babelfish 1.83
2.Open perhaps 3, 4 or 5 tab
3.Refresh some of those tab or open a new one to a new site
