Firefox auto forward (kidnaps) me from one URL to another

I cannot help this: After I select a web page using a bookmark, which apparently doe not exist anymore, something auto forward me to another URL. This happens so fast, that I cannot even move back to the former URL and edit it. I searched registry for trace of some devious autoforwarder, to no avail. I cannot resolve this on my own.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to (for example) http://www.poelking.com/wbuch2/DO-400/enew400.htm
2.
3.
Actual Results:
From the above URL Firefox forward me to:

http://urlseek20.vmn.net/search.php?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.poelking.com%2Fwbuch2%2FDO-400%2Fenew400.htm&tbn=vendio&type=404&lg=en


Expected Results:
Stay on the same URL!
Of course when "back" operation is applied, do not ignore it.

URL http://www.poelking.com/ is a valid and living URL.
I searched registry for something called "urlseek" for "vmn.net" and many similar keywords.
