Many of u in IT use self-signed certificates, and my online tutorial have been hit ten of thousand of time by commercial and government user worldwide. Firefox 3 Beta 5 treat them (verbally, the message on the screen) a errors, rather than a bona fide and legitimate us for openssl by IT professionals, for special purposes, test machines, and limited-audience venues. Please change the message to be le error-oriented. Firefox 2.x handled it more appropriately, IMHO.
