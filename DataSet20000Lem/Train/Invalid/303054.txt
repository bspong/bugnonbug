When I middle-click on a link to open that link in a new tab, sometimes this
work a expected, other time nothing happens at all. I've not been able to pin
down precisely what cause it to sometimes not work. It ha something to do with
the page containing the link, because i.e. on slashdot.org or vg.no it fails to
work (most of the time, *not* always) whereas it work fine (all the time) on
google.

It also work fine when I try with firefox 1.0.2.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit for example slashdot.org, vg.no or dagbladet.no
2. Middle-click on a link.

Actual Results:
Nothing.

Expected Results:
Link should have opened in new tab. This happens on most sites, and even some of
the time on the mentioned pages.
