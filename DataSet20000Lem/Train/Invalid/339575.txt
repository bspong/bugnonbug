Hi,

There is a problem when you submit a variable named "apos" a a second element in an URL. Firefox change this name to the char "apostroph". See this example:

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<a href="test.php?aid=1&apos=2>test with aid=1 and apos=2</a>
</body>
</html>

When you click on this link, the url is translated to:

a href="test.php?aid=1'=2

it seem that Firefox don't check for the trailling ";" after the "&apos" and this is why it translate this variabe to the char "apostroph".

Regards,


Reproducible: Always
