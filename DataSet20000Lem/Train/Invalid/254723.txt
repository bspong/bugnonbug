After logging into Hotmail, it "floods" my cable modem and shuts it down.

After logging into my Hotmail account, if I click on any link to manage my
account (go to junk mail, open mail, delete mail, empty) all of my cable modem
light lock on for about 5 sec., then they all go off and the cable modem
reboots. Sometimes I can get into my Junk Mail or my Mail folder fine but when I
try to delete or move something it happens. Other time a soon a I click on
the Junk Mail link it happens.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into Hotmail
2.Click on Junk Mail link at bottom (if it doesn't happen...)
3.Check a box to delete mail
4.Press Delete button at top of page

Actual Results:
My cable modem light all lock on, they all turn off, the cable modem reboots.

Expected Results:
It should have opened the Junk Mail page or deleted the piece of mail or moved
the mail.

I'm running a 3.2 ghz P4 HT, 1gb Dual Channel DDR400, Plex DVD-R/W, Plex SCSI
CD-ROM, Lite-On CD-R/W, 320gb of HD over three drive (160gb SATA, 40gb & 160gb
IDE), Adaptec 2940 SCSI card, GeForce FX 5700XT, Hauppage PVR-250, Creative
Audigy, Thermaltake 480w PS. The cable modem is a Toshiba PCX-2200 and the cable
is Brighthouse Cable in Central Florida.

I installed Firefox 0.8 and the problem did not occur. I have no plugins
installed and I just uninstalled 0.93, deleted directory and profile, deleted
registry key and reinstalled and it still happened. I tried with IE6 and it
worked fine also.
