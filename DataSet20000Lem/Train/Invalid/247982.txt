when i visit a new site and use a mouse gesture to open a link in a new tab, the
last site i visited open in the new tab. this only happens on the first link
that is opened per page. the best way to re-create this bug is to do a google
search. open a couple of the returned link in new tabs, then go to page two of
the google returns, when you now attempt to open a link in a new tab, the first
time you do it, page one of google hit will open rather than the link that you
were trying to open.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. do a google search
2. open a couple of the returned link in new tab
3. go to page two of the google return
4. now attempt to open a link in a new tab

Actual Results:
the first time you do it, page one of google hit will open rather than the link
that you were trying to open. the subsequent attempt to open in a new tab will
work a expected.

Expected Results:
the link that you were trying to open should have been in the new tab.
