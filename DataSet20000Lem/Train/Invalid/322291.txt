When you single-click on the URL bar of firefox, it place the cursor wherever you click. Is there ever a time when you single-click on the address bar when you don't want to select all? Most of the time, you click on the address bar to change, copy, or cut the address. All of these generally require the entire address bar to be selected. Would it hurt to have the entire address bar be selected on a single click? This is the default behavior of IE, and it's what one would think would happen when you single-click on it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Single-Click on the address bar.
Actual Results:
The cursor is put where you clicked.

Expected Results:
The entire URL should be selected.
