Firefox remembers window size, but for the wrong window.

Firefox remembers the window size (dimensions and position), and us that information when starting a new Firefox window instance.

When there are multiple window open, the window that determines the stored window dimension is the window that wa instantiated first. Instead, a a user, I expect the most recently resized window to determine the window size of subsequently opened windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Execute firefox.exe. A new window is opened. Call this "Window A".
2. Execute firefox.exe. A new window is opened. Call this "Window B".
3. Execute firefox.exe. A new window is opened. Call this "Window C".
4. Uniquely resize the dimension of Window A.
5. Uniquely resize the dimension of Window B.
6. Uniquely resize the dimension of Window C.
7. Execute firefox.exe. A new window is opened, using remembered window dimensions.
Actual Results:
The new window opened in step 7 ha the dimension of Window A, the first window instantiated.

Expected Results:
The new window opened in step 7 should have the dimension of Window C, the most recently resized window, or else use dimension of the most recently closed window.

This is pretty annoying for a multi monitor setup, where I might have a tiny "thumbnail" window open in the secondary monitor. If the thumbnail window is the first instantiated window, then ALL subsequently instantiated window will be the goofed up thumbnail size, no matter how many new window I open, resize, and close. It's impossible to save new window dimension until I close the thumbnail window.

IE and Chrome use the last window closed for remembering dimensions. This work much better and more predictably for the user.
