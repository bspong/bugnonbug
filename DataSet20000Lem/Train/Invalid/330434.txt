See only tree structure in property window on not bookmarked site
Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and on your homepage rightclick and choose "Bookmark this Page".
2. In the Properties window you'll see a tree structure of bookmark folders.
3. Now go to another page and call Properties window again.
Result: tree structure gone.

Tree structure is also missing when I rightclick on bookmark and choose Properties (or is this intentional).
