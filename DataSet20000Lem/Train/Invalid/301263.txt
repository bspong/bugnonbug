1) When I try to click on Extensions, Themes, or Options, they won't open.
2) There is a bar underneath the statusbar that, I'm guessing, shouldn't be there.
3) Before I open Deer Park Alpha 2, after it tell me which Extensions don't
work with DPA2, it asks me if I want to continue, or stop scripts.

Reproducible: Always
