Firefox 4.0 with download accel;erator installed, download sort and downloadhelper.
On the above url, right clicking a picture - the download sort will not fire and the trandfer doe not get made. (Context menu Item - Save Image as) - the same will work with image download II and Image toolbar -Just a script problem, I think.
On YouTube, the user is allowed one download of a particular video. After that no mor transfer of that title. If transfer is requested, Youtube sends "denial info" to host. The ff engine doe not interpret this correctly and shuts down ALL transfers/downloads, this happened 3 times, which triggered reinstall.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the page with these extension installed.
2.Right click on pic and save as.
3.For video, choose one that's already been dl'd. denial will be set.
4. Try dl from another site with audio or video, the Download manager should crash.
Actual Results:
In both case the extension should not operate

Expected Results:
The host should display denial dialog. Or the download should be permitted, extension should operate

The manager in FF should remain operating normally
