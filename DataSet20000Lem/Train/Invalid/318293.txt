i *think* the javascript mod function may be incorrectly implemented a it is returning negative result when mod'ing negative numbers. for example "-2 % 4" should evaluate to 2, but the result given is -2. this is the same for all negative numbers, you get the wrong answer (not sure if this is on purpose though for javascript, i haven't been able to find any information that say it is though which lead me to suspect it could be wrong).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type "javascript:alert( -2 % 4 )" into address bar
2. press enter
3. boom! you get -2.

Actual Results:
the result of the example to reproduce return -2 where i believe the answer should be 2. but this seems to be a problem for the mod of all negative numbers.

Expected Results:
should evaluate to 2

i am not sure if this implementation is intended or not.
