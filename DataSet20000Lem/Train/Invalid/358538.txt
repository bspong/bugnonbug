i typed ieee.org and then pressed Ctrl + Enter that took me to ieee.org.com
though it is known that Ctrl+Enter stand for .com but in this case browser could identify the extension mention by checking after the period(.) operator and not add .com

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
The browser should have taken to ieee.org rather than ieee.org.com
