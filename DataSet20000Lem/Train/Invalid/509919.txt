Hi all,

I am doing research a Masters thesis. My research question is it is widely believed that the open source community doe not do requirement yet it produce high quality product that can be presumed to satisfy stakeholder requirements. How can this be? Is it true? what evidence can be found in the archive an open source forum to answer this questions.i.e. how requirement are proposed in open source communities,how community people agree that this is what they need to develop and how can they document it, if so, whre is the proof? To find this i have selected Firefox a my product, have downloaded all the emials from mozillazine forum and analysed , but i haven't found any evidence. Any suggestion regarding this will be appreciated.i don't know where should i post this. please don't mistake me.
Thank you,
