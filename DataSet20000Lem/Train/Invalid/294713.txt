Firefox crash when I am typing text and I lose what I typed
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier:

On several different occasion I have been typing on a web page to fill out a
form. Always, I have done several sentences. Suddenly, I get a message from
Windows that Firefox ha a problem and must close. I close it, and lose my
work. This is so annoying that I have removed firefox until a way is figured
out to make it stop.
