When you open a locally stored XML file in FireFox with an associated XSL file to transform the XML to XHTML, the HTML tag do not affect the appearance of the output (not a they should at least). The DOM appears to be correct (using the dom inspector) but thing are just not displayed properly. This is especially evident with what I wa doing; making HTML tables.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an XML and associate XSL file which transforms the XML into some sort of table format.
2. Make media-type="application/xhtml+xml"
3. Open the XML file in Firefox.


Actual Results:
The table is not displayed at all, only the text is displayed.
The HTML tag have no effect on any of the formatting.


Expected Results:
The xhtml output of the transformation should be rendered a html.

It should be noted that when you save the page a an HTML file the page is saved a it should have been displayed. Opening this HTML file show the transformation a it should have been displayed.
