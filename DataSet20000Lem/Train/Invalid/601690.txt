When you try to save a file (via File->Save As, or right-click and Save Link As), if you include a question mark in the filename, the "Save" button becomes unresponsive and won't save OR tell you that you have an invalid character.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a link nearby; right click and choose Save Link As.
2. Type a filename that includes a question mark.
3. Hit "Enter" or press "Save."
Actual Results:
Nothing Happens.

Expected Results:
The file saves, with the question mark in the name, OR it ha behavior similar to when you include e. g. a colon (:): it tell you the file name is not valid. (would be nice if it said WHY too, but that's another issue).

Happens on FF 3.5 on Vista and 3.6 on Windows 7.
