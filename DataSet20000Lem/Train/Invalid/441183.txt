I use metacrawler.com's search engine a my mini search toolbar with Mozilla. Until a few day ago, I would type a string of word to search, using the search toolbar, and the word would stay intact, with the search being successful. Now, when I type in two or more words, the space are replaced with "%2B" at metacrawler's web page. Weird and annoying. Data doesn't transfer from the search toolbar to the web page.
Please help.
Thank you!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type in two or more word (such a "west coast") in search toolbar, using metacrawler.com a toolbar's search engine
2."west coast" becomes "west%2Bcoast" and throw off the search, every time
3.
Actual Results:
"tiny tim" becomes "tiny%2Btim" and the search result are strange...

Expected Results:
"john wayne" would come back a "john wayne", not "john%2Bwayne"
