75% of the time I load a page, it take an extremely long time to load
completely and some time it say (Not Responding) on the top of the firefox
window. It never get to the point where it like that so long I have to end the
firefox process, but it always take awhile. I have run many virus, spyware, and
adware tests, nothing show up. I even tried without running any other program
(even one in the background) and the same thing happens.
