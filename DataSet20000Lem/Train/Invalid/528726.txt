This issue is not site specific, but ha been occurring in at least the last two release including 3.5.5.

Problem: after search bar pulldown display on screen, it cannot be removed until FF is restarted. One or more "floating pull downs" are left on the screen.


I will attempt to attach a screen shot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a term in the search bar.
2. The search bar drop down with previous searches, and so on.
3. However, that drop down window is then stuck on the screen until FF is closed.
4. Even more oddly, if the browser width is changed, the pull down remains in the old position. So if another pulldown is invoked, it will also remain on the screen. So you can create lot of floating pulldowns.

Actual Results:
Bogus pulldown section remain on the screen

Expected Results:
Pull down should close or be able to be closed.

I noticed this several release back and on OS X 10.6.1. After upgrade to 10.6.2, it still occurs. However in my Windows VMs and boxes, have never noticed the issue. Seems pretty Mac specific.

Strangely, in searching for the issue, could not find anyone reporting it, which is odd since it is so blantant, and 100% reproducible.
