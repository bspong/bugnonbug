cannot find server
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: mozilla firefox 2.0.0.4

Whenever firefox auto update to version 2.0.0.4, I immediately get the message "Cannot find server", ie, it will no longer connect to the internet. I have uninstalled firefox from add\remove programs, downloaded the latest version from main mozilla site. Upon installing it, the same thing happens.
I fortunately had the installation file for version 2.0.0.2 saved on a portable device. As soon a I install 2.0.0.2, I can connect to the internet straight away. The same thing happens on firefox portable apps - 2.0.0.4 installs and I cannot connect to the internet, reinstall portable apps version 2.0.0.3 and I connect straight away.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Firefox version 2.0.0.4 auto update
2.Immediately an unable to connect to the internet
3.Reinstall earlier firefox version and hqave immediate internet access
Actual Results:
There are no special step - the 2.0.0.4 auto update (or new download of 2.0.0.4) will not work on my computer, but earlier version do without a problem.
There have been no change to the computer other than firefox 2.0.0.4 auto updating.

Expected Results:
I expect firefox 2.0.0.4 will connect to the internet, but it doesn't.
