Can't access complex preference from a bootstrapped addons startup() function [caused by JSONovich]
Ok, I'm not sure the bug title is entirely appropriate, and I'm not sure whether the addon manager is the appropriate place for this bug.

This wa initially reported at https://launchpad.net/bugs/867753

This started off when the reporter stated that the Accept-Language header in all of their outgoing http request wa set to the wrong value ("en-us,en;q=0.5"), despite the fact that intl.accept_languages wa set to the correct value according to about:config ("en-gb, en"). This is set to a complex value, with the real value coming from the reporter en-GB language pack addon.

We initially suspected that the bug wa due to the JSONovich addon, a the problem wa resolved after disabling that addon. However, further investigation ha shown that JSONovich doesn't appear to be doing anything wrong.

Note, than JSONovich is a bootstrapped extension.

What appears to be happening is that something in it's startup() entry point trigger the initialization of the nsHttpHandler service, and nsHttpHandler read and process the value of intl.accept_languages at this point. However, when this happens, no extension chrome ha been loaded - so the value end up being provided by the built-in en-US provider instead.

So, it seems that it currently isn't possible to reliably read complex prefs from anything which run inside the startup() function.
