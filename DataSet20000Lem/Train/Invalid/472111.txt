In other browser the page load perfect, but in the Firefox the page load wrong. This page ha three div float:inline and the browser load like Two in the left(the second onde down) and one in the right(and this down too!).
The correct is: |[DIV]-[ D I V ]-[DIV]|

Firefox loads: |[DIV]-----------------|
_______________|[ D I V ]-------------|
_______________|_________________[DIV]|


*I tried everything and nothing can fix this.

Reproducible: Always

1.Type URL
2.Loads the site
3.Firefoz load wrong
Actual Results:
The Divs of CSS load in the worng way, the first one is OK but the second down and tird load wrong too.

Loads the three Divs inline

In all broser that I load my blog everything is OK: IE, Opera & Google Chrome, i've already put a message in my home page. "This site load better in IE, Opera & Google Chrome". What hapend with Firefox, cant work with CSS?
I tried all possible thing that i can, different way with float, creat a table, resize the DIVs. Nothing work!
