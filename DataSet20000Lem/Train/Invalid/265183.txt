Installed FireFox on 2 PCs. Imported mozilla profile from 1.3 and 1.4. Both
version displayed Personal ToolBar Folder a expected, organized in folders.
After importing from both into FireFox, the Personal ToolBar Folder display
only the bookmark in the first folder.

I'll post some screenshots of Mozilla and FireFox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Delete Profile Directory (if it exists)
2.Run FireFox
3.Select to Import from NS/Mozilla

Actual Results:
Bookmark Tool bar is populated with bookmark that are contained within
folder within the Personal ToolBar Folder.

Expected Results:
I would expect the Bookmark Toolbar to be populated with folder (or drop down
lists, not sure what it's supposed to look like.)
