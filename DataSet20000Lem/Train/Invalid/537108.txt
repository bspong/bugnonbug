Wrong wording: "Remember my browsing history for at least".
The setting is the maximum number of day for which FF keep history. For example, if I select "5", then AT MOST five day of history will be retained. "AT LEAST" mean the least number of day is five (and the most ha no limit), which is not how the feature works.

The ambiguity may cause a security problem for users.

Suggested wording:
"Remember my browsing history for no more than"
"Remember my browsing history for at most"
"Keep no more than this many day of browsing history"
