New Window open a really old session with many old tab
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

I don't know how this happened, but whenever I do File -> New Window, or if I open Firefox while it is already running (again, that should open a New Window).


Actual results:

I get a window with old tab I closed month ago. It definitely look like an old session that is somehow stuck in Firefox. This problem wa in Firefox 5 a well.


Expected results:

Firefox should have openned a new empty window.
