Build Identifier:

I downloaded the 3.0.8 update and when it launched I received this error. I tried uninstalling firefox, downloaded the latest version (via IE), ran the installer, launched the program, and received the same error. I searched the bug page and could not find a report of this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update to 3.0.8 or install 3.0.8 from installer.
2. If installing, use either standared or custom install
3. Run application
Actual Results:
If I perform the step above, I receive a message box from "Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library" stating:
Program: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

This application ha reuested the Runtime to terminate in an unsual way. Please contact the application's support team for more information."

I did have my forcefully restarted overnight, however, by uninstalling and reinstalling, I do not see how that would play into it, though I thought I would mention it.

Expected Results:
Launched firefox
