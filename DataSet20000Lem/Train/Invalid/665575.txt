GCLI startup/shutdown function might be un-necessary
Questions:

- Does it still make sense to have startup/shutdown functions?
(The idea from bespin wa that thing could be dynamically pluggable),
however
- this is more of a top level thing, so pluggability isn't the same
- we might be able to do this with Domains anyway
- it make thing harder without a concrete usecase

In summary - we probably don't need startup/shutdown functions.

- There is initialization that need to take place in the correct order
How should we arrange for that to happen?
