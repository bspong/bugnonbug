Bookmarks lost after upgrade to Firefox 6.0 on SPARC Solaris 10
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; SunOS sun4u; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110812093811

Steps to reproduce:

I installed Firefox 6.0 for SPARC Solaris 10.


Actual results:

After that all my bookmark (from Firefox 3.6.x) are gone.

So I tried to restore one of the backup available in the directory bookmarkbackup. Nothing happened except for the deletion (as warned) of the only bookmark I've added after the installation of FF6 and before I discovered that I'd lost all previous bookmark


Expected results:

Firefox should preserve the bookmark (or reformat them if necessary). At least restoring a backup should be possible.
