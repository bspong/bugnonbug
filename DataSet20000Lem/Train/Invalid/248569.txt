I have built a form using PHP/Pear HTML_QuickForm_Controller and Smarty Template
Engine. It build 3 radio buttons. The default should be enabled a the source
code ha enabled checked. It is selected upon the first viewing of the page.
But when the page is reloaded once, the selection is changed and stay changed
on subsequent reloads. Sometimes SHIFT-reload will bring back the original
selection, sometimes not. Also, after the selection ha been changed, you can
redo the error by either closing the browser session or deleting the cookie that
is generated by the PHP session. Plus if you disable cookies, the page act
correctly. The HTML code is not changed by any of the reloading, the cookie
doesn't change the HTML in any way, except by changing the id to a randomly
selected id each time (this id change is done by Smarty).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page
2. Reload page once (selection should change)
3. Delete session cookie
4. Reload page (selection return to normal)
5. Reload page (selection change again)
6. Disable cooky and reload (selection return to normal)
7. Enable cooky and reload (selection change again)
Actual Results:
The selection changes. As you can see, I showed different way to change the
selection, all by just reloading the page.

Expected Results:
The selection shouldn't change

I have reproduced this bug in Mozilla 1.6
