Tool for replaying web session for profiling, performance tracking
I would like to be able to capture a session with a web application and replay it multiple time with multiple different version of Firefox, without touching any external server. This would be handy for eg tracking FF's performance on heavyweight web apps like gmail.

This could get a complex and fancy a you want it to. An initial cut could just replay HTTP response (perhaps with some fuzzy matching if the response doesn't exactly match the earlier response). Other possible capabilities:

- capture exact timing of the initial session and replay it with the same latency
- produce the same series of random number a in the original session (probably requires forcing the seed both during the original and replay sessions)
- lie to the Javascript about the date and time
- local storage, web sockets, mouse and keyboard event
- what else?

I started looking into this, but I'll be working on something else for a while. Up for grabs!

Note that another major component would be the capture of the original session. To a first approximation, it seems like the NetExport extension to Firebug doe this, although it need to be updated to HAR 1.2 so it can capture binary responses.
