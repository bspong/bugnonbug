When I try to load a HTML page from subversion server (which run on Apache
httpd) the page is displayed a "verbatim" HTML text (i.e. plain text with
first line starting with <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ....). Also, just mentioning
here that localized character in any page are rendered a "diamonds with ?",
since the browser doe not recognize the encoding (specified in meta-tag).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup subversion server using WEB_DAV on apache 2.0
2. Check in some HTML pages.
3. Browse the page over SVN WEB_DAV access.

Actual Results:
The page is displayed a "verbatim" HTML text (i.e. plain text with first line
starting with <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ....).

Expected Results:
I would expect it to be rendered a HTML instead. At least, this is what IE do.
I am not sure whether this is correct by standard, by this is definitely
desired.
