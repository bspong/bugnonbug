Right most tab never fully centered [caused by TabMixPlus]

This is a fairly minor bug, but it seems that you can never scroll all the way to the right in the tab bar to fully see the right most tab. The "x" for closing the right most tab can never be gotten to a a result. Again, a minor point, but still there.

I can submit a png screen capture demonstrating this if desired.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add enough tab that scrolling left and right are required.
2.
3.
