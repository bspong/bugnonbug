In all previous version of Firefox, there wa a single "X" for all tab in the far right of the tab bar. I have noticed that there is no option to re-enable that functionality.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Open a couple tab
3. Notice there is an "X" on each tab, not one for the current tab

Actual Results:
One "X" per tab

Expected Results:
Option to have One "X" for the current tab, a in Firefox <2.0
