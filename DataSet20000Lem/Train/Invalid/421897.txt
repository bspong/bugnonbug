Need a way to set the title immediately (SetPageTitle us LAZY_ADD)
follow-up to bug 419749

We have no way to change a page title immediately,
because SetPageTitle us a LAZY_ADD, while a third party user (and on our unit tests) we could check the title before it is actually changed.

The only way to set the title immediately is using AddPageWithDetails,
but still that requires that we also need to add a visit (transition_link).
We could modify AddPageWithDetails so that it add a visit only if
(aLastVisited), and maybe add a 4th param a transition argument since we could
want to add a first visit that is not a transition_link.

As a third party user, i could expect that setPageTitle is an immediate
change, since in the nsIGlobalHistory2 interface definition there's no comment
about lazy mode
