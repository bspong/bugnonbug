firefox request page in endless loop
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.2; WOW64; Trident/4.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1

I noticed a couple day ago that firefox (then 3.0.x) (now whats pasted in the build identifier) wa getting really slow and gmail would not work at all. Internet explorer worked fine and firefox in ubuntu inside vmware worked just fine a well. I started looking in wireshark and noticed that in the broken firefox, everytime i requeseted a page (GET /) that the page wa being requested in an endless loop. I tried this across multiple site and got the same behaviour. Only after exiting the tab or closing firefox did the request stop.

I uninstalled my firewall (comodo) and disabled my AV but have the same issues. I also made sure my machine wa syncing time properly and it was. Since it span multiple firefox installs, 3.0.x, 3.5, compplete uninstall/redownload/reinstall of 3.5, I think maybe it some file thats not removed by the installs or a bug I have just triggered in all version.
