In the latest version 3.0.6 we experience by automatic generating webpage using perl, that when first a java alert popup screen is shown (like <script language=javascript>alert("message")</script>), before building the html screen in the browser, the html screen is completly left completly blank after clicking away the alert popup. The to be shown screen is loaded in the browser, that we can check by looking to het 'source code' of that blank screen. Everyting work fine in firefox version 3.0.5 or lower, ie 6 or 7, safari and chrome...
