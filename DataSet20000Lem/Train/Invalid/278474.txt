Having "import bookmark" functionality in multiple location is confusing.
Attempting to import bookmark from camino on recent OSX build is an irritating
experience.

(1) User is tempted by the useless "import" option on the file menu.
(2) User see confusing dialog with missing text, but no helpful error message.
The "next" button is lit, but doe nothing when clicked.
(3) User must discover that, unlike all other popular browser on the system,
they must first export their bookmark into an HTML XBEL-like format.
(4) User then return to "import" and stare a while longer, trying to imagine
how they can convince the app they need to import a specific file.
(5) User ha a fit of cleverness and drill down into the bookmark manager, but
an "import" option is nowhere to be found.
(6) User google around until they find the firefox FAQ.
(7) User realizes that a *dialog* ha quietly altered the content of the file
menu to contain an identical looking "import" option with radically different
behavior. Success.

This exciting experience could be avoided with the following change:
* Make the import command on the main file menu a "split" wizard. Give the user
a choice between importing existing (autodetected) setting and importing from a
saved set of bookmarks.
* Adding autodetection and import of camino bookmark would be even better.

Given the volume of similar "importing from camino" issue in bugzilla, this
certainly isn't an isolated problem. I wa only able to figure out the issue
after a combination of slogging through bugzilla, google, and the firefox FAQ --
not exactly a "just works" user experience.

Thanks,
