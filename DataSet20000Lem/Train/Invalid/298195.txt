The synaptics v5.9 touchpad on the HP pavillion ze4500 doe not function
properly. When I try to use the touchpad, a small scroll symbol replaces the
mouse pointer, but nothing happens. The synaptics touchpad is suppose to be
able to scroll both horizontally and vertically. When attempting to scroll
horizontally, nothing happens, not even a scroll symbol for the pointer.

Reproducible: Always
