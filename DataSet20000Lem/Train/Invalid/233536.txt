Installer should not create duplicate icon
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

With Firefox, there's a problem where if you have a shortcut on the desktop or
quick launch bar, a duplicate is created when you install a new version.
The situation would be helped by bug 225641, however, I think it is a distinct
issue. I don't think the user should expect duplicate shortcut to be created.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox
2.Install a newer version of Firefox


Actual Results:
Duplicate shortcut are created

Expected Results:
No duplicate shortcut should be created, the installer should check for
existing shortcuts.
