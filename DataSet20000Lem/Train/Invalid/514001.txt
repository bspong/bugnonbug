a sex site is automatically activated, after clicking with your middle mouse button (MMB) in to the empty pane of a new tab. This is just the most simple version. You can get the same result, if you mmb click into an "empty region" (no text/image/flash) of a random website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a new tab
2.MMB click into the empty pane
3. an (x) is generated in the url, which is converted to http://x/ and then the search function generates a link to a sex site

Actual Results:
the mmb click forward to a sex site

Expected Results:
nothing, if i MMB click an empty region

usually this is a normal bug. But since i can't figure out, whether there are security issue involved, i decide to level up to major until the circumstance are clear.

env: opensuse 11.1, kde 4.3
ext: firebug, fireftp, firegestures, adblock plus, downthemall
