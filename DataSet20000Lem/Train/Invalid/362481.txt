Sorry if this ha already been reported but I couldn't find it doing the search. Sorry also for not knowing all the "teccy" word for the problem that follows.
I use Firefox a my internet browser which connects to google automatically. After I've clicked on the firefox icon on my desktop it go straight to JUPK. COM or Skenzo.com (dubious adult/gambling type websites)even though it ha Googles URL Address in the web search bar at the top. I've run my AVG virus checker, Skybot, Ad -aware etc. but they are not picking anything up i.e. no virus etc. I've also been on the Microsoft website, tried system restore etc. Can you help?

Regards, John
