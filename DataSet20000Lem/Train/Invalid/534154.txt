I need this in bug 534152. There I'm hiding the navbar without collapsing it children. (I'm not doing that because we'd end up either with a slow selector or with a solution that's not general enough and that wa rejected by Dão, see bug 461291 comment 9.)

I don't really the approach this patch take but I couldn't think of anything better. I'm open to suggestion :)
