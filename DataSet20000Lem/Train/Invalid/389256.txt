STR:

- Use a System where no profile for Firefox exists
- Start Firefox - Migration Wizard come up
- Select no Migration
- Autocomplete Box under Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> "Remember what i enter in form and search bar" is checked

- Delete your profile again
- Start Firefox - Migration Wizard come up
- Select Migration from IE
- Auto complete Box under Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> "Remember what i enter in form and search bar" is unchecked

I think the Option should be active like on other plattforms like mac.
