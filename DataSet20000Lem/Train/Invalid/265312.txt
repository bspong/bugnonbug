On various page on the web, Firefox load page to wide, forcing you to scroll
to read line by line. This is not the case with everyone, but I have test on
various OS's, PC's, and out of 10 diff PC's, it happened to 2+. If especially
happens strangely on the MOZILLA Forums, and also Spreadfirefox.com . The
mozilla forum seem to load about an inch wider then it should on page with
long posts, or something.

This link show people having the same problem a me, on the same page on the
forum a examples, and refreshes DO NOT solve the problem:

I view these page in IE fine, but FF continues to load these specific page to
wide on a consistent basic, I have run test and it happens precisely the same
and on the same page to other users, some of which can confirm a an example in
that forum topic alone. This really is embarrassing. Mozilla put down MS for
not running to standard and theyre site not working on other browsers, when
Mozilla's own site is not working for what seems like a reasonable amount of
Mozilla users, on the mozilla site, worse - IE load them fine.

If is the same pages, refreshes do not fix it, others have posted confirming,
and I have also ran tests, either the site in question have a problem, or the
browser. You may not be able to re-create it personally, this doe not been the
bug is not there, I and many can re-create it all day, on whatever version FF,
with whatever settings. The site or the browser, which is it?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=146651&postdays=0&postorder=asc&postsperpage=15&start=45
2. The page display too wide
3. Refresh, the page is still too wide, happens quite regularly on various sites.

Actual Results:
The page is 1 inch wider than it should be forcing you to read it line by line,
moving left and right. IE display it fine, FF, cannot - and it's Mozilla's site.

Expected Results:
A page the same size width a the last, and every page on the site, a with IE
and previous pages.
