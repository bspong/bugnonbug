I'm using the most recent release of Firefox.
Last night I wa just browsing some normal site I browse. Next thing I know, Adobe Acrobat open up, then I start getting viruses. Windows Defender and Symantec caught a couple Trojans, but couldn't catch others. The attacking file wa in the temporary file of Firefox. It wa a malware which spammed fake anti-virus ads. This wa gotten from normal browsing without purposely downloading and installing anything.

Firefox need to be set to require approval for all downloads.
