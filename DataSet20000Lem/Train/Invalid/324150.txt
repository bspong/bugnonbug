I upgraded my browser this morning to Firefox v. 1.5. On loading the browser all the icon are missing from my bookmark toolbar. If I put the mouse pointer on the toolbar and click a small empty white box appears and then disappears.

Also, a the bottom of the screen is about 1 inch blank space that cannot be resized nor can it closed, so I lose that much space in my browser screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reinstall the upgrade.
2. Reload the app.
3. Reinstall the upgrade
4. Reinstall the upgrade.
etc, etc, etc
Actual Results:
Same issues, same results.

Expected Results:
It wa expected that there would be no such visual and functionality change on the upgrade.
