At the top of the page just below the EPICSOLDIERS Banner you will notice several words; HOME, LOVE, TRUST, PEOPLE, TALK and FORUM, these are all drop down menus, and they work very well in all other browsers, ie: IE7, OPERA etc.
But do not work with Firefox! When I scroll the mouse curser over the word the Drop down menu doe not appear. I have tryed installing Java for firefox and still not luck! :( I have been a faithfull Firefox user for several year but ever since updating the website with this new feature I have had to resort to IE7 and advise my user to use IE7 :(
