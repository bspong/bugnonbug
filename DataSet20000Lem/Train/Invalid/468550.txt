i did have horizontal scroll capability 2 previous release ago. i believe it wa 2.x not sure. that said, it's been poof for the last 2 updates. i've tried some searched suggestion of modifying some synaptics data fiels but to no avail. some of my colleages that use trackpoint on their thinkpads report that their horizontal scroll work fine. so i'm not sure what give here. up, down and sideways have always worked on ie. i'd switch over completely to ffox if i didn't have to lose this function but either way u guy will have some work to do when ie 8 releases. sweet!

appreciate the help. i'm sure there are many of u that have this issue but just haven't reported it. i've had it for month now. i'm running xp sp3, zapro 7.x, symantec enterprise 10.x and bunch of other apps.
