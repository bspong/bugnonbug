There seems to be a bug affecting the browsing of blog page which are formatted using Movable Type software (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_Type), especially long pages. When I access page like this one using 1.5, my CPU usage go up to 90% or more, with the task manager showing most of that being from Firefox.exe. This ha the consequence of making the browser be rather sluggish and slow to respond. Was not a problem in the 1.0.X line. When I close those pages, the usage drop back down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a long blog page which us Movable Type, such a the URL I listed above.
2. Monitor CPU usage.
3. Close the tab or window with that page and see the CPU usage go back down.

Actual Results:
The CPU usage got really high and stayed really high for a long a I wa at that site, with the resulting reduced browser proformance.

Expected Results:
Not used anywhere near a much CPU capacity for just one web page.

Occurs with the default theme.
