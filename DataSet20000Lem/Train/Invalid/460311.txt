I have free4u.pl site built with PHP.

I have problem becaouse when using FF3 I set session using url http://www.free4u.pl/...,
FF3 don't see this session using http://free4u.pl/.

And just the other way about.

This problem show when using captcha files.
When somebody try to register on http://free4u.pl/rejestracja.php.
I set session in file http://www.free4u.pl/token.php, which is an image shown on a page.

The issue is that domain http://www.free4u.pl is not the same domain a http://free4u.pl.

This is the bug of Firefox. Where should I notice it?

Best regards!
