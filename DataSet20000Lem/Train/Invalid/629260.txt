Stop script popup not coming up. Error console show no errors. Had to ctrl+alt+del firefox.exe.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b10) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b10

This locked up the browser completely. I thought the other tab were not supposed to crash. Error console had nothing in it. The error seen in the image I attached happend before the javascript lockup.
I have uploaded the image here: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v135/noitidart/stopscripterror.jpg

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download new tab king addon https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-king/
2. Start typing in the to do list box
3. When browser freezes, after a minute you will get this popup box trying to popup but it doesnt, and even the X is not clickable of the popup box.
Actual Results:
Popup box tried to open but wouldn't. Error console showed no errors. Locked up everything.

Expected Results:
Error console should also show the errors. Stop script should come up and be clickable. I thought with putting the JS into it's own plugin-container.exe that the JS crashing should not crash the browser or other tabs, I thought this wa a major feature and would really love it. Please make the browser withstand this.
