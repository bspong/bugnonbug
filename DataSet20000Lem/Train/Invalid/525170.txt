After Firefox updated to 3.0.15, the space where the Google toolbar had the word "Firefox cannot find this add-on. Please reinstall toolbar.". When I went on the Google toolbar website, agreed to reinstall it, and restarted Firefox, when Firefox restarted, the Google toolbar is still not working, and said it needed to restart to finish the installation. After restarting Firefox more than three times, the Google toolbar still isn't installed and working and it is still saying it needed to restart to finish the installation.

Actual Results:
When Firefox restarts and all tab reopen, on Add-on Extensions menu, Google Toolbar for Firefox 5.0.20090813W is saying "This add-on will be updated when Firefox is restarted"

Expected Results:
Google toolbar is supposed to be installed and working and in the Add-on Extension menu, only stated a "Google Toolbar for Firefox x.x.xxxxxxxxW Take the power of Google with you anywhere on the Web!"
