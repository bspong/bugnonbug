with the update to firefox 2.0.0.4 the search engine stopped working with Cyrillic (no latin?) requests. Yandex.ru or meta.ua for example. When keyword is in Latin they work fine. But when it is in Cyrillic search engine act like no keyword wa typed in.

However, Google search keep handling it fine.

Suspicion is that it handle well search engine with UTF-8 encoding, but not with win 1251
