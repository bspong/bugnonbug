Running FireFox with Real Player 14 PlugIn affect external application
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.2; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Firefox-Version 3.6.16

I am a developer and i got report from a customer who is able to report the following problem:
If FireFox with the Real Player 14 PlugIn is running, our application refuse to start with the C Run-Time Error R6030 from the Microsoft C Runtime library (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9ecfyw6c%28v=vs.80%29.aspx).

If the plugin is not activated or if FireFox is terminated, the problem doe not occur.

I am sorry, that i can only report this without additional information, The customer is quite reliable and ha tracked down and reproduced this issue. Firefox itself doe not encounter any problem.


Reproducible: Always
