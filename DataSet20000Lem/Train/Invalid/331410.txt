CTRL+ and CRTL- resize non-monospace font, but not monospace one. I have "Courier New" set a my default monospace font in preferences, but I allow those setting to be overriden of course.

I noticed the problem while developing a Web application. The relevant part of my CSS look a follows:

div {
...
font-family: Courier, monospace;
...
}

That caused that font to resize in "jumps" -- not smoothly, a other fonts. To have the font resized I have to press CTRL+ or CTRL- multiple times. While I wa dooing that the other font were being resized.

I finally fixed it by changing my CSS into:

div {
...
font-family: Courier New, monospace;
...
}

("Courier" --> "Courier New")

Is it a bug or doe Courier differ from Courier New and have only couple fixed size available? If it's a bug that might be a problem for many Websites using Courier only.

Thanks!
