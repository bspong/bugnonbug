With tabs-on-top, the tab bar no longer exists visually; it merges into the title bar, and it behavior should act like the title bar.
On Windows, double-clicking the tab bar actually work just fine (window maximizing/restoring), but on Mac OS a new tab open after the action, which should be fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double click the tab bar. (Visually there's no tab bar!)
2. Expected to see the window get minimized.
3. A new tab open instead.
