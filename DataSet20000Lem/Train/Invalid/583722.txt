When a page contains a NULL byte, and some condition with Content-Type ha met, Firefox open up a download dialog.

I'm not sure about the condition of Content-Type, but it seems that the following are causing this bug:
text/plain
any/thing
any/thing;charset=something

However, these are working a expected:
text/html
application/javascript
text/css
text/plain;charset=something

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a file containing a NULL byte with Content-Type text/plain
Actual Results:
Firefox open a Download dialog.

Expected Results:
The page show up.
