I've always had bookmark keywords working, but in this build,
'http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/token.cgi?a=cfmpw&t=MK3k-2KX', they are no longer
working for me.

Now, if I type in a keyword, it doe the default google.com 'I'm Feeling Lucky'
search and take me to that result instead.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a bookmark
2. Assign it a keyword in the bookmark property
3. Type the keyword in the location bar and notice that it will not go to your
bookmark

Actual Results:
Firefox doe it's default action on a word that is NOT a keyword and query
google.com for it's I'm Feeling Lucky search result, and go to that page instead.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have gone to the bookmark which is using the assigned keyword.
