Installed latest Firefox release from Fedora 15 yum package manager, v 4.0.1-2. Attempted to open you tube flash video and video report flash player is out of date. Attempted to install flash-plugin adobe 10.3.181.14 (latest version) and yum report latest version already installed. Checked about:plugins and could not find flash player. Connected to Mozilla Chat Line and went through the troubleshooting procedure with the representative for several hour with no success. Installing lightspark allows limited flash capabilities, but not all flash site work (facebook game do not).

I have 2 computers, one an intel dualquad core processor with 6 GB of memory and an Asus G73J laptop, also with an Intel dual quad core processor and 6 GB memory. Both computer have Fedora 15 new installs (not an upgrade). Both had Fedora 14 installed last week and Firefox 4.01-1 and Flash Player worked a expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox or Chrome - Mozilla ha apparently disabled flash in both.
2. Go to a flash website
3. Flash video do not work

Actual Results:
Flash video not available, Mozilla Plugin Check page generates:
For your safety, Firefox ha disabled your outdated version of Flash. Please upgrade to the latest version.
