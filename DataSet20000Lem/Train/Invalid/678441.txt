Steps to reproduce:

I just purchased MacBook Pro and updated it to Lion OS and it seems like I have problem with using Magic Mouse and track pad in the Firefox. It doesn't react to back-forth gesture and scroll upside down. Track pad reacts the same.


Actual results:

If I need to go down the page I have to sroll up. If I need to go up I scroll down.


Expected results:

If I need to go down the page I have to sroll down. If I need to go up I scroll up.
