I've managed to get this repeated on Firefox 3 final installation on multiple friends' PCs. As you can see on the demo URL, the time for the feed item aren't displaying correctly - they all read a 12:00pm. The time display correctly under IE7, and viewing the source under Firefox show that the correct time are in fact there in the feed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open RSS URL in Firefox.
2. Check times.
Actual Results:
All time displayed a 12:00pm.

Expected Results:
Displayed the correct time a per the RSS feed contents.
