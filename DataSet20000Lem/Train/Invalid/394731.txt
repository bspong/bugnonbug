Firefox expects an image file to be returned instead of html file.

When searching www.bookabite.com for a restaurant and clicking Search, firefox sends the data to the HTTP server but when it receives the result page it display the error: The image “http://bookabite.gotdns.com/Search” cannot be displayed, because it contains errors.

I have checked the HTTP server log and the GET request from firefox stipulates Accept: image/png only. This problem doe not occur in IE.
