I installed Firefox 3 RC2 and then ran the utility CCleaner afterwards, the info in the drop down for the address bar is removed a it should be by ccleaner but then the drop down item are replaced by entry from the bookmarks. I do not find any way of clearing the history from this drop down. Have only seen this issue with Firefox 3 all version (Beta, RC1 and RC2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3 RC 2 and surf to some site to make entry in the history
2. Run the Freeware utility "CCleaner":
3. Check the dropdown and info from bookmark will be there
Actual Results:
Same a box above

Expected Results:
The bookmark are still shown in the box even after shutting down Firefox and rebooting the computer.

Behaved normally with the browsing typed in entry in the box.
