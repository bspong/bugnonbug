Firefox, oh secure firefox, you can't even block cooky correctly!

In the cooky options:
Allow site to set cookies: Enabled
for the originating site only: Enabled

Exception rule:
Block *.doubleclick.net

Visit a site that will usually set cooky from doubleclick.net such a cnn.com or reuters.com, doubleclick.net cooky will be allowed. First of all, a block rule should override any other option so regardless of my other options, that cookie should not have been allowed. Secondly, it should not have been allowed from cnn.com or reuters.com a I only want to allow cooky to be set for the originating site.
