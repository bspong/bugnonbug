When the webpage is loaded it hard-freezes Firefox. The only remedy is killing the browser with an End Task and re-opening it. This happens regardless of whether it is opened in a tab or a it own page. It happens after a bit of loading -- it may have to do with the length of the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the website.
Actual Results:
Exactly what I expected. I had already typed in all of the above information when I did it, but experienced a moment of self-doubt, and did it again anyway. It happened again. And I had to type in all this bullshit again.

Expected Results:
Loaded the damn page without freezing, maybe?
