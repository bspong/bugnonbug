Parse error when loading news feed from NewsIsFree
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

When I use the latest build of Firefox (dowloaded 10-5-04 evening) to open News
Is Free, instead of displaying the page with it RSS feeds, I get Parse error:
parse error, unexpected T_FOREACH in
/home/newsisfree.com/www/HPE/plugins/mod.newsbox.loaditems.inc on line 39.

I cannot get my NewsIsFree feed to load consistently a live bookmark -
similar parse error.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reloaded NewsIsFree page and feed did load.
2. Washington Post feed in browser give Live Bookmark Failed to Load.
Actual Results:
As above.


I'm new user - hope very much that I'm not wasting your time. I like the
browser a lot - but really want to be able to use it to view RSS. Thanks!
