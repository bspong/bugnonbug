[Mac] Default fullscreen button doesn't obey text mode setting in fullscreen mode
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.2b1pre) Gecko/20091011 Namoroka/3.6b1pre ID:20091011033822

The default full screen button which is displayed when the user hasn't moved it from the customize sheet to the toolbar doesn't obey the current toolbar setting and is always shown a a button.

Steps:
1. Open customize toolbar sheet and click on reset to default
2. Switch to text only mode
3. Switch into fullscreen mode and check the fullscreen button on the right side
4. Leave fullscreen mode
5. Open customize toolbar sheet again and d&d the fullscreen button to the toolbar
6. Enter fullscreen mode

As you can see the fullscreen button behaves differently between step 3 and step 6. It's something I have already discovered on bug but haven't got feedback so far - probably it wa a bit unclear description.
