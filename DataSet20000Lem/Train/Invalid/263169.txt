autoscroll's incremental speed function not working properly to scroll thru page

On IE when after you initiate the autoscroll function by depressing the middle
button on your mouse, the page will scroll at a speed directly proportional to
the distance the cursor is from the round multidirectional autoscroll indicator.
In Mozilla Firefox the speed is the same (slow)regardless of the distance of
the cursor from the autoscroll indicator. PLEASE FIX if at all possible

p Love you program
