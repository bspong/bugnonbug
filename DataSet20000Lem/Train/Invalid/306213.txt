I hv recently installed firefox ver. 1.06. Upon reinstalling I saw that .htm and
.html file were not associated with firefox, so I made it the default browser.
It worked but the icon were not there, simply nothing. Then I went to
Tools>Folder Options>File Types>.htm > advanced>change Icon, and changed them to
default firefox icon but still no icon appeared though it showed in the change
icon window in file types.
Please help

Reproducible: Always
