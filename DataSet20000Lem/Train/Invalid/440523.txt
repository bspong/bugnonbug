I use a custom home page that I've created (.html file) with my most important links. With Firefox 2.x I could always (and that wa my primary working style) middle-click on a link to open it on a new tab in the background. This doe not work now with Firefox 3.0.

Ctrl-Left-Click won't work, Ctrl-Shift-Left-Click won't work (see http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Mouse+shortcuts).

It also didn't work with a saved page (File->Save Page As...) I quickly tested.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a local (file:///...) html page with some link in it
2. Middle-click on a link
3. Observe the tab that open
Actual Results:
A new tab open with the URL for a title and nothing loaded. The address bar ha the proper URL. The tab doesn't even pretend to load anything, it just opens.

Expected Results:
As with Firefox 2.0, I expect the page to load normally.
