Installing Firefox creates problem with Ctrl key in Windows XP

Ever since I have installed FireFox, I have sometimes had problem with the
"ctrl" key. The problem ha been that Windows think that I am holding down
the control key, when I am in fact not. I click on icon on the desktop, and
then multiple one are selected. I try restoring a program from the task bar by
clicking it, and nothing happens. Sometimes on web page when I use the scroll
button on my mouse, it resizes the text. Once when loading outlook, a dialog
box came up saying that it detected that the control key wa being held down,
and asked if i wanted to load it in safe mode. Again, Windows think that I am
holding down the control key when I am not. The problem go away though when I
tap the control key.

I made sure that "sticky keys" were disabled a a part of windows, and it wasn't
enabled. I then uninstalled FireFox, and the problem went away. I just
reinstalled it, and the problem reappeared. I cannot find any specific action
though that produce the problem.
