Default Browser
I set FF to be the default browser. Then, I changed my mind and cleared the
flag on FF; set the flag on IE. Everytime my apps need a browser, it still
default to FF. When I check the setting in FF, the checkbox is clear, but upon
hitting the "Check now" button, the popup dialog box say "Firefox is already
set a your default browser". I cannot seem to clear the setting even though
the checkbox is clear. HELP!
