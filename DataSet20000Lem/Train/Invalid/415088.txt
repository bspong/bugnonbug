The latest Proto theme (0.10.1) ha very bad layout of it buttons. The navigation button are much to close to the left border (it's 2pt, it should be 20pt according to Apple's HIG). It look really bad this way.

The new history button (little downwards triangle after the navigation buttons) is much too small, it is almost impossbile to distinguish. This is a triangle that can be used a an extra adoprn image inside a button (as it used to be), not for a separate button (as it is now).

The optional view for Add-Ons at the right-hand side of the toolbar are missing (in my case for AddBlock).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Proto theme
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Navigation button too close to the left-hand side. History button is much too small. Toolbar view for add-on are missing.
