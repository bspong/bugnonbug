large increase in number of FF 3.0.10 crash after 10.5.7 update
After Apple released 10.5.7 around May 12, 2009, there's been a large increase in the number of FF 3.0.10 mac crashes. The URL link show the number of catch-all objc_msgSend crashes, the top mac crasher, by OS version. Note the strange spike in 10.5.6 crash and the steady rise of 10.5.7 crash while other version seem relatively constant.

Overall summary

The first sheet contains the overview, the other sheet a breakdown for objc_msgSend crash which shot up to over 9000 last week. The rate of Flash_EnforceLocalSecurity crash more than tripled from the week before. The chart is a bit hard to read in the published version, so here's a better screenshot:

Note: the 500 maximum is probably an artifact of a crash reporter limit, my guess is these number are probably higher.

This is based on pulling down crash report for the last 30 day and analyzing the stack crawls. This is just for objc_msgSend crashes.

There seems to be a lot of problem when printing, especially for folk using Canon printers. But the rate of other bug seems to have increased also which make me suspect there's some sort of memory corruption problem that Apple introduced with this update.

My guess is that this is an Apple-related problem but I logged this just in case there's something we need to do to ameliorate the problem.
