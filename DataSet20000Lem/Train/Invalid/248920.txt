With Javascript enabled, passing cursor over line containing "Completely Safe
Link - Trust Me" will start email client - Eudora 4.3. Disabling Javascript
prevents program from starting.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.digicrime.com/noprivacy.html using Firefox/0.9 with
Javascript enabled.
2. Pass cursor over line (no necessarily the words) containing "Completely Safe
Link - Trust Me"


Actual Results:
1) Message box came up stating "You probably just sent mail ..."
2) Email client started - Eudora 4.3 started with new mail addressed to
"mcc@digicrime.com"

Expected Results:
Nothing.

I do not believe the mail wa accually sent but that may have been due to my
setting within Eudora.
