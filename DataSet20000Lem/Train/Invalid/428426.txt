The portal GOOGAHOO.COM.BR will be launched on line April 20 and I'd love to have it FF Friendly. I do use FF myself and if I can get this on, I like to promote FireFox in my portal.

Thank you and congratulation to all fro the good word with FF

Best regards,

AC Costa

NOTE:
I have been looking the mozilla org for 4 day trying to find out information for webmaster to make their site FireFox Friendly. You only have link to report a site. I don´t want to report my sites, I like to make FF Friendly, but I can not find help fro you.

Thank you for your help
