After any Add-on or browser update, the New Tab Button Preference under Tools~Options~Tabbed Browsing~User Interface get's reset to "Blank Page" instead of keeping the option I had it set to (Browser Homepage)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. After new update - click on new tab
2. "Blank" tab is presented rather than my preference
Actual Results:
This ha been consistently happening since I started using FF in version 1.0

Expected Results:
The option in this setting should be maintained after update - especially third-party add-on.
