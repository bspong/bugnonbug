I do not know how to mail to the Firefox team. Hence me filling in a non bug issue. If you visualize http://vouters.dyndns.org/awstats/awstats.pl (currently opened to all .mozilla.com DNS ending names) you'll see how your Web browser rank #1 among the browser used by my Web visitors. Two sentence from me : keep on with the excellent work you are used to; you do look to be on the right track.

With my very warmest regard to all the team.
