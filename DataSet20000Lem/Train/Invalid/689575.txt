Disable keyboard shortcut while tab animation is active
Build ID (current latest trunk):
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110926 Firefox/9.0a1

This is an enhancement request in order to improve the tab animation user experience.

WHAT?
When managing tab (i.e. dragging a tab from tab strip), shortcut key that could interfere with tab animation should be disabled
-> ctrl+shift+w (close window)
-> ctrl+shift+e (enter panorama)
-> ctrl+shift+k (launch web console)
...
other shortcut keys.

WHY?
This request is based on the following:
1. This behavior wa not possible before the landing of the Tab Animation Feature bug 455694 which mean it's a regression, if not an intended behavior.
2. The use of keyboard shortcut can lead to faulty UX (i.e. the one in bug 689554 and bug 689566

PLATFORMS AFFECTED
Currently Windows, Mac and Linux
