Having downloaded the mouse rocker extension (that allows you to navigate
forward and backwards using a combination of holding down one mouse button and
clicking the other), I find that Phoenix ha a tendency to navigate backwards
sometimes when you click the left mouse button.

It's a if the right mouse button seems stuck, thus causing left click to
navigate backwards. Has happened on a few different computers, with different
mice, so might be a software glitch.

To cure: just push the right mouse boutton repeatedly until the context menu
appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use the right mouse and left mouse button to navigate for a bit
2.
3.

Actual Results:
after a while, left click make you go backwards, instead of clicking link etc

Expected Results:
clicked the link and loaded up a new page

TO CURE: click the right mouse button repeatedly until the right mouse button
context menu appears.
