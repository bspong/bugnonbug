My page ha such line in the heading to include a source javascript file.
<script language="JavaScript1.3" src="./onload.jScript"></script>

It work all find, until just now I downloaded/unpacked Firefox PR1 from:
firefox-1.0PR-sparc-sun-solaris2.8.tar.gz - Sun Contributed Forte
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.10/contrib/firefox-1.0PR-sparc-sun-solaris2.8.tar.gz

I have a simple test in the source code: alert("loading");
However with this build of Firefox, I cannot see this file is being loaded or
and alert come out.

BUT: I also download a Firefox PR1 for window platform from:
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.10/Firefox%20Setup%201.0PR.exe

And guess what, it work correctly! The file is loaded, I can see the alert pop
up during the loading, and my page work correctly.

Something strange is going on...
