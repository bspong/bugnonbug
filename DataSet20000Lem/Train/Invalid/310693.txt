The java applet WILL load if I manually SWITCH the "%7E" symbol back to the "~"
symbol. This is a manual fix but it doe not work automatically.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Example website: try going to http://www.stanford.edu/~alxgould/econ111

1. This first loading will work fine and you can see the blue applet on the left.
2. Then click on ANY of the blue applets. When the next page loads, it will
make that sign substitution and those blue applet won't load.
3. If you correct the sign susbstitution in the URL and re-load, the blue
applet will load.

Actual Results:
Clicking on the blue applet should not lead to a substitution of the symbols.

Expected Results:
Maintain the "~" symbol from page to page.
