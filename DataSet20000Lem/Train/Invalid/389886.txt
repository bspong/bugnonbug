I have three HTML elements: an <input type="text"> with an onblur handler, a <div> with an onclick handler, and an element whose display type I want to toggle using CSS.

With the input box selected I click the div. I should see the input's onblur followed by the div's onclick. Firefox lose the onclick event if the onblur handler modifies elementToggleDisplay.style.display.

Reproduced on FF 2 and latest FF 3 nightly with a clean profile.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://javascript.pastebin.com/f226c9383 and download the content. Save it to a local HTML file.
2. Open the file.
3. Blur the text box a few time and convince yourself that the onblur handler both toggle a <div>'s visibility and writes a debug message.
4. Click the "Click me" section a few time to convince yourself that the onclick handler writes a message when it fires.
5. Reload the page to clear the debug messages.
6. Focus on the input box.
7. Click on "Click me" to cause an onblur followed by an onclick.
Actual Results:
Actual result are that the onblur fire (the content appears/disappears) but no onclick event fire afterwards.

Expected Results:
Expect that both the blurred and clicked debug message appear.

Removing the .style.display toggling code (highlighted in pastebin) and repeating the recreate give the desired results.

Having the toggled element below the "Click me" link make this work.

It seems that reflowing the HTML content above "Click me" make Firefox forget the onclick event.
