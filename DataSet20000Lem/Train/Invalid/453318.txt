When I click the mouse button that ha been assigned to be 'double-click', with the cursor on the 'go back one page' button, the browser should go back 2 page with the single click. The previous version, and older one too, of Firefox did this properly, but the latest one doe not... is there some way to set it to response to the 'double-click' mouse button?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Simply advance 2 page and attempt to go back the initial page with a single 'double-click;.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
When the 'double-click' mouse button is hit, it only go back one page. I've retried this with the previous version of Firefox and it work a usual so nothing ha been altered at my end.
