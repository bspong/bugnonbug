Steps to reproduce:

I tried to open link (e.g. in google) with my scrolling wheel to open it in new tab.


Actual results:

Nothing happened, even ctrl+lmb doesn't work.


Expected results:

A new tab with the link I clicked should have opened. (The mouse work perfect, I tested it in other browser, work fine)
