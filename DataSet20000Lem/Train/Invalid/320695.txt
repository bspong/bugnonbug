when i try to open a website and forget to type the dot (like "www.mozillaorg"), firefox automatically add a de (without a .) and doe this repeatedly - like "Nachschlagen von www.mozillaorgdededededededededededede...". i hope i haven't misconfigured firefox myself in about:config but i can't remember that i have changed the name of the default extension or anything like that.

Reproducible: Always
