My 3rd party password manager (Verisoft Access Manager) always register one website (my gmail login) a the currently open page eg it will detect a username password field the currently open tab but always fill in my gmail login detail instead. This problem did not occur in any version of Firefox 2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any URL in firefox 3.0 with a username password field on a computer running Verisoft Access Manager
Actual Results:
On my gmail account the correct detail are inserted. On any other page the gmail logon detail are also inserted

Expected Results:
If logon detail for the website are stored they should be inserted into the relevant field

This may affect other 3rd party password manager
