Bug in ordering of Go menu and History sidebar entry
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060913 Fedora/1.5.0.7-1.fc5 Firefox/1.5.0.7 pango-text

I would like to have the entry in the history panel ordered by last visit. Currently the closest to this is ordering by first visit, which make little sense.

The logic can be understood when you observe how you naturally organise book on the desk you have been reading.

To go further I think this should be the default.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open history panel
2. go to foo.com
3. go to bar.com
4. go to qux.com
5. go to bar.com again


Actual Results:
History panel:
qux.com
bar.com
foo.com

Expected Results:
History panel:
bar.com
qux.com
foo.com

Tested on both Firefox 1.5 and 2.0
