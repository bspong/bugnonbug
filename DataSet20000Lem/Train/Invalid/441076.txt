When activating the context menu for the forward or backward button they contain the history from the combined pulldown menu. It make little sense to me for the back button's context menu to contain forward item and vice-versa. Why would someone use the back button to go forward?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to several pages.
2.Use the browser's back button to go back a few pages.
3.Use the browser back button context menu to navigate further back.
Actual Results:
'Forward' url are located in the 'back' button's context menu.

Expected Results:
The back button's context menu should only have backward navigation in it.

I realize why people would like the combined pulldown menu, but it doesn't make sense to attach the combined menu to the forward and backward button when they could retain their specific functions.
