File with .xml a extension and .tar.gz in the filename isn't seen a xml, dispite of it's content.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050911 Firefox/1.0.6 (Debian package 1.0.6-5)

When the given file is loaded, it isn't seen a an XML file dispite it being
one. The tar.gz in the filename seems to produce this problem. Accessing the
same file but without the .tar.gz in the filename, will make firefox see it a a
normal XML file. Due to this wrong identification you are also unable to see the
content using view source.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a valid viewable xml file (file.xml)
2. Make a copy of this file with tar.gz in the filename (file.tar.gz.xml)
3. Compare the result of both files.
Actual Results:
file.tar.gz.xml won't be seen a an XML file while file.xml will.

Expected Results:
Both file should be handled equally, because the tar.gz is not the last extension.

The Mozilla 1.7.8 web browser doesn't show the same problem.
