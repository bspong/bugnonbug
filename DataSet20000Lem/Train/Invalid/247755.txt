firefox crash when opening any website/does not open at all
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a1) Gecko/20040520
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.9/FirefoxSetup-0.9.exe

After downloading several extentions and browsing with them, I started to have
certain problems. I downloaded:

Adblock
Single Window
Download Trimmer
DownloadWith
Mouse Gestures
All in One Gestures

I disabled them all but Firefox still crash after finishing loading any webpage.

After trying to visit "mail.yahoo.com," it would not start at all. Firefox
would appear in the Task Manager under Processes but no Application would start.

This can be fixed by erasing my entire profile. However, if I cannot use
extentions in Firefox without having to erase my profile, it defeat the purpose
of the extention manager, etc.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
Actual Results:
Nothing.

Expected Results:
Opened firefox.
