[firefox-trunk] This java applet crash firefox on window and hang forever on
firefox-linux while using 100% cpu. Same applet work fine with latest Release.

I gave a URL for the jarfile because you need a trading account with the online
brokerage OptionsXpress.com to run the applet in firefox. The applet draw
stock and commodity price charts. (You can open an account for free if you
want to.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login at optionsxpress.com and click on the link "Try our Streaming Beta
Flex Charts"
2.
3.
Actual Results:
On windows, firefox crash immediately. I've filed several talkback report
already. On linux, firefox hang forever while chewing up all the cpu.


Their older, stable version of java chart work fine on firefox-trunk, and
their beta version work fine on firefox-release.
