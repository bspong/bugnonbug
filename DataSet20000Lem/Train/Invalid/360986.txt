I have three form in a page. The first form contain two radio buttons. Depending upon which radio button is selected, either form2 or form3 is displayed. All this logic is all implemented on the server-end so it involves posting a request every time the user change his selection in form1.

Here is how I reproduce the bug:

1) form1: [x] [ ] form2
2) form1: [ ] [x] form3
3) Hit Back Button
4) form1: [ ] [x] form2

I am expecting step 4 to read:

4) form1: [x] [ ] form2

It look a if FireFox roll back the state of the bottom form, but not the top one. This work properly under IE6.

Reproducible: Always
