Advertisement tab keep opening by themselves. I have tried running McAfee, Malwarebytes, and Spybot, but none can seem to find any kind of problem. When it is not tab opening by themselves, Google search are opening page entirely unrelated to the link I click on. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox to no avail. This is very frustrating a I attend school online.

Reproducible: Always
