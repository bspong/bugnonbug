After closing Firefox, the firefox.exe process is not always shutdown and the CPU usage is high (100% of 1 core)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Since Firefox 3.5.7 (and also with firefox 3.6 Beta4 & Beta5)the browser doesn't always shutdown properly. It visibly is shutdown but sometimes it is not possible to restart Firfox. Looking in the Task manager it is evident that the firefox.exe process is still active with a high CPU-load of 100% of 1 core.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse at least some several websites.
2.Shutdown Firefox (x-button)
3.Watch Windows Task-manager to see if Firefox.exe ha been shutdown
Actual Results:
Sometimes the Firefox.exe process is still active, it will not shutdown at all and the CPU-load is high (100% on one core; with 2 cores: 50% cpu-usage is seen.)

Expected Results:
Within some second the firefox.exe process should no longer be listed on the Task Manager and you should be able to restart Firefox again.

This is a new bug with Firefox 3.5.7 and also seen on Firefox 3.6 Beta 4 and 3.6 Beta 5.
