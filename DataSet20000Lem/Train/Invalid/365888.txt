When I open a web-site link to view pictures, the picture will not open up.
I have had this problem with numerable websites,and have needed to go to another browser to get the pictures.
Also I have not been able to submit picture to web site ( for instance,I could not get the submit picture, for a craigs list advertisement, to work.
It did work with an alternate brower,therefore I am sure the problem is with the browser and not the sire.

One more problem that I have experienced is that I am denied access to one of my website that I use very often, a it is connected with my business. The website is"mannatech" The initial site open but when I try to log in,access is denied.
I had to go to an alternate browser and did not have the problem. I wa able to log in and access all of my information, therefore that confirmed that it is a browser problem and not the website problem.
