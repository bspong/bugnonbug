Sometimes Phoenix stop responding to keyboard events(arrow keys, alt-f, etc)
completely. Additionally, I can't click in any text entry box (the blinking
cursor never appears). The mouse continues to function normally, however. The
only workaround I've found is clicking Help->About and clicking ok. It also
seems to happen more frequently when I middle click to open a link in a new tab,
however it happens other time a well.

I am occasionally able to reproduce this bug, but it seems not to happen a
often when I'm trying to get it to happen, if that make sense.

This happens with a fresh install of Phoenix 0.5.

1. Go to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
2. Click on Query Page
3. Let the page finish loading and try using the keyboard
