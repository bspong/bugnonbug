Its the god damn cut/copy/paste bug... but i can reproduce it 100%

Ok i have a clean install of Firefox beta 2!, no extensions, old profile are
deleted totally B4 install!...

Bug is 100% repoducable in normal mode but 100% unreproducable in safe mode!
to test it u will require virtual dimension get it from here
http://virt-dimension.sourceforge.net/ install it and have at least 2 desktop

God damn fix the damn clipboard bug it been around for almost 2 years! if u
cant fix it write the ENTIRE clipboard code... IE is quickly catching up to FFs
abilities...

Next>
Now install google bar... remove the bookmark toolbar... are repeat the above
steps... and the text WILL PASTE INTO THE ADDRESS BAR!!, EVEN THOUGH THE CURSOR
IS FLASHING IN google textbox!... this mean that firefox is INCORRECTLY
TRACING focus!.. I SUSPECT THAT FIREFOX DOESNT CORRECTLY handle window change
of focus events... a well a other CRITICAL SYSTEM BASED EVENTS..
