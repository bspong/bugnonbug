The W3C spec dictate that font-size-adjust should only be applied when the author's first-choice font is not available to the browser. This is because it is intended to preserve a best a is possible the final size of substitute fonts, which can vary dramatically even with the same font-size value.

However, Firefox applies the font-size-adjust value even if the author's first-choice font IS available, making the command worse than useless! It should only apply it if the first-choice font IS NOT available.
