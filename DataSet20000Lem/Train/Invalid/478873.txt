Firebug can not load javascript source file : "Failed to load source for sourceFile top-level"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6

I think it is a regression I never had that problem earlyer. Firebug can not load javascript source file any more.
I use Firefox 3.0.6 with Firebug 1.3.2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load a web page
2. try to load javascript file with "script" tab in Firebug
3. Answer is "Failed to load source for sourceFile top-level..."



I also have several Firefox plugins like Yslow
