when i entered a url site (http://wm.somesite.com), the location bar show
previously visited site... i believe i pressed enter key plus another key by
mistake and the browser looked for http://www.wm.somesite.com.net ... of course
that wasn't what i had intended.... also the history on the location bar keep
showing the www.wm.somesite.com.net a the first choice and list the
wm.somesite.com/member/ a the last choice... obviously there is an ordering
issue in the history

Reproducible: Always
