Installed update and firefox stopped working.

Build Identifier: firefox 2.0.0.12

I'm not sure if I have a bug or not. Firefox requested that I download updates. I did and installed them and then firefox stopped working. It try to go to website but it will never connect. I tried to uninstall and reinstall and it did the same thing. When I clicked on check for update it says, "AUS: connection refused." I can still use explorer. The problem is completely with firefox.
