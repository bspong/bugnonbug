ff 5 hang when downloading
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

tried to download a file or image


Actual results:

the browser hang and then window 7 become unresponsive. It get bad enough that I cannot even ctr-alt-del and have to restart by turning it off the power. I'm getting disk corruption also, severe enough disk problem that I'm unable to boot window 7 and need to boot from a different install and run chkdsk. One chkdsk took 45 minute to complete a it had enough problems.

I have not had such problem in the past when losing power. Things work fine in FF 4 and thing work fine in FF 5, until I download a file or image. I don't know if the extension are a problem a currently I am reluctant to turn off the extension and download with FF 5 due to corruption problems.

I realize this might not be optimal but is a serious issue such that I cannot use FF 5.
