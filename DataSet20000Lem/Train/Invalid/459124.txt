Setting homepage to 'about:' redirects to 'about:blank'

If I'm in the URLbar, and enter 'about:blank', I get a blank page. Good.

If I'm in the URLbar, and enter 'about:', I get a page with the logo and the build identifier and a few other things. Also good.

I set my homepage to be 'about:' so that when I launch, it immediately show my the build identifier (useful when I'm updating to trunk build several time a week, and need to know if I've launched today's x86_64 build or Tuesday's i386 build). However, what actually *displays* is 'about:blank'.
