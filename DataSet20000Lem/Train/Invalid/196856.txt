Everytime I try to customize my Phoenix build via "tools ->preferences ->
system" to adjust the assignment of file format (i.e. default application of
.html files) or protocol I can not complete this selection since hitting the
ok button resulting in no effect.
If I want to access other item (i.e. general etc) I have cancel my operation
and restart the preference to see other tag (downloads, connections, font
type and color etc.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.entering tool menu
2.selecting preference
3.go to system, selecting single listed item

Actual Results:
can not access other tag anymore, when seleting an item within system-tag. To
enter these tag I have to cancel and start again to access config issue via
tools->preferences->system

Expected Results:
Accept my selection and take "ok"
