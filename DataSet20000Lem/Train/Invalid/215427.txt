opening a bookmark folder in tab doe not respect web panel
1. Make a folder in your bookmark and add a few bookmark to it
2. Set one of those bookmark to load in the sidebar
3. Middle-click the folder in the bookmark menu

Actual Results: All bookmark open in tab

Expected Results: Actually, i'm not sure. If there's only one sidebar bookmark,
it would make sense for it to open in the sidebar. But what if there is more
than one sidebar bookmark in the folder? Perhaps only open the last one in the
sidebar...?
