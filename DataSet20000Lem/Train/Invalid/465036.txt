Ever since the update on 11/11/08 I can log into my yahoo mail classic and read my message and move and delete them a normal, but when I hit reply, and I type my response and then hit send, it won't send it. The same thing happens when I try to open attachments.

However, if I Copy my response, then go back to the inbox, click on the message again, click reply again, and paste the message then quickly hit send (all this ha to happen in 3 second or less) then it will send it. The same go for attachments, if I click the attachment the second the windo open it will download it, but if I take a minute to red the e-mail and then click on it, nothing happens.

Every thing function normally in IE. Also, please know that I'm not the only person having this problem, two of my friend are also having this issue.
