Firefox won't load any pages; www.google.com could not be found, etc.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla 1.0.7

I cannot get any page or site loading, using Firefox. I have used Firefox and
IE for month without this problem. All of a sudden, a few hour ago, Firefox
would not work at all. I uninstalled, reinstalled; I removed the profile
information; deleted the Mozilla directory from Windows - still no joy. IE is
working for me. I just downloaded Opera (because one site I visit won't load
properly for me using IE - the URL is http://forums.vugames.com/forum.jspa?
forumID=160 - it loads, but I cannot actually reply to any topic a the text
area fails to give me a cursor. It wa fine with Firefox), and THAT doesn't
work either.
I have Zone Alarm switched off. I haven't changed any settings. I use Symantec
anti-virus - there ha been an update for that today, but could that have
changed something? I use Ad=Aware - full scan, no problem found.
I very much want to see this solved. It seems many other people have suddenly
experienced this today...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click onto firefox.exe.
2. Watch a the browser fails utterly to open any page at all.
3.

Actual Results:
All sites, any sites, failed to open.

Expected Results:
I expected, for instance, google to open when I typed in www.google.com Even
typing in the actual numerical address of google failed to get the page up, so
I don't think it can be DNS cache.
