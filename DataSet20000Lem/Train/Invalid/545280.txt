Links on certain catalog page always result in "File Not Found".
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

While I have had this problem on other pages, the reported URL is always a problem. The owner ha been very cooperative and tried to fix it. She say she ha had no other report but doe not write page with Firefox in mind. Cannot find the problem. Tried at least three times. To buy from this site I have to write to them and describe what I want.

I updated two day ago, but had the same problem before updating a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Url
2.Look in catalog
3.Click link to see more detail (Or any similar link)
Actual Results:
Sends you to Homestead (the ISP) File Not Found page instead of expected link.

Expected Results:
Expected new page showing product detail and allowing to choose size and make order.

Gone to expected link.
