On the advice of someone on Launchpad (The Ubuntu bug reporting site), I am cross posting this bug here.
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.5/+bug/477513

FireFox crash routinely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. Surf to various sites. That's all that's needed.

Actual Results:
FireFox will crash.

Expected Results:
FireFox should not crash.

Seems to be related to changing pages. If I stay on a site and don't navigate to too many pages, FireFox may stay alive for longer (though not guarunteed).

Surfing to many page in a shorter period of time increase the likelihood of crashing sooner.

I can reliably crash FireFox in under a minute by randomly surfing without stopping to look too long at the content.

Please see the bug report on launchpad for crash output and further details.
