When I install Leech a an extension the setting button is greyed and
unavailable. As a result the parameter cannot be set. (It still works.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Leech from the Extensions website.
2. After restarting go to Tools->Options->Extensions->Leech
3. Try to click the setting button

Actual Results:
The setting button is greyed out and unavailable.

Expected Results:
Opened a dialog to set the parameter for the Extension.

The extension still work correctly, at least the "Get Entire Website From Here"
option. It is probably still using the parameter I set earlier. This did work
correctly in the Dec 7 build. At that time a tree displayed. All the tree
version I remember worked. Now it a series of window which don't seem to work.
