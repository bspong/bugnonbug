User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

I see numerous report re. memory leak for Firefox (Thunderbird is just a bad), yet these always get marked a "Works For Me". Well, thats a nice way to avoid the issue while Firefox just get worse and worse. Yes, it also a simple matter to blame plugins, again to avoid the issues.

Its TIME for the developer to pull their head out and address the issues!

Firefox regularly fall into massive memory usage - for myself 600MB +

This is very simple to fix using Firemin, however it now time for the Firefox developer to stop dodging this problem and FIX IT!




Actual results:

After running Firefox for several hour memory usage exeeds 600MB


Expected results:

Memory usage should stay below 200MB
