MS Exchange Server Best Practices Analyzer Tool
Hello:
This utility allows Exchange Admins to analyze setup and fix problems. It scan
Exchange server & Active Directory setup and produce report which includes an
option to take the user to a link which explains discovered issue & give
remedy steps. The bug I discovered is this...

With Firefox 1.0 set a the default browser, a rogue "%09" (minus quotes) is
injected in the URL string generated by the utility. This produce a "Bad URL"
result in the browser. Example:

URL with Firefox 1.0 set a the default browser:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/exchange%09/exbpa/4a057fc7-fbaf-4863-9675-318d5d0139f0.mspx

URL with default browser Internet Explorer (6.02 - patched up-to-date):
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/Exchange/ExBPA/4a057fc7-fbaf-4863-9675-318d5d0139f0.mspx

Other Info:
- We've been able to reproduce this on another PC
- OS is Windows XP Pro Sp2 fully patched
- Pasting the Firefox version of the link into IE and trying it from there also
produce a bad URL.
