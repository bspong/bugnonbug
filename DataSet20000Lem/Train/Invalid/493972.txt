* copied the theme from the 'mac firefox installer' into window firefox

Some item in the menu-bar menu and right-click menu have disappeared but their placeholder remain. The item appear when they are hovered over with the mouse.

Reproducible: Always




(Also, I can't use the ALT key to select menu with the keyboard with the Mac theme)
