Firefox treat upper case bookmark URI a different URI compare to the lower case URI.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

For example, there are 2 bookmarks:
http://www.mozilla.org/
http://www.Mozilla.org/

As you see, these two bookmark are the same.
The difference between the two URI is "m" and "M". Just lower case and upper case.

But Firefox treat them a different bookmark when I browse one of them like "http://www.mozilla.org/" and the Star which in the Location bar(Address bar) doesn't turn into light while I have the bookmark in Firefox like "http://www.Mozilla.org/".

Sorry for my poor English.
