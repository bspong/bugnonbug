Option "Notification: Change the bookmark's icon" ha no visable effect in Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

When a bookmark is scheduled to check for update the notification option "Change the
bookmark's icon" doesn't work. When Firefox belief the page to have changed (which it get
slightly wrong; see bug 207814) it will display a notice if "Display an alert" ha been selected,
or alternatively 'beep' if "play a sound" is selected, but the icon displayed on the Bookmarks
Toolbar never change when "Change the bookmark's icon" is selected. The icon shown on the
menu Bookmarks/Bookmarks Toolbar Folder doesn't change either. This is using the default
theme Firefox(default) 2.0 Gerich and Horlander.

Have reproduced using:

Firefox 0.9.1
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040719 Firefox/0.9.1

Firefox 0.9.2
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Firefox 0.9.2
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Have tried the same test in Mozilla 1.7.1[Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.1)
Gecko/20040726 Debian/1.7.1-4] and the bookmark icon changes. NB Mozilla doesn't show
favicons which Firefox doe and this I'm guessing is probably relevant to the problem.
