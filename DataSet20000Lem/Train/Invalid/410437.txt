I own www.sybfun.com... to get to my webmail I have to type
www.sybfun.com/webmail

I accidently typed webmail.sybfun.com and I got a search page from
searchportal.information.com/

which made itself out to be sybfun.com but it wa not... the complete source of the page is:

<html>
<head>
</head>
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" src="http://searchportal.information.com/?a_id=47368&domainname=referer_detect"></iframe>
</html>

I don't know how or why this redirection is occurring but I downloaded seamonkey and the exact same thing happened...

My feeling is that I should have gotten a 404 page not found error or something rather than this redirection...

Anyone know whats going on?
