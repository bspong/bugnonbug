working on a silly floating menu - really simple pas seems to work fine in IE 6 and Opera9.24 - AND it work in FF 2.0.0.9 EXCEPT in the case of absolutely positioned divs (or something related to that anyway.

This fails in FF (no error - just doesn't work) - but work Ok in IE and Opera...

this DOES work in FF - same exact code just WAY simpler overall page...

In the case where it fails for FF, it look to me like the value of document.body.scrollTop remains fixed either at 0 or blank or something like that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
case that faile DOES, in fact, move the menu from it's initial position when the doc is loaded but, thereafter, the menu doe not move

Expected Results:
expect the floating menu to move every 1 second such that it is visible in the browser window when the page is scrolled

searched bug related to scrollTop and didn;t find anything that seemed the same - sorry if this is just another dup :-(

I'm going to m,ark this a MAJOR because it would seem that scrollTop is a pretty important value in a LOT of clientside developments.
