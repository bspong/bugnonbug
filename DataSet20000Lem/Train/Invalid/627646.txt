I often use page with http basic authorization, it's address start with letter "d". And when I'm trying to type different address which start with the same letter instant preview try to load page with authorization, authorization dialog is shown and my address typing is canceled. So I have to cancel authorization dialog and try to enter correct url again.

Reproducible: Always

1. Often use page with http basic authorization
2. Try to enter url starting with same letter a this often used page

Actual Results:
Authorization dialog is showed and user can't continue typing url in location bar

Expected Results:
Instant preview should ignore page with authorization needed.
