Somehow, the installation of adblock plus or the removal of the navigation and bookmark toolbars ha disabled the regular bookmark window that pop up when right clicking the mouse -> bookmark this link. The new window ha no cancel button or a close window icon. Now a toolbar like bookmark window pop down from the top left with only the close and done buttons. Clicking "close" still add a bookmark and hitting 'esc' key doesn't close the window either. One ha to then go to bookmark -> organize bookmark to delete the bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Remove the navigation toolbar
2. Remove the bookmark toolbar
3. Install adblock plus, restart firefox
4. Right click a link -> bookmark this link, strange window without cancel button pop down from the top left.
5. Disable adblock plus, restart, still same behavior
Actual Results:
Strange bookmark window with close and done button pop down from top left.
