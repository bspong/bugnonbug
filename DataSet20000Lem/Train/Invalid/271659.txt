1. The box alerting me about unencrypted etc. keep coming up twice. Very
annoying.

2. To get to this page took several minutes!

3. There is a definite slowdown or no moving on from Web site to Web site (hangs
up a lot)

4. There is no option to use fonts, color in my Comcast e-mail in Firefox but
there is in IE

5.Please make it where I can remove individual URLs from my drop down menu in
the Locator (address) box. I just want to get rid of some, not all of them.
Thanks
Mrs. Boyd
