Where is talkback?
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0

I would like to run talkback manually. Under mozilla, it used to be in
mozilla/components/talkback/talkback. But there is no
firefox/components/talkback. It must be installed somewhere, though, since it
pop up when firefox crashes. How do I run it?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run firefox and crash.
2. Click "Don't send" accidentally.
3. Search the web and mozilla org for firefox talkback and the like.

Actual Results:
Found some article on bugzilla.mozilla.org saying that talkback wa in
firefox/components/talkback/talkback. In my installation, however, it isn't.


Expected Results:
Firefox is smarter than I am since it is able to run it from somewhere while I
remain confused. So it is probably not the software's fault.

I have firefox installed locally under my personal user account.
