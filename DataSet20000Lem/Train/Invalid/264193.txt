When you try to scroll down the page: www.breeze.com.mt I noticed that the
topmost image is being scrolled too and it get truncated. This is different
from IE's behaviour. I contacted the webpage developer and he insists it's a bug
in moz/firefox. Can anyone confirm this please?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.breeze.com.mt
2. Scroll down
3. Notice the topmost image get scrolled out of view too
