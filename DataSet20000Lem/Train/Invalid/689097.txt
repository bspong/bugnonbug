Memory Leak FF6.0.2
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
Build ID: 20110902133214

Steps to reproduce:

I have been experiencing that FF take over 50% of the CPU and memory over 120K. Suspecting memory leak I did the following:
- Turned off all Add on's and plug in's
- Opened FF with google home page (cant have a more light weight site )
- Memory started with 48K and 0 CPU
- Over next 2 hours, Memory go up to 72 and CPU ranging from 0-2
- After this I opened 4 more tab each with google home page.
- memory went up to 84 and CPU stayed at 0-2
- Over 2 Hours Memory went up to 104


Actual results:

Please see above


Expected results:

The memory seems to be leaking causing the CPU and Memory to rise. This is forcing me to kill FF and reopen it on a daily basis and I cant keep this open for hour together.
Certain site like nytimes seems to have even more issue with FF
