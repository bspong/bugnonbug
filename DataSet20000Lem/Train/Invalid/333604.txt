Running the 1.5.0.2 universal binary candidate on an Intel Mac under Rosetta, Java applet fail to load. Tested using both JREs included in Mac OS X 10.4.6. Java applet load correctly running a universal binary natively.

Reproducible: Always

1. Launch Firefox on an Intel Mac under Rosetta.
2. Access the above URL to test the JRE/JVM.

Actual Results:
The test applet fails to load.

Expected Results:
The test applet loads, "displays information about your operating system, the JVM and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If you can see the dancing Duke logo image animated in the applet above, then the JRE is functioning correctly."
