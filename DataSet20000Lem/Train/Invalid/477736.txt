Previous bug wa closed (see #476888) a invalid, but I still don't see why it's not valid.
After many tests, I have this :

Video are not played if the end in .ogv, while they work fine in .ogg (even if the video is exactly the same)

See the url (http://louizatakk.no-ip.org/test/) and it code source for a concrete example.
First video is a .ogv and doesn't work, the second one is the same video, but renamed to .ogg and it works.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to read a <video>, with a name ending in .ogv
2.Fail
Actual Results:
Video is not working at all (as if there were no video at all)

Expected Results:
Video in .ogv should play exactly like an .ogg video, a .ogv and .oga are the new extension, for video and audio files, in ogg/theora/vorbis content.
