I am developing a web application that uploads image to a server via the new Flash upload component in Flash 8 in conjunction with a PHP
back-end, insert the image name and description into a MySQL database,
and then resizes and store the resized image for screen resolution
via the GD imaging library.

The entire application work fine in IE but there is a flaw in Firefox.
The PHP page that rename and insert the image name data into the MySQL
database cannot seem to access the session variable unless the page is directly viewed; just what I am trying to avoid by having a back-end. These page are
pure PHP they have no HTML so they should not be subject to browser
compatibility problems. Moreover, I am not using cooky for my session.

The actual structure of the app is a follows:

SWF uploader (Using the deconcept embed and passing the following page
filename and location to the SWF.)

1. PHP back-end uploader -- Once the file is uploaded the filename and
description are inserted into a php SESSION variable.
2. PHP MySQL inserter -- Inserts the SESSION data into the MySQL
database
3. PHP image processor -- Resizes the stored full resolution image to
create and store a low-resolution thumbnail and a screen-optimized, 640
X 480, image.

In my debugging I have noticed that the PHP back-end uploader will
in-fact upload the file, however, it will not append some crucial
session data to the file name, namely MM_Username. Moreover, it will
indeed write the filename data to the session variable, however, it
will not insert the session data into the MySQL database. Furthermore,
it will access the PHP page that resizes and processes.

Once again, the whole combination work perfectly fine in IE. At first
I thought it wa a problem with the firefox and the deconcept embed,
but the SWF is certainly getting the data from the embed a it
successfully uploads the file and process them, it just doesn't
insert them into the MySQL database?

The code for the PHP-backend uploader is a follows:

[CODE]

<?php require_once('Connections/siteData.php'); ?>
<?php
if (!isset($_SESSION)) {
session_start();

}

?>
<?php
//path to storage
$storage = 'images';

//path name of file for storage
$uploadfile = "$storage/". basename(
$_SESSION['MM_Username']."_".$_FILES['Filedata']['name'] );

//if the file is moved successfully
if ( move_uploaded_file( $_FILES['Filedata']['tmp_name'] , $uploadfile
) ) {
//populated session array to be passed to SQL
$_SESSION['upFile'][] = basename(
$_SESSION['MM_Username']."_".$_FILES['Filedata']['name'] );
echo( '1 ' . $_FILES['Filedata']['name']);

//file failed to move

}else{
echo( '0');
}

?>

[/CODE]

The code for the MySQL inserter:

[CODE]

<?php require_once('Connections/siteData.php'); ?>
<?php
if (!isset($_SESSION)) {
session_start();

}

?>
<?php
// galleryInsert Recordset
mysql_select_db($database_siteData, $siteData);
$query_galleryInsert = "SELECT * FROM gallery";
$galleryInsert = mysql_query($query_galleryInsert, $siteData) or
die(mysql_error());
$row_galleryInsert = mysql_fetch_assoc($galleryInsert);
$totalRows_galleryInsert = mysql_num_rows($galleryInsert);
?>
<?php
// Instantiate Date Variable
$date = date ( 'D M j' );

// Populate fileArray with uploaded file value
$fileArray = $_SESSION['upFile'];

// Insert image data SQL
foreach($fileArray a $key => $value) {
$caption = '<A href=\"images/'.$value.'\"
target=\"_blank\"><U>'.($_GET['upname']).'</U></A>';
$ins_str = "INSERT INTO gallery VALUES
(NULL,'".$value."','".($_GET['upname'])."',
'".$_SESSION['MM_Username']."','".$date."','".$caption."', -1,
0,'".$_SESSION['sessionID']."', 0, 0)";
if (!mysql_query ($ins_str)) {
$r_string = '&errorcode=3&msg='.$msg;
} else {
// pas back id of inserted record
$r_string = '&errorcode=0&id='.$id.'&';
}

}

// Destroy $_SESSION['upFile'] array
unset($_SESSION['upFile']);
?>
<?php
mysql_free_result($galleryInsert);
?>

[/CODE]

In regard to the session, it is valid. If I run "print
$_SESSION['MM_Username'];" it output the correct username.

In case you are wondering, I use multiple <?php ?> tag in each page in order to more effeciantly structure the PHP for my editor, Dreamweaver 8. As far a functionality goes, someone preveoiusly raised that a a concern so I changed all of the page to a single <?php ?> tag per page. However, this had no effect on the functionality within FireFox.

Thanks.
