In testing an admin web application I have in Firefox 2 and now in Firefox 3 beta 3 I notice a difference in the way that the the file form field is handled. In Firefox 2 if I browse to a file in a path such a c:\my_directory1\my_directory2\my_file.ext I will get this file path when I request the data. However, in Beta 3 all I seem to get in the filename, in this case something like my_file.ext. Why is it cutting everything else off?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a form with a file field
2.view form, browse to a file, select, and submit
3.do a write out of the form data (multiple way to do this) and only the filename will be displayed.
Actual Results:
filename only display

Expected Results:
path should show
