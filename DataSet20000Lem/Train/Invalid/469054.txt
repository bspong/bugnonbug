Tab Rename: Not retaining between sessions.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

Right-clicked on a Tab, left-clicked "Rename Tab" from drop-down, typed-in new name for tab in Title box, and checked "Rename this tab permanently for all addresses".

The re-named tab hold their new name throughout the current session only.
However, after saving the session and exiting, then returning the next day and re-load Firefox browser, the new name may or may not be there. If they are not there, it is because the tab returned to the URL default address name. However, it they are still there, they won't be for very long ... just left-click on the tab then left-click on another tab and look at the tab you just left ... it return to the URL default name.
(I also have checked on the tab drop-downs "permanent tab" and "freeze tab".)

How do I go about permanently maintaining the renamed tab between session so that I don't constantly have to keep renaming them every time I load the Firefox 3 browser?
)I use the new Firefox 3 on a Micro U3 flash drive.)
