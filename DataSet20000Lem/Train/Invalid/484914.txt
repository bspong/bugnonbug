Mozilla Crash Reporter is elicited on exit and there ha not been any crash. To put it another way, it appears that by clicking on the X in the upper right hand corner, Firefox will close successfully. Then, for no apparent reason, the Mozilla Crash Reporter appears a if there wa a crash. There wa no crash. I checked the Windows XP SP3 Task Manager and firefox.exe doe NOT appear a a running process after I close Firefox and the Mozilla Crash Reporter is elicited.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on X in upper-right hand corner of Firefox browser window
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Mozilla Crash Reporter is activated

Expected Results:
Firefox closes, period.

I added the Personas theme add-on on Sunday 3/22/09 but bogus crash report on exit did not occur then. Started on Monday evening after several exit before that with no crash reporter activation. From Monday evening on, I keep getting a crash reporter activation simply on exit when there hasn't been any crash. Because of suspicion of an attempt by a hacker to get my e-mail address and somehow access my Firefox program, I simply close the crash reporter. Firefox restarts with no problem and there are any usage problems.
