While opening some site using Flash firefox hangs. It look like this:
http://public.mar.lt/iloveit.jpg
I'm unable to kill it. It happens with all browser so it probably Flash fault.

The actual file that crashed flash wa http://public.mar.lt/viewer.swf . It's not crashing at the moment (probably because broadcast is over)

I tried running only that one file with direct link and Flash crashed in all browsers. All browser are like firefox on this situation except IE that after taskkill hide from taskbar but it remains in process list.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site with flash
2. See how firefox hang
Actual Results:
Firefox hanged

Expected Results:
Firefox should have shown that Flash plugin ha crased and it need to restart or something. The really anoying thing is not the crash but that firefox hangs, it remains in taskbar and you're unable to kill it. Only restart helps.
