No longer capable to easily access and copy & Paste the Firefox version info from the About dialog
The About Minefield dialog used to have a read-only textbox with the version info and build ID in it. This could be tabbed to, selected and easily copied to the clipboard.

The newly redesigned About Minefield dialog completely take away this this functionality, making it impossible for a keyboard user to access that info.

STR:
1. Go to Help/About Minefield.
2. Tab around the dialog.

Expected: Hit the space where the version inof is.
Actual: No such thing is in the new tab order.
