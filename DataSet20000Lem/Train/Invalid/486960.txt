When Firefox crashes, the page or item that caused the crash is not saved in the Firefox history.

I had a couple of crash today and when I tried to find the offending page in the history, they weren't there. The page right before the one that cause the crash wa in the history, but not the one right after that cause the crash. If the crash reporter is able to tell what page you were on when the browser crashed, then that lead me to believe that Firefox know where I wa at when it crashed.
