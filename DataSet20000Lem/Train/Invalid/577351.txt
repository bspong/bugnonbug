I click on the button to display the image of a check but there is no response. When I try to leave Firefox by clicking the x in the upper right, the window close but task manager show Firefox task still running. I cannot restart Firefox unless I kill it with task manager.

Similar problem on webmail.spamcop.net when I click on button to reply or send a new message.

In both cases, some other button are fully functional. Bug occurs in v3.6.x with JRE v20

2. Click on the button to view a copy of the check
3. Gotcha!
Actual Results:
The check image doe not appear. I must use task manager to stop Firefox.

Expected Results:
I should see the check (it work in IE8)
