On www.deviantart.com I wa clicking through there gallery and clicking
on/saving quite a few pic for quite some time (1 to 1.5 hr) and felt my system
running slow, when I checked my memory usage FireFox wa at 459,204K (see
below). When browsing I would keep the main window open and then open pic I
liked in a new window. I would often click on the pic in the new window to see
a larger view of it. I would then close the new window when I wa done with
that pic. If I let my computer sit for 20min the memory drop in to the 200mb
range. I would say that firefox is not cleaning up memory fast enough rather
than not at all but that’s just my non programmer opinion.
I am running 1gb ddr memory, 2.8ghz p4, winxp pro sp2 all my patch a of
11/29/04, Firefox 1.0 en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 <<whatever
that means.
