My Firefox wa working fine until 2 day ago. I deleted the icon on the desktop, since it asn't responding when i clicked on it and proceeded to download a new copy of the software. Now, at the end of the download it keep on giving me the following error messages: 'Mounting failed', 'corrupt image'. I don't know why this is happening?
Please help.

Reproducible: Always




I am using a PowerMac G4 (Mac OX version 10.3.9)
