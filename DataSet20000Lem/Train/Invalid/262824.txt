Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1
I have these extension installed: adblock, flashblock, tabbrowser and openbook.

Clicking on image on this page
http://213.215.144.81/public_html/cafonal/cafonal_01.html (sorry for the ugly
face <g>) trigger a javascript function that open up a new window and write in
it the actual content.
I have popup blocking activated a i used to have in Mozilla 1.7.3 but in
Mozilla these link always worked.
Trying to open these link in firefox 0.10 will eventually lead (after one or
sometimes two tries) to the popup blocking checkbox (in the option window) to
be resetted to clear (as i wouldn't want popups blocked).
After this, no more these link works.
Opening page that trigger popups confirms that popup blocking don't work
anymore (as popups show up).
Closing and reopening Firefox doesn't restore popup blocking (it is really
disabled).


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable popup blocking
2. Open http://213.215.144.81/public_html/cafonal/cafonal_01.html
3. Click on image links, try a few time

Actual Results:
Popup blocking get disabled

Expected Results:
Popup blocking should stay enabled (while allowing those popups to open a I
actively linked on them)

These problem show in Firefox 0.10 a well a in Firefox 0.10.1

I have these extension installed: adblock, flashblock, tabbrowser and openbook.
I couldn't check it yet without these extension installed.
