I want the locationbar to not have any history of visited URLs (yes, I'm paranoid).
In earlier version I think setting the history = 0 day in the GUI menu wa
enough to get rid of all the site in the locationbar history but not so with
Firefox 1.0
So after some searching I found out about the about:config entry
"browser.sessionhistory.max_entries" and tried setting that to 0.
And then I tried setting it to 1.
And still all site I've visited sine my last start-up of Firefox is remembered.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set "browser.sessionhistory.max_entries" to 0 in about:config
2. enter "www.aftonbladet.se" in locationbar and press enter
3. enter "www.expressen.se" in locationbar and press enter
4. enter "www.snopes.com" in locationbar and press enter
5. press the down-arrow at the right side of the locationbar and be amazed to
see all site remembered regardless of "browser.sessionhistory.max_entries"
settings.
Actual Results:
Locationbar is still remembering old URLs

Expected Results:
Show now URLs with possible exception of current one.
