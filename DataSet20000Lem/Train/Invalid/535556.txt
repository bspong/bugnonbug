When in Google Reader and some other websites, sometimes when I put the mouse over a hyper-link it start blinking like crazy (very fast). At the bottom of the browser, it read the hyper-link (blinking at the same speed a the mouse) a one of the link in my bookmark toolbar. It pick the link randomly a far a I can tell. The toolbar button in question also blink like crazy at the same time like I'm putting the mouse over the button and off the button (only a zillion time a second). Occurs randomly.
