British dictionary not installed by default at install time when selected.

N.B. Reporting on behalf of a friend.

Using Firefox with Hotmail it wa found that the British dictionary wa not install with the rest of Firefox thereby leaving Firefox without spell checking capability and without information on *why* it wa missing.

If Firefox wa somehow unable to install the dictionary and wa left without a default it should at the very least check for this condition and inform the user no default ha been set.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install RC1, select British
2. Go to Hotmail
3. Spell checker doe not work.
Actual Results:
Firefox wa somehow unable to install the dictionary and left the user to wondering why Firefox doe not spell check like his IE install with no information to make a clear assertion to the root cause.

Expected Results:
Firefox to be sure it ha a default dictionary to insure spell checking is correctly functioning or warn otherwise.

Workaround: Install a dictionary by right clicking on a page..
