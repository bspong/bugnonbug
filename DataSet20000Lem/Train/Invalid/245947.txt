Create preference for throbber tooltip
The throbber tooltip in Firefox is inaccurate with a custom
browser.throbber.url. The tooltip suggests clicking will go to the Firefox home
page, which isn't true with another URL.

Bug 245271 comment 15 suggested browser.throbber.label for the pref name. The
relevant XUL attribute is "tooltiptext", and the entity is "&throbber.tooltip;".
I'd suggest one of those choice for consistency. (There are no prefs
containing the string "label" or "tooltip" in Firefox, so there's no
pre-existing style in prefs nomenclature.)
