Opening some web page intermittantly crash my PowerMac, dual G5, Mac OS X 10.4.9 (Tiger).

Apple ha lot of crash dump and bug report from me on this.

Always crash while in Firefox 2.0.0.4. Last crash wa while adding my Gmail.com
account to my Google page.

Mac OS X come up with the 'grayed out screen of death', telling me to power
cycle my machine. When I reboot, my Mac let me report the crash to Apple.

You should be able to get the crash dump from Apple.

It happens about once a day to me.

Seems to possibly happen more often when I open up web page in Tabs, but I'm
not yet sure about that.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I just keep using Firefox a my default browser.
2.
3.
