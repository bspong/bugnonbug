give user choice about launching after installation
I noticed that, unlike the Windows installer, the Linux installer doesn't give
the user a choice a to whether or not firefox should launch after installation
finishes.

observed while using recent branch (aviary 1.0) build on linux (tested on
fedora core 2).

1. download the installer for a linux build and decompress it.
2. run ./firefox-installer
3. chose either a standard or custom installation, and when you get to the
"ready to start installing mozilla firefox" panel click the Install button.

actual results: the installer run then auto-launches firefox.

expected: the installer shouldn't auto-launch firefox unless the user choses to
do so.

suggestions:

(a) at the "ready to start installing mozilla firefox" panel, provide a checkbox
saying "Launch Firefox after installation completes."

(b) or, after installation finishes, have the wizard display a panel saying
"Firefox ha been installed. Launch Firefox now. [checkbox]"

Windows doe something like (b), with the checkbox for auto-launch selected by
default. my own preference would be for (a), but (b) would be consistent across
platforms...
