Some extension seem not to install correctly if MFB is not restarted between
installations. Specifically the javascript debugger fails to install. Download
of a new nightly build made no difference so suspect my configuration file I
believe to be held a part of my profile.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install an extension. Don't restart
2. Install Javascript debugger (Venkman)
3. restart
4. No installation can I see!

Actual Results:
Javascript debugger never installs.

Expected Results:
Installed debugger like Mozilla 1.4
