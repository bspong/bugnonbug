Attempting to log in to my D-Link DIR-655 router fails under Firefox 3.0. Password confirmed a working correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type the DIR-655's internal IP into the Awesome bar (192.168.0.1)
2. Enter the administrator password for the router from within Firefox 3.0

Actual Results:
A warning box appears stating "The Network connection seems to be down. Press OK to try again". This also appears when something with the router is wrong, and need to have itself rebooted.

Expected Results:
Expected the browser to log into the router successfully.

Immediately after attempting to log in to the DIR-655 router with Firefox 3.0(did not modify network setting on any of the machine connected to the LAN, or make any change to the physical network setup, including removing and re-seating network cables), I attempted to log into the same router via Internet Explorer 7. Logging in from there worked correctly. Removed FF 3.0 and installed FF 2.0.0.14. Logging in to the router via Firefox 2.0.0.14 also work correctly from every machine on the LAN.
