Firefox normally work fine. However, after long session involving extensive
web browsing, often after my laptop ha been on without restarting for several
days, I have now had four or five occasion when, while using Firefox, the
computer restarts without warning. I am not 100% sure this is a Firefox problem
a opposed to a system problem, but every time it ha occurred, Firefox ha been
the open window and I've just clicked on a link (which work fine on other
occasions). It ha usually been preceded by dropping my wireless connection,
requiring a connection to Ethernet to continue browsing. Is cache management an
issue? This never occurred with IE.
I'm using an IBM Thinkpad T41 running XP Pro SP2 (and connecting using Netgear
wireless router).
