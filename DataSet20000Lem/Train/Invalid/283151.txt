The Problem seems not to be specifically related to the Platfrom(W2K) a it can
reprocduced also on a Linux-Box(Kernel 2.6.10-1.14). The Firefox Process is
using about 21MB of Memory but no CPU-Time at this Point.
After playing around a bit I found out that i may be related with the Extensions
a after uninstalling these it work fine(on Windows a well a Linux).
The installed Extensions were the following:
Googlebar(0.9.0.30)
Auto Copy(0.3)
Switch Proxy(1.3.1)

Uninstalling and Reinstalling work also fun until I install the Extensions in
which Case the Problem occurs again.
