Thunderbird mangle IMAP server directory path string
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050416 Fedora/1.0.3-1.3.1 Firefox/1.0.3
Build Identifier: Thunderbird 1.0.2 (20050317)

We are running uw-imap server. By convention, users' mail folder are stored on
the server in "~/Mail/". This is set in the Thunderbird mail account property
named "Imap server directory" (via the dialog box at Account
Settings->Server->Settings->Advanced Account Settings->IMAP(tab)), either using
the absolute path "~/Mail/" or the relative path "Mail" (Either way should
work). Thunderbird sometimes mangle the path string, converting slash
character (/) into pipe character (|). For example, ~/Mail/Sent becomes
~|Mail|Sent, or Mail/Trash becomes Mail|Trash.

I have closely examined the problem using Thuderbird 1.0.2 on Windows XP in a
simple and reproducible test scenario. However, we have encountered many
variation of this problem in a variety of real-life scenarios, involving
various version of Thuderbird client and Mozilla mail clients, in combination
with various version of uw-imapd, in various configurations.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new user acount on a mail server running uw-imapd. The new account
skeleton ha an empty "~/Mail/" directory. Initially, .mailboxlist doe not exist.

2. Create a new imap user account in Thuderbird, with the following properties:

Imap server directory: ~/Mail/ (or, alternatively, just "Mail")
Show only subscribed folder: CHECKED
Server support folder that contain subfolders and messages: UNCHECKED
Use idle commnad if server support it: CHECKED
Allow server to override the name spaces: UNCHECKED

3. Connect to server and attempt to create or access folder on the server.

Actual Results:
Upon initial connection, TB attempt to create a Trash folder on server. Upon
sending a message, TB attempt to create a Sent folder on server. But the path
sent in the IMAP CREATE command is mangled. Therefore, the server either fails
to create folder or else creates folder with incorrect path/name.

More specifically, TB translates slash (/) into pipe (|), and so attempt to
create folder name like "~|Mail|Sent" (if using tilde path) or "Mail|Sent" (if
using relative path).


Expected Results:
TB should have created the directory in their proper paths, ie. ~/Mail/Trash, etc.

Here is the exchange which follows the initial authentication (from tcpdump):

UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: 2 OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4REV1 IDLE
NAMESPACE MAILBOX-REFERRALS BINARY UNSELECT SCAN SORT THREAD=REFERENCES
THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT MULTIAPPEND] User testuser authenticated
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 3 lsub "" "~/Mail/*"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: 3 OK LSUB completed
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 4 list "" "INBOX"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: * LIST (\NoInferiors) NIL INBOX
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 5 list "" "~|Mail|Trash"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: 5 OK LIST completed
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 6 create "~|Mail|Trash"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: 6 NO CREATE failed: Can't create
~|Mail|Trash: invalid name

My explanation of the above: Thunderbird initially query subscription list
(lsub) using the correct server path "~/Mail/*". This being a newly created
account, the server correctly return nothing (i.e., ~/Mail/* is empty).
Thunderbird apparently doesn't like this response, and so Thunderbird mangle
the the server path string to ~|Mail|, and continues to use this mangled path
string for all subsequent communication with server, causing subsequent
command to fail.

For comparison, I created another test case, the only differnce being that I
manually edited the uw-imap subscription list file, .mailboxlist, adding the
fake entry "~/Mail/nonexistentfolder". The ~/Mail/ directory still empty, a
before. Compare:

UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: 1 OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4REV1 IDLE
NAMESPACE MAILBOX-REFERRALS BINARY UNSELECT SCAN SORT THREAD=REFERENCES
THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT MULTIAPPEND] User testuser authenticated
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 2 lsub "" "~/Mail/*"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: * LSUB () "/" ~/Mail/nonexistentfolder
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 3 list "" "INBOX"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: * LIST (\NoInferiors) NIL INBOX
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 4 list "" "~/Mail/Trash"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: 4 OK LIST completed
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 5 create "~/Mail/Trash"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: 5 OK CREATE completed
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 6 subscribe "~/Mail/Trash"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: 6 OK SUBSCRIBE completed
Thunderbird -> UW-IMAPD IMAP Request: 7 list "" "~/Mail/Trash"
UW-IMAPD -> Thunderbird IMAP Response: * LIST (\NoInferiors \UnMarked) "/"
~/Mail/Trash

This time the server responds to the initial lsub query, returning the fake
folder name. Thunderbird is happy and go on to create the Trash folder in the
proper (~/Mail/) directory.

So these test case show clearly the nature of the problem in a simple,
reproducible scenario involving a newly created user account, but the problem,
unfortunately, is more pervasive. (If the problem were only in creating new
user accounts, the above finding suggest a simple work-around.) We also
encounter the same path-mangling in other common situations: (1) When migrating
a user to a new desktop PC and reconnecting to his existing imap server account
(2) in deployment testing of a new, upgraded mail server, when we migrate user
mail account to the new mail server and connect from existing clients. In
these cases, when the user attempt to access an existing mailbox, he get a
message like:

"The current command did not succeed. The mail server responded: SELECT failed:
Can't open mailbox ~|Mail|Sent: no such mailbox."

So the common thread here is that the server path ha been mangled, and so the
folder (in this case a real, existing folder) cannot be accessed. I have not
yet had the opportunity to analyze these case in depth, but from what I know
now, I am guessing it might also have something to do with the content server
subscription file, or more precisely, Thunderbird's pathological response to
what is being returned by the lsub command.

It would seem that Thunderbird's refresh function (i.e., the "refresh" button
from Thunderbird's "Subscribe" dialog box) ought to be able to sort out any
discrepancy between the subscription list and what actually exists in the
server directory path, but I have observed that, when refreshing, Thunderbird
also query the server using the mangled path, so nothing is found, and so the
"refresh" function is quite useless.

So in summary, I have experienced a variety of problem resulting from TB
mangling the server directory path string by translating slash (/) character to
pipe (|) characters, and I have described a detailed test scenario for observing
this bug in one of it various manifestations.
