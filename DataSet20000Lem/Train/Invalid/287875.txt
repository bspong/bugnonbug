There are really two issue here. One: the add bookmark/rename bookmark/add
folder panel in the add bookmark sheet and manager use one sole tab to say
"info". This one tab doe not look good in OS X a it is a 'sole" tab. There are
surely other way of describing what the window is doing. Tabs are only to be
used when selecting multible panel in one window. and
B) If there is no other way of changing the above, at least overhaul the sole
tab so that it mesh with the current tab interface. The current tab are
actual button centered at the top of an embedded panel. I'll upload a picture.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Look at any "add" or "rename" panel concerning bookmarks.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Uses tabs/uses wrong tab interface

Expected Results:
Shouldn't use tabs/should use current OS 10.3+ tab interface.
