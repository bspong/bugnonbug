Summary: Should drag and drop/reordering of bookmark trigger switch to "Unsorted" view to match up with the Bookmarks Toolbar?

This might be WONTFIX, but it's good to have it discussed/resolved.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open the Bookmarks Manager.
2. In any view but "Unsorted," drag and drop bookmark (in the "Title" column), and note their position on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

Actual Results:

Although their position are updated in real-time on the Bookmarks Toolbar, within the Bookmarks Manager, item remain sorted by whichever current sort view is used.

Expected Results:

I think it's a valid-enough use case to suggest that we trigger the "Unsorted" view on drag and drop, at least for the Bookmarks Toolbar folder items...
