build instruction do not work - need manual ./configure step
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030425 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/README.html give instruction for
a build from CVS.

In fact, 'gmake -f client.mk build' doe not initially work. The Makefile is not
created from Makefile.in in at least the browser directory is not created by
this step.

I ran './configure --enable-crypto --disable-tests --disable-debug
--disable-mailnews --disable-composer --enable-optimize=-O2 --disable-ldap
--disable-mailnews
--enable-extensions=default,-inspector,-irc,-venkman,-content-packs,-help
--enable-plaintext-editor-only' first. The went back to 'make ... build' and
thing seem to work.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get fresh CVS checkout (make ... checkout)
2. make ... build
3. make dy because there is no makefile in browser

Actual Results:
make dy because there is no makefile in browser


Expected Results:
There should be a make file in browser

this wa tested for firebird only. I have not tested mozilla.
