Build ID show in Firefox 2.0 release version titlebar
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

The build ID began showing after I upgraded to RC3. After the release version became available I had to upgrade manually(RC3 didn't see it). However, the build ID(which I'd assume would disappear with the upgrade) stayed.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Build ID shown in titlebar.

Expected Results:
Titlebar contains only page title and Mozilla Firefox
