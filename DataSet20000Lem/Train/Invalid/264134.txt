Missing button and other graphic in etrade web page

The etrade web site is unusable with Firefox because many button and
other graphic are invisible. I used to access etrade with Mozilla but
it ha been a while and they may have changed their web site. So this
may be an evangelism issue.

But they are a fairly high-profile site and it is not good if Firefox can
not view it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delete all cooky for any etrade domain (us.etrade.com, www.etrade.com etc.)
2. Enter https://us.etrade.com into the address bar and press ENTER
3.

Actual Results:
Missing buttons, such a the orange "LOG ON" button under the
username/password fields.

I will try to attach screen shot showing Firefix vs. Internet Explorer
(FF on Linux, IE on Windows XP)
