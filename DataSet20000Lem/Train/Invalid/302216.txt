HTML sourcecode example

<html>


<!-- Margins set like in line 11 of the body tag will move the first line almost
out of sight = before line 1
Question: How could you ever level up logical (text and graphics) line 1 before
actual line 1 in the output context ?
This in an inconsequent behaviour to me ! Only CSS shall be able to do thing
like that (if wanted to place the starting pixel line out of (=above) the output
context.

Consequence: Let graphical pixel line 1 be the top of the output in any case
except for ! a CSS setting ! is altering the first pixel line to a level above
the first pixel line -->

<!-- Leave away the margin setting of the body tag below - here in the HTML
source - to observe mistake 2 and 3 in a more convenient way -->

<body rightmargin="0" topmargin="0" leftmargin="0" bottommargin="0"
marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">


<!-- Mistake 2: combination of two nested font tag with 12 !!! (11 do not show
the mistake) BIG tag disables the linefeed by <br>
Hint: Obviously an error - a sort of overflow - in the tag counting structure
and the procedure managing these -->

<!-- Leave away one BIG tag and strangely enough it will work in Firefox a
expected -->

<FONT face=times color=#ff6820 size=5>
<BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG><BIG>
<BIG>
<FONT size=2>
Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1
Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1 Line 1
<br>


<!-- Mistake 3: leaving no space between &nbsp and the string "Line..." make
the special character '&nbsp' to be interpreted a text rather than a special
character.
Solution: Parsing '&nbsp' should immediately result in a space character in the
output stream ! -->

&nbspLine 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line
2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2 Line 2

</FONT>
</BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG></BIG>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just save the html code of the Details section to a .htm file and opem the
.htm file with Firefox to see mistake 1
2. delete the margin setting of the body tag to see mistake 2 and 3
3. delete one <big> </big> tag bracket to see mistake 2 to disappear, insert a
blank character after &nbsp to make mistake 3 go away


Expected Results:
