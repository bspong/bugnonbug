When browsing Newegg's product selection page, Nightly will lock up when an option is selected from any of the drop down menu on the left of the page and "search" is pressed.

3.Several drop down menu will appear, select any one and choose a selection (Form Factor > 1.8"; in my case)
4.Press "search" button
