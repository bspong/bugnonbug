While watching a video online the amount of buffering ha increased to every few second even when the entire video ha loaded. It cause the video to pause frequently over and over again for a few seconds, sometimes freezing it completely. This also happened in the previous version of FF. I do have the Flash Blocker on but this problem showed up even before adding this tool to FF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to webpage and begin video
2.Pause video until most or entire video ha loaded (this might take a few minutes)
3.Let the video play and watch how much the video ha to pause for Buffering over and over again
Actual Results:
The video continued to buffer even when the video wa through loading, every few second it would pause.

Expected Results:
The video, once completely loaded, should be able to play without the need of buffering every few seconds.
