Created attachment 543091
A quick screenshot of exactly where my plus is stuck. It look fairly normal except that it won't move.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I decided to move the "New Tab" button to the left of my tab bar via the customise option and clicked "Done". After deciding it wa actually le convenient there, I tried to move it back.


Actual results:

The plus became stuck there and will not move back to the right. It move during customisation, but a soon a I click the "Done" button, it immediately jump back to the left. Putting space between the tab and the plus doe not help, nor doe shutting down Firefox and restarting it.


Expected results:

The plus should've moved back to the right and stayed there. As is, it won't budge.
