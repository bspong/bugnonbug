At work, when using Firefox 4.0.1 beta, I cannot connect to any internet site (ex google.com). I can connect to site within my corporate intranet. I did not have this problem with Firefox 4.0, and don't have the problem using IE or chrome.

There is no proxy set up. I verified that no proxy wa configured under "Internet Settings". I also set the "No Proxy" setting in Firefox, with no change.

I tried in safe mode, and I also tried with a clean profile. In both case the behavior wa the same. I can connect to intranet sites, but not the internet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to google.com
2. Firefox report "Unable to connect"
3. Go to website on corporate intranet
4. Website load successfully
Actual Results:
Firefox cannot connect to an internet site.

Expected Results:
Site should load.
