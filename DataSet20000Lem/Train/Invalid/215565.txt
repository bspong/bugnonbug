Form Variables are sometimes posted with original value instead of current value

I change some of my hidden form variable using JavaScript. However,
intermittenly these variable are posted to the server using their original
value instead of the current value assigned by the Javascript.

So my form work sometimes and then unexpected do not work. When I check the
posted value for the form variable in such case I will find one with the
wrong value (ie. the value posted doe not agree with the current value on the
web page.)
