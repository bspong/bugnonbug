SAP Internet Transaction Server page display different Theme in Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

From the SAP Note 1010519:

"You can only activate this parameter for the new Streamline theme of SAP GUI for HTML (~webgui_theme 2002 in the standalone ITS 6.20 or ~webgui_theme SL in the integrated ITS). This mean that the parameter is not available for the Mozilla Firefox browser in the standalone ITS 6.20 or for NetWeaver 2004 with integrated ITS 6.40."

This mean that I see the page in a different theme than IE.
Do you think is a fix to be solved in SAP ITS or it's a mozilla firefox Bug?

Reproducible: Always
