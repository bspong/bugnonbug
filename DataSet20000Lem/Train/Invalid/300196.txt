I am having the same problem, Firefox crashes, QFA creates error log, but there
is no Incident ID # showing, I have at least 4 crash result that are in queue.
The QFA doe not send them, although it doe try, I then get the following
error "The Agent is unable to connect to the Server. Please check your proxy
setting or try again in a few seconds." Firefox is crashing all the time,
never happened before, just in the past week. I have lost my entire profile. I
am running AVG anti-virus and Zone Alarm, if that mean anything. I have DSL.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. It just happens, I do not know why
2.
