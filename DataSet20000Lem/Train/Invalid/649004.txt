browser.urlbar.autofill doesn't function for URLs in history of website that redirect to the www subdomain unless you type "www." first.

If you go to a website that redirects itself to the www subdomain (such a mozilla.org, which immediately redirects to www.mozilla.org), then the AwesomeBar's autofill (browser.urlbar.autofill) functionality won't autofill when you start typing the URL (such a "moz") unless you precede the URL with a "www."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit mozilla.org -- or another website that redirects itself to the www subdomain (many site do this) -- a couple of times.
2. Open a new tab and start typing that URL you just visited in the AwesomeBar, without a preceding "www.". For example, if you went to mozilla.org, type "moz".
Actual Results:
The URL won't be autofilled/autocompleted in the addressbar, unless you type "www." first.

Expected Results:
URLs of website that redirect themselves to the www subdomain should be autofilled/autocompleted in the addressbar regardless of whether or not you prepend a www when typing it, like IE, Chrome, and Opera do.

Right now, about half of the website I visit won't autocomplete for me in the AwesomeBar unless a I prepend a "www".
