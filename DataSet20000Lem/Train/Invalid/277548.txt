Inability to access Easylink website
Hi, Rob Clark here.
I am network manager for a small school that run an RM CC3 network. Part of the
network ha an Easylink secure website that allows student and staff to log in
to their own work area. This is coded in asp. and us webfolders. Because of
this they still have to use the dreaded IE to gain access to their file from
home. When accessing the site through FireFox after accepting the security
certificate the screan go blank instead of getting a login screen.
It would be great if they could use FireFox.
