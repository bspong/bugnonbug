Ubuntu user reported that various of the dialogue and window accessible from Edit / Preferences were too small for their contents. I wa able to reproduce this with a fresh profile from the Ubuntu build.

Note that Ubuntu's firefox generally us pango for most of it font rendering, which might have an effect on the overall layout.

I have gone through all of the dialogue box which were insufficiently large and changed the size in our version, and will attach the corresponding patch to this report after I have filed it.

However, the system strike me a fragile. Some of the dialogue box have size in ems, at least, rather than pixels, but even then change to the content seem not to be reliably reflected in dialogue size changes. Surely there should be some kind of automatic sizing mechanism which would avoid these kind of problem ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For example, in Ubuntu 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.2-0ubuntu1, select
Edit / Preferences ... / Connection Settings ...
and observe that the RHS of the dialogue content are off the RHS of the dialogue box.
