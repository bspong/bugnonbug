I don't know when this appeared (some checking were done recently to make the
'Customize...' dialog look more like a window) but if you open the
'Customize...' dialog on window _without_ running the theme engine, a title bar
will appear above it (see the screen shot)

There are at least two problem with firefox when you are using the app without
any theme in window (the other one being the missing border in _any_ progress
bar), you should try to fix those before 1.0 final

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
0. Make sure you have the classic window style, dont use the theme
1. Open the 'Customize...' window
Actual Results:
You see a titlebar floating above the dialog

Expected Results:
No titlebar at all
