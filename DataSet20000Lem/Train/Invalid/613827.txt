I had this before. Thhe place thing. Apparently fixed?!? Funny. According to bock access trace Firefox writes to places.sqlite-journal every few minutes. Even more, it now writes also to sessionstore-3.js a well a _CACHE_001_ and others when idle.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Install a current copy of Firefox
Actual Results:
Messig disk. No way to do an idle spin down. No way to reduce power consumption.

Expected Results:
Reasonably behaviour when idle. Allows user to spin down disk.

Im going to close this bug report a WONTFIX according to prior experience with the bug handling at Mozilla foundation. Would somebody please scrap my account. I' m tired of having bug around for years.
