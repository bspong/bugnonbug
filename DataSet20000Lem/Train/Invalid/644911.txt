Navigation toolbar, added Icons are not displayed.

I wanted to see the Reload, Stop, Bookmarks icons. So I started Customize and added the Icons to the navigation toolbar. When the Customize screen is open the icon will be displayed in the navigation toolbar. However when I use the aply key in the Customize menu the Icons wont be shown in my layout.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select Customize menu
2.Add Icons
3.Select Aplly
Actual Results:
Added Icons missing in the navigation toolbar

Expected Results:
FF 4 should show the icons, by resizing the navigation entry field?

I have screen dumps, send me a mail if you want them.
