about:config fails to update security.enable_java
1. about:config
2. change security.enable_java to false
3. quit browser
4. restart

expect security.enable_java to remain false.
actual security.enable_java is still true.

Mac OS, but not Windows. Not sure about Linux.

This ha security implication since it make it difficult(impossible?) to disable java on mac o x.
