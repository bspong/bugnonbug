User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110914 Firefox/9.0a1
Build ID: 20110914030906

Steps to reproduce:

I use Debian 6.0.2 (squeeze).
I found it at Firefox 6 also it appears at Nightly 9.0a1 (2011-09-14).
Before test it again, I first backup and delete my folder .mozilla.

Steps To Reproduce:
1) Navigate to “Bookmarks” and select the property of one bookmark.
2) Right click to the top of the window and select “Move to Workspace Right” (no matter if right or left)
3) See the main window ha disappear.
4) Close the window of Properties of the bookmark.
5) Firefox still not appears and it will not appear if clicking at the window list.

The only way to reappear is to switch workspace and then return to the first one. Or right click at Firefox at the window list and minimize - unminimize.

It also happen at "Bookmarks Toolbar" property window.


Actual results:

Firefox not appears, except of the window list.
