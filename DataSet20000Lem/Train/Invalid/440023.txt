I have a file:/// based homepage. When I click on a http:// menu item displayed by the homepage the address appears in the status bar at the bottom of the browser page but is not propagated to the address bar at the top. I can never connect to a http:// site this way. If I simply type the URL into the address bar, I connect to the site properly.

If I start FireFox 3.0 in -safe-mode, the file:/// homepage operates properly a it did before with FireFox 2.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Make the script below your homepage, referenced by file:///
