I have a posted a sample page of the problem at http://www.tom-gibson.com/test6.html. This page only contains a background image, a text box and a flash movie. If you click in the text box, a black box will appear and cover some of the content of the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.tom-gibson.com/test6.html with a mac firefox brower
2. Use your mouse to click in the text box
3. You will see the black box appear


Actual Results:
A black box appeared and cover part of the page.

Expected Results:
I expected to be able to type in the text box without part of the page disappearing.
