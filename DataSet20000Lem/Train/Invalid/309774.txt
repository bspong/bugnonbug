Javascript issue with APPLET
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I will leave a sample page up for a while at
http://server6.onlineproject.com/Tests/City2004/PadKLL2C.nsf/testing?OpenForm .

I am unable to get the applet using document.applets.

I can get the applet using document.getElementsByTagName('APPLET').
After doing so, however, I cannot get it's properties. For example, outerHTML
come back a undefined.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the webite provided in Firefox - DO NOT use IE. The second alert will
crash IE.
2. On open, an IBM/Lotus applet will run. Javascript will attempt to throw a
DIV around this applet.
3. The first alert you will see contains the outerHTML of the applet.
4. The second alert contains the outerHTML of the applet after attempting to add
a DIV around it.

To see this in IE (without the second alert - which cause a crash) go to
http://server6.onlineproject.com/Tests/City2004/PadKLL2C.nsf/testingIE?OpenForm
Actual Results:
Java applet doe not have DIV tag set & is unavailable.

Expected Results:
Correctly set DIV tag around the applet.
