I can access to hp printer service. the message report "unable to perform this operation" and i have this problem only with firefox from version 2 to minefield.The solution to close all firefox's window doesn't work.
i know this problem isn't new.....but i don't understand (like me other people) why i love this browser and i can't use it. i can't think to uninstall firefox everytime i have to check my printer.Sorry for my english!Thanks
