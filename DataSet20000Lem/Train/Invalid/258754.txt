firefox polish
list from feedback alias, reported on linux--can these be confirmed?

1. About Firefox doesn't handle being resized in a pretty way (my window
manager force all window to be the same width).

2. About Popup Blocking panel ha a resizer widget that actually works.
While that is quite a lot of fun, it should be disabled.

3. Sidebar menu still need to be removed, with Bookmarks moved to the
Bookmarks menu and History to the Go menu.

4. Full Screen doesn't use the right window manager hint on Linux. It
totally doesn't work with my window manager. It appears to be trying
to do it itself, which fails in a laughable way (the scrollbar get
cut short, for one). This used to work better around 0.8 or before.
--note: appears ok on win xp/0901. should be checked on linux.

5. View Source doesn't show the current cursor position. Seamonkey doe this;
it seems harmless to me and is quite useful for debugging.

6. The focus outline around label next to checkboxes is way too big.
