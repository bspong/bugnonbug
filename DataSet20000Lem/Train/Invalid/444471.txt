I download a zip file with the same name after the file changed and I get the cached copy not the newly-modified version

I have a webpage that us javascript to send a zip file to the end user. This zip file can be changed by the user and re-downloaded again with the new updates, but the file name doe not change. Here is the javascript:
<script language=javascript>
setTimeout("location.href='./storage/tmp-2d63dd8ac1caa2751d9c62b83737d6ca.zip'", [1000]);
</script>

What happens is that firefox doesn't check the file to see if it's modified from the cached version, and the end user always receives the cached copy even thought the file size is different and the modification date/time is different.

I have verified this in Windows and Linux, in FF2 and the latest FF3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a .zip file from a webpage, ie: http://localhost/test.zip
2. Change the content of the test.zip file
3. Re-download http://localhost/test.zip
Actual Results:
You receive the cached copy everytime not the newly modified copy.

Expected Results:
I expect that firefox should check the file-size and modification info of the file being requested/sent to the browser, and if it doesn't match the cached copy, replace the version in cache with the one being requested.
