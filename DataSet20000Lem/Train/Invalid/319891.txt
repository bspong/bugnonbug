Open the page
http://www.aztv.co.il/site/programs/programs.asp?start=now
and you get an empty diplay panel, that should contain the list channel and the program that are currently being broadcasted.

Something is wrong with the java script - either on the page or in the mozilla interpreter.
(IE displayes it just fine)

Reproducible: Always
