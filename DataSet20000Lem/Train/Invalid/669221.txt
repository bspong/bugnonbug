Firefox Crashes on Startup, go to crash report
User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/4.0; (R1 1.6); SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; InfoPath.2)

Steps to reproduce:

I wa surfing the net when my computer wa infected by a "Personal Shield Pro" attack. Whether or not this ha any impact on what happens afterward, I don't know. I removed that virus with MalwareBytes. I updated Firefox to the latest version.

I am using window 7 64-bit.


Actual results:

Now, when I open firefox, it go to the crash reporter screen asking to submit a crash report, or it display the altnerate 'did not leave a crash dump file' screen. Using safemode (either by adding the command line '-safe-mode' or holding shift while clicking firefox) doe not alleviate the problem.


Expected results:

Firefox should have opened.
