When using the Bandwitdth Tester with 4 tab open locked firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

I installed the 1.0.1 version of Firefox on the Mac 10.3.8 completely patched
and permission run etc. I also installed the Bandwidth tester.....seemed to
work 3 time in a row testing it at slightly different times. on the 4th try it
took longer to test than the previous times....when I tried to select the FF
window, it would not allow me to.....I could cancel the tester, but not use any
open tab or the browser...I had to force quit

thanks

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:
Let me continue using the browser and tab
