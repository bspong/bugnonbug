RFE: Preference option to suppress Restore Session dialog (Always/Never)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

I use multiple window with multiple tabs. When I have to restart window I get the Restore Session dialog (good, because I *DO* want to pick up where I left off).

It take Mozilla a while to start after an update, and I would like to streamline the startup by setting a Restore Session default answer, preferably by check box on that window, and necessarily somewhere in Options should I need to change the setting later.

I suggest Tools > Options > Advanced > Session (new option tab)



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple window
2. Force shutdown of Firefox
3. Start Firefox


Actual Results:
Restore Session dialog

Expected Results:
Used my default preference instead of prompting me to Restore Session.
