Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.please visit : http://betah.co.il/
2. then search for any book with '#' in it for example say C#. then you would get a list of book to download.
3. then you have a link against each e book 'Read more to download' click on that link

Actual Results:
This would not get processed but when I tried the same with Other browser like Interent Explorer it worked.


Expected Results:
We need to get further detail of how to download and the link for download would appear.

I have faced similar problem when I tried this with a forum at http://nagfans.nowpos.com but i dont remember the exact link.
