when will firefox be completely compatible with x3100 graphic card and drivers?

Reproducible: Always




you might want to contact Intel for the detail on the possible upcoming updated driver for x3100 card because they haven't released an update for window 7 x3100 since 2009. And could mess with gpu and cpu acceleration of firefox 4. So Please Make firefox 4 Fully compatible with x3100 because a lot of user are using computer with x3100 driver and it lag when direct2d 10 is enabled so please fix that incompatibility a soon a possible.
Thanks
