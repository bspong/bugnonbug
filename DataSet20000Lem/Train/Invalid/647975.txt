Google Calculator search suggestion - or perhaps any search suggestion list of length 1 - no longer appears in Firefox 4.

I'm used to using the Google search bar a a handy in-browser calculator that doesn't take up any extra space (as an add-on would) and can handle complex expressions. In FF3, all I have to do is type in the expression, maybe with an equal sign (=) at the end, and it show me the calculation result a a single search suggestion. I can then remember the result and input it wherever needed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
In Google Search bar, type in a mathematical expression followed by an equal sign, such a "2*2=".
Actual Results:
Nothing happens. No search suggestion are shown.
(If you hit enter to conduct the search, the result is displayed, but it take over the tab to display the result).

Expected Results:
A single search suggestion appears, namely "= 4".
This is the useful behavior of FF3.

Personally, I see this a a major feature that broke in the "upgrade." I will not install FF4 on my other machines, and may revert on this one for my general use, until the bug is fixed.
