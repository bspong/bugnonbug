When too more downloads or megabyte limit (i don't improve this), firefox is
blocking and not responding with memory increment (i seen it in process of
task manager). It ha been 3 or 4 time (i wa downloaded about 10 gigabytes),
but i can't reproduced it, because it may be need too much downloads. My system:
win xp sp2 corporate ru

Reproducible: Always
