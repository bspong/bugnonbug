Installer text say "Click Next" but the button is labelled "Forward"

The first page of 'Firefox Setup' ha some text at the top which end "Click
Next to continue the Setup program". At the bottom it re-iterates "Click Next
to continue installing Mozilla Firefox 1.0PR."

But there is no button labelled "Next"! There is however one labelled "Forward".

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run 'Firefox Setup'.

Actual Results:
See text referring to a non-existent button.

Expected Results:
They should match: either the button need renaming, or the text should be
changed in both places.

I did this on Linux, but I'm guessing that the same text is used on all platforms.

Of the severity category listed this is 'trivial': it's mostly cosmetic, and
there's no loss of function.

But given how eager Ben is to make installing 'Firefox' a simple and a
unconfusing a possible for those not familiar with computers, I'm requesting
blocking-1.0; I think being asked to click a non-existent button is just the
sort of thing that could confuse such a (potential) user!
