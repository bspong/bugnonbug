Firefox suffers from extensive memory leak over long browsing period
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

If Firefox is used for a long time, intermittently - say half a day or more - without restarting, it start to use a very large amount of memory. Closing all open tab and clearing the disk cache doe not help - the only thing that doe is closing the browser entirely, and opening it again.
As I type this, firefox.exe's memory usage is 82.2 MB. It often rise to 130 or even 160 MB.
If Firefox ha swelled to a large size, it also ha trouble ending the process upon being closed. It often take several minute for firefox.exe to start reducing it memory usage and to disappear from the Task Manager process list - even after all Firefox window are closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox for several hours, browsing a lot of pages.
2. Check the memory usage in the process list.
3. Try closing Firefox - and keep watching it entry on the process list.
