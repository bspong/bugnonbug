cs font-family setting are overridden by ff for form tag if not set directly on the tag
Take this basic cs part for example:
body {
font-family: Arial, serif;
}

text in form tag like input, button, textarea is not rendered in Arial or default serif like all other text on the website.

Workaround:
set font-family directly on the tag works:
button { font-family: Arial, serif }

The workaround doe also help in Bug:

FF should not overide the setting on input tags.

Tested on:
Ubuntu
Windows7
