When I opened FX this morning an extension/plug-in named AutocompletePro wa listed in my addons a just added which wa not on it when I closed FX last night.
It permit disabling, but the Uninstall button is inactivated.The bug is the inactivation of uninstall.

Reproducible: Didn't try




This seems to be an adware engine rather than more malicious for now. Mozilla with add-on give the user substantial control of the browser which competitor envy. If Mozilla allows an add-on developer to force use it is displaced a is the user. Inactivation of 'Uninstall' on add-on should be unacceptable coding.
