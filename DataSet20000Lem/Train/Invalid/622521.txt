Firefox 4b8 fails to load CSS/JS for Google AdSense

It seems, for some reason, Firefox 4.0 beta 8 fails to load the CSS and JS of Google AdSense. The page load only the text, but fails to display any layout, CSS or anything else.

The cache were clear. I opened the page for the first time since I got a new computer and it wouldn't display it properly. I cleared it afterwards anyway, but still no success.

I must admit, though, that I haven't checked if Google is doing User Agent sniffing and sending different content based on browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in with the Google Account that manages your AdSense.
2. Go to http://www.google.com/adsense

Actual Results:
On Firefox, if you're already logged in, you'll see a cyan/gray screen. On any other browser, it show the AdSense dashboard.

Similar effect happen on other pages: On Account Creation, the text is displayed, but no layout information is loaded. The JS also seems to fail to load, with some part displaying only "true" or "false".

Expected Results:
Page rendered properly.

Again, I haven't checked if it isn't Google doing User Agent sniffing and sending broken/incompatible data.
