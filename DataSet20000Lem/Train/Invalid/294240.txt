when trying to install in fedora3 I get an error message saying that libstdc++.so.5 is missing
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko)
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0

starting firefox-installer in fedora3 give the following
result: ./firefox-installer-bin: error while loading shared libraries:
libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. change to directory 'firefox-installer' a root
2. use the command './firefox-installer'
3.

Actual Results:
./firefox-installer-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory


Expected Results:
installed firefox

fedora3 use 'libstdc++.so.6' so I guess the problem is that there is no
firefos-installer for fedora3
