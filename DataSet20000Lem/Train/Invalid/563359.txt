This is a packaging error, a far a I know. This problem doe _not_ appear on Windows.

The default Search Engines (Ask.com etc.) re-appear if I upgrade Firefox via synaptics/apt-get.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install custom search engine and remove some of the defaults.
2. Upgrade Firefox to a new version via apt-get o.s.s.
3. Look into the Search Engine list
Actual Results:
All custom engine and default engine are installed.

Expected Results:
Only the custom engine and not deleted engine should be there.
