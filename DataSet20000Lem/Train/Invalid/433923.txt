When you bookmark an https: site and there's a mismatched certificate, firefox doesn't alert you and redirects you immediately.

Is this expected?

Note: this is not a trunk bug, it's been with firefox for a while now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.bookmark the URL
2.open a new instance of firefox and hit the bookmark

Actual Results:
get redirected with no warning

Expected Results:
there should be a warning like when you click on it?
