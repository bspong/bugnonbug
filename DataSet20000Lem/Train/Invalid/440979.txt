Does not occur with IE7.

Difficult to establish whether this is a known bug ('fixed' or otherwise)due to large number of hit on bug search. Since I don't have the HTML knowledge to gut through the source-code, I'm reporting the bug as-is, hoping that it's easy to recognise by someone familiar with table encoding in HTML.

Difficult to assign to correct Firefox component because a) Layout component not listed in drop down on bug report page. b) Not definitely a problem with layout! Could be due to table running under right margin that wa wrongly set. c)Could be bad HTML that just happens to work in IE7!
