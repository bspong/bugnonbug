Support drag-and-drop of RSS feed (icon) from Firefox

I've had a user suggest this, and it make some sense. They tried clicking and
dragging the RSS feed icon from the bottom right of Firefox to Thunderbird, and
it didn't work. They're not very technical people, so it became somewhat of a
chore for them to find the feed URL and add it with a wizard to Thunderbird.

Now, I realize this would require work on both products, but I'm opening it here
first.

Is it possible to get support so we can click and drag around the RSS icon in
the bottom right? If that get done, then the next step would be to add a
listener to Thunderbird to receive the RSS feed.
