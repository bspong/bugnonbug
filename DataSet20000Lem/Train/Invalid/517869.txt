Flash page refresh doesn't update change correctly

I'm taking the given page a an example.
(Create an account if you must, otherwise test on http://orochimaru-pil.mybrute.com )
When I login to the page, the correct page is shown, but I'm still not logged in. After I press CTRL+F5 I suddenly am logged in.
Furthermore when I push the button that say 'Register your brute' nothing happens, while actually it should change into a textmessage saying that I've been registered.

The same thing happen on another game site http://en.dinorpg.com and on my site of my bank, every time I click something once I'm logged into my bank, I have to login again.

All this didn't happen before 3.5 and doesn't happen when I try Internet Explorer.
I've reinstalled firefox, downgraded firefox, upgraded again, created new profile etc, uninstalled pluggins, but nothing helps!

Please help me :(
