If a bookmarklet is used like the one in this bug's URL field above, it will pop up a window when the bookmark is clicked. If the popup is cancelled, a void value is returned which break the URL entry field - you can't type into it any more. Other tabs' URL field will continue to work, just not the tab that had the focus when the bookmarklet wa cancelled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bookmark with the above javascript URL
2. Click on the bookmarklet and a window will pop up
3. Cancel the popup (for the simplified URL above, OK or Cancel make no difference)
4. Try typing a new web address into the URL field, and you will find that you can't get the text cursor to go into the field.
Actual Results:
You don't seem to be able to focus the text field.

Expected Results:
The URL field should continue to behave a it did before the bookmarklet wa clicked.
