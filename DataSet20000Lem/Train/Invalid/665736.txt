The new design of the PayPal homepage ha on it left the button for "sign up", and "login". Behind those are link defined with "rel=nofollow". Clicking on those button doe not have any visible effect. "Open link in new tab" open the desired links.

Tried it with FF4 (same result) and IE9 (works).

Other link on the page (not "nofollow") work in both version of FF,
therefore I suspect that this tag is causing a problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the paypal site above
2. click on "login"
3.

Actual Results:
Browser remains on the page

Expected Results:
Browser load new page, in this case the login page
