Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

env: fresh FF 2.0 install with fresh profile, no modifications, no plugins, no extensions.

clicking on any of the MP3 link for the for the site, or the PDF link, crash FF without invoking the talkback agent (ex: http://www.thehypertonics.com/mp3/the_hypertonics_53_demo_future_shock.mp3). FF exit to desktop and, very briefly, display the download dialog box (asking where to save), then nothing. behavior can repeated on every attempt. eventually, FF would no longer start with error: "FF is already running, you must first close...", however firefox.exe wa not listed in any process list. it would not start in safe mode either. i uninstalled FF, del application dir and moved profile, reinstalled, and FF would still not start and reported the same "already running" error. uninstalled again, del all reg entries, reinstall and it worked.

i looked at their source code and couldn't find anything obvious, but i'm no expert.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click any MP3 link and FF should crash
2. keep repeating until FF will no longer start (approx. 5+ times)

Actual Results:
FF would no longer run with error stating that the process wa already running. this wa not correct a demonstrated by both taskmanager and sysinternals process explorer.

Expected Results:
opened the download dialog asking to save or open link target (*.mp3)

i'm flagging this a a potential security problem because this behavior is very strange and unexpected.
