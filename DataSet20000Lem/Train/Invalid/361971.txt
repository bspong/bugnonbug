This is currently the only thing keeping me from switching fully to Firefox from AvantBrowser. Typically I have a LOT of tab open for my various research project that I like to come back to the next day, without having to browse through favorite or history to figure out which one I wa reading. Avant ha a feature that save all open tabs, and then when you next open the browser, it give you a list of what you had open. You can uncheck the one you don't want, which is also very handy.

Reproducible: Always
