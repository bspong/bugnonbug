Image link context menu and property not complete for keyboard user
Env: Bon Echo 20060515 nightly build

Description:
When you right-click the mouse on a link image you get a long list of item in the context menu, and the property dialog show both link property (e.g., URL) and image property (e.g., height, width, alt text). If you tab to the link image and press Shift+F10 to display context menu, you get a much shorter list of menu items, and the property dialog show only link properties, but not image properties.

Recreate:
1. Load this URL in Firefox (Bon Echo): http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_imglink
There will be a "+Next" button in the right pane of the window.
2. Move the mouse over the "+Next" button, and click the RIGHT MOUSE button.
This will display the context menu. This cause a list of about 15 item to display.
The last item in the list is "Properties"
3. Click on the "Properties" option.
Note that both Link property and Image property (including Alternative text) are displayed.
4. Press ESC to clear the property dialog.
This should leave keyboard focus on the "+Next" button. You should see a dotted line
around the button.
5. Press SHIFT+F10 to display the context menu using the keyboard.

Error 1: Note that this time, a list of only about 8 item is displayed. The
missing menu item include "view image, copy image, copy image location,
save image as..., send image, set a desktop background, and
block image from w3schools..."

6. Select Properties from the context menu. (Press "P" to select)

Error 2: Not that this time, ONLY the link property are displayed.
The image property are not displayed.

(Note: of course you can use any page with an image link to reproduce this bug... i.e., an image enclosed in an anchor tag containing a hyperlink,
e.g., <a href=xxx.html> <img src=xxx.jpg... /> </a>)
