User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Zune 2.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Aero Firefox theme

I downloaded the most popular Aero Firefox theme and restarted my browser immediately. While an object for Firefox appeared in the taskbar, no window will appear. I attempted to run Firefox in multiple mode found by right-clicking my FF3 desktop icon, going to Properties, and choosing different option found under the "Compatibility" tab. None appear to work.

Also, right-clicking the FF3 object in the taskbar doe not reveal Minimize & Maximize option like it doe for all other taskbar object that I right-click on. The only way I am able to close the taskbar the program is through the Alt+Ctrl+Delete method. According to the Task Manager though the browser doe not physically appear it still us the same amount of memory a it is when it's working.

I wish I wa able to give you the exact detail of the theme and possibly all the extension I have installed but I AM NO LONGER ABLE TO USE FIREFOX!
