See title. This behavior is new (introduced a few day ago, it seems), and I don't think it's expected.
Always happens, on browser start up, too.

If you opened a feed while it wa updating, then the article list will close before your eye once it's done reloading. To reproduce the problem, right click a feed to force the reload, then quickly open the feed before it's done reloading.

Reproducible: Always
