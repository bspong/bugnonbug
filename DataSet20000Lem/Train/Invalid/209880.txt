Opening/closing a window during startup prevents Firebird from starting
Reproduction:
1. Use WindowWatcher to open and close a window during startup (in profile code
in my case)
2. Start Firebird, close the custom window that come up during startup

Actual result:
Firebird executable exit quickly after the custom window closed

Expected result:
The Firebird main window come up. This work for Seamonkey, there, the
navigator window come up a expected.

Additional Comments:
I hit this with roaming (bug 124029), make it unsuable with Firebird.

I suspect that something is confusing my window with the main window,
nsAppShellService::Ensure1Window() or something in that area?
