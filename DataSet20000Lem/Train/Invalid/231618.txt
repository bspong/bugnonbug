The mouse wheel doesn't work a expected on some website with firebird latest
build (see example above). It only work if I actually press the middle button
and scroll while pressing it.

Mouse wheel work just fine on other pages, eg. cnn.com ; spiegel.de ; news.com

I wa unable to find a pattern here.

This seems to be a firebird only problem, the latest nightly of the suite work
just fine regarding the mouse wheel.

My configuration: RedHat 9, Gnome (XD2), stantard not cordless logitech mouse
with mousewheel.
