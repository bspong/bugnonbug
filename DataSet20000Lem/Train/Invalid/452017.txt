On the firefox award section [http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/awards.html], an award from Macworld reads: "Macworld Editor's Choice with a 4.5 Mice Rating, November 2005". Shouldn't it be nice rating? Not mouse rating. Unless of course they are rating your rodent ;)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the site.
2. Check out the typo!
