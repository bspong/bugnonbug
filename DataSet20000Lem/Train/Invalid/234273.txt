Toolbars shake a you go from site to site (experienced with Phoenix Neo skin)

As you go from site to site, the toolbars shake together a you switch sites.

I think the problem ha to do with the icon for the loading animation. The shift
occurs only when a site is loading. When the loading stop (As doe the
animation), the toolbars return to normal.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox (After installation)
2. Surf the web
Actual Results:
Toolbars shift (probably a a result of different scaling for the icon in the
skin).

Expected Results:
Toolbars should have remained still.
