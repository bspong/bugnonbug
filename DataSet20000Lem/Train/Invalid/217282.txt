As soon a I change theme in Firebird and restart the browser, I lose the
forward and back key in the navigation toolbar and my scrollbars disappear
(thankG for mousewheels).

I have repeated this error, ad naseum, with different users, from scratch, etc.

Turning off the toolbar and rebuilding it doesn't help, a those key are not
among the choices.

I have tried downloading different theme (or not, a the case may me), tried
playing with different extensions, etc. - it appears to be theme change related.
Returning to the default theme doesn't help.

On another machine I have, the key choice list for building toolbars is all
monkeyed up - one key (like the "Bookmarks" key) ha 15+ icons, most repeated
(but not the right one) under the single title. I haven't dared move the blob
into place. Don't know how related that one is.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. mozillafirebird.exe -p
2. create new user profile
3. download any of the theme available through the menus.
4. restart browser

Actual Results:
My browser becomes annoying to use, a I have to right click to move back
through my history and I can't see scroll bar (left/right and up/down).

Expected Results:
Maintained it visage.

Vanilla XP Home installation, nothing funny.
