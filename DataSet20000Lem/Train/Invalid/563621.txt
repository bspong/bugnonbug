I've read some fix online but nothing helps.
It say to copy all the font from the Fonts folder somewhere, then delete all the font from the Fonts folder and after that copy the font back. I am using Win7 and I cannot delete Times New Roman and then replace it, it say that the font is "System Protected".
This bold rendering started just a few day ago, after I've updated to the last FF build. In some cases, the default font is not bold, but in Italics or both styles.
