I'm using IE Tab 1.1.1.4 extension to render corporate content from Microsoft Sharepoint using IE6 on a Firefox browser tab. After highlighting any word on the sharepoint site, one can't delete or replace the highlighted words; one must remove highlighting before any keyboard function will work.
Using native Firefox, this function work normally, but other Sharepoint quirk prevent me from being able to use native Firefox.
Using native IE6 SP2 (version 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp.050928-1517, this function work normally, too.
Since IE Tab 1.1.1.4 merely launch IE6 for a given URL within a Firefox tab, it appears the issue is within Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install IE tab 1.1.1.4
2. set this extension to render a sharepoint URL in a Firefox tab using IE
3. navigate to sharepoint URL and login (as required)
4. type text in a search or other text box
5. highlight a word and try deleting it or overwriting it--doesn't work
