After upgrading to 2.0.0.1, Context Search work properly one time. After that, while the line still appears in the context menu, it doesn't expand when highlighted, or clicked. After restart, Context Search will work properly one time, again, and then stop working, again.

I uninstalled 2.0.0.1, reinstalled 2.0, then reupgraded and the problem recurred, just a it had the first time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Upgrade to 2.0.0.1
2.Use context search on any blocked text (does not matter which engine, or word is used)
3. Try to repeat step 2

Actual Results:
Context Search can only be used one time. After that, the search engine menu fails to appear.

Expected Results:
Seach engine menu should reappear every time.
