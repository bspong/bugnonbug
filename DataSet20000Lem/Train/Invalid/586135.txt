Web Console input field isn't resized when the user press Return

Proposed patch.

When the user press Return to submit a long line of JavaScript, the Web Console field isn't resized. This problem also occurs on other event that change the value of that field without triggering key press (undo, for example).

The attached patch fix this.

Requesting blocking status for Firefox 4 because this is a serious UI issue with the Console.
