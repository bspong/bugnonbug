When Ctrl+F4 is pressed, two tab are closed instead of one

Normally (in other browser - NS/Moz/...), Ctrl+F4 close only the active tab.
But in Firefox, when I press Ctrl + F4, two tab are being closed (the active
tab and the one immediately left to it). If there are only two tabs/one tab, the
first tab also close and is replaced with an 'Untitled' page (similar to bug
#266851).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few tab
2. Press Ctrl + F4


Actual Results:
The active tab and the one to it immediate left would close.

Expected Results:
Only close the active tab
