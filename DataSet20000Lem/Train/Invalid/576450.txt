Suggestion for a paper cut: When loading a link that is clicked, the previous page remains onscreen awhile before the screen is blanked out for the destination page. During this time, you can sometimes click link on the previous page and change the destination that is to be loaded, but not always. Some time you can click a link before it head to the next page; other time clicking on the link before it blank out to load the next page doe nothing. This small inconsistent behavior cause the user frustration not experienced in other browsers.

It should blank out the current page immediately after clicking a link or allow in all case for another link to be clicked to change the loading destination. It is inconsistent behavior that is fit for a paper cut. As it stands, clicking a link to divert the direction of loading only work some of the time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a link on page that take longer than a second to reach the next page.
2. While browser pause on current page before blanking out to the next page, click on a different link to change the direction of the loading to another destination.
3. Repeat this on multiple case to discover that sometimes it doe not change the destination.



It ha been a standing behavior of Firefox for a long time, up to and including the latest Minefield nightlies of 7/1/2010.
