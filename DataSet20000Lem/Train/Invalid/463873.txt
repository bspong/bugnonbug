I am using Vista. After updating to version 3.03 I cannot connect to ANY web page. I can use IE and Chrome to connect and view any page. I have already disabled my firewall, which is the firewall that came with Vista so I'm assuming it is the standard firewall?! I have put it on the list of accepted program and removed it and placed it back on this list, still no luck. I do not have any addons or anything like that.

Reproducible: Always
