Empty box appear numerous time on the home page (http://www.translink.bc.ca,
and a couple of others within that site). When viewed in Internet Explorer,
there is nothing there, but the Mozilla browser put box there. When I right
click on those boxes, and choose "view image," nothing loads.

It tried connecting to the site to load the images, but give a "connection
refused" error.
