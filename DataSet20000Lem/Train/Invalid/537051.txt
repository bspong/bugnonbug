Suddenly bad rendering, temporally associated with 3.5.7b5 and weave merge
I have two firefoxen running on two machines: Namoroka on my laptop, Firefox 3.5.6 (but wa trying 3.5.7beta when this occurred) on my desktop. Both Mac OS/X. I had just installed weave on both machines, and synced them. Don't know if weave is involved. Don't know if beta is involved.

At some point, I noticed that the beta browser (on desktop machine) wa rendering badly. Attached png show three grabs:
- The search bar in top right corner ha it icon/glyph mis-placed
- the tab have no close button
- the thumb ha no bottom 'rounded part'
There are also apparently issue with location inside a text box.

I tried:
restart firefox beta: No success
kill beta and revert to 3.5.6: No success
restart the whole machine: No success
download new 3.5.6 and restart machine: No success
sign out of weave and restart firefox: No success

It seems to me that the problem is likely to be something to do with the rendering engine, and maybe to do with some kind of cache that the renderer is not clearing. Maybe. I do not think that the bad rendering is the actual problem, but it is the symptom I'm seeing.

What I need (very much) is a way to fix the symptom. I also hope that this bug help lead to a fix the underlying problem whatever it may be.
