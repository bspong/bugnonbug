I want a different cookie acceptance policy: I want to accept cooky from all
site a "session" cookies, except for regular site that I trust (web-mail,
google, mozilla, etc.), which I'd like to allow long-term cooky a well.
This can be implemented by a simple white-list mechanism: any site not on the
list will have it cooky deleted when I leave it. As simple a that.
One more thing: add a "privacy" component to bugzilla.
