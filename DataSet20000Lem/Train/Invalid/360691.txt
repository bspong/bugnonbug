Problem: Lost ability to use broadcom 440 card after closing laptop.
I closed my laptop than opened it one hour later. After opening the laptop firefox asked to restore a crashed session. I clicked no than opened firefox from the quick start menu. From this point on my broadcom 440 card could not get an IP address. I called the University of Wisconsin tech support and went through the motion for two hours. I did the following thing and could not get an IP address. Ran several reset command at the do prompt according to tech support such a ipconfig reset and something to do with win socket. We checked the card on multiple LAN jack and determined it wa not a problem with the LAN. I unistalled the card, then reinstalled the drivers, this did not fix the problem. I then downloaded the newest driver and installed them: this did not fix the problem (I still had wireless internet the whole time). We booted in safe mode and it did not fix the problem. I ran a system restore to a point two week ago. This did not fix the problem. WHAT FIXED THE PROBLEM. I clicked the NoScript from blocking script to allowing script then immediately my network card got an IP address. This is not coincidence since everyone on the router ha been using the internet all day. FireFox somehow disrupted my broadcom 440 card.

I noticed that card would always be pointed to this IP address 169.254.77.61 after it stopped searching for an IP address.

Reproducible: Didn't try
