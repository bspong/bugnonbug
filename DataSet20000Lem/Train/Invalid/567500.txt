anchor with "target={any option}" cause error if "Open new window in a tab instead" is selected [caused by Norton Toolbar]

If I have the "Open new window in a tab instead" option selected, any anchor tag on my web page that have "target=xxx" cause multiple error to pop up, but the link eventually loads.

The first message is: "Permission denied for <http://www.tgif-classic.org> to call method UnnamedClass.toString on <>." No URL or line # are listed (using onerror in my Javascript to capture bug information).

The second message is: "uncaught exception: unknown (can't convert to string)"

The above error happen alternatively, usually 3 time each, and then when you've clicked OK on the last one, it finally open the new URL in a new tab, but it still doesn't switch to the new tab, even if I've got the "When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" option selected.

It doe not seem to matter which "target" ("_blank", named, etc.) is provided, or how it is provided (as an attribute in the html <A> tag, or by setting it in Javascript using either myanchor.target = "x" or myanchor.setAttribute("target", "x"). All of these fail the same way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on the "Open new window in a tab instead" and "When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately" options.
2. Go to www.tgif-classic.org
3. Click on the Host Hotel link on the left nav bar and you'll get the errors.
4. Turn off the "Open new window in a tab instead" option.
5. Click the same link on my page and it will successfully open a new window with no errors.
Actual Results:
After step 3, you get the error mentioned in the Details sections. However, if you make the change a specified in step 4, it work correctly.

Expected Results:
After step 3, the new tab should have been opened in the same browser window, with the new URL loaded in it, with no errors, and the new tab should have become the active one.

A friend reported this to me. He told me it work fine in IE8 (not sure if he tested any other browsers), but Firefox doe not work for him or for me, so I know it's not just me.
