No scrollbar binding in browser window

I recently updated from an old nightly of Firefox to the recent ones, and
discovered that my theme no longer show scrollbars in the browser window(1). I
switched back to the classic theme temporarily, and the scrollbars re-appeared.
When I opened the DOM inspector and tried to view the scrollbar element (using
find-by-click), nothing showed up, however.

As shown in the screenshot(2), scrollbars /do/ show up for non-browser window
things--this includes Sage (shown), bookmarks, and DOM inspector. Is this
somehow related to the new (to me) NativeScrollbars binding in the classic
theme? I've tried binding to it, but it seems to have no effect.

Please excuse any setting that are wrong for this bug, a it's the first one
I've filed.


(1) This includes textareas and anything else shown inside a page

(2) The scrolltray is black in that shot because I'm currently just trying to
get /anything/ to show up in the scrollbox.

Reproducible: Always
