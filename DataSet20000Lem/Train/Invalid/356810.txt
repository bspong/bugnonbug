My bank reqires me to u the Internet Explorer to log into the bank's
system, after downloading and installing some files.
My problem is Firefox "overtaking" the Internet Explorer, such that the
file I downloaded from the bank's site using the Internet Explorer had
the Firefox logo embeded on them, rather than the usual "e" logo of the
Internet Explorer. This make all installation of these file go
through Firefox, which the Bank's software doe NOT accept.
To solve this problem, I uninstalled Firefox, deleted all bank files,
and loaded & intalled them again using Internet Explorer, BUT Firefox
DID 0vertake the Internet Explorer.

PLEASE help me in this matter, and How can I delete Firefox TOTALLY from
my Windows XP, so I can access my bank account.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Delete all downloaded file AFTER unistalling them
2.Load the same file using Internet Exploere and install them
3.

Actual Results:
My problem stem from the fact that the Bank's software doe NOT accept Firefox, and requires Internet Explorer for accession.
The problem will repeat itself EVEN if when I uninstalled Firefox from my window using Add/Remove program option, and downloaded the same file and install them.
HOW can I TOTALLY remove Firefox from my computer ??

Expected Results:
Can NOT access the Bank's system, and thus cannot log in.
