hyperlink shown in addressbar unusable on small window or screen
Created attachment 475489
screenshot showing the problem

I just noticed the new behaviour of the awesomebar. It now show the
target of hyperlink instead of the usual and old location, the statusbar.
This is totally unusable on small screen or small windows.
I am attaching a screenshot of my FF4pre window when I discovered it...

Furthermore, I originally thought FF wa buggy since my statusbar wa never
updated when I hovered over links. I think the statusbar is too well implemented
in users' mind to change it like that, w/o a _major_ impact on users.

I strongly recommend reverting to the original statusbar behaviour.
