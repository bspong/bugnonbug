For quite a while now, many of the shortcut key have stopped working in the Firefox nightlies on Linux. All page navigation key have stopped working (arrows, page up/down, home/end, etc.), a have focus-switching key (tab/shift+tab) and the copy shortcut (ctrl+v for paste is ok).

Firefox doe seem to be picking up the keys, a evidenced by tab closing the auto-complete pop-up in a form entry, but not actually focusing the next widget.

Pages also can still react to these keys, so Google Reader's shortcut key (including the arrow keys) work correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Go to any page that requires scrolling and try to use the keyboard to scroll. Alternatively, go to any page that ha multiple form entry and try to tab between them.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens, or at most, auto-complete pop-up disappear.

Expected Results:
I would expect these key to work, a they have in previous version of Firefox.

I've tried disabling all extensions, to no avail.
