Scenario..

When trying to open the link of Problem 2 nothing happens and when I checked the Javascript console message it wa listed there a
Security Error: Content at http://localhost/example/test.htm# may not load or link to file://///networkdrive/share/.

When trying to open the link of Problem 3 an alert occurs and then nothing happens.
The alert message stated - Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (c) isn't associated with any program.

When trying to open the link of Problem 3 nothing happens and when I checked the Javascript console message it wa listed there a
Security Error: Content at http://localhost/example/test.htm# may not load or link to file:///c:/test.txt.


Expected results.
Problem 1 - Link will open and showing the content of the network share
Problem 2 - Link will open and showing the content of the network share
Problem 3 - Link will open and showing the content of the file
Problem 4 - Link will open and showing the content of the file

Problem doe not occur if you type the link in the address bar.
