The use of closing browser window shortcut key (ctrl+shift+w) while dnd a tab disturbs tab animation
The issue is visible on Fx branch that have tab animation landed:
-> Nightly: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0a1) Gecko/20110926 Firefox/9.0a1
-> Aurora: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0a2) Gecko/20110926 Firefox/8.0a2

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox on a clean profile
2. Have at least 2 tab visible
3. Drag one tab from the tab and while holding the left click, hit the key combination to ctrl+shift+w
4. Drag the detached tab onto the pop-up message and release the left mouse click

Expected result
In step 3 a pop-up message should appear that you want to close the tab completely
In step 4 the detached tab is draggable without holding the left click

*Notes:
-> This issue is present since the landing of the tab animation feature -> bug 455694 which mean it's a regression if not an intended behavior
-> Is this blocking bug 455694? (see comment 304 in bug 455694)?
-> Please see the screen video of the issue here. Notice that the detached tab can be moved around without holding a mouse click: https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=bc75b2c6fced798f&id=BC75B2C6FCED798F%21348#cid=BC75B2C6FCED798F&id=BC75B2C6FCED798F%21349
