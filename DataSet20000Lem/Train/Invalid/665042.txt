Panic 0.3.7 work fine in Firefox 4. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/panic/

Why is it still listed a incompatible?

I used "Add-on Compatibility Reporter" and submitted a report when Firefox 4 wa in Beta, that the above extension work in Firefox 4.

This problem is just going to get worse, due to the fast release cycle.

Yes many Add-ons break when there is new FF version, but many still work.

By default FF should allow installation of add-on that worked in previous version until it is reported a broken and no longer working.

Reproducible: Always
