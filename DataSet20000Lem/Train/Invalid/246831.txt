Firefox 0.9 for Linux installation instruction say to run "firefox-installer"
this file doe not exist.

Using SUSE Linux 9.0 Firefox extract and will run (generates lot of ugly error
messages) but it sure doesn't seamlessly install into the OS. If Linux is going
to be successful then product like this must have a braindead installer that
leaf the user with a nice easy to use icon (and inserted into menus) to run
the software.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to install on Linux
2.
3.
