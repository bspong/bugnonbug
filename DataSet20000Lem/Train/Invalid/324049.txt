XML Transform ok, but not rendered

Taking the attached test case, Firefox seems to do the transformation correctly (select page content and then in the pop-up menu select 'view selection source'), but fails to render the HTML properly. What we see is the unformatted tranform displayed.

If I save the source a seen in the 'view selection source', and then reopen it in Firefox it display fine, but with some junk characters.


Reproducible: Always
