I have some utility page that I use for various conversions. They work in firefox 2 and fail with error in firefox 3.0.1.
See:
http://www.newfdog.org/samples/js/utf-8.html

This script now fails with "invalid new expression result qqq"

The script call some basic java object along with some java script function to convert text to UTF8 output a hex.

It seem firefox 3.0.1 doe not allow embedded java in script, where firefox 2 did.

new java.lang.String(); // fails.
Packager object appears missing/inaccessible.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to url http://www.newfdog.org/samples/js/utf-8.html with firefox 2
2.enter qqq in bottom text box, press button on left.
3.top text box should display hex values,
4.repeat with firefox 3
5.Get nothing console show error.
