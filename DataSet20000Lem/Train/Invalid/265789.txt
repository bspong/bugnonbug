the special character &nbsp is displayed incorrectly if followed by a non-whitespace character

In the supplied url there is a table about halfway down the page with date and
title of sermons. Each row is numbered and indented. The indent are done
using non-breaking spaces. The final &nbsp is followed immediately by the
number and so Firefox doesn't recognize it a the non-breaking space special
character. So far I've found that only Internet Explorer will display this
correctly. I checked with Firefox, Mozilla, and Safari and all of them do it wrong.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit the page supplied.

Actual Results:
The line "&nbsp" wa displayed on the page when viewed.

Expected Results:
Recognized &nbsp a the non-breaking space special character.
