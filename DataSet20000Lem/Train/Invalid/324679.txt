Add container icon to the place title
At the top of the place view it say "Showing Bookmarks Toolbar", or whatever is the name of the container of the current view. After "Showing", there should be the icon for the container: "Showing XX Bookmarks Toolbar". This icon will make the title look nicer and more clear.

Also, you should be able to drag this little icon to move or create link to the folder, just like you can with the icon in the title bar.
