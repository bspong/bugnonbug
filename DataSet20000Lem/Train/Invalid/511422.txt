I have two computer running XP, one JUST loaded yesterday. As of today, when Firefox 3.5.2 (latest) is run - it automatically DROPS all Firefox protection from Spybot Search and Destroy, along with Disabling 230 protection in SpywareBlaster (I do my I.T. update and all on Weds. mornings). What give ?
It appears it's unsafe to run Firefox, now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.update Spybot and SpywareBlaster - and protect/immunize
2.open Firefox (later) and then close it
3.run Spybot - and notice you're NOT at all immunized any more (in Firefox)
4.run SpywareBlaster - and notice you are partially disabled in Mozilla (230 items)
Actual Results:
Full update and immunize/protect through Spybot Search and Destroy AND SpywareBlaster software.

Then, open a Firefox session (which will take a few seconds). Upon closing Firefox - recheck your Spybot and SpywareBlaster - and you'll discover your protection were REMOVED !!!

Expected Results:
It came out the same ALL THREE TIMES

It should have remain "protected" and "immunized" !!!
