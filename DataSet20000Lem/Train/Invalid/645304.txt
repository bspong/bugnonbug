When logging into Gmail, sometimes the screen go completely black for a second or two before finishing the login process.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.gmail.com
2. Login to your account (or just let it auto-log you in if you have it setup to remember you)
3. Watch the loading screen.
Actual Results:
Just before it will show you your inbox, the entire screen of FF go black for a few seconds.

Expected Results:
FF should never go completely black, not even for a second.

I've witnessed this happening at least once a day for me. Never know when it's going to happen a it's completely random.

I think it might have something to do with the GPU rendering that ha been introduced in FF4. Maybe GMail and the GPU rendering combined doesn't like ATI video card that much? (have an ATI 4850, latest driver installed)

BTW, never saw this happen in FF 3.6.xx, hence leading me to a possible problem with the GPU rendering.
