Exporting your favorite to an html file in Firefox also includes the default bookmark and links. If you import this file into a new FF installation, you will end up with the following duplicate entries:

Bookmarks Toolbar Folder
Mozilla Firefox
FireFox and Mozilla Links

It would be nice if Firefox would either replace the default entry during the import or at least give the user the option to integrate/update them while importing. Its annoying to have to go in and clean it up after importing.

They shouldn't duplicate, instead they should be updated
