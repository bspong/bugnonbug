Whenever you open some web page that us javascript and switch the tab to some other tab i.e stop viewing that page, firefox doe not stop running that javascript. I hope that it is the same with other dynamic content which are there on the web page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the firefox browser and observe the resource that firefox consumes.
2.Now open some web page using javascript(the mpre you open them the more it is visible).
3.Open a new tab in the same window and open any text based web page.
4.now observe the resource that firefox consumes.

You will observe that it consumes more resource than before even when you are not viewing the tab which contains the javscript.
Actual Results:
The resource consumption by firefox increases.

Expected Results:
It should not waste resource on thing which the user is not viewing.
