I chose to have Firefox restore my tab whenever I close it. However, rather than restoring the tabs, it default to my homepage. I just switched from Firefox 3.x and it wa working fine then.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open several tab
2.Close Firefox
3.Reopen Firefox and the tab will be gone
Actual Results:
All the old tab were gone, replaced with my homepage.

Expected Results:
The software should have reloaded my tab from last time.

This is a fresh install of Firefox 4 on top of a fresh install of Firefox 3.x (I just got this laptop today)
