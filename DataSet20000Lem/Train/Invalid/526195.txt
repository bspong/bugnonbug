After installing/deinstalling/deactivating a plugin (for example) Firefox doesn't start correctly. It just open another process of firefox.exe.

When *I* close Firefox and start it, the window opens. But not always.

IE8 is affected, too.

Only under Windows 7, not under XP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Install plugin
3. Let Firefox restart himself
Actual Results:
I have to restart the computer. I can close the processes, but FF doesn't start anyway.

Expected Results:
The browser should open.
