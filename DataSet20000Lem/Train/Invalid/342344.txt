It's not just on yahoo, it's also on any other website entered in the Anonymouse which is a proxy based website will show you the advert. It's quite annoying.

I looked through the source code, and I believe the code is coming from a script planted on www.falkag.net

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the proxy website
2. Enter any website
3. A popup will appear everytime a website is entered

Actual Results:
A popup appears

Expected Results:
Blocked the popup

More and more website seem to be getting by the popup blocker. It used to be good, but now it's starting to slide down. Please fix it. Thank you.
