Firefox only load in Windows safe mode, not even Firefox safe mode (caused by MSMpEng.exe / Windows Defender monopolizing RAM)

a live chat client reported that he could not load firefox unless he wa in window safe mode. We tried clean install, complete new install with removal of profile folder after uninstalling in window through add/remove programs. The client ran 5 malware and one antivirus scan in both window safe mode and regular boot. When trying to get into firefox.exe -safe-mode from either window safe mode or normal window reboot the client got error report that the file wa not found.

Eventually it wa determined that "(01:52) Bill: Well, blow me down. That wa the conflict, even though, a far a I wa concerned, it wa never "on" but, clearly, it must have been doing something in background. Just prior, when I wa in safe, I saw a process that wa hogging an enormous amount of memory and contributing chatter - MSMpEng.exe - crappy bit defender which, again, I didn't know wa in play. I removed it too. It wa using something like 29,000 whatevers in safe. Thks, Brett. Gold Star. I'm very grateful. Bill" It appears that Windows Defender wa the culprit.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
It seems that to reproduce this you would have to be running winXP with window defender messed up using insane amount of ram



Though the client didnt specifically state the cure, he hint in the last sentence in the live chat session that killing window defender in task manager allowed Firefox to load and start running correctly
