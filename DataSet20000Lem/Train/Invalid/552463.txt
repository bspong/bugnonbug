When playing Java-based browser game Runescape, the Windows clock on my Acer 1692WLMi laptop (Pentium M 740, i915GM) gain time at appx 8 min per hour. The CMOS battery is confirmed fully charged and keep the correct time despite the above. In other words, it's the Windows clock itself that gain whilst playing Runescape. In all other respect time-keeping is not affected with normal laptop usage including browsing other websites. The problem only manifest when playing Runescape.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Power on, go into BIOS and check time is correct.
2. Sync this time to an accurate external clock.
3. Boot machine and check Windows time match the external clock.
4. Start Firefox and go to www.runescape.com (which start Java) and log into game
5. Play for at least 15 minutes, then exit game
6. Compare external clock time to Windows time & note discrepancy
7. Resync Windows clock to uk.pool.ntp.org
8. Browse pretty much anywhere else for at least 15 minute then repeat step 6.
9. Reboot machine and check CMOS time and external clock match
Actual Results:
External clock and CMOS clock always stay in step.
Playing the Java game using Firefox for a period result in a discrepancy between CMOS clock and Windows clock (confirmed by external clock).

Expected Results:
Playing the game should not interfere with or affect the Windows clock time keeping ability

I found a Java bug candidate requiring Java Runtime Parameter "-XX:+ForceTimeHighResolution" which I tried both a runtime setting and exporting a environment variable. This had no effect on the bug but did make playing the game in Firefox considerably le responsive (almost unplayable).

I have confirmed the bug present on my current 3.6 both with add-on and clean build (without add-ons). I have confirmed the bug present on clean build Firefox version 3.0.18, 3.58 & Nightly 3.7a3pre.

This problem also manifest when using Opera 10.6 but at a reduced rate (between 1 - 2 min per hour discrepancy). Interestingly however, this problem doe NOT occur at all when using SRware Iron 4.0.280 (secure Google Chrome build).
