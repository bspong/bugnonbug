The page linked includes a search box containing initial text - this text is not centered (vertically) in the search box when I visit the page. This may be a page layout bug (in which case the Mozilla web team may want to update the page) or a bug in the text rendering/layout engine.

I cannot seem to attach a file - please email me for a screenshot if you are unable to reproduce the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit linked page.
2.
3.
