cs Layout problem: if there is a div block of certain width that is floated, another div block immediately after would float itself against the preceding floated div block without having float property according to standards. however, if the non-floated div block ha margin-left property, the margin will be calculated from the end of the floated block. this is wrong. it is supposed to calculate from the edge of page, according to IE, Opera, and Dreamweaver.
