Single-clicking location bar selects it contents, in Firefox 3 using fvwm2

I am trying to append an path to an url in the adress bar but firefox wont't
let me on Linux with windowmanager fvwm2

What I want to do is to mark some text (left mouse & drag) in e.g.
another application and paste (mouse middle click) it into the address
bar of firefox.

But the problem is that a soon I click into the address bar, firefox
will select the text that is already in the address bar and copy it into
the clipboard so the test i originally choose get lost.

It used to work with all firefoxes in the past, at least it work fine in
firefox 2.0.

To make more clear what I am talking about I created this two screencasts:

OGG http://firefox.muellers.ms/firefox-2.0.ogv working
AVI http://firefox.muellers.ms/firefox-2.0.avi working

OGG http://firefox.muellers.ms/firefox-3.0.ogv failing
AVI http://firefox.muellers.ms/firefox-3.0.avi failing

System is Debian GNU Linux, Kernel 2.6.24-1-686, windowmanager fvwm2
Browser Details: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052912
Firefox/3.0


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. enter an url into the location bar
2. mark some text e.g. a path and try to paste it into the location bar
detail.
Actual Results:
just after clicking into the location bar it will mark the url entered in step one and put it into the loaction bar

See http://firefox.muellers.ms/ for detail

Expected Results:
behave like firefox2 and allow to append the url in the location bar by the text that it stored in the clip board.

See http://firefox.muellers.ms/ for additional screen casts.
