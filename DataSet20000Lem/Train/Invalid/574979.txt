I use AeroBuddy, an addon that allows Firefox 3.x to use Aero transparency layer on the UI.
In my case, it worked absolutely fine until last update, 3.6.4.
When I attempted to load a site which used the newly added Plugin Container (e.g. a site with Adobe Flash), the UI would get screwed up a soon a the Plugin Container wa launched.
However, it only seems to affect the window which host the webpage using the plugin. All other window seem to remain OK, a far a I've tested.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install AeroBuddy, available at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/63130/
2. Restart your Firefox, then see e.g. Google's webpage. Notice all the Firefox UI ha Aero transparency, a seen on my first screenshot.
3. Now go to any site that us Flash, such a http://www.disneylatino.com or even Gmail, when you use the extended e-mail attachment option (which use Flash, BTW).
Actual Results:
All UI wa utterly screwed: scrambled text on title bar, wrong transparency on status bar, etc.

Expected Results:
Nothing. Adobe Flash should not interfere with the UI at ALL.

My addon/theme setup is a follows:
*AeroBuddy 1.05 (URL Above)
*Strata40 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14284/)
*StrataBuddy 0.6.2 (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/14762/)
