Firebird 0.6 tab are uglier than Mozilla's and provide le feedback.

1. The active tab should use a different color than inactive tabs.
2. The active tab should have a horizontal baseline, spanning the entire width
of the window. Much like real-life tab and files.
3. Tabs should have rounded corner (or one that are slightly cut-off, a in
Mozilla). This is much more visibly appealing than square-looking tabs.
