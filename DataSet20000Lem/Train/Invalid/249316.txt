incorrectly render W3C xhtml 1.0/CSS validated page

This is the second time today I've written a valid page, but it doesn't render
correctly. It seems like FF cannot consistently find the CSS. When it does, it
put the http header at the top of the page. I have the web developer
extension installed, and it say that the browser is running in quirk mode, but
it shouldn't be, and it wasn't earlier.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the page.
2. Hit refresh several times.
3. Sometimes you get CSS, sometimes you don't.

Actual Results:
Sometimes you get boxes, sometimes you just get plain text. When you do get
boxes, you get http header in plain text.

Expected Results:
Always see boxes, never headers.

Nothing special... The page load perfectly in IE 6.0 every time. I'm rating
this a a blocker because rendering the page incorrectly or unreliably is
pretty serious in my books.
