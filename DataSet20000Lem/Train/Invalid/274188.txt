If html page from http:// (e.g.
http://bbs.cvut.cz/~covex/czilla/REDDRAGON2.html) ha img src=url pointing to
file:// (e.g.
<img src="file:///home/test/temp/REDDRAGON2_soubory/rd_b01.jpg") then the image
is not displayed in FF1.0. This work in MAS1.7 however.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
FF display nothing instead of picture.

Expected Results:
Picture should be displayed.

This behaviour is not happening if page is on local disk. Means if you store
exacly same page from above url to local disk and load a
file:///home/test/temp/REDDRAGON2.html then also url with img src=file:// seems
to work ok.

This seems similar to bug #122022, but is wa said to be a dup of #84128, which
are different problems.
This problem is also mentioned in bug #227546, but this bug is also about
different thing.
