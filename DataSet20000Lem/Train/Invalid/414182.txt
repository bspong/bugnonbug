Remove the ellipsis from Help > Check for Updates...
Dean opened bug 296016 to remove the ellipsis from Help > Check for Updates... because when you select that menu item, there is nothing more to do (bug 296016 comment 0).

He also mentioned a change in the access key in bug 296016 comment 2.

I wrote a patch to fix both: attachment 296371.

Beltzner did not agree to remove the ellipsis on the ground that if an update is found, it required action from the user (bug 296016 comment 4).

I morphed the bug to only address the access key change, which wa problematic (attachment 299303), so I WONTFIXed that bug, leaving Dean's original intent aborted.

Dean justified the removal of the ellipsis in bug 296016 comment 9, which need a reply from Beltzner. I'm opening this bug to track this issue and fix it if Beltzner can be convinced.
