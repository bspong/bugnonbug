Accessing the URL attached cause my entire X session to crash/die fairly consistently (50% - 75%) of the time. This ha been tested on two different Fedora 8 installation on two separate computers. Crashing doe not occur on other platforms. This problem ha existed on at least the previous RC1, beta5. I will investigate earlier versions. Since it entirely crash my entire X session (full log out, etc), I'm not sure I can get any crash data etc. Advice on how to capture crash info would help.

On first computer (floyd) regular X session running KDE. Nvidia driver for display. On second computer (chilliwack), VNC session running X, running KDE.

Relevent /var/log/messages section attached from both system (not much there, just the seg fault) will be attached
