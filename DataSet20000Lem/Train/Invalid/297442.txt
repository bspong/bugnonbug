Firefox hang up if close the "import bookmark for IE" dialog for a new user without selecting an option
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.4

When I set up a new user on my XP box, they simply "closed" the window that
offer to import IE bookmarks, instaed of selecting "Yes" or "No". Firefox
still hang on restart after logoff (the only thing which reset the
hang....task manager doe no good) for that user only. all other user remain
unafected. Firefox Safe mode doe not help either.

I would like to know hwo to get firefox setting reset for that user!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add new user to WinXP system
2.Logon and start firefox a new user
3.Click "(window.close) X", do not select yes or no

Actual Results:
Firefox go into some kind of hang state immune to "Task Manager" end now!
Logging off work until that user try to use Firefox again at which point it
hang immediately.

Expected Results:
Just close the window gracefully...assume default no import!

Does not CRASH, but it doe HANG and use a lot of systme resource doing it!
