Brief overlay of the active tab's page content is painted over inactive tab page content
A brief overlay of the active tab's page content is painted over inactive tab previews.

STR:
1) Open up google, and two about:blank tab
2) Make google your active tab
3) Go to the taskbar and first preview the google tab
4) Move the mouse over the preview for the second tab (first blank tab). Nothing happens in the page content area.
5) Continue moving the mouse to the right to preview the the third tab (second blank tab) and witness a brief overlay of the google tab painted in the white content area of the third tab.
6) Move back to the second tab and the overlay is painted there also and so forth now between the second and third tabs. I didn't try with any more tab then that.

Just for the record, I don't notice the briefly overlay being paint in the actual preview.
