When I use the "Save Page as..." Dialog, changing the "Save a TYpe" field to
"Text Files" doesn't change the extension of the file to be saved a ".txt".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right click a web page
2.Select "Save page as..."
3.Change "Save a type" to "Text Files"

Actual Results:
The extension of the filename remains '.htm'.

Expected Results:
Changed the extension of the filename (in the field 'File Name:') to .txt
