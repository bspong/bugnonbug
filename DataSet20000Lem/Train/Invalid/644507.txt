Firefox can't remeber password to two diffrent account
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I am using two e-mail accounts:
1. Private gmail: mail.google.com
2. Company mail based on Google Apps: mail.signati.pl

The two account are complatly different without any conection between them.
However Firefox (bot 3,6 and 4.0) can only store one password and want to use the same credential for both site which is wrong.

Hope anyone can help to change this behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Please read information in "details" section.


Expected Results:
I am expecting to have different credential to both site which firefox should remember.
