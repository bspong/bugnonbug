FF3 doesn't clean up old FF2 session data
Firefox 3 no longer us the sessionstore.js format to save it data, but when you upgrade from Firefox 2 we don't get rid of the old data. That's a chunk of potentially juicy history and cookie data that we should clean up rather than leave hanging around forever. We should check for that at least once each session and delete it if found (some people might switch back and forth a few time before settling into the new version).
