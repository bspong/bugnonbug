Crystal (possibly others) Theme make the Proxy-Settings Window unuseable
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When using the Crystal Theme at least, the Proxy-Settings window becomes
decreased by it's radio-Buttons and the posibillity to enter a proxy.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get the Crystal Theme
2. Install it
3. Activate it
4. Restart FireFox to make the change active
5. Try to change a proxy
Actual Results:
It's impossible to make any Proxy-Settings

Expected Results:
It should be possible to change these Settings, shouldn't it? ;)

Maybe it's not a Bug in FireFox, but in the Theme itself?
But if that's the case, these Theme should be marked a unuseable for FF 0.8 in
it's current version.
