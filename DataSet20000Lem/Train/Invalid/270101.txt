Auto-Scroll doesn't work outside the range of a page and Scroll-with-Mouse doesn't work altogether

I use Kensington 4-botton Trackball (with their latest 6.03 driver)and with 2
single bottons set to scroll Up & Down respectively & "Accord" bottons to
activate Scroll-with-Mouse function of the driver (when you simultaneously press
2 upper or lower Left+Right bottons to acivate Autoscrool).
#1:You can't scroll the page if you are outside the range of the page, e.g. in
the heading of the page (where the BACK & FORWARD bottons are) the Scrolling
doesn't work unless you lower the cursor on the page/ or bring it up from the
Status Bar on the bottom).
#2.The Scroll-with-Mouse doesn't work altogether! It's the reason why I never
switched to Netscape 6 or 7 after VER. 4.8. All version of I.E. & all Netscape
version up to 4.8 never had this problem!!!
#3. All SOUND SCHEMES THAT WORK IN MY WINDOWS XP (or any other versions) DON'T
WORK WITH MOZILLA FIREFOX - IT'S TOTALLY MUTE AND SO THERE'S NO AUDIO
CONFIRMATION TO ANYTHING THAT IS DONE IN THE BROWSER!!!! PLEASE ADDRESS IT AND
FIX IT!!!!!!!!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. GET KENSINGTON TRACKBALL, SET RIGHT BOTTOM AND RIGHT TOP BOTTONS TO SCROLL
UP/DOWN RESPECTIVELY AND BOTTONS 1+2 (LOWER LEFT + LOWER RIGHT) TO INVOKE
"SCROLL-WITH-MOUSE". TEST & MAKE SURE IT WORKS WITH Netscape 4.* & Internet
Explorer a an example.
2. Try it in FireFox 1.0 & see that it doesn't work if you are outside the
screen's active range if you use regular Scroll Up/Down and Scroll-with-Mouse
doesn't work completely. Your setting in the browser such a Smooth Scrolling
and Autoscroll have ABSOLUTELY NO BEARING on the trackball's performance.
#4. When saving .JPG's (OR ANY OTHER IMAGE)from the internet to a designated
folder, unexpectedly this unrequested "DOWNLOADS" window appears (with "Clean-UP
Desktop" button. This window is totally useless!!!) Please add a function to
disable it - it's SUCH A NUISANCE, + I don't need a intermediary to monitor the
number of image I download!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE REMOVE OR ADD A DISABLE SWITCH!!!!!!!
#5. YOUR "COPY IMAGE" FUNCTION (when surfing and want to copy an image from the
internet site by right-clicking on it and choosing "COPY IMAGE") DOESN'T WORK!!
When performing this function and trying to paste the image to e.g. a DESKTOP,
the PASTE function is GREYED-OUT!!! Int. Explorer ha it and it work
flawlessly! I guess you forgot to implement this function. PLEASE FIX IT - it's
imperative to have it !!!!!!!
Actual Results:
NOTHING

Expected Results:
ALLOW TO FREELY AND SMOTHLY SCROLL UP & DOWN WITHOUT ANY HESITATIONS.
I've spent numerous hour with Kensington R&D team a a beta-tester to make sure
that this function (which I stumbled accross by accident) wa implemented and
now widely advertised, just to have it completely lost in your application...
PLEASE ADDRESS IT!!

Today I installed your browser and it's pretty good in it simplicity, (I wa a
beta-tester before), and the first thing noticed is the total silence...... :-(
ONCE AGAIN - ALL OF THE WINDOWS "SOUND SCHEME" sound ARE COMPLETELY DISABLED IN
YOUR BROWSER! :-(( :-((
Well, not everyone is either deaf or is NOT interested in audio sound
confirmation to any activity that they might be performing while browsing the
internet!
PLEASE MAKE YOUR BROWSER 100% COMPATIBLE WITH Internet Explorer's sound scheme
- it's one of the reason why I still enjoy using I.E. & even older Netscape 4.8
Communicator.
Want to have a REAL WINNER on your hand instead of a MUTED wannabe? DO IT !!!
