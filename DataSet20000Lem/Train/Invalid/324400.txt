Hi,

when using firefox (and thunderbird) for some time, there are plenty of individual settings, such a fonts, stored password, bookmark etc.

When migrating to a new computer (or keeping a notebook up to date to the account at home) it is quite difficult to keep the setting in sync. Some setting are easy to clone (e.g. those in prefs.js), others are more difficult (e.g. the bookmarks, since LAST_VISIT and ID keep continuously changing), and some are extremely difficult to migrate, e.g. passwords.

What exactly is the fileformat of the password file and it's encryption? Why can't firefox read a file copied from another computer, even if the master password is the same? Why is it sometimes called 12345678.s (with changing number - what's the meaning of the number?) and sometimes signon.txt?

Firefox should allow to keep several account in sync, and not just by mouse-click-configuration. It is highly annoying if you need to reconfigure every firefox instance from scratch and to reenter every single password. That way it is too microsoft-ish.
