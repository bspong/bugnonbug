I have the AdBlock and Nuke Images extension installed. In recent build (not
sure exactly when it happened), I've noticed that their entry are not always
showing up in the context menu when I right-click on images. I'm pretty sure
they're installed correctly a AdBlock still remove ads. I have the 2003-3-20
build installed in a different folder and the context item for the extension
show up just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Nuke Image or AdBlock extension
2. Go to a webpage with graphic
3. Right click on a graphic

Actual Results:
I don't see the context menu entry "Remove this image" or "AdBlock".

Expected Results:
Show the context menu entry that the extension enable.
