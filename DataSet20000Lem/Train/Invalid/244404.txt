In the Cookie Manager, if the "Don't allow site that set removed cooky to set
future cookies" checkbox is checked and unchecked while cooky are being
removed, site are not correctly blocked according to the current setting.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Cookie Manager (Tools->Options->Privacy->Cookies->Stored Cookies),
with several cooky stored. Called these Cookies A, B, C, from Sites A, B, C
respectively. Make sure "Don't allow site that set removed cooky to set
future cookies" (henceforth "Siteblocking checkbox") is not checked. Make sure
Sites A, B, C are not permanently blocked in Exceptions dialog
(Tools->Options->Privacy->Cookies->Exceptions).
2. Select Cookie A, and click "Remove Cookie". The siteblocking checkbox is
clear, so we do not want Site A blocked.
3. Click the Siteblocking checkbox to active it.
4. Select Cookie B, and click "Remove Cookie". The siteblocking checkbox is
active, so we want Site B blocked.
5. Click the Siteblocking checkbox to clear it.
6. Select Cookie C, and click "Remove Cookie". We do not want Site C blocked.
7. Click "OK", and, remembering Bug 237795 (Cookie Exceptions don't update right
away), click "OK" to close the Options Menu. Reopen the Options menu, and check
the Cookie Exceptions to see whether Sites A, B, or C are blocked.


Actual Results:
Neither Site A, B, nor C wa blocked.

Expected Results:
Site B should have been blocked. I think the software is not looking at the
Siteblocking checkbox until after the preference window is closed.

This problem can have the opposite effect a well; it can block cooky from a
site which wasn't supposed to be blocked. For example, clear the Siteblocking
checkbox, remove Cookie A, set the Siteblocking checkbox, and remove Cookie B.
Then click OK. This will block site B (correctly), and site A (erroneously).
