If you enable private browsing, then many website that rely upon cooky fail to work. For example, Yahoo Mail will not allow you to log into it site, because it can not set a cookie, and it can not receive a cookie from your hard drive. Compare this behavior to private browsing in Safari, where all site work, but no data about which site you visited is recorded, and no cooky are stored. No site that I regularly use that require a login were fully functional in private browsing mode.

Perhaps Private Browsing could be split into two modes, or have two different level of functionality. One would not record any data on your machine, The other would not send any data such a cooky to remote websites. I question the value of the second set of functionality though, because website already know which machine are visiting them with reasonably high certainty based on their IP address. (Yes, an IP isn't a unique identifier, can change, and can be forged, but breaking the site isn't really useful a a user.)

Another solution would be to copy all cooky and other data into memory, then alter only the in-memory copy when private browsing is enabled. When it is disabled, the browser can erase the in memory copies, and use the normal on disk copies.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable private browsing
2. Go to a site where you have a login, such a mail.yahoo.com or slashdot.org
3. Can't log in, and no functionality available only to logged in user is available
4. Disable private browsing
5. Can log in (or already logged in), but browsing data is saved to the local machine.
Actual Results:
Many website break. Badly.

Expected Results:
Websites should work but data should not be altered on disk.
