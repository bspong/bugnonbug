Feature request: Turn off net-nanny

Steps to reproduce:

Not playing net-nanny is way to show respect to developers.

FF ha grown into such a net-nanny. Changing config? I have to "promise I will be careful" [sic]. Checking out a forgery site? No. Only if Google allows it. Looking at a web page with old cert? I have to click on a dozillion of disclaimer that I "know what I am doing". Wanting to give my script more permission? NO. Can't do it. Need to consider all kind of workarounds, extensions, greasemonkey add-ons.

FEATURE REQUEST: I want a "turn off net-nanny" mode with the semantics of "do exactly what you were ordered to, without whining, complaining, requiring promise of being careful, telling Google, throwing exception and refusing order for the mere reason that someone thought it wa not a good idea". It isn't exactly helpful to only think of John Doe user and piss off developer making them develop workarounds, extension and stuff, just because Mozilla thought they should not be doing what they want to do.
