After installing Firefox 1.5 for Mac the toolbar bookmark ceased to function properly. where before when clicking on teh toolbar bookmark the bookmarked site would open, now nothing happens if I just click on teh toolbar bookmark. If I command click on the toolbar book mark it works, and if I drag teh toolbar bookmark inot an open tab or window it works, but not otherwise.

Also, I jsut checked, and selecting bookmark from teh bookmark menu also is not working properly (i.e., long pause, then nothing opens.

The link on your website for hte daily build wa not active for Mac OS so I wa unable to check the daily.

I am running OS 10.4.4

Reproducible: Always
