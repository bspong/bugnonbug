Browser doesn't start and CPU is used 100%
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008121300 SUSE/3.0.5-0.1 Firefox/3.0.5 Ubiquity/0.1.4

I shut down my computer (just after the browser poped up the "erase browsing" dialog)(I often do that and get a restore session dialog on opening). What wa unique is just after the shut down dialog I clicked on "erase browsing" and it seems that the computer shut down before completing this task.

When I tried to fire up the browser, it show the "erase browsing" window. Clicking on whatever button ("Cancel" or "Do erase") made the window disappear and the CPU usage grow. When killing the process, CPU stayed high for a few second and then returned to a normal value.

It now works. I had Firefox started in "safe mode" (all option in), closed, and opened in normal mode. It work fine.
