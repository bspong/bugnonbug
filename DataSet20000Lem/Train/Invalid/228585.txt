This bug depends on Bug 228582 being implemented first. Bug 228582 deal with
the ability to remember if the user last had the tree view expanded or not.

In this bug report, I suggest that we go a step folder and remember the last
selected folder in the tree view (if the user is using the tree view) and have
it highlighted and expanded next time the user return to the bookmark dialog.
