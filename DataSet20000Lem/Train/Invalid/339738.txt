On my wife's Windows XP Laptop Firefox wa giving error message that something serious ha happened and Firefox must close; then shutting down. I uninstalled and reinstalled newest version 2 day ago. Since then, it keep putting up a window about Google Toolbar and asking for me to OK it tracking and choosing enabling or disabling - tracking, I think. It come up every few minutes, even tho' I unchecked tracking and checked "disable." I finally had to uninstall it again and I'm trying Opera. I much prefer Foxfire, but it won't stop blocking my wife's system. Apparently, it only accepts it preferred answer and keep asking until it get it?? Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Startup Foxfire. Period.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Window appears thanking me for selecting Google Toolbar from Foxfire and asks me to select Foxfire a default browser (which I do) and I think the second check box asks to allow tracking, which, for privacy reasons, I uncheck. Then, at the bottom of the box it ha a selection of disable or enable keeping track of where I go. (Since I had to uninstall foxfire, I'm answering from memory.) It's apparently the standard window you get when you install Foxfire now. I then click on finish and the window closes, only to return in a minute or two and start the process all over again. And you can't just X-out the whole window.

Expected Results:
The software should graciously accept my declination of it offer to keep track of everything I do.
