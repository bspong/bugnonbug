When typing in the location bar field, a drop down appears a normal with previous site that match the text entered so far.

If a site is selected from this list by using the down arrow key and pressing enter when the desired site is highlighted. Firefox browse to the page a expected but the drop down list still shows.

If instead of using the down arrow and enter keys, the mouse pointer is sued to select the desired page then the page is displayed and the drop down list disappears.

Seems to be an issue with keyboard use.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter text in location bar - a list of previous site should appear in drop down
2. Press down arrow key to highlight desired page
3. Press enter key, page is displayed yet drop down still displayed

Actual Results:
Drop down list of previous site still displayed over web page

Expected Results:
Drop down list should disappear when enter key pressed a it doe when mouse is used to select page.

This did not appear after a version upgrade, so I'm guessing it may be a plugin/addon issue.
