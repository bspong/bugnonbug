Firefox 6 say it incompatible with the latest Java apps and disables them so I have to stay on version 5.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1 WBSMTWB020
Build ID: 20110707182747

Steps to reproduce:

I let Firefox automatically upgrade to version 6 and the window popped up saying my latest Java add-on were incompatible and it disabled them.


Actual results:

As you might guess, many very important website would not work properly without the Java apps functioning. I had to go back and re-install Firefox 5. Then all the Java worked again.


Expected results:

Little incremental change in Firefox, which is what version 6 is - not a whole new version, should never disable something a important a Java. These problem should be worked out before the release.
