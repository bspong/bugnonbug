Visiting the attached page with Firefox 4 beta 12 under Linux result in a 'feedback' link appearing on the right-hand side of the screen, over the top of the browser's scrollbar. The scrollbar can still be used, and it will scroll behind the HTML element.

At first I thought it wa a Mozilla thing asking for browser feedback because of this, but when I clicked on it it belonged to the web page!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://nullege.com/codes/search/wx.StaticText.SetBackgroundColour
2. Wait for a few second
3. Look for red 'feedback' image vertically centred on the right of the screen
Actual Results:
Red feedback image appears on top of browser scrollbar

Expected Results:
Red feedback image would be constrained within the page content area

Running under Linux with default theme
