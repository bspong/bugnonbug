window.close in a crosswindow script (to a window.open-ed window) generates a security related error. This can easily be overridden a the attachment shows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. first reload into about:blank (there is at least one way to do this)
2. I dont know why it works, but it seems that you need to seperate the closing action (by a timer that may even be set to 0)
3. now close the window
Actual Results:
window close

Expected Results:
no closing + error
