In a sample web site, we have defined 2 pages. The page contain a drop-down menu that work with Javascript. The drop-down is used to make the user navigate from 1 page to another. Now, when the browser's back button is clicked, the content in the previous page get loaded. However, the drop-down doe not get affected a the Javascript doe not get triggered once the browser's back button is clicked. So, to make the page work, we click on Refresh button and drop-down menu display correct data. We would like to show you a sample by sending an attachment. Currently this option is not available.
