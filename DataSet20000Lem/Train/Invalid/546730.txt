File browser pop up when entering url for upload

The file upload page on an ISP that I use offer the choice of manually entering the pathname of the file to upload or using a file browser. I generally prefer the former. Firefox, however, pop up it own browser when I begin to type in the pathname entry box. In addition to improperly over-riding my choice to enter the pathname by hand, the browser is not even smart enough to use the beginning of the pathname that I have typed and instead screw thing up by inserting it own default location. This problem did not occur in Firefox 2. The upload page is generated by cpanel "legacy file manager".

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
Firefox should only pop-up a file browser when asked to. It should let the user enter text in a form in peace, even if it think that that text is a pathname.
