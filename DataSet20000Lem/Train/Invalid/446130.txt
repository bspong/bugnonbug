While having any session open in Firefox, then connecting to a standard VPN that push it's gateway down on your connection cause Firefox to not be able to connect to anything until restarted. Understandable, but should have a "smart re-connect" or something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox a per normal
2. Use Windows (re-produced in Vista on my end) to connect to a vpn
3. Attempt to continue using Firefox
Actual Results:
No connectivity.

Expected Results:
Firefox to "figure out" that it can still connect to the internet, just not using the current connection session it is using, then repair.
