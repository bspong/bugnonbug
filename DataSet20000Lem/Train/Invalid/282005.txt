build mozilla product for X11 on Mac?
User-Agent: Lynx/2.8.4rel.1 libwww-FM/2.14 SSL-MM/1.4.1 OpenSSL/0.9.7d
Build Identifier: fink.sourceforge.net

Actually, this is a documentation bug in all the aps. How
am I supposed to build a version of the aps that run under X11
on Mac OS X? It isn't clear to me. Emacs, by contrast, ha
easy configuration option --with-x and --without-carbon. I can't find
such option for Mozilla applications. I know it is possible to configure
mozilla application this way, because Fink doe it. But how??
