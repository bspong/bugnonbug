When closing a browser window containing a site that requires HTTP auth
credentials, those credential are cached a long a there are any other browser
window open. HTTP auth credential should be expired when the last window with
active page on the domain is closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple FireFox windows/tabs.
2. In one of these windows/tabs, log into a Web site requiring HTTP basic auth.
3. Close the window/tab containing the site requiring HTTP auth.
4. Return to the site requiring HTTP auth in any existing or new window/tab.

Actual Results:
Authentication credential are cached, and the user is automatically logged
into the site.

Expected Results:
Authentication credential should be expired, requiring the user to reenter
them. Alternately, a user could choose to save the credentials, but this should
require an explicit confirmation. Default behavior should be to expire the
credential when the last window is closed.
