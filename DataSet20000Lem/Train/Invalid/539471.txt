We have a stable config using /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-sun/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so* (linked to /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins) and Firefox 3.5.*. Java plugin load and is shown in about:plugins, and java test work.

Replacing Firefox with 3.6RC1 the java plugin simply doe not load. It fails to appear in about:plugins, and java page complain about missing plugin.

I suspect this bug is related to earlier bug reported about java plugin simply crashing Firefox, so someone may have turned off loading this plugin to get the 3.6RC1 released.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start with working config using 3.5.7 and properly installed sun java plugin.
1.5 check about:plugins, Java plugin show up.
2.upgrade firefox to 3.6
3.check about:plugins. No java plugin.
