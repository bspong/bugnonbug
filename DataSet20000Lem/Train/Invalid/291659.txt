Firefox 1.0.3 w/ Latest User-agent switcher is unusable
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 1.0.3 Auto-update with the latest User-agent switcher update (firefox start but unusable)

This happened on both my computers, one running WinXP SP2, the other Debian
Linux (ver. 1:3.3.5-2) Gnome (ver. 2.2).

After automatic update of firefox to version 1.0.3 and the latest user-agent
switcher (don't remember the version) the browser became totally unusable. See
the screen shot at:
http://www.spicesoft.com/img/bug_win_xp_sp2.JPG

On the screen shot I demonstrate the behaviour when I try to drop down the
location list. The menu (File, Edit, View, Go, etc) is not responding. I
can't type the location. Automatic update is working, saying that no new
update are available which is natural since I have just updated everything.
Search-engine list show up at the same place (top-left corner).

Similar bug could be 216288 or 267798 but in my case firefox doe NOT crash
or exit, it just behaves like an idiot. Rebooting did not help. My guess: the
agent-switcher is to blame.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Do the complete update to 1.0.3 together with agent-switcher (WinXP SP2,
Debian)
2. Start (or restart) firefox

Actual Results:
Firefox became unusable in the sense explained above

Expected Results:
Act like a web-browser

Sorry, can't do anything with my firefox right now.
