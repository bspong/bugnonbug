This problem may be caused not by Firefox itself but by the 3rd party driver, but nevertheless...

On my machine I installed Ramdisk (http://www.dataram.com/products-and-services/ramdisk ) - hard drive emulated by RAM. Compared to the one that come with Windows, this one can be made persistent, i.e. the driver save the content of the drive in the background to the file on physical disk.

This drive ha been working OK for month while I wa keeping on it temp files. Then I moved to it Firefox profile. As soon a I did that, Firefox started hanging in the middle of work. I open Firefox, and in several minute it will hang, even when I let it sit on one webpage and not browsing anything. When It hangs, it effectively kill the whole system - process can't be neither closed, nor killed, system shutdown doe not work.

The developer of this driver state that it wa built according to WDM specifications, and this emulated drive work OK for seemingly all other purposes. Perhaps Firefox is doing with the profile file something out of spec that is not expected by the drive.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install dataram (http://www.dataram.com/products-and-services/ramdisk )
2. move Firefox profile to the new drive emulated by dataram
3. open Firefox on any webpage
4. wait several minute until Firefox becomes inaccessible, and kill the whole system
Actual Results:
system becomes inaccessible
