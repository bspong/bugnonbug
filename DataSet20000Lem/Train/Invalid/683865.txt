When I go to www.weather.com, and click on my saved location (this is the link: http://www.weather.com/weather/today/EIXX0017:1:EI), Firefox start to behave a if there wa no internet connection on all tabs. Even page served by local IIS ( localhost addresses) do not work, also no other tab work in the same process. If I restart the process it is happy day until I go to weather.com again.
