Control+Click on URL should conform to Mac standard and open a new window rather
than a new tab.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Control+click currently brings up new tab.

Expected Results:
Control+click should bring up a new window by default.

Perhaps option in preference to allow control+click to open either new window
or tab?
