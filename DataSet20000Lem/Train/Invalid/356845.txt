certain url popups up the add bookmark prompt automatically

I'm using Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061016 BonEcho/2.0

going to http://www.jroller.com/rss/malformed?catname=/JUICe cause the add bookmark dialog to show up.

see also bug #356744

in case it matters, I found this url from http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Flash+Player+Enabler.plugin&qt_s=Search&sa=N&tab=gw

I'm not sure what's going on yet, but given bz's initial comment in bug #355475, I'm going to mark this security sensitive
