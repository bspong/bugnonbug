Firefox 0.9 won't allow more than 46 BCC address in MSN Hotmail

When attempting to send a message to a larger number of recipient at the same
time from my Hotmail account I usually send a message to 65 recipient at once
using BCC. With Firefox .9 (as with Firefox .8) My list of BCC address get
cut of in the middle of one of the address (somewhere in the 47th address
usually) making it unable to send the message. I must go into the BCC list of
address and delete the trailing fragment of the last address. Then the message
go but I must then reconstruct the message in order to send it to the
remaining recipient that weren't allowed the first time. It could be a
character string length restriction on the number of address that can be
included in a BCC list of addresses. I don't know. All I do know is that this
isn't a problem with IE. This is the main reason that I have not made Firefox my
default browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Construct a new email message with attachment or not.
2.Check the 65 (more than 47) recipient in my favorite contact list to which I
wish to send the message.
3.Click Send.
4.The message doesn't go because of an error in the BCC address list.

Actual Results:
I must open the list of all the BCC address I created and delete the fragment
of the last address, the piece that caused the error. I can then send the
message to the limited number of recipient whose address could be completely
entered.

Expected Results:
I should have been able to send the message to all 70 recipient at one time by
creating only one complete list of BCC address that would contain all 70
address rather than having to send it to the first 46 recipient and then
having to reconstruct the message and send it to the remaining disallowed 24.
