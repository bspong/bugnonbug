FURIOS over loss of cookie option!
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

THIS MUST BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY:
Until the current build, one could allow cooky - but ask before ACCEPTING
each one. This is no longer the case - I discovered, after I began wondering why
Firefox had suddenly stopped asking about known cookie-rich site - after I had
exposed myself to a myriad of loss-of-personal-data. I need cookies, sometimes,
when I read the NYT, etc. I don't want them when I go to report a spoof letter
(via web-e-mail) through a company I later discover ha major automatic
connection with Doubleclick.
I expect this to be corrected within 48 hourrs, meanwhile, I'm going
back to .91 for some security.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run the program, attempt to set up v.91-style cookie security
2.
3.

Actual Results:
I wa raped <metaphorically>

Expected Results:
When I upgraded and had my setting "transferred", Firefox Current should have
continued to allow me to allow all cookies, asking each time before placing them
on my machine. This is an obscenity, a complete reversal of all that is Mozilla.
Additionally, FIREFOX current ha an optionb to "read new mail" under tool -
now how doe a stripped-down browser get mail?

I know you guy work hard, but remember your mission. It's bad enough we've got
a thug in the WH and a "patriot"<spit> act, but the browser we trusted the most
is now giving Big Commerce our data too!
