I dunno what you hippy use all that google money for, but im sure it involes sticking your cock in each other's asses. you guy have a long way to go to beat internet explorer.

fix the damn keyboard problems, why doe the caret not show in edit boxes? why doe apostrophe bring up the search box? how come copy and paste doesn't always work?

these are the basic of the browser. some ppl actually use browser for real work not just browsing gay porn.
