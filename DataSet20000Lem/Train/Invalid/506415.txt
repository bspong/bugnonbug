I started noticing this when I began to use Firefox 3.5pre. Certain site (such a http://boxee.tv and https://wa.macomb.edu/WebAdvisor/WebAdvisor) do not prompt to remember the password. The drop down bar never appears for the site and it doesn't automatically remember it.

Problem wa duplicated in a fresh profile (with no changed setting or extension installed. Other site worked fine) and across multiple platform (Tested on Vista, 7, XP, Leopard, and the latest Ubuntu release). Problem CANNOT be duplicated in Safari 4 or the Opera 10 beta 2 (remember password prompt are produced and password are remembered).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site such a http://boxee.tv
2. Enter Login information and hit login
3. No prompt to remember password
4. Logs in perfectly
5. Does not remember password
Actual Results:
No remember password prompt is shown and password is not remembered

Expected Results:
Prompt should have shown and password should be remembered

As said, tested across multiple operating system on multiple computers. Theme currently being used is GrApple Tangy but it doe not seem to matter what theme is being used.
