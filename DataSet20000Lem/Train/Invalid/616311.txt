the bottom curve connecting the tab to the main toolbars are asymmetrical, with the left side not overlapping the curve for the left inactive tab, unlike the right side

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have many tab open with a middle one selected

Actual Results:
left and right connecting curve differ

Expected Results:
should be the same, both like the right curve

most visible on win xp, the transparent areo border hide the problem.

both curve should be a little bigger, like the mac theme and mockups(another bug)
