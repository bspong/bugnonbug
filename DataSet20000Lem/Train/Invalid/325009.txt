This message board ha a space at the bottom of each post which should show button such a "PM Me" and "Profile," and a space at the bottom of each page for "Reply" and "New Post" buttons. About a month ago, all these button disappeared, making it impossible to participate on the board. The button do show when I access the site via (excuse the expression) IE. The Webmaster is mystified; a far a he knows, his site is fully compatible with Firefox. I will hand-knit merino wool watchcap for anybody who accepts and successfully fulfills this challenge. Thanks, BB
