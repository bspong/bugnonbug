At the end of 1/10/2004 I left my computer on. Coming back the next morning
the homepage wa reset to Google and all boomarks were gone. The browser
appeared a it did when first installed without any of my set preferences. No
update or change were made to the browser. Even the default theme wa in use
instead of Safer Fox
Possible security problem? My system is protected by a router firewall a well
a F-Secure firewall and the latest update to F-Secure anti-virus.

Reproducible: Didn't try
