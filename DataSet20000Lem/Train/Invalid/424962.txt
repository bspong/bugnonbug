Leopard 10.5.2, FF 2.0.0.12

Searching bugzilla for "unicode", "decomposed", "utf", "umlaut" did not produce information about this, so I am creating a new bug.

I am checking in subversion commits using svnX with log message containing Estonian umlauts. svnX us command line svn binary in the background. I am viewing subversion information through everyone's favorite project environment trac, the problem show up in Timeline and other page where the log message are displayed.

svn client us decomposed unicode characters, I recompiled my svn binary according to this:

There is additional information about Mac Firefox having problem with decomposed Unicode character already from 2006:

Safari 3 show everything in question correctly. Curiously, Firefox 3 Beta 4 also show everything in question correctly. Therefore it seems something in the Firefox font rendering engine ha been altered to handle this. But since my whole browsing ecosystem only run on FF2 for now, it'd be nice to get some information if it's possible to fix this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
View attached HTML page.
Actual Results:
Umlauts are displayed with an empty box instead of the accent.

Expected Results:
Normal umlaut display.
