margin just get colored when border
I found out the following:
If you have a <DIV class="outer">
which ha assigned a background-color, and in it another DIV
<DIV class="inner"> which hasn't got a background-color but a margin,
then the margin's of this inner DIV just get colored when the outer
DIV ha borders.
In the example on the URL "http://www.libelle.at/kraftb/moz_bug.html" you
can see it.
If you look at the source you see the "border-top" of the outer DIV is commented
out. If you comment it in the margin of the inner DIVs will also get colored
blue.
