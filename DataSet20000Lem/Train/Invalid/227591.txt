In following search page which combined with "check mark" at:
http://www.sanseido.net/sup/ash/AsahiFind.asp, Firebird browsing could not
correctly trace out "check mark" key value, thus further search work could not
proceed. Mozilla 1.3 work properly to trace out "check mark" assigned and
complete search work well.

1.put any keyword, like "return"
2.mark either or all checking mark on check> column under
3.execute "¸¡º÷(search)"

Actual Results:
Error message pop out to indicate "no check mark found failure", and couldn't
execute search function properly.

Expected Results:
Firebird need to proof the bug and work properly like mozilla, tracing the
fill-in check mark value correctly and complete Web search function work a is.
