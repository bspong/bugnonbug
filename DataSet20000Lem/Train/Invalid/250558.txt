I have my memory cache set to 512 k, and sometimes up to 4096 k for working. My
current memory cache usage is 21 MB, according to about:cache, and accordingly
the total program memory usage is about 50 MB. I know the two are related, a
when one grows the other does. It is a bug to treat the limit a a suggestion only.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set memory cache size to 512.
2. Browse a few minutes.
3. Check about:cache.

Actual Results:
Memory cache device

Number of entries: 146
Maximum storage size: 512 k
Storage in use: 21188 k
Inactive Storage: 0 k

Expected Results:
Memory cache device

Number of entries: 6
Maximum storage size: 512 k
Storage in use: 488 k
Inactive Storage: 0 k

Firefox 0.8, may not remain in .9 but since I can't run it I can't check. Didn't
find any mention in Bugzilla.
