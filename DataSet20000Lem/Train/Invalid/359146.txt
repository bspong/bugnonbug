Authorization window open when I type something into search toolbar (Google checked)

I have a connection through proxy with authorization.
When I open a browser for searching info in Internet and type something into search toolbar, authorization window open and I type last part of word into name field.
I want to see a preference to turn off search term suggestions. I know what I want to find and I can't need this feature.

Sorry for my English.

Reproducible: Always
