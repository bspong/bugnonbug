I have found that a lot of website are telling me to upgrade to a newer version of firefox. I have. 4 times. I can't remember all the website (there have been a lot) but my email (MSN/Hotmail from Qwest) doe EVERY time. However, I can click on "go to inbox anyway" and I can still see my email. But next time I log on, it will tell me to upgrade again.
Also, I have found a lot of website that crash firefox. When you restore the session, some will then allow you to navigate, whereas other will not. Particularly, the Comcast WebChat... it crash every time.
This is kind of obnoxious. I want the previous version of firefox back... I never had any problem with it!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

chatting with a Comcast rep.
