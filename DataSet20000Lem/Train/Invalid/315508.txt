title, history, and uri not updating correctly

Whenever I open a new tab and load a new page in it, the title, history, and uri update correctly. However, when I go back to my first tab, those component did not change back to the first-tab page (neither doe the title on the menu bar on the bottom)
In order to update the info, I have to click Refresh and I'd have my back button and everything else back. (And if I need the 2nd-tab, I have to do the same thing)

I don't know why, but I'm guessing the problem lie with a theme or extension. I used to not have this problem. I think it's either clipmarks or greasemonkey

Reproducible: Always
