Address Not Found: Firefox can't find the server at w.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008111317 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.4

Starting from yesterday, Firefox v3.0.4 often complains that it cannot find server at w (the first character of the domain name). It occurs with both the official 3.0.4 Windows binary and the Ubuntu 3.0.4 package. Clicking the "Try again" button on the error page cannot fix the problem, but the Reload button on the toolbar can.

Sometimes the domain name is truncated at different position, e.g. forums.m for forums.mozillazine.org.

I am not sure if it's a network problem here in China or a bug in 3.0.4. Please advise.
