embedded Google Map fails to display correctly

Map created in Google Maps and embedded in another web page by copy-paste of the code snippet provided by Google Maps display with image-placeholders for the control and either some or no map tile rendered (or shown a tile with too-high zoom). The same embedded map on the same web page display correctly in Camino/Opera/Safari on Mac, IE6 on Win XP and IE7 on Vista.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open maps.google.com on any location
2. click the "Link" URL, from the popup panel, copy the code below the "Paste HTML to embed in a website"
3. paste copied code into a web page
4. open page in Firefox 3
Actual Results:
The embedded Google Map didn't display in Firefox: gray background with tile marked "We are sorry but we don't have map at this zoom level for this region. Try zooming out for a broader look.", some map control render correctly, others show a image-placeholders. The same page display correctly in Safari, Camino, Opera, etc.

Expected Results:
Properly rendered Google Map

Unlikely it's a Firefox add-on, a the same problem wa reported to me by an associate who run plain-vanilla Firefox (also on Mac OS X).
