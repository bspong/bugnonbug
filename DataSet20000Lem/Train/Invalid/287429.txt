In this installation, every time I have several window open, if I close the
first window, the others cease to respond, they still show the webpage they had
loaded, but clicking on link ha no effect, favicons dissapear (that's
generally how I realized i commited the mistake of closing the first one) and
image and icon on menu and context menu also dissappear.
I've tried reinstalling it several times, and every time the same happens

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox on WXP
2.do a ctrl+n to open a new window (or shift-click on some link)
3.close first window
4. try and click on one of the link still open in the remaining window

Actual Results:
Windows left open cease to respond, have to close them all and reopen firefox
for it to go away.
It will not even let me bookmark anything

Expected Results:
all window should've kept working normally.

I'm willing to send you any information about my installation, a copy of the
registry, or whatever.
