Work around tooltip covering bookmark bar while dragging proxy icon
Now that bug 312852 ha reappeared on the trunk, we really ought to work around it, if it doesn't get an actual fix for 1.9. Two possibility that occur to me off the top of my head: the final solution of just making the tooltiptext attribute #ifndef XP_MACOSX, and the slightly icky solution of using a <tooltip position="end_before"> instead of tooltiptext, so that the tooltip would appear to the right, over the URL, rather than below-and-right, over the bookmark toolbar.
