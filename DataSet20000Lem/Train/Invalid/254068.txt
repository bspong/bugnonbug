Fails to display CSS formatting from external stylesheet in a .cfm file

When viewing any ColdFusion (.cfm) page that us an external CSS stylesheet
(through either the @import directive or <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"
href="stylesheet.css" />), Firefox fails to display any of the CSS formatting.
"Page Info" will show the correct URI of the stylesheet, and Netscape 4.8 and IE
6 both display the CSS style properly (within the limitation of Netscape 4.x,
of course). The server is Windows NT 3.51 running ColdFusion Pro 2.0 (not 100%
sure of the ColdFusion version), but since other browser have no problem I
don't think this is a server issue. I have been unable to find other .cfm page
on other server to try and reproduce the problem elsewhere. Embedded and
inline style work just fine on the exact same pages.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a ColdFusion (.cfm) Web page that us an external CSS style sheet
Actual Results:
The browser displayed the page a if it had no CSS style at all.

Expected Results:
The browser should have incorporated the CSS style a described in W3C's CSS
specifications.

The URI of the page included in this report is a sample of the site I am helping
develop, and illustrates the problem; IE 6 and Netscape 4.8 will render it
correctly, Firefox 0.9.2 will not.
