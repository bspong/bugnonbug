I have lost bookmark before and now know how to retrieve them. But this time - you really out (Fire)foxed me. I did about 3 hour of online research and had about 30 bookmark for that work. You updated my browser - even though I have set the option for you to ask first. When I came back on line a bit later - not only did you update without asking me - you lost that work that I had done - because you saved my bookmark before I had done this work.

So you have really cost me this time and I am not happy about it. Either your software ignores the setting of my option regarding your asking first - or they do not work at all.

What to do - You have cost me dearly this time. I am working on a paper and all of my research is up in smoke. I am really angry.

That is my two cent worth.
