This is related to popup window blocking (a feature I love!). Can this message
"Firefox prevented this site from opening a popup window. Click here for
options..." moved to a small icon some place (I believe like how "Google
Toolbar" doe it)?

I keep thinking it is part of the web page -- a bit confusing and also cause
the web page to kind of refresh or reload.

Anyway, just slightly annoying :-)
