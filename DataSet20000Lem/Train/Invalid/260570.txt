system-wide install ruined the migration process

On the bidding of the 1-million downloads ;) I grabbed the installer and, a I
usual do, ran it a root using sudo. all go well until we get to the debug
reporter and "migrate old settings"

debug get permanently broken, repeating the process under a user account
doesn't fix it, and the migrated component aren't -- bookmark and password
are migrated for the base user (the user who ran the sudo, not for root) but
other component and plugins had to be migrated by hand.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. run installer under sudo
2. choose /opt/firefox-1.0 a the base directory
3. select to migrate old components.



Expected Results:
the installer should detect being run by root and default or offer to make a
system-wide installation.

the installer should check for common location of mozilla plugins
(/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins) and either symlink those to the install target.

still haven't figured out how to get the crash report module working.
