Linux system.
create user a
create user b

login a user a
start firefox (creates a fresh profile)
quit
logout

login a user b
open terminal
run:
ssh -X a@localhost
firefox

Your desktop belongs to user "b", but the started firefox process belongs to forwarded user "a".

Go to any website, right click on any image and say "view image".
Now use file save as.

This always crash on my Fedora 9 system, i386, Firefox 3.0.2

Please see the attached text file.
The first couple of line show some assertion failures, printed by firefox.
The remainder are stack from gdb.
