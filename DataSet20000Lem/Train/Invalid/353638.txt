Starting Firewfox trigger some malware that pop up many IE shell 'free scan for viruses' type adware. This is critical problem in that it ha great potential for destroying the Firefox userbase. It seems to be directed only to respond to an attempt to use firefox .. it doe not happen with Flock, Opera. The popup's disguise themselves a probably being from Mircosoft and warn against continueing without clicking for a 'Free virus scan'

Btw, the #Firefox channel on irc.mozilla.org wa totally unsupportive of solving this problem, appreciating in no way how important it is. In fact, they banned me for insisting that it is critical for the future of Firefox. Malware directed to cause a particular competing product to function in undesired way ha the greatest potentila for adversely affecting a product's user base.
