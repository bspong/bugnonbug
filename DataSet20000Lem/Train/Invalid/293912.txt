I have ha this problem with version 1.0.3 and now 1.0.4
Sometimes when clicking link or just opening a new window (whether firfox wa
already open or not), the window spawn blank. No message in the status bar.
The title bar on the other hand show the title of the page you are "viewing."
The address bar appears blank and when you try to use the pulldown it is blank
and shifted to the left of the address bar. The google-yahoo-imdb,etc.. search
bar appears normal, but when you attempt to use the pulldown the menu drops, but
it is on the left side of the screen and down about 1/2 way. The update button
that appears when update are available also appears, out of place. It show up
next to "Help" above the address bar. If you click it, it will attempt to search
for updates, but it won't find any even if some exist. You can hit Refresh and
Home and the title bar will update to the new page, but nothing else happens.
