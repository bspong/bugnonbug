Ever since downloading this last update 3.6 I have been having nothing but problems.

1) It screw up text on my yahoo group page making simple grammatical thing like ' and ? looking alphabet soup. http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/WarrenHaynesandGovtMule/

2) Sign in problem with one site after another. My cooky are set to ask me to allow each third party cookie. All of a sudden no one like your third party exemption and I don't get it. I am having ongoing problem signing into my You Tube account with my google account. I am also having problem with yahoo mail and signing into my account there. It is all because of some setting you changed in the third party cookie section. It used to work but now it is a big problem for some reason that I can't even begin to figure out. For year I've used firefox with don't accept 3rd party cooky unless I say ok and now that is looking like I am getting nothing but problem with that setting.

3) The worst change you made is after a crash or a freeze in my computer, Firefox open up the old site. That is very annoying because sometimes it put you right back into the freeze or crash. And if it is a bad site, well you're right back at a bad site. Make the program start fresh and stop going back to the old page that you just got kicked out of.

I am so filled with annoyance about the new update that I am ready to move far away from your product. It used to be the best now it is annoying. Furthermore, have you ever had anyone organize your help sections? Your help section is terrible. I don't want to read a story. I don't want to have to look at a million page of unorganized junk that people write. Nor do I want to read a long complicated description. And stop telling me to clear my cookies. It isn['t the answer to everything. I want a quick fix and or a tech person to help me. And I should get a contact email address to write to instead of having to do a bug report. I dont' know if it;'s a bug. I just know I've had problem with Firefox ever since the last update.

And that isn't even telling you about the problem with the flash player, which I think I have figured out now. It ha been very time consuming to deal with all the issue this last update ha given me.

This is becoming a very cumbersome product for me. Please straighten out your current product to stop limiting my enjoyment of the internet. Ever since that last update I am not happy with Firefox.
