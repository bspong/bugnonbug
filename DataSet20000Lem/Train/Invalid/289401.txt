When Singlewindow extension is installed, firefox won't load the homepage at
startup, the bookmark toolbar disappears and the back button won't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install singlewindow 1.4 from update.mozilla.org
2. Restart Firefox
3.

Actual Results:
After I installed the singlewindow extension v1.4 (and restarted), the bookmark
toolbar disappeared. Firefox wouldn't load my homepage (www.spiegel.de) at
startup even though it wa still written in the preferences. When I pressed the
homepage button, firefox loaded www.firefox-browser.de (German default firefox
homepage) instead. And the back button wa always greyed out. When I disabeled
the extension everything wa fine again.

Expected Results:
Well, load the homepage, show the bookmark toolbar and react on a pressed back
button.

In Win2k and Linux, I never noticed this problem.
