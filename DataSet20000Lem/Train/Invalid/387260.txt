When I visit the Nike site http://www.nike.com/nikeskateboarding/v3/ the page load fine. When I scroll, the page go blank. The Flash content go blank.

The Nike animated gizmo keep drawing in the middle of the rectangle, and when my mouse move portion redraw.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.nike.com/nikeskateboarding/v3/
2. Scroll more than a centimeter
Actual Results:
See the white blank screen.

Expected Results:
It should display the Flash content, scrolled.

I see this on many sites, and I think I saw this with a Java applet plugin too. I'm running MacIntel 10.4.10 / FFX 2.0.0.4 latest Flash plugin. There is no workaround.
