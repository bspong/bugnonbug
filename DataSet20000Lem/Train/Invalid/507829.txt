When using Mozilla 3.5, after about 15 minute of use, the screen go white. I recently upgraded from 3.0 to 3.5 and did not have any problem of white screen prior to upgrading and can not find an old build of 3.0 to go back to. I have uninstalled 3.5 and reinstalled it and I still have the same problem.

My only solution to the white screen problem is to close my browser and reopen it.

1.open Mozilla 3.5
2.wait 15 minute
3.white screen
Actual Results:
screen would go white and I would close browser and reopen browser

Expected Results:
