[Windows] page loaded in the background first display in normal size, then the site-specific text zoom is applied, causing the page to jump
+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #386835 +++

A page loaded in the background first display in normal size when switched to it.
Then the site-specific text zoom is applied. This cause the whole page to jump.

STR:
1. Visit a site like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page.
2. Set text-zoom to larger or smaller than normal by pressing Ctrl + or Ctrl -.
3. Load a couple of page from the same site in the background by middle-clicking e.g.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_zooming
4. Switch to the background tabs.
5. Optionally repeat step 2, then 4.

Actual result:
After step 4, the page display for a split-second (but long enough that you're able to start reading) in normal text-zoom, then jump to the site-specific text-zoom.
After step 4, the page display for a split-second in the *previous* displayed text-zoom, then jump to the *new* site-specific text-zoom.

Expected result:
The page display in the correct text-zoom from the beginning.
