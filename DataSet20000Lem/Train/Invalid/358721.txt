with Firefox 2.0, I lost the ability to copy images/links or save picture by pressing on the mouse.

Definitely, it did not work with my PowerBook; with G-5 I had to press the right button not the usual left button on the mouse.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a photo from web page
2. Press on the mouse on it to copy. save, etc.
3. The only way it work with PowerBook is to drag the picture into a file

Actual Results:
Cannot copy/save picture or links.
