Shift + Left Click doe not select HTML form element in Linux
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050920 Firefox/1.0.7

When I try to select multiple element in a HTML form (select tag) using Shift +
Left Click, no selection happens. If I try to shift + double click, the item
from the select disappers. A couple of more double click with shift pressed, the
entire selection becomes empty.

This happens only in Linux build of Firefox. I can confirm that Windows build
behaves normally and let me select multiple entry with Shift + Left Click. I
can also confirm that Ctrl + Left Clicks work normally in Linux and Windows.
