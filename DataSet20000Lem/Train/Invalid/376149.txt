Ugh. Maxthon can do this... but it doesn't give you the option of opening certain other site in a separate window if you want (which would make it easier to sort out thing the next time around. And it would be nice if someone made a plugin in which you could make selected tab go into a specific separate instance of firefox rather then a totally new instance all the time.
