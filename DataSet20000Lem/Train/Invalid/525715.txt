I do not use a theme. I have a Mid 2007 iMac with 4 GB of RAM and the dual core processor. Firefox ha had occasional trouble on this computer in the past (eight or nine month ago) but ha been far more stable on this computer then it ever wa on Wierdoze (Windows), until now. This build is the worst upgrade for Firefox I have ever been associated with.
