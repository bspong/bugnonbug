On window program can be launched with ; a separation
I dont know anybody can do anything bad with this
From C:\> I can make Firefox download explorer.exe by running

firefox.exe;a/../windows/explorer.exe
or
firefox.exe;a\..\windows\explorer.exe

So I am wondering combined with other plugin Vulnerability
(bug 395942 Quick time flow or Adobe PDF Vulnerability)
Can somebody make it dangerous


Step to mimic "Adobe PDF Vulnerability POC" at
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_mv49Sdeok
1. In openoffice Writer create new document
2. create a link with
file:///C:/path_to_firefox/firefox.exe
3. Export a PDF
4. Open the PDF
5. Click the link it will launch firefox.exe

I tried URL "firefox.exe -chrome http://google.com"
I did not work

With openoffice I can not produce PDF with ";" or space in url
What is somebody edit PDF with a binary editor to make ";"
