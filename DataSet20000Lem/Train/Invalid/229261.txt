Mozilla Firebird cant start even though it worked fine the first two times.

Ive downloaded MozillaFirebird-0.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu-tar.gz from mozilla site.
After I untared it, i used ./MozillaFirebird to start it. Worked fine first
time. After I installed Flash plugin (that worked ok with my mozilla 1.4), when
tried to start Mozilla Firebird again, I keep on getting this error message:

INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: No manager for initializing factory?
System error?:: Success


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Untar MozillaFirebird-0.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz
2.cd MozillaFirebird
3../MozillaFirebird (worked ok first time)

Actual Results:
INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: No manager for initializing factory?
System error?:: Success

Expected Results:
