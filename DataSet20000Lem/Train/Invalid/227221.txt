Drag link/text anywhere to open/search - Super / Magic drag & drop support (like MyIE2 & GoSuRF)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; MyIE2; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: -

I'm missing a feature in Firebird which is being missed by quite a few people,
seeing the various forum topic on the subject:
"Super Drag & Drop" or "Magic Drag"

This feature is incorporated in the IE shell extension of MyIE2
(http://www.myie2.com/html_en/tour/03superdragdrop.htm) and GoSuRF
(http://mmjd.com/gosurf/tour/?en - Items 13 & 14).

Basically it allows you to select any link and drag it anywhere, after which it
will open the link in a new tab in the background; OR select any text and drag
it anywhere, after which it will search for the text in Google and open the
result in a new tab in the background. If the selected text is a URL (without
A tag), it will just open the URL in the background.

I realize this is possible in Firebird by dragging the link to an open space
on the tabbar or to the toolbar/go button, but if you have ever used these
option in MyIE2 and/or GoSuRF, you know there is a huge difference. It is so
much easier doing it their way. Saves a lot of hassle and you can do it blindly
(which is probably the biggest reason to choose for this method).

It can also be turned off (which is important) or enhanced: by dragging a
selection of text or images, you can let these selection automatically be
saved to a previously chosen folder.

This is my reason not to switch to Firebird at all, while I would really like
to.

Actual Results:
Not supported.

Expected Results:
Explained above.

An extension would be a solution, I'm not sure if this should be a default
behavior for Firebird. There is no such extension available however and it's
VERY useful. I find myself using this almost anywhere (then finding out it's
not possible).
