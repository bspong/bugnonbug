Hi,

Phoenix beep if you accidentally type in a new window (no input field
focussed). I think it search through the document for link containing the
letter typed, and beep if the search fails.

Often happens if I'm typing in a shell while waiting for a new browser window to
open.

My motherboard's onboard sound ha the unfortunate feature of routing the system
beep through connected speakers. It is incredibly loud. No amount of tweaking
ha gotten rid of this. In a house with roommates, loud beep at three in the
morning suck. :)
