Our company us MS SharePoint service for our intranet document vault and other item on the intranet. The previous version worked fine. The IT department ha just "upgraded" to the latest version of MS SharePoint service. Now if I attempt to open the page I am asked for a username and password. There aren't any, and I can't access the page anymore with FireFox. Of course IE work fine. I suspect that MS ha written some form of non-compliant bug into the latest SP Services to keep FireFox from working.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to browse to our intranet Sharepoint site.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
A dialog box open asking for Username/password.

Expected Results:
The page should simply open without requesting any additional information.
