changed themes, lost all menu icons, only large print now, all drop down menu's black
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: unable....all menu's are blacked out

I changed themes, i think to spheregnome. When FF came back up, all the icon
were now print only, there is no spacing to the print and it overlaps. When I
click on a menu heading, the drop down is completely black. The actual web
page being viewed is normal. I have deleted the software twice, including all
the reference I can find in the registry. After each reinstall, the problem
is still there so there must be something left behind when the software is
removed. I cannot tell you the build because of the blacked out menu's. I am
unable to get a printscreen of what it look like. I've been forced back to
IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.switch to a new theme
2.
3.




I downloaded some new theme via IE to see if I could get a new theme to
override the corrupted one. On each I get a message 'Invalid or corrupt .jar
file.....'
