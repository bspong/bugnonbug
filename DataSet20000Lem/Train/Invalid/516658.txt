The top menu tends to steal focus at random times, and very often when I pause typing. (For example, a I started typing this, I activated a random menu choice because the top menu stole focus). It is most noticeable on facebook, out of various sites, since it involves entering text in field a lot. It is not consistently stealing focus - sometimes it steal it at a pause, other time when I am in the middle of entering a few sentence at a "normal" speed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to site that requires entry in test field (Example: facebook, or bug entry form)
2. Attempt to enter text, pause a couple time a you might while gathering your thought
3. At some point, the top menu steal focus, and your keystroke will activate a random menu item
Actual Results:
Menu bar still stole focus (File menu item is always the one it highlight a having focus initially, until unaware keystroke activate another menu item

Expected Results:
The menu bar should not be stealing focus, it should remain where it is (i.e the box I am typing in) until I direct it somewhere else either via keystroke or mouse click
