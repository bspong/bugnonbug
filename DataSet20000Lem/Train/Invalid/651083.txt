suppose there is a add on which add an toolbar button . and it ha a icon sized at some higher resolution for e.g. 200*300 then it should be resized to the 16*16 image. It wa been resized in earlier version of firefox. but it is not resizing in latest version. So , many time it quite annoying to see such a big icon for any toolbarbutton.

Reproducible: Always
