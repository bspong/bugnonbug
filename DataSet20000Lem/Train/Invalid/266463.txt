I tried installing LiveHttpHeaders 0.9 on FireFox 1.0 RC1. Install.log indicated
success even though it poped up a dialog box says:

"LiveHttpHeaders 0.9 could not be installed because it is not compatible with
this version of FireFox. (LiveHttpHeaders 0.9 will only install with FireFox
version from 0.8 to 0.10+"

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

2.
3.



Expected Results:
Install.log should log a failure
