Whenever I attempt to view an image that isn't added to a page, for example a link directly to an image on a server, the tab for the current active tab's text is replaced by a compressed version of the image being viewed. The tab also extends to match the width of the image being view. This occurs with all image types.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a link to an image file
2.Open an image file through File>Open File
3.

Actual Results:
With each different way to access an image, the issue occurs again.

Expected Results:
The software should maintain the name of the tab, not attempt to se the image it is viewing a a tab title. The title should be the image file name.
