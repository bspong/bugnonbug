In Windows the XUL File association created by firefox is incorrect
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

Windows ha "file associations" that map file extension to a command(s) to
execute to open/view them. The association created by firefox for XUL file
when executed generates a "c is not a registered protocol" error.

The problem can be fixed by editing the file association from any explorer
window: hit Tools->Folder Options, then "File Types" and select XUL, hit
"Advanced" and on the Open command hit "Edit" change the command so after the
path to the mozilla executable (firefox.exe perhaps?) it reads: -chrome
"file://%1" (instead of: -chrome "%1") However, since this doe not match the
default setting Mozilla see that you changed this and asks you "if you want to
make mozilla your default browser" and if you hit yes, it change it back.

(currently it is setup by the application to read: -chrome "%1" but since most
path will begin with "c:/" - you're typical drive letter - it must think c:/ is
the protocol...)



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install firefox (or mozilla) or "Set Mozilla to be your default browser"
2.double-click any XUL file

Actual Results:
receive "c is not a registered protocol" (where "c" may be the drive letter your
xul file wa located on) and no rendering of your pretty form, subsequently
followed by frowning

Expected Results:
rendered the xul file, subsequently followed by awe
