Awesome bar now a dialog, fly in from offscreen
In FF3b4 and all previous version of Firefox, the location bar and all other autocomplete widget appeared a normal drop-down fields, and were treated a such by the window manager. In FF3b5, autocomplete drop down have been promoted to some kind of window (dialog, perhaps, but not top level window) which the window manager place with an annoying animation.

The annoying animation is the window manager's problem, but it's Firefox's responsibility to advise the window manager that something is or isn't a real window. Somewhere between b4 and b5, this advice changed.
