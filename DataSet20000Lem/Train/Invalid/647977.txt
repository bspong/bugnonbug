showItemProperties failed to show Bookmark property
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.5 and 3.6

When the function 'PlacesUIUtils.showItemProperties(ItemId,"bookmark")' is called the following error occures :

"Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.getItemTitle]" nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/editBookmarkOverlay.js :: EIO__appendFolderItemToMenuList :: line 299" data: no]"

The bookmark property window opened but each field is empty. Only Dialog title is shown.

I reproduced this error with Firefox 3.5 and 3.6.16. With firefox 3.0 it works.

With Fx4.0 this function is deprecated and replaced by PlacesUIUtils.showBookmarkDialog which work a expected.

Reproducible: Always
