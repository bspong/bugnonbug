When I opened some tab and wanted to compare some style for a forum I noticed that some tab rendered the forum with the wrong style. It seems they got mixed up between different tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The problem can be replicated is a follows:

1. Open a new browser and create 2 tab
TAB 1: http://demo.punres.org/?id=105
TAB 2: http://demo.punres.org/?id=48

2. Next, go to tab 1 and click 'test forum'.

Actual Results:
You'll see that tab 1 now us the style of the forum displayed on tab 2...

Expected Results:
The correct CSS file should be loaded and used on the two tab separately. At this moment the page in the tab use the same CSS document while in fact they differ.

Quick resolution:
A shift + refresh solves the problem
