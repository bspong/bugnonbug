I use this function regularly, and until the latest update, (Apr 10) this worked fine. Now the pop-up window opens, but it either time out, doe nothing, or return
"Connection Interrupted
The connection to the server wa reset while the page wa loading.
The network link wa interrupted while negotiating a connection. Please try again."

It act like a very slow internet connection, yet everything else connects fine, and there is no problem using IE. Almost like the code is being blocked or will not execute. Pop-ups are allowed, and Adblock Plus is disabled.
This is the personal travel planning function of my employer's website (American Airlines, https://www.jetnet.aa.com), and is password protected.


Thanks
