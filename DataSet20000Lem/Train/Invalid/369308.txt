page never finish loading after SSL warning dialog
Since Firefox 2, there are several problem with dialog box not being modal.

The latest one occurs when starting Firefox with several page in the session to restore.

As soon a I get a dialog box (the one that seems to trigger it is a warning about the site's name not matching the certificate's name), all page stop loading. Even after clicking OK on the dialog box, several tab (presumably any that haven't yet loaded before the SSL warning dialog) never finish loading. They sit there perpetually with the tab's title showing "Loading".

I am also using an authenticating proxy.
