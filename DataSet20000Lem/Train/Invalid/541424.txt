Popup blocker doesn't block CNET popup

If you go to the CNET news site it display a popup in the lower right corner asking you to either sign in or join their network. You only get this once per browser session. I click on "no thanks" but since I don't save cooky for that web site if it set one it lost.

I'm using Firefox 3.6 under Vista and have block pop-up enabled. I have three web site listed a exception (pandora, expedia, and travelocity). The exception list work a expected.

To be fair Opera 10.10 and Chrome 4.0.249.78 beta don't block popups on http://news.cnet.com/ either.



Reproducible: Always
