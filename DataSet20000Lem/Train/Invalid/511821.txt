Something claiming Firefox Update auto-installed even tho option set to "ask me first"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

I have my option on Firefox 3.5.2 set to "check for updates" but to "ask me first" when they are found instead of auto-installing. At approximately 6 PM EST today (Aug 20, 2009),I had Firefox open and suddenly a pop-up window appeared and said "downloading and installing update" a few second later it said "update will be finalized the next time you start Firefox" Neither window identified what wa being downloaded. Not only wa my Firefox already updated, but I have my option set to "ask me first" before installing *any* update -- this option isi set true for all my software, including Firefox, Thunderbird AND any Windows updates.

Was this a genuine update or something else? Either way, why did wa my instruction to "ask me first" ignored? I also have current updated version of AVG anti-virus and Spybot program running and received no warning from them when this happened.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. not an event I can attempt to reproduce
2.
3.


Expected Results:
According to the setting in options, Firefox should have "asked me first" if I wanted to install update instead of proceeding automatically to download and install whatever it was.

I have been running Firefox for the past year and this is the first time by option to "ask me first" ha been bypassed. NOTE: Same thing happened with my Thunderbird installation about 6 hour later.
