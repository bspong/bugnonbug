The bookmark system doe not seem to be very efficient. I cannot drag and drop bookmark into folder from the pulldown menu. The organize bookmark option is hard to find and even harder to make it work, still cannot drag and drop bookmark with that option. Must copy and paste. Creating new folder to organize is also overly complicated. Organize bookmark option on the main bookmark tab would help this problem a lot and also when bookmarking a page make it efficient like it wa in previous versions. Cannot view any sub folder when bookmarking webpage so I have to go through the complicated step above to try to organize.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click Bookmarks tab at the top of brower
2.Click Bookmark this page
3.Try to conveniently and easily create a folder to put that page into.

1.Click Bookmark tab at the top of browser
2. Click bookmark this page
3. Try to put a page directly into your newly created folder.
Actual Results:
I got frustrated and started clicking button until I found the organize option. Then forgot how I got there the first few time because I wa clicking around. For the second part, it's just not possible. I had to find the organize button and cut and paste my bookmark into the folders.

Expected Results:
To work like the previous set ups which were very easy to use and quick.

I'm not harping on anyone, just reporting an issue I see. Don't think I'm not grateful for the browser, I just want it to stay the best.

It's right out of the box beta 2 version with colortabs and yahoo mail notifier.
