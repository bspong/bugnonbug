location bar no longer work after upgrade [caused by Tab Mix Plus]

After upgrading from 4.0b1 to 4.0b2, I am no longer able to access URLs using the location bar. I've attempted both pressing enter and clicking the go arrow. I've confirmed that it's an issue with only my profile, but the exact reason is still unknown.

Reproducible: Didn't try




I uninstalled Windows 7, backing up my Firefox profile first, and moved to Windows XP. Upon creating a new profile, I confirmed it's solely a profile issue. Perhaps something is screwing up because it's thinking I'm still running Windows 7.
