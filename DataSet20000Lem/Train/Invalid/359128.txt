I am a web developer. I developed www.ppocweb.net. The form doesn't display the correct colors. Currently, the color are not set so, they should be white. The name field and the text area field display correctly. The other field display yellow. I have tried to change the color to a variety of different colors, red, blue ect. The yellow field stay yellow. I have viewed the page in other browsers, internet explorer, netscape, opera. The form display correctly in these browsers.

Being a web developer, I use several browser and several different somputers to check my work. I offer this feature to my client a a selling pitch. I would love to continue to use firefox a it is one of the more user friendly browsers.

I hope that this bug is easily fixed.
