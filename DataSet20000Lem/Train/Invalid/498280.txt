received an update notification for a non-existent version of the beta (3.5b99)

a notification box came up by the system tray that said there is an update available, it wa for 3.5b99, when i hovered, it immediately disappeared. i thought it wa some joke by god-knows-who, but it even say it in the update window.
went and checked the site, since the FTP is usually updated /after/ the site, still nothing there.

if this is some kind of nightly build or quiet push, sorry, but i've never had a problem before =]
