Make permission language easier to understand
Bug 573176 made a basic about:permissions interface, but we need to update the language in this interface to make it easier for the user to understand what each of the permission is doing. We also want to make sure this language is consistent with the notification that ask the user to set these permission (password, geolocation, etc.).
