When using FireFox to browse the web, the synaptics driver doe not appear to
work correctly. When browsing the same site in Internet Explorer the hardware
driver will scroll up and down. The hardware this is running on is a Compaq Evo
N160 laptop and the driver have been reinstalled after a fresh installation of
FireFox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch web page
2. Attempt to scroll up/down using the directional pad.

Actual Results:
Windows play the 'error.wav' sound when trying to scroll and the action doe
not take place.

Expected Results:
Windows should scroll up/down when the up or down button on the directional pad
is pressed.

It appears to be an issue with the hardware driver and the software call for to
allow scrolling up/down. This happens whether or not additional tab are
opened, but it may be related to how the hardware interacts with the different
tab (my guess is the hardware driver can't make sense of the additional
requirement for multiple tabs). This is the first time I've seen this behavior
in any software... I love this browser and really would like to get this one
feature working!!! Thanks in advance for any assistance! I have searched all
the forum for synaptics and didn't receive any results.
