Random freeze in Win2K with no action from user
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1

It just freeze within second to a maximum of maybe a minute or so.

Most easily freeze after typing in and trying to reach another site.

Sometimes I can get to yahoo.com without trouble, but mostly anything I type in
and try to go to will freeze the browser. Even those on my intranet, or even
from my local loop apache server.

It will freeze when doing nothing.
It will freeze while you are typing in a field (like Bugzilla).

I tried opening page stored on my disk, regular html.
It seems to have no trouble opening a simple html "hello world" type of page.
But a large page with XHTML and CSS choke it every time.

Of course this freezing eats CPU cycle hard core.
I have an AMD XP 2500+ system.
