If a web page generates a mailto link using Javascript, the link show
properly with an underline, but you can't click on it. When you hover
over the link, the status line at the bottom doe not show the link.
If you click on the link, nothing happens. This happens on the "email" link
on the indicated URL (near the bottom of the page). I have also seen this
behavior with several other website using the same mechanism. This work OK with the latest build of Mozilla, but doe not work with the latest build of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL http://www.mmra.org/contact.html
2. Try to click on the "email" link at the bottom of the page

Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
Should open a compose window with user's mail client.

Works OK in Linux build of Firefox - this is a Windows-Only bug
