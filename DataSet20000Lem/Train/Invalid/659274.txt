When pressing the aforementioned key two time quickly after each other, it brings up the Clear All History window, but in a small window, in which you're unable to do anything.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Crtl+Shift+Del quickly twice to bring up the window.

Actual Results:
It opened up the Clear All History window, but in an empty, small window.

Expected Results:
It should have opened up the normal window.

It's surprising that you guy don't have a system where I could upload some screenshots. Anyways, here's one:
