With certain web page I am no longer able to close the tab. The page will load fine and render properly but clicking on the X in the tab or right clicking and selecting close do not work. I am able to load a different page in the same tab, but I will not be able to close the new page either.
While some tab are unable to close others pointing at different site will still function correctly.

I have tested this in safe mode and I get the same results. This issue started about 10 day to 2 week ago.

I am running Minefield from a tar ball with update enabled. But I also have firefox-3.6.4-2.fc14.x86_64 installed via the vendor packaging system and it doe not have the same problems. When I first downloded the Minefield tar ball it worked fine a well. But one of the update in the last 10 day to 2 week started this problem.

I would guess that about 15% of page experience this issue. Another page where I have the same problem is here.
