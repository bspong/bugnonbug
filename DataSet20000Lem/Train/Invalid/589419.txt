since a few days, one of my website show an unexpected underline rsp. border line, though i didn't change the site in this period.

Calling the url above show a joomla page, where the first menu item "Willkommen" seems to be striked out. The reason is a cs formatting from a higher level div, that appears like a strikeout but is some border line perhaps. I couldn't figure it out, why this happens

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.just call the url
2.look at the first menu item, that seems to be striked out
3.look at the right corner to see it a longer line, like a border line
Actual Results:
there is a border line with size of the id "ja-container"

Expected Results:
no border line

sorry, got no idea, which definition could create this. therefore i'm unable to decide, whether it a known bug or not. Even worse, maybe it ha been a bug in the joomla website all the time, but new firefox is the first to show it ;-)

Konqueror a delivered with kde 4.4.4, rel 2 show it in the expected way without line.
