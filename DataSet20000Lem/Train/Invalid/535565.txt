Lets say I have a scollable table. The tbody take up the whole height even when there are fewer rows, making the table look ugly. Giving exact height in pixel doe not help. IE display the same properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a scrollable table with fixed header, say height 500px.
2. Make it contain 2 or three row of height say 25px

Actual Results:
The row height grows to fill the whole space

Expected Results:
The row height should be 25px - just like what it is in IE

The row height should be 25px - just like what it is in IE
