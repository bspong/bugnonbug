Non-private session is restored after crashing in Private Browsing mode
To reproduce:
- Go into Private Browsing Mode
- Crash while being in Private Browsing Mode

When restarting, you get to see the session restore dialog, which indicates that you crashed the last time.
I don't think that should be happening, right?
