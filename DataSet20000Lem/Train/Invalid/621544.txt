I go to http://www.lightinthebox.com/index.php?main_page=advanced_search_result&inc_subcat=1&search_in_description=0&light_select=0&keyword=Card+Reader+MP3+Player
place and order and click pay with PAYPAL, a HTTPS link come up and I'm asked for social security # and all sort of credit card info. I'm not able to get out of this screen unless I terminate firefox. THIS ONLY HAPPENS WITH FIREFOX AND THIS LIGHTINTHEBOX SITE. Paypal will not help and light in the box will not help. I have current Norton anitvirus, spybot and XP SP3 updates. Is the redirection occuring with firefox cookies? I have screen capture that I can send but this bug list doe not accept attachments.
