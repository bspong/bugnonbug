After undoing a complete deletion of the 'name' field, the 'Add' button remains disabled

This bug prevents the user from adding a bookmark after he undid a deletion of
the name field in the 'Add bookmark' dialogue by mistake.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press CTRL+D or select Bookmarks->Add Bookmark to pop up the 'Add Bookmark'
dialogue.
2. The name field contains the current page title, it is completely highlighted.
Press DEL or use the context menu to delete it.
3. Press CTRL+Z or use the context menu for an undo.

Actual Results:
After step 2, the 'Add' button is disabled, which is the anticipated behavior.
But after undoing the deletion of the field, it is still disabled until
something is entered.

Expected Results:
Firefox should enable the button everytime when there's some text in the 'Name'
field.

Reproducable under:
- Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050717
Firefox/1.0.6
- Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712 Firefox/1.0+
- FF 1.0.6 under Linux

Therefore, I assume this bug being included in almost every Firefox version.
