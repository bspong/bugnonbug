Since yesterday I can't open my message in gmail anymore. I click on a message and it doe nothing other than tell me that it is loading. When I change back to the older version of gmail, I don't have that problam. Since I have made no change of any kind and it worked well before yesterday, I don't know what the problem is. I tried it in IE and had no problem. Unfortunately, gmail always change me back to the new version every time I close the program.
