a) GOOGLE. This top search webpage, ha literally solved our hand by automating the search box, by when you first write/type something, immediately appears the millions, thousand etc of result in the main window aside to the one you are typing plus the alternatine option that give you, and make it easier to find what you are looking for or to continue. Now it's just a blank search box. In my safari, this work like a charm and worked also at the firefox 3.0.5 and all previous.
b) HOTMAIL.2 ISSUES // 1) Unfortunately with the beta 3.1, even if you have satellite line, you must have plenty of free time to navigate through your folder or to write a new e-mail. 2) Don't even think to attach a file! When you press the attach button in the main page of a new e-mail, you must ask Merlin if the button "browse" will appear! If it appears (the chance are 1 to 10), the chance to open a window so to attach a file is 1 to 20! And of course this file firefox never upload it. Tried several times, even with 20kb files!
c) please check www.e-radio.gr . is the most popular website in greece with all the radiostations (fm + internet) located in greece. The same problem a firefox 3 in the beginning. Does not play those players. And please note that these are not only greek, is a system that is used worldwide of course

All the above I tried them with safari 3.2.1 and they work perfectly a they worked with all the previous version of firefox
