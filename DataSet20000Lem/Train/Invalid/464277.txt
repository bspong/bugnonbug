Pref "Open new window in a new tab instead" doe not seem to be honored
Seen while testing Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b2pre) Gecko/20081111 Minefield/3.1b2pre.

STR:
1. Go to Preferences | Tabs and make sure the checkbox "Open new window in a new tab instead" is checked.
2. Go to a page and right click a link, making sure to select open link in a new window or open a new window.

Expected: Because I have that pref checked, the link would open in a new tab or my new window would open in a new tab.
Actual: When the pref is checked, everything open in a new window.

whimboo mentioned there wa some pref work remaining to be done but since I wa trying to update the Litmus test case I came across this discrepancy and wanted to make sure it is tracked.
