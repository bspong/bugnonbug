In the page at http://www.voltaj.ro/ some element inside the flash object do
not get displayed at all.

In other browsers, the element are displayed properly at the url above.
In FireFox, while testing on the local network, the element are displayed
properly. This happens only when the site is on the web.

In the flash movie I load xml content serval time at once outputed by the same
file (constructor.php) located on the webserver.

After you go to http://www.voltaj.ro/ you will note in the status bar that the
browser keep loading information and never finish loading

In addition, I've added a message in flash so that it give out a javascript
alert box. By clicking the OK button inside the alert box serval times, the
flash movie missing element get displayed one by one.

This problem puzzle me, because everything work on the local server but not on
the web.
