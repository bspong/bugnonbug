FIREFOX --- and CHROME
FANTASTIC IMPROVEMENT OF ### CHROME ###
USE BROWSER BAR CLEAR ------- TRANSPARENT STATUSBAR ----------

USING A NAVIGATION BAR, INCREASING AREA READING AREA
############
ADDRESSES SHOWING UP ON THE PAGE NAVIGATION --- fantastic implement
NECESSARILY have to implement FIREFOX BROWSER
------------ THAT A LARGE DEVELOPMENTS --- NAVIGATION ---


HOWEVER --------------- I USE ------ BOOKMARKLETS........... in example

CONSIDER AT ALL COSTS,
INCLUDING ESSENTIAL,
HAVE AN ACTIVE BAR MENU,
ONLINE WHERE I KEEP MY USEFUL SPACES ------- My BOOKMARKLETS



CONSIDER AT ALL COSTS, INCLUDING ESSENTIAL,
HAVE A BAR TAB PAGE BELOW, AS DIRECTLY RELATED PAGES The TAB,
SO ESSENTIAL TO HAVE THE BAR MY PICK UP,
KEEP IN TOUCH LESS ACCESSED MORE AWAY UP,

AVOID MAJOR SHIFTS AND THE READER AVOIDING REFORMULATION SOMETHING CONSTANT REPETITIVE



SO ............


This is the ideal image browser




--------------------------------------------------------- title bar
---a--b--c--d--e--f--g--h------------------------------- BOOKMARKS TOOLBAR ....... my personal prefer
-|----||----||----||----||----||----||----||----||----||----| TAB BAR
page view



---------------------------------------------------------- TRANSPARENT STATUS BAR






This maximizes AREA
OF NAVIGATION AREA
AND BECOME MORE NEXT USING FUNCTIONS IN WRITING -------------- BOOKMARKLETS ------

THE CHOICE SHOULD BE OPTIONAL. Any way I want the tab above the other menu
