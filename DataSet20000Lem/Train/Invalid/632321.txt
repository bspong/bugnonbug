I created a page to embed a Google Doc in an iframe. The page is displayed properly, but scroll down to the iframe.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on http://nevcal.com/test/bugabc.html
2. Notice how a title appears first
3. Notice how the display jump to the iframe
Actual Results:
When the rest of the page more that fill the current window, such that the iframe is not even partially on the screen, the top of the page will be shown, and then the page will jump down to the point where the iframe is fully visible at the bottom of the window.

If even a little of the iframe is visible because the top content is small, then the jump dosen't happen.

Expected Results:
Opera doesn't jump. Chrome jumps, and then jump back. IE jump just like Firefox. The correct behavior, a far a I'm concerned, is not to jump (like Opera).

I classify this a major a it seriously disrupts the browsing experience.
