Examining the places.sqlite database, one find 64-bit integer in the dateAdded and lastModified field of moz_bookmarks. Viewed a 64 bit the number make no sense. The high 32 bit appear to be the actual number of second since 1970. However, the correct date is displayed when one organizes bookmarks.

I believe firefox is storing the number byte-swapped, then byte-swapping it again for display. I'm sure there's some historical reason for this, but it's rather unfriendly to people who write tool to view/manipulate the database. (I imagine this issue extends to all dates, but the bookmark field are the one I ran into.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open places.sqlite in any sqlite client.
2. Look at the dateAdded and lastModified fields.
3. Ask yourself just what those number mean.
Actual Results:
For an example bookmark in places.sqlite, a shown via a .dump:

INSERT INTO "moz_bookmarks" VALUES(103,1,169,98,4,'.Mac',NULL,NULL,1124217734000000,1200888214000000);

Expected Results:
The same bookmark in FF2's bookmarks.html:

ADD_DATE="1124217734" LAST_VISIT="1203614241" LAST_MODIFIED="1200888214"

I confirmed this on both os-x and windows.
