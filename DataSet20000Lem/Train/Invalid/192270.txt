The page http://phil.codeallday.com/nonfunc/ ha problem with the links. Both
'arsjerm' and 'nondeus' should be links, and indeed display with the underline.
Also, the 2 image for valid cs and valid xhtml/1.1 should also be links.
However, neither of these two part change the cursor a expected, nor doe
clicking them have any effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://phil.codeallday.com/nonfunc/
2. Mouse over the arsjerm text.
3. Click it.

Actual Results:
Nothing.

Expected Results:
At step 2, the cursor should have changed from an arrow to a hand, but it doesn't.
Clicking the link should open it, but it doesn't.

This affected 0.5, and having just upgraded to the latest available win32
nightly, this still happens. I haven't had problem with any other pages, IE6
handle this properly, and the page validates both a valid cs and valid xhtml/1.1.
