The cs file in the URL is not automatically handled by firefox: it asks the end
user what to do with it. However, on the link, http://www.tvland.com/shows/, the
file is loaded a CSS, and the javascript console for the web developer toolbar
say the file wa gave a warning that the file wa loaded a CSS, even though
the mime-type header for the file wa application/x-pointplus.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Firefox handle the same file in two different ways, most likely from ignoring
mime-type header

Expected Results:
Loaded the file a application/x-pointplus
