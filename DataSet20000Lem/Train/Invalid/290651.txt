After upgrading to Firefox 1.0.3 firefox cannot find any url

I upgraded Firefox to 1.0.3 using the red arrow on the upper right of the
browser. During this upgrade another window popped up and downloaded and
installed firefox, even though I have been using firefox for 6 month or more.
After it reinstalled firefox and finished the upgrade it cannot find any url,
including mozilla.org. How do I fix this? I looked through all of the bug
report and didn't find any with this particular or similar problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch firefox
2.Error message pop up stating start.mozilla.org cannot be found. Try again.
3.
