I wa trying to access a site called minyanville when firefox stopped working and gave the above error message. Now the only site that I access often that work is https://www.cbcfcu.org/home/home and all page related to that site. This is a home computer and a far a I know I do not have a proxy server. I am not a very computer literate person.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try accessing any site except https://www.cbcfcu.org/home/home
2.
3.
Actual Results:
I got the following message:

The proxy server is refusing connection













Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that is refusing connections.





* Check the proxy setting to make sure that they are correct.

* Contact your network administrator to make sure the proxy server is
working.












Expected Results:
The browser should have provided access to the desired site.

Chrome and internet explorer appear to work good. I tried reinstalling Firefox and that didn't work.
