Steps to reproduce:

In any html page with a <select> field, the select field will receive focus, but not display it (with shaded box) until reached by tab (or shift-tab). Example code:

<select id="test1"><option selected value="1">1</option></select>
<input class="text" type="text" value="" id="test2">
<input class="submit" type=button value="Select" onClick="document.getElementById('test1').focus() ">
<input class="submit" type=button value="Text" onClick="document.getElementById('test2').focus() ">

If you click on the text input or the Text button, focus is shown on the text input (the caret is visible). If you click on the select box or the Select button, focus is not shown on the select box. Once you hit tab (or shift tab) to reach the select box, focus is visible and work properly via tab, click, or javascript.


Actual results:

Focus on the select box wa not visible.


Expected results:

Focus on the select box should have been visible (with shaded box)
