Fault with "Password Bank support module"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

After updating to 2.0.0.1, I have been receiving the following message in a pop up window:

"Firefox 2.0.0.1 (en-US) in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\ wa detected. To use password bank with this browser, a support module need to be installed. Although this browser is too new and wa not fully tested with Password Bank support module, it should work. Install module now?"

There is then the option of selecting "yes" or "No".

As I do not use Firefox to remember any passwords, I selected NO and this cancelled the window, only to have it return 1 minute later. I persisted with the NO option a few more times, before selecting YES in order to see if this would stop the pop up window from appearing. This then opened a subsequent window indicating that the module cannot be installed when Firefox is running. I then closed Firefox and ran the module, obtaining a pop up message saying that it installed correctly - only for the original pop up window to reappear 1 minute later.

The original pop up window now appears a soon a my computer is switched on.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Switch computer on.
2. Select no option - pop up window reappears within 1 minute
3. Select yes option - pop up window reappears within 1 minute after saying that module ha installed correctly

Actual Results:
As indicated in the above detail window - the pop up window reappears every 1 minute no matter what option is selected

Expected Results:
The module should have not have needed to be installed, and if it needed to, it should not continue to reappear
