In the past (at least in FF 3.0) I would get key event for each key pressed when using some kind of IME on mac OSX, for example when typing in Chinese. Now there are no such event at all, except for the very initial key down. The only thing received is DOM Mutation events, which are after the fact, not before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the demo URL http://www.danilatos.com/event-test/ExperimentTest.html
2. Select some form of Chinese input (I used ITABC)
3. Type into the contentEditable div in the top left (starts with the text "Hello")
4. Observe the event log. Click on event to see more information.
Actual Results:
Lack of any sort of key event for any key typed but the very first one in a pinyin sequence.

There are similar problem with other IME input methods, not just Chinese. I haven't yet tested other OSes, but the problem could well be there a well.


Expected Results:
Always get some sort of key event every time I press a key on the keyboard.
