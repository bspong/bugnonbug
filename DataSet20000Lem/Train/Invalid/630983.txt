about:home snippet appear blank; profile contains empty snippet from 2010-10-22
In the main Firefox profile on my Linux box running Minefield trunk nightlies, the snippet area on about:home is empty (looks like a blank white button).

localStorage.snippets on about:home contains the following value:

<div class="snippet_set"><!-- content generated at 2010-10-22T21:07:11Z --></div>

As far a I know, I have never manually changed any browser.startup or browser.aboutHomeSnippets prefs.

I don't see this problem in any other profiles. Is this just a remnant from some test deployment last October, which will be fixed when bug 592431 is deployed?
