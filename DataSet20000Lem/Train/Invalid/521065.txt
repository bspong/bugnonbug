Extension that override addtab

Many extension (especially one that modify tab behavior) override gBrowser.addTab in order change thing after a new tab is opened.

This no longer work when a tab is opened using the middle mouse button or right click, open Link in new tab.

The tab opens, but never loads.

The error is:

Error: [Exception... "'JavaScript component doe not have a method named: "clone"' when calling method: [nsIURI::clone]" nsresult: "0x80570030 (NS_ERROR_XPC_JSOBJECT_HAS_NO_FUNCTION_NAMED)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml :: loadURIWithFlags :: line 186" data: no]
Source File: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml
Line: 186

I've attached an extension that replaces AddTab.

You can check the behavior on Firefox 3.5 and Firefox 3.6.
