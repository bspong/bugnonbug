Autosport is a motorsport site that add new article everyday. After opening autosport website, reading and returning to homepage, I close Firefox, shut down PC. Next day, on reopening firefox, the Autosport homepage is in the state it wa previously. "Refreshing" the page doe not change it even though update have occured to the page (I have another browser open which ha newer detail - the other browser doe refresh correctly so I don't believe it is the website). I have only noticed this with Firefox 3.5.2
