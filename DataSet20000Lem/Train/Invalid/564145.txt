When the user ha the option to warn when
"I leave an encrypted page for one that isn't encrypted.",
he is presented with a warning but no opportunity to abort.
This is sometimes contrary to user expectations.
This feature would allow you user to abort retrieval of the unencrypted page.

Reproducible: Always




This could be implemented with an additional button on the warning window.
It would be best if closing the warning window also aborted retrieval.
