Forgive me if this is a duplicate, but I haven't seen it if it is. In Hotmail with Minefield, I can read message fine and enter text in the message box on the compose page, but then when I send the message or look at it in the Sent folder, the text is not there. I'm not sure if this is a Minefield or Microsoft problem, but it work fine in other browser (Opera, SeaMonkey, Links2, Midori, Galeon, etc)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign into Hotmail account.
2. Compose new message or reply to existing message.
3. Send the message and check Sent folder.
Actual Results:
Recipient of the message doe not have the message body, and it is not in saved copy either.

Expected Results:
Message should be sent a typed.

OS: Ubuntu 9.04 64-bit
Latest build of Minefield with current security update and default theme
