Yesterday I downloaded Firefox from what appeared to be your site, and whenever I ran it I got a message saying "Firefox could not install this item because of anerror in Chrome registration. Please contact the author about this problem. I got this message 12 times, but Firefox ran. Today I downloaded Firefox again but it would not execute at all. I just downloaded 3.7 from your Bugzilla web site but it said it would install "Minefield".

I downloaded Google Earth a couple of day ago and it insisted on installing Chrome also. I tried Chrome, didn't like it, and uninstalled it. The Chrome logo stayed on the desktop and I could not delete it until I also uninstalled Google Earth. There are two folder named Chrome in my program files\Mozilla folder. I suspect someone is attacking you, and I suspect it is Google. I'll be happy to cooperate with whatever you wish to do.
