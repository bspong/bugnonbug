In the test page, when you click on the little blue circle (any of them) and a
new window pop up, the scrollbars do not show even though there is overflow.

The url to the JavaScript for the popup is:
http://imacosx.homeunix.net/test-scrollbug/e_edit.js

I thought this wa a problem with the JavaScript at first but it work with
every other browser I tried such a Camino and Safari.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the test page and click on one of the blue circle
Actual Results:
Window pop up but there are no scroll bars. To scroll down you must use down
arrow key.

Expected Results:
There should have been a scroll bar.

You can still scroll down using the arrow key, but you can't scroll back up
using the arrow key.
