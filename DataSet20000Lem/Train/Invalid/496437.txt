This morning I upgraded to OSX 10.5.7 (plus quicktime, itunes, and airport, none of which should be related to firefox basic functionality). Upon the restart of firefox, the Location bar wa missing, a were the standard paging key (back, forward, home, refresh). This wa immediately after the upgrade, and I performed no other operation other than starting firefox. Just in case it wa related to themes, I changed the theme back to the default. On restart, the bar and the button were still missing. I do not see any other problems. I am able to function, more or less, using function key and Open Location, but this is extremely annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:
no location bar, no forward/back page buttons, no refresh button, no stop button, no home button

Expected Results:
these item should have been there, a they always had been before the upgrade of OSX

bug occurs with default theme and with Walnut theme
