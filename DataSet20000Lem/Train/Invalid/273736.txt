Misleading file name in Linux installer
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; it-IT; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041110 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; it-IT; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041110 Firefox/1.0

If I start firefox-installer-bin instead of firefox-installer, the installation
procedure starts, but then hang telling me that it could not open the xpistub
library... this is rather annoying, since at a glance one cannot distinguish the
real installer from the other one (a helper application?).
Changing the name of that file into installer-helper would make it more clear,
moving firefox-installer-bin into another folder (so that there is just one
executable) would make it even clearer...
