I downloaded Firefox 4 beta, install went fine, clicked on shortcut it placed on desktop. It open fine at first but then it just stay in the loading stage and say "transferring data from i.ytimg.com..) I have uninstalled, reinstalled (normal and custom), right clicked and ran a administrator and issue continues. No matter what I do it just say transferring data from i.ytimg.com.. and will not let me click on anything on the window except for the minimize/close/restore down buttons. I uninstalled FF4 and downloaded 3.6 and issue no longer happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download FF4
2.Try and pull up your igoogle homepage (if you have one)
3.it will just sit there with the little loading icon spinning and at the bottom of screen say "transferring data from i.ytimg.com.."
Actual Results:
FF4 would not let me click on anything except for the minimize, restore down, or close buttons. Also, after closing I would have to physically go to ctrl+shift+Esc and end process to close it all the way otherwise when I tried to open a new window it would say that FF is already running.

Expected Results:
Let me browse the internet using FF4
