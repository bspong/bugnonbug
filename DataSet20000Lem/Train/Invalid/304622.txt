Adding a live bookmark via feedview us the location of the feed rather than the location given in the referring page's link element; redirects, PURLs don't work
When a webpage provides a <link/> to a feed and give an url that redirects to
another page, the actual location of the feed is used by the live bookmark,
rather than the url given by the <link/>.

For example:

<link rel= "alternate" type= "application/atom+xml" href=
"http://purl.org/example/newsfeed" />
(Assume http://purl.org/example/newsfeed redirects to
http://example.org/newsfeed.xml)

Using Firefox 1.0's subscription mechanism, http://purl.org/example/newsfeed
would be used a the Feed Location, a intended by the page's author.

When entering feedview, that url would be resolved to
http://example.org/newsfeed.xml; then, when adding the live bookmark,
http://example.org/newsfeed.xml would be used a the Feed Location.

If http://purl.org/example/newsfeed wa then changed to redirect somewhere else
(to the newsfeed's new location), the live bookmark would break.

(Using the regression keyword because this worked a expected in 1.0.)
