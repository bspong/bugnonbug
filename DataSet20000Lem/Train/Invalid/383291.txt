Need to find a simulacrum for a browser help object

We're using a web app that validates user on our firm's intranet. While this work with Internet Explorer due to the Browser Help Objects, FireFox doe not share this technology. Is there an analogous 'hook' we can use to make FireFox compatible with the validation app? This is a deal-breaker because we may have to restrict the use of FireFox unless we can find a mean for making this work.
