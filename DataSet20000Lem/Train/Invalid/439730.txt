Characters, including an ellipsis, sigma, tilde, all the letter of the greek alphabet, the trademark symbol, and pretty much every character after and including &#8465; won't render when used in part of the browser, ie., the tab (with the exception of sigma), the Page Name bar, the interface (including the menus). However, all of said character render correctly a part of a web page.
