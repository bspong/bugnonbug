Reload with Proxy doesn't update the content of the webpage. This occurs
especially with site having the following properties:
1) Site ha frames.
2) URL in address bar remains the same.

Examples:
http://www.doom9.org
http://forum.doom9.org and all other forum site using a similar system.

In rare occasions, the webpage get completely garbled. Only resolution is to
clean the cache. Afterwards, still old content.



Reproducible: Always

2. After content change, visit webpage. Press reload.
3.

Actual Results:
Webpage content is not updated.

Found a similar bug description for Mozilla1.0, though not specific for site
with frames.
