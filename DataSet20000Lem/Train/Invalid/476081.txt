If you specify an bold font such a "font-family:'Arial Bold'" or "font-family:'Bitstream Vera Serif Bold'" you get the plain version instead. You have to add 'font-weight:bold' to get the bold fonts.
DARN IT. If I specify 'Arial Bold' then I effin want 'Arial Bold', not Arial. I know yall are doing the 'right thing', but it still annoying.

BTW, I came across this by trying your @font-face example. It us 'Bitstream Vera Serif Bold', and it wasn't working and wasn't working and I wa getting more and more frustrated.
