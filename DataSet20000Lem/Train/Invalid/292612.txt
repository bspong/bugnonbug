When using the GNOME file dialog to choose a "helper application", you can't type a program name

When using the GNOME to choose a "helper application" (e.g. you want to open
PDFs with XPDF), you can't type a program name in. This mean you have to use
the little command-buttons to browse to /usr/bin, and then wait for it to list
the entire content of /usr/bin in the listbox (takes ages), and find the
application you want in that list.

Even using the / key to search within the textbox give a long delay a the
content of /usr/bin are listed to give data to an "autocomplete" function.
