On some special pages, phoenix crash when doubleclicking on any link in the
document, when it's loaded via the --chrome option.

This is not working with all documents, but some special one within our
intranet-webserver. Those document heavily rely on frame an javascript, and have
onmouseover handler on most links.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
[ this only seems to work with some, special pages, not with all. But within these pages,
it work always, on linux a well a on window ]
1. ./phoenix --chrome http://ourserver/document.html
2. <doubleclick on some link in the document >

Actual Results:
Phoenix crashes.
It feel like (on windows) phoenix crash instantly, during the 2nd click of the
doubleclick. ondblclick doesn't get processed too. But when I click slowly, that no
dblclick get generated, nothing happens.

Expected Results:
Open the page normaly.
