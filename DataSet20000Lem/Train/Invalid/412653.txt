STR:
1. Go to History | Show All History
2. Select an individual history entry and observe the UI.

Expected: I would see something other than light blue that indicates the entire area is greyed out and I cannot enter information in there. Maybe this is a work in progress, not sure. Also, on Mac that area of the UI is white and not blue.
