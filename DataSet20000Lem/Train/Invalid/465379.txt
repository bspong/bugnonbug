Something funny is going on here, because it look like a hardware or driver problem, but only mozilla application have been affected, and that, to me, look fishy. My disk ha passed numerous low level diagnostics, and no file outside a firefox or thunderbird profile directory have had any "chkdsk" error messages, ever. I even started over with a new profile, after moving my old profile to a non-standard (unfindable by firefox or thunderbird) location.

This error message pop up in the window system tray. No side effect have ever been observed by me. The localstore.rdf and sessionstore.js file have been consistently readable by me.

"localstore.rdf" is by far the most common error message, and both the minefield and thunderbird profile directory have come up with the error message.

Both release and alpha version (firefox and minefield) have exhibited this error, and it's only happened with version 3.x. I never reported it before because I thought it wa a hardware or driver problem. It may still be, of course, but I have become suspicious of firefox. Thunderbird's localstore.rdf never did it to me before today, but it's so inconsistent and rare that it's hard to say that it's a new problem with thunderbird.


Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use firefox or thunderbird for several week
2. maybe you'll be asked to run a chkdsk
3. maybe chkdsk will say it did some trivial fix, but usually it won't find anything wrong.




I think I will try switching to my backup disk this weekend, and see if this ever happens again.

I'm interested to know if someone can think of a reason that these file would be "special" in some way that cause error in other software or hardware component to manifest.

I may have forgotten one other file from the mozilla program directory that ha appeared in the same error message. I'll update the bug if it happens again.

Other program I can think of that could be accessing these file are Avast! anti-virus and google desktop search. Windows XP content indexing is turned off.
