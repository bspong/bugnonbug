Firefox randomly deletes saved password in random interval (several days)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; de; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 Ubiquity/0.1.4

In irregular intervals, Firefox somehow deletes saved passwords. I have about 100 password in my saved password (as long a Firefox doesn't delete half of them). In the beginning, I thought it only happened when Firefox wa closed via Kill Process, but now, it also happens while surfing, without even exiting Firefox!
I also tried disabling all addons, but it did not solve the problem. Just for the record, I attached a list of addons unter "Additional Information"

I already installed Xmarks to keep the problem not-so-bad, a I am able to restore my password to a previous state, but this is not how it should be, really!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf the Web
2. Wonder where your password went
3. Curse and restore a backup
Actual Results:
Some of my password are gone. Strangely, it mostly affect the site I visit often (GMail, Facebook, etc.), and le frequently the site I rarely use, but this may just be my perception.

Expected Results:
Well it should have kept my passwords, of couse.
