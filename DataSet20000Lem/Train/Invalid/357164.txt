When pressing the up down left right arrows, the page doe not scroll a expected on the HP Compaq NC6000. Rather it appears that there is a cursor floating in the webpage that is being manipulated by the cursors. Only when the cursor move to the top or bottom of the viewable window will the window start to scroll. This only work when i click on the page and place the "cursor" on the page. if i do nothing, then the page sometimes doesn't even scroll.

I have a desktop machine and a Dell laptop and both work fine using the arrow for navigation.
