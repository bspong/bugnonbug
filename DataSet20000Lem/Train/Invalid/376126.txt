There should be a customize menu button since finding the right spot to right click to bring it up is a pain sometimes, for example if you are relaxing and don't want to be bothered with hunting for a spot to right click. The way I have my menu set up I have to move my mouse all the way up or click in between the bookmark and tab which is annoying sometimes since I miss and sometimes I am laying back in my seat and don't want to have to get up to scroll all the way up.
