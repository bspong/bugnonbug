I tried to add the forecast option but it didn't finish adding; instead there is a popup window every time I open Firefox.

The popup window say "Forecastfox Options." I can't do anything with it, nothing I tell it registers. It just always pop up. I want to get rid of it. It's clear I'm not going to be able to add that forecast option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I haven't tried to reproduce it. It just come up. If just once it didn't come up, I would be happy and not bother you any more.


Actual Results:
It got on my system after I clicked whatever that wa to add the forecast.

Expected Results:
I expected to be able to dialog with the popup window but nothing I told it registered. The popup window pop up every time I open Foxfire.
