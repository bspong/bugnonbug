Some of the javascript date method in Firefox are a bit... off.

I found this under Firefox 3.0.10 in Windows Vista Home Premium and Ubuntu 9.04.

Add-ons: (still happens after disabling them)
Adblock Plus
DownloadHelper
Firebug
Forecastbar Enhanced
FoxyProxy
Malware Search
Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant (Vista only)
NoScript
User Agent Switcher

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to web page http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~swaneybr/date.html since I don't think I can post javascript here.
2. Debug.
3. Tell me it's a problem with my script or it otherwise can't be reproduced or something along those lines.
Actual Results:
Displayed the following (code on web page):

Internet Explorer seems to share some of this, but not all of it.
