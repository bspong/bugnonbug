Livemarks don't automatically update.
Gavin requested I file this instead of reopening bug 419832. It probably should have been bug 419885 that got reopened (which wa supposedly fixed by bug 390505. Anyway, livemarks are not refreshing automatically.

Feeds aren't automatically updating with latest nightly builds. However, I just grabbed a build on Windows (20080308) for the day after the fix went in to bug 419832. (20080307) It doesn't work a you might expect there either.
