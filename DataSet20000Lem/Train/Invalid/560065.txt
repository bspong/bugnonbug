Firefox 3.6.3 crash casually with NoScript 1.9.9.63.

When Firefox chrashes, other program chrashes too. The task manager is not able to end that programs. I must log out of Windows to correct the error. This is not a hardware crash. The error occurs when working with multiple program windows. I uninstalled NoScript to find the error.

Reproducible: Sometimes
