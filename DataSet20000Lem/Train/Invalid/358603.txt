This ha happened twice to me now and is very annoying.
When I am re-organising my bookmark in bookmark manager, I drag and drop a folder in the right hand pane to a new location. But this deletes another folder ? I have just lost all my development links, over 40 links. It ha just happened again when the single item I wa moving, ha overwritten the Quick link Folder of links. ???

Can you please fully test this it should never delete an item !!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start bookmark manager
2. start re-organising your item
3. crap !!!
