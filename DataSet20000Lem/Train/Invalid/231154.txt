Back to the old day when browsing experience wa done in only one window, it
wa linear, so wa history, no problem.
Now in modern browsers, tab browsing is done in a TREE fashion :
- each page is a node
- the "back" page is the page's parent
- the "forward" page is the child's parent
- each "open link in new tab" is a child's page
- each "open a new tab" is a root's child
Each node should be timestamped so that the user can choose to browse the
history in the "tree view" or in "time view".
