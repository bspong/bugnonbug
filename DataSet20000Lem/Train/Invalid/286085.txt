stealpw.exe trojan installed with firefox ver 1.0.1

Today (14 Mar 2005) used the link on Firefox homepage to install the setup
1.0.1.exe ver (4.59MB download, file version 3,12,0,0.) After the install
symantic detected pwsteal trojan. I do not have AOL installed. I use earthlink
ISP. But after instructing Symantic to quarantine the trojan, no trace of it is
in the quarantine file within the symantic systemworks 2001 Norton antivirus
section (looked there to cite where exactly the trojan wa detected in Windows
folder after the Firefox install.)

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:
Updated to ver 1.0.1 Firefox browser, and not installed virus nor trojan in
the process.

In the reboot after the Firefox Setup 1.0.1.exe Symantic detected the PWsteal
trojan. I selected "Q" for quarantine and continued with the reboot process.
Using the Firefox homepage
(http://www.google.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)
then the link (http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html) there on to
report the bug and getting time out in the Support
(http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/) and the FAQ
(http://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/faq) links; I went through Mozilla/
bugzilla to document the pwsteal found in the ver1.0.1 update.
