display issue with stackoverflow.com search result
I wa searching on stackoverflow.com.
I'm using firefox 6.0.2 on linux x86-64.

http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=[windows]+define+for+os+specific+code&submit=search

If I search for 'c++ define for building on windows', the result do not show up. I get the search box, and the widget for showing how many page of result are available. The source for the page show result are there, they are not just showing up.

It doesn't happen with all search results. If I search for just '[windows]' or '[linux]' then I see results. I haven't yet discovered what make it fail, but it ha something to do with the search box that sometimes appears just above the search results.
