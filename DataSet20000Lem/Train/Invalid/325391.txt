Possible memory leak with extended browsing - maybe MySpace?

Over an extended browing session (several hours) I am getting consistent error message combined with heavt memory usage. The error message I get is "The procedure entry point ?Alloc@nsMemory@@SAPAXI@Z could not be located in the dynamic link library xpcom.dll" along with a current memory usage of 89K and climbing.

I can't say if there wa a specific event that caused the problem. I wa browsing MySpace.com when the error started popping up on almost every page view. I've only got two tab open but I *have* been listening to streaming audio via the Flash player on MySpace URLs over the last two hours.

Just seems that opening and closing tab over an extended period of time, paging back and forth, and utilizing various streaming technology ha caused a leak somewhere.

Closing Firefox and reopening get me back to square one with low memory usage.

Reproducible: Didn't try
