Windows XP, all patch current. This problem much le in Firebird 0.61. When
opening several instance and several tab in each instance, the response would
become slow in Firebird 0.61. Soon after all instance would crash. In Firebird
0.7, this crashing happens sooner.

It would be great if instance were completely separate from each other.

It seems sensible to increase the stack space to allow 40 instance with 10 tab
each.

I am often asked to research numerous subjects. Each subject becomes a Firebird
instance. Each tab is some information found on the subject. The number of
subject can easily reach 40 before I have finished some and can close them.
