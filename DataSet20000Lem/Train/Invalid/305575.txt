I set the home page for the latest Der Park Alpha 2 to a Google search result
page. Subsequently, any new browser window opened with a (static) set of saved
tabs. Mind you, the tab were not necessarily related to the Google search, they
just happened to be open when I set the new home page. The only way to get rid
of the unwanted tab wa to reset the home page through tools/opetions again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open up some tab
2. conduct a google search in oen of the tab
3. set the Google result a new home page in tools/options
4. press Ctrl+N to start a new window

Actual Results:
the new browser window ha a set of tab open

Expected Results:
the new browser window should have started with only one tab, containing the
home page
