If you go to this site, there is an area on the left where a video highlight reel can be selected to play.

Do so, and a small progress diagram appears. Also, a missing plugin drop down from firefox appears. Dismiss this.

Then click the big play button graphic in the video window.

The screen where the video would play go white. Also firefox seems frozen, a it screen won't redraw, and no button or menu in it interface work. I think it is at least related to the flash plugin, since it doesn't happen if I disable the flash plugin. But when you disable flash, you don't progress to the point to try playing the video.

I have a flash plugin installed. It is the only plugin I have.
libflashplayer.so
Shockwave Flash 9.0 r115

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go the site
2.Click to choose to play a video. A big play button should appear in the area where the video should play.
3.Click this.
Actual Results:
Firefox lock up.

Expected Results:
It should not lock up. I don't really care if it doesn't play the video (I don't expect it should, since I didn't install the plugin.)
