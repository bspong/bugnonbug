On the http://www.amazon.com homepage, on the upper right corner there is a drop down lisr labelled 'Whis List'. Only often (and I dont know why) the drop down list will not appear.

Also, when you log in and go to 'your recommendations', you should be able to select 'not interested' 'I own it', or provide a rating for the recommended item. These setting do not always get set/saved either.

Im not sure if they are related though.

Both issue work fine in Mozilla 3.0 and Internet Explorer 8, but often fail (but not always) with Mozilla 3.5.1

Sorry that im not very technical, a I cant tell if it javascript or something else that is failing or what not.

1. Go to http://www.amazon.com
