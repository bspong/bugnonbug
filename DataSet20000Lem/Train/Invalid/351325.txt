new theme doesn't adapt to color scheme of the desktop environment
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 BonEcho/2.0b2 (Debian-1.99+2.0b2+dfsg-1)

The new theme doesn't adapt to the color scheme of the desktop environment in several areas:

- The tab section (bug #348975 cover this, but not the other areas)
- The navigation button when highlighted
- The border of the widget with the screen rectangle beneath the URL input widget
- The border around the search engine input widget

See the screenshot I attached.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use GNOME or KDE and select a different desktop color scheme.
2. Start firefox
3. Look at the tab bar and the border of said widget
4. Hover over a navigation button and look at it.

Actual Results:
Colors that do not match desktop color theme and thus look ugly.

Expected Results:
Colors that match the desktop color theme or transparency through to the color of the desktop color theme.
