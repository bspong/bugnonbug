FQDN .uz domain resolve in DNS but http://uz/ redirects to http://www.uz.com/
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; rv:6.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.1
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

I followed link to http://uz/ and I also typed in the same thing into the location bar.


Actual results:

Firefox redirects to http://www.uz.com/ in each situation. Internet Explorer seems to be confused, too.


Expected results:

This is a bug in which I purposely want to view a website that ha no trailing TLD (top-level domain) because uz is a TLD. What is unusual about uz is the fact that it resolve and most TLD's do not. For example, the uk domain doe not resolve to an "A" record, nor doe com. The browser should respect the fact that a TLD can and sometimes doe resolve to a host address. The browser is using internal checking to out-think the user and by doing so, it is assuming something that is not correct.

The DNS query to the FQDN "uz." works, and it resolve to 91.212.89.8. This IP address ha a port 80 web server that host the website for http://uz/ -- Incidentally, there appears to be a http://www.uz/ also, resolving to a different IP address.

Please compare the http://91.212.89.8/ with what happens with http://uz/ ... I believe that this wa working fine in an older version of Firefox, perhaps a recent a 3.x?
