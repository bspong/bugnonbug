When adding Live Bookmark manually(File -> New Live Bookmark... in Bookmarks
Manager), it only provides the URL to be filled in a FEEDURL attribute in
bookmarks.html.
However, it make Live Bookmark empty in Location column in Bookmark Manager due
to the lack of URL attribute.
Besides, this make the Live Bookmark couldn't be imported to Mozilla a link
for backwards-compatibility.
I hope the <link> element inside feed could be filled automatically when adding
Live Bookmark in order to fix the above issues.
