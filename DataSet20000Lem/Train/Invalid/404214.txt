Allow dragging of bookmark folder on the bookmark bar by holding cmd
In a bunch of Mac application (Adium is one of them) by holding command and dragging you can perform some other sort of drag action.

In this case, it would allow you to drag around folder of bookmark on the bookmark bar. IIRC this wa one of the most common complaint I got when I asked for feedback from folk about Firefox 2 on the Mac on my blog.

Not sure if this is the right component (maybe toolbars?)
