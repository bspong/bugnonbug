When using the trunk build normally, sometimes, there is a hang for a moment, then a beep or two, then the stop script dialog come up. I don't know why, but it come up for no reason whatsoever. It may have been a j error, but just in case, here is the latest error I copied from the JavaScript console:'

Error: Components.classes['@mozilla.org/uriloader/content-handler;1?type=application/x-maf'] ha no property
