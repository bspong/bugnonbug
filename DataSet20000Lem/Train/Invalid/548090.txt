When new tab are opened, rather than going to the end (far right) of the list a before, they now open just to the right of the current tab. This may not even be a "problem," but just a different choice imposed on u by the new version, but having an option would be nice. This ha only occurred since I downloaded the latest version of FireFox last week. Not a serious problem, but annoying.


Reproducible: Always
