Build date is wrong on user agent string and in about:
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

It say the build date is 2008052906 but I got Firefox 3 today and it should be 2008061015!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get Firefox 3 RC 3

3. Type about: in the address bar
Actual Results:
I got the User Agent String Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0 and it should not be that date.

Expected Results:
It should have said 2008061015.
