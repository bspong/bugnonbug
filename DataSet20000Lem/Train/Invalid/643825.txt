The part of a bookmark folder which cover Windows taskbar remains after closing.

Some of my bookmark folder have enough entry that they extend to the bottom of the screen. If I open one of those and then close it, the "Open all in tabs" and part of the line above it remain on the Windows taskbar. Minor but annoying.

Reproducible: Always
