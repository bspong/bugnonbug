Not sure this started with version 2.0.0.2, happens only on some machines, but is always reproducible.

refresh meta stopped to work. For instance <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=targetPage.html"> doe not have any result.

For instance, going to http://microsoft.com/vista doesn't work at first. If you hit the refresh button, then, it work and continue to do so on subsequent visits.

I don't know how to narrow the field of search but I'm willing to help.

Reproducible: Always
