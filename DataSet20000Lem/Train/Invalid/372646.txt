Location bar annoyingly appends ".net" to well-formed URLs

If you go too quickly, 1 time out of 10, the address bar will randomly append ".net" to the end of URLs entered in by hand. I can't tell you how many time in the last year I've ended up at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article.net because of this glitch.

Reproduceable in ff 1-2.0.2

This bug ha been around for ages, but I'd always assumed it would be obvious enough to be noted. Apologies if it doe turn out to be a dupe, but, surprisingly, I couldn't find reference to it.

Reproducible: Sometimes
