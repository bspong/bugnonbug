page scrolling (up/down) is broken
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030507

If typing either the page up/down key or hitting the grey area around the
scrollbar slider with the mouse, the page advance several times, making these
feature unusable for page scrolling. It seems that smooth scrolling (which
work a intended for the arrows) is also applied for these elements, which, in the
view of usability, make no sense at all and therefore is just wrong.
This is very visible for user and should be repaired soon.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load a longer page
2.type either the page down key or click into the grey area below the slider
Actual Results:
watch the page flying by, unable to use page up/down for paging document

Expected Results:
Document should scroll up and down page one by one to be useful at all.
Don not apply smooth scrolling for page up/down.

This may not be a smooth scrolling problem only, a Mozilla 1.4x ha the similar
problem for the scrollbar area (often scroll two page instead of one, but
page up-down key work).
