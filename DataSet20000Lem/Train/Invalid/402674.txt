title text in url bar autocomplete result should be grey (#555566)

We currently have cs rule to make the "title" column in url bar autocomplete appear grey:

.autocomplete-treebody::-moz-tree-cell-text(treecolAutoCompleteComment) {
color: #555566;
}

my fix for bug #399664 regressed this (but it ha been backed out.)

but I need to fix this before I re-land.
