New fedora 11 install which come with 3.5b4, but the problem also happens on RC1 and RC2.
If I open 3-4 tab one right after the other, the computer freezes.
If I open just 1 youtube/flash video de computer freezes...
THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN on 3.0.11 - Fedora 11, so it is not the hardware or Fedora 11.
