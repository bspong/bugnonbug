SVG support seems to be totally missing

I use Batik to build an SVG file but when I open the file in Firefox, it prompt me for an application to handle it, then creates a blank tab with nothing rendered. The Adobe SVG plugin in IE render the file ok. Assuming my generated file is corrupt in some way, I tried several of the example svg file from the Batik distribution, all of which render and function normally in IE. None of those work in Firefox and what's worse, Firefox prompt me over and over for an application to handle the content. Each time I select Firefox, it open a new tab and prompt me again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.If you have Batik, try opening any of the example file in the lib/examples folder.
2.Observe that multiple blank tab are opened and no image are ever rendered.
3.Try the same thing in Internet Explorer with the Adobe SVG plugin installed and it works.
Actual Results:
Blank tabs, no rendering.

Expected Results:
Don't prompt for an application to handle the content, it's supposed to be built in.

I tried to include the file I produced using Batik, which render in IE ok, but got an error because it's too big for Bugzilla I guess, so here's the header part, maybe you'll be able to see something about this that's not working. If not, try some of the Batik example from the Apache Batik project.
