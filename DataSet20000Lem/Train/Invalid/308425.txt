In page http://www.headscratchers.com/headscratchers_elements.html, the graphic
picture under PART 1, and PART 2 don't display in Firefox, but do in IE. These
page were built with Yahoo Sitebuilder. They are HTML block that have HTML
inserted. I build the graphic in Powerpoint, cut and pasted them in word,
saved the file a HTML. It display OK in Word and IE, however not in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just Load page http://www.headscratchers.com/headscratchers_elements.html
2. Do it in Firefox, and Do it in IE. The result are obvious
3.

Actual Results:
IE display correctly, Firefox doesn't.

Expected Results:
Displayed like IE. I'm don't know HTML, so it maybe that IE is messed up and it
somehow works, or Yahoo Sitebuilder is IE specific. However if Firefox is
going to win market share, it need capatability.
