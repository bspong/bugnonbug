make fails due to dependency of libglib on libintl.so.5

Firefox wa running on my pc and during a port upgrade libintl.so.5
disappeared. Don't know why but thereafter Firefox would not start at all.
After trying to reinstall Firefox (which also failed for the same reason)
eventually created a symbolic link called libintl.so.5 which pointed to
libintl.so.6. Thereafter it compiles and runs.

Thought this might be a useful workaround for anyone with the same problem.
