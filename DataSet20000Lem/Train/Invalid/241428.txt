If multiple tab are open and I make any tab other than the first tab active,
when I use the "Use Current Page" function (Tools/Options/General/Use Current
Page(s)) to make the currently active tab the new home page, the FIRST tab
loaded is the URL that is used.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox and open a few different site in different tab
2.Make any tab other that the first tab loaded active
3.Click Tools/Options/General/Use Current Page(s)
4.The URL for the first loaded tab will appear instead of the URL for the active
tab.

Actual Results:
The URL for the first loaded tab will appear instead of the URL for the active tab.

Expected Results:
The URL for the active tab should have been loaded.

This work correctly in Mozilla 1.7rc1 on Linux.
