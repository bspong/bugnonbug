I have no network or internet connection.
If I open the attached html file and scroll a bit, FF lock hard itself and
X-Windows. Mouse cursor can be moved, but mouse button have no reactions.
Keyboard reacts only to MagicSysRq Keys ;-(
Locking happens quite soon after opening a file, sometimes in a second,
sometimes in a couple.

I tried to go in offline mode, and also set netwotk.online to false.
It make no difference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save the attached file to local disk.
2. Pull the network cable
3. Open the file with FF and wait a bit

Actual Results:
FF/X-Windows freezes.

Expected Results:
I should be able to open local file whether network available or not.
If some element of file cannot be displayed, FF should display an error for
this parts.
