Allpeers extension asks for the master security password when Mozilla starts. It won't start if I do not enter the Master security password. I would not want to share my browser's master security password with any extension / plug in.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a Master security software for your browser.
2. Install Allpeers extension.
3. re-start Mozilla
Actual Results:
you will be prompted to key in you master security password. the dialog box will also state that the Allpeers extention is asking this info.

Expected Results:
Allpeers should either set up a separate password or not ask for it at all. Allpeers password should have nothing to do with the browser's master security password.
