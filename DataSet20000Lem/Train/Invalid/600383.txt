Once I've been in Russia. There you pay internet depending on the bandwith you
use (an amount of data). It's not just like in US or in Europe where you pay
for an amount of time.
Every one there disable images, ..., everything they can. Updating/Upgrading
ha a cost there. Checking for update too (even if it is a smaller). So no-one
ha up-to-day software and no-one wished to update/upgrade.
So, not implementing the auto-download of updates/upgrades when avaible is
important for firefox market penetration and development.
I know about Russia, but I think that some similar case could happen in
developing countries.

Reproducible: Always
