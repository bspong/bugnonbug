The drop down menu (such a Hardware Platform, Operating System on the bug submit page) show only an empty white box. In the stable version it show the proper text in what is now a white area (which for my hardware is Apple and my OS is OSX).

Reproducible: Always

1. Go to a webpage with drop down menu
2. Look at them
Actual Results:
You will see a blank drop down menu but when you click on it you will see the proper options.

Expected Results:
You will see whatever your selected option are.
