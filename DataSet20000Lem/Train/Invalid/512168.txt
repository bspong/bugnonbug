When doing a Tools -> Clear Recent History and selecting Everything, Firefox also clear out the list of site that I have added to exception in my "accept cooky from list." Older version of Firefox (the 3.0 series) did not do this. It is annoying because I want to clear the cooky set by those sites, but not remove those site a exceptions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools -> Options -> Privacy uncheck "Accept cooky from sites"
2. Click Exceptions, add one or more site to list. Confirm/Close all open dialogs.
3. Tools -> Clear Recent History -> Everything -> Clear Now
4. Observe a the Exceptions list just created is clear.
Actual Results:
Removed my exceptions.

Expected Results:
Keep exceptions, but delete the cookies.
