Switching from remote logon to direct logon cause machine crash
Firefox 1 and Thunderbird with latest downloads from your site.
Client Machine-Sony Vaio VGN A290, XP SP2 Dual monitor
Host machine MSI Bookshelf, XP SP2
Belkin KVM
100 mb ethernet, m firewall and symantec av on all machine
Host machine running Direcway v 4.2.1

I wa running Firefox and Thunderbird on the host remotely using a remote
desktop connection from the client machine. There were two logons on the
host....an administrator running the direcway navigator and domino server v
6.5.2 and the remote connection with user client privelege.

I switched the monitor and kb to the host for a direct logon without
disconnecting the remote session. I do this all the time without incident.

Strange thing happened.....several error message a the host shutdown and
rebooted.

I wa not able to get the host to run after this until I restored to a date
before firefox and thunderbird were loaded.

Before the restore the host would just randoomly halt and reboot.

Nornally I would reproduce this several time before reporting, but this is just
too scary.....I have run in this configuration for several month without a
problem. The host is a stable machine that ha run flawlessly for over 3 years.
It seems to be running ok now that firefox and thunderbird have been removed and
the system restored.
