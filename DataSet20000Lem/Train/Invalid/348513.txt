Had to recycle my DSL router. When FireFox reloaded it wa a NEW verion of 1.5.0.6 and the bookmark were GONE!! Nadda--zip--nothing!! Then it ha changed the text size to something to small to read! When I increase the text size it doe not remember it the next time I open FireFox.

The brower seems to work but IT AIN'T what I had and it AIN'T what I want!!
