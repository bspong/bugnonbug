Unable to delete any existing username for a site

Build Identifier: All version of Firefox

When entering a site, Firefox will remember the username & password. If you want to 'delete' the password, that is good - it works. If you want to delete the username then forget it. There is no way to do that. Really screw up when I delete an existing username and replace it with a new one at a particular site - firefox forever remembers the 'old' username.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to site - create username, password
2. Tell Firefox to 'remember'
3. Go to site again, delete username
4. Go to site again, create new username
5. There is no way to remove the old username from firefox, he will forever use the old one




On delete 'password' have option to delete 'Username'
