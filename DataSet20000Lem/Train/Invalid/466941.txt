I have installed the Forecastfox addon yesterday. Everything wa OK. Down on the status bar wa forecast for Today, Thursday and Friday. I do not shout down my PC during the week. Today I came to work and there is still Today, Thursday and Friday. I guess the day should change to Today, Friday and Saturday.
I have closed all the Firefox windows, I have restarted my PC and nothing ha changed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Forecastfox addon. Check the day on the status bar.
2.Wait till next day. Check the day on the status bar.
3.Days ha not changed, there is the same forecast a previous day.
Actual Results:
I see bad structure of the days. I see Today, Thursday and Friday, but today is Friday. That is not correct.

Expected Results:
The day will be changing every day.
