When I have several tab open on Firefox 4 and use the Roboform icon on the tray, the Roboform dialog box appears on the first tab opened instead of the current tab. I will see it only when I go to the first tab. The latest version of Roboform (7.2.8) is installed.

I have no problem when using the Roboform toolbar.


I will also report this to Roboform.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open more than one tab in firefox 4.
2. Try to access Roboform from the tray in a tab other than the first tab opened.
3.If I don't want to disturb the first tab, I would have to open the Roboform Toolbar to access Roboform or open another window.
Actual Results:
Roboform only open in the first tab opened. If the first tab is closed and I try again it will appear only in the next tab opened after the first and not the current.

Expected Results:
Roboform should open in whatever is the current tab.
