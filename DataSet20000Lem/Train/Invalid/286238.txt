Although not being a programmer I keep the website of my wife updated by editing
the html. Recently my friend urge me to switch from IE to Firefox, which I am
doing. Now I found that our website is not correctly displayed.

In the page at: http://henri.bik.free.fr/ the Title Welcome on top is blinking,
which it should not do. the same go for
http://henri.bik.free.fr/Cattery%20Galitsija.htm
http://henri.bik.free.fr/nederlands.htm , http://henri.bik.free.fr/engels.htm ,
http://henri.bik.free.fr/frans.htm and http://henri.bik.free.fr/spaans.htm

In all other page the title is shown too far to the left.

page: http://henri.bik.free.fr/De%20Poezen.htm is mixed up, apparently resizing
the picture doe not work properly, the same go for
http://henri.bik.free.fr/kleokit22dec04b.htm

I have read some of your information on possible cause of rendering page
different from MS IE. Allthough not a programmer I grasp that poking around in
the html code , which wa originally made by somebody else, in a trial end error
way I have probably messed up the standards. Apparently firefox is more strict
than MS IE.
However a firefox is getting more and more popular , it is important for u to
adhere to the standards, so a to be properly displayed to firefox users.

I wonder if you can help me, if necessary I can send you the html pages.

Kind regard from the Bik family
