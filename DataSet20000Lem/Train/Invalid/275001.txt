on home page ~gapitts click on "gapitts page2". In Firefox I get 4 month old page
from earthlink even with additional ftp of new copy and reload command (the page
is missing "click here for gary life story" line. Same click on same home
page using mozilla browser get correct page2. I note that the "~" is replaced
by %7E
in both browser display of page2 address. If I replace the %7E with ~ in
the displayed page2 address in firefox and reload, I get the correct current page2.

mozilla is my default browser.

Reproducible: Always

1.open http://home.teleport.com/~gapitts with the mozilla browser
2.click on "gapitts page2" and note line "click here for gary life story"

3.open http://home.teleport.com/~gapitts with Firefox browser
4.click on "gapitts page2" and note that "click here for gary life story"
is missing
5.change http://home.teleport.com/%7Egapitts/page2.html to have ~ in place of
the %7E and click reload. note you now have current corect pag2


Actual Results:
