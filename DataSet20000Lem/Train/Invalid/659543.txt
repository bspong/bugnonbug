Hello,

My option are set not to allow the 3 available Javascript wrongdoings.

I wa on this video page:
www.dailymotion.com/video/xfo010_mylene-farmer-oui-maisy-non-clip-officiel_music

I wa curious about the new "Export" feature, so I clicked on Export at the top-right of the video, and I chose "link". The link wa copied without asking for my agreeing — I wa not OK. This is not correct. I lost what I had kept in my clipboard for later use.

A page must not have the right to write to user's clipboard. The clipboard is system-wide and belongs to the user, not to the page.

Or at least a an option, off by default, or — same idea — after the browser ha asked the user and received a yes.
