choosing "Manage Add-ons" from the Preferences window should re-use an existing Add-ons manager tab
If a tab showing about:addons is already open, it should be switched to when clicking the "Manage Add-ons" button in the Preferences window, rather than opening a second one. This would make it consistent with the Tools > Add-ons menu item.
