History folder child often duplicated, resulting in bug-like behavior elsewhere
History folder in the sidebar are displayed with unique child only - duplicate child are filtered out in the view. However, during copy/paste transaction (which will be enabled by the fix for Bug 378558), the node's duplicate child aren't filtered out, and 'collapse duplicate' code shouldn't be put in the main copy/paste code.
