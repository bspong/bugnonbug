Not long ago, I tried asking how to fix the tab movement feature a it wa too sensitive and would move my tab to a new window, but all I got wa that my problem wa "already posted" by someone who had a problem, but when I read the comment that may have said how to fix it, the computer lingo wa so thick I couldn't understand a word of it. So now, only more confused, I would like to know how to COMPLETELY remove this feature off of Firefox. It ha been totally useless and ha only annoyed me. How do I get rid of it? And PLEASE don't go into computer lingo, please tell me how a if I never used a computer.
