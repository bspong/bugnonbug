Minefield name instead of Firefox name in the default program window

I removed all FF or minefield from my computer.
I installed FF 3.6 and it ha been declared a my default browser. That wa the case and it wa present in the default program window : it wa associated to 5 extension and 3 protocols.
When I installed 32-bit Minefield, I didn't declare it a my default browser.
FF 3.6 is still my default browser, but in the default program window, the Firefox name is replaced by the Minefield one. The logo is still the Firefox one.

For me, it is a different bug from 568849 a it is about 32-bit version.

Reproducible: Always
