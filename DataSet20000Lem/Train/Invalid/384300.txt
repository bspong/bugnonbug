I like to use quicksearch to google around example i write in the url g something.
In latest trunk the g shortcut is included in example:

http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=g+something

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the url bar type g something
2. google will load with this url http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=g+something
3. You can see that is searching for g something
Actual Results:
google is searching for g something

http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=g+something

Expected Results:
google should search for something

http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=navclient&gfns=1&q=something

I can reproduce this with a clean profile and in safemode too.
