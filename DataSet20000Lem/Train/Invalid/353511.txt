In the bookmark menu (drop down menu with the bookmark listed) in the down scroll area only one or two line of pixel cause the menu to scroll.

I have a long list of bookmarks. When I place the mouse at the bottom of the menu I have to move it into a very finite spot to get the menu to scroll down. It appears that this "window" (which recognizes the mouse hovering to cause the bookmark to scroll down) is the correct width but is not the correct height.

This appears on my home computer with Windows XP and on my work computer with Windows 2000.

I would fix it if I only knew how :(

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a long list of bookmark (longer than your computer screen)
2.attempt to use the down arrow of the bookmark menu to scroll and show bookmark that are not on the screen.
3.You will notice that the mouse ha to be in a very, very small area for it to work or you will have to move the mouse back and forth across "button" and the bookmark to scroll down.
4. The up arrow doesn't have this problem.



Expected Results:
One should be able to place thier mouse anywhere over the scroll down button in the bookmark menu and the menu should scroll down.
