When contacting the server server34.userfull.be (IP : 195.0.76.34), I got an
HTTP_Favorites_Icon_Overflow on my Firewall. This mean that an Favorite Icon
with uncorrect size is used. This is a known security breach in IE 5.0, but
since a few week I started using Firefox. Also my IE is 6.0 so I believe
Firefox caused this problem.
I am reluctant to reproduce the error since my PC got infected since then and
I've just been able to fix it again.
