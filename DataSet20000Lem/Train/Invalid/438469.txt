When I select Tools -> Clear Private Data and then both "Browsing History" and "Saved Form and Search History" and click "Clear Private Data Now," the typeahead history for page title is NOT cleared. Typeahead for URLs doe get cleared.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit some sites, noting the page title
2. Note that when you, for instance, type that first 'w' in the address bar, you get typeahead suggestion based on the page title a well a page URLs
3. Clear the heck out of your private data
4. Note that you STILL get typeahead suggestion based on page title (but no longer URLs).
Actual Results:
As noted in step 4.

Expected Results:
NO typeahead whatsoever immediately after clearing the private data.
