unable to use getRegistryEntry
'm trying to use getRegistryEntry from the winhooks object in Mozilla Firefox
but I cant seem to get it working.

In Mozilla 1.x the following code:
Code:
var x =
Components.classes["@mozilla.org/winhooks;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIWindowsRegistry);
alert(typeof(x.getRegistryEntry));
alert function

but the same thing in Mozilla Firefox say "undefined" or "TypeError:
Components.classes['@mozilla.org/winhooks;1'] ha no properties"

Isn't it possible to use getRegistryEntry in Mozilla Firefox?
