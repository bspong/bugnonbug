Almost every time I visit this page in Firefox 3.0, X11 unexpectedly crash while the page is loading. I have asked several colleague to reproduce this, and their machine are able to reproduce the crash. This did not occur in Firefox 2, and I have been able to access the page in a different browser.

This is a critical bug, because it ha the potential to cause data loss when X11 crashes.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aero/data/datafmt.html in Firefox 3
2.
3.
Actual Results:
X11 Crashes, and the session restarts.

Expected Results:
The page should have loaded properly, and not have caused X11 to crash.

X11 Log File Output (only the error):

Fatal server error:
Unknown GTT size value: ffffffff
