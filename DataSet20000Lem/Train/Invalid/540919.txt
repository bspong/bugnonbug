The find bar on the bottom (menu>edit>find) is hidden to the point it hard to use. See bottom of screenshot at http://www.dirtydetox.com/cutoff1.jpg

It just started today.

Reproducible: Always




This may be related to other bug I've reported.

I have quite a bit of security programs, but my network monitor show a tremendous volume of odd traffic, so it may be a hack problem.
