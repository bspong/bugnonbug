Unable to restore session when default homepage is changed

The option to "save and quit" is removed when closing multiple tabs, and the "restore previous sessions" button is only available in about:home . That mean user who don't use about:home a their homepage will somehow lose their ability to restore sessions, or at least they'll have to manually "restore" their session by looking through the history, which is extremely inconvenient.

My suggestion would be to show a notification show a notification from the left of the address bar (the location where the security info of a page is shown) to prompt a user whether to restore a session, and should consist of the following options:
X Restore previous session
X Do not restore
[ ] Always restore previous session for me
[ ] Never ask me again

When "Always restore previous session for me" is checked , the "do not restore" and "Never ask me again" button is grayed out. When "Never ask me again" is checked, the "Restore previous session" and "always restore" option should be grayed out. This feature would comply to Fx4's "no popup" strategy and give ALL user an easy way to restore their sessions.

Reproducible: Always
