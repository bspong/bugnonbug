When proxy are enabled and you want to bypass the proxy for local address you put that address in the No Proxy For text area. It work fine for domain name and full IP addresses. However when trying to bypass the proxy for a whole block of IP address it doe not work.

Trying to bypass the proxy for address 10.6.1.49 (and all other addresses) should be able to be achieved by entering 10.0.0.0/24 however this is not the case. Entering the full IP address of 10.6.1.49 will give the desired result for that address but not for the others.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Setup Proxies
2.Enter Subnet mask to be bypassed
3.
Actual Results:
The address supposedly being bypassed by the subnet mask were not being bypassed

Expected Results:
The address should be bypassed
