FireFox display the font set in advanced setting (TOOLS | OPTIONS | CONTENT | FONTS & COLORS | ADVANCED) when TOOLS | OPTIONS | CONTENT | FONTS & COLORS | ADVANCED | "Allow page to choose their own fonts" is checked (whereas, assumably, the checked option should cause FireFox to honor the font specified in the style sheet of the URL.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set font in advanced setting to a font different than specified in css.2.Check TOOLS | OPTIONS | CONTENT | FONTS & COLORS | ADVANCED | Allow page to choose their own fonts.3. Visit/refresh URL to find that cs font is not displayed; instead, the font specified in advanced setting is displayed.
Actual Results:
FireFox display in the font specified in TOOLS | OPTIONS | CONTENT | FONTS & COLORS | ADVANCED.

Expected Results:
Fonts specified in the style sheet of the URL should be displayed.

The assumed/desired functionality of course is the default behavior of IE. As failure to honor the cs of the site/URL is a *major* adversity to the effort of web developer (of course, there may be some error in the cited URLs), IMHO, fixing this flaw should multiply FF market share, because this issue (or lack of documentation on how to accomplish the desired support of css) constitutes a critical, major complaint against the otherwise very respectable functionality of FF.
