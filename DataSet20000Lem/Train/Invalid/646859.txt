Hello,

My operating system is Windows XP Professional , Version 5.1, SP3. The browser is Firefox 4.0, and the Cool Previews is version 3.2. The problem that happens is that when I activate the icon on the top quarter of a page the Cool Preview window flash open and closed and doe not load any info, the lower 3/4s of the page work fine. Also on some page the icon work fine then after moving to other page and back to the previously OK page the icon will not even appear, I must then deactivate and reactivate Cool Previews for the whole system, sometimes just for that page will work. These symptom have only occurred since I downloaded FireFox version 4. I don't know which program is the cause. This information ha also been sent to Cool Previews problem reports.
Thanks for your support on this.
