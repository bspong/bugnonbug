The symantec NAV package come with a popup blocker that redefines the window
object. It seems javascript errors, like using nonexistant variable or
unterminated strings, do not show up anymore inside the are bracketed by the NAV
scripts. Actually I have no idea whether it is NAV or version 1.1, I'm just
naming suspect

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.write a javascript with an error inside a webpage
2.load page while the NAV popup blocker is running
3.look in console

Actual Results:
No error from the webpage.
I wa using DTD HTML4.1 strict, if that make a difference

Expected Results:
give diagnostics for debugging
