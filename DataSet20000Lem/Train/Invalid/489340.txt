When dragging a tab up and then along the menu bar, when the tab is dragged over the bookmark menu the menu opens, none of the other menu open in this way when dragging a tab over them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open minefield with a new profile
2. drag the tab up to the file menu and then along towards the help menu
3. when passing over the bookmark menu the bookmark menu open


Expected Results:
As none of the other menu open in this way I would expect the bookmark menu to be consistent and remain closed.

This occurs whether you drag left to right (File --> Help) or right to left (Help <-- File)
