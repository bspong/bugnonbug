[Regression] selection of 'awesomebar' search hit is moving around randomly. "Switch to tab"?
Not always reproducible - there must be at least one more factor I don't know yet.

Reproduction:
1. Focus location bar, type a part of a URL you have recently loaded
(in my case, even a tab currently open)
2. Press "down" arrow key, to go into search result dropdown
3. press "up" and "down" arrow keys, to move between search result

Actual result:
The current selection jump to another item, usually 1-2 back back, i.e. while I go 3 up, it go 1-2 down, forcing me to press "up" 4-5 time instead of 3 times.

Expected result:
No selection changes. When I press "up", it selection move one up, and *stays* there.

Reason:
Wild guess: some async action is triggered when an item is selected, and when that finishes, the selection is changed, but at that time, I already moved on.
