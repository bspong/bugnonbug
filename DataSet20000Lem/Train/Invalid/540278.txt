Every time I try to use Firefox to start a game at pogo.com, a headless Zombie process is started instead. Note that Google Chrome and IE behave correctly.

This behavior began a couple of month ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to pogo.com.
2. Login.
3. Start a game.
Actual Results:
headless Firefox zombie process started

Expected Results:
Game launched just a in Google Chrome or IE
