Firefox 3.0: The path "Bookmarks->Bookmark This Page" yield an "Edit This Bookmark" dialog with a button to the right of the "Folder" field. Clicking that button should open a scrollable tree of existing bookmark folders. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn't, or (using iFox Smooth 3.01) the tree consists of folder icon without the names. Clicking an icon expose it name. The default theme sometimes show the tree immediately, but usually doesn't.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Firefox 3.0, click "Bookmarks" on the main menu.
2. In the pulldown menu that results, click "Bookmark This Page."
3. In the "Edit This Bookmark" dialog box that results, click the down-arrow button to the right of the field labeled "Folder".
Actual Results:
Depending on the theme used, (1) No bookmark-folder tree is exposed; (2) A folder tree with unlabeled folder is exposed; (3) The labeled folder tree is exposed (rare).

Expected Results:
The existing bookmark folder tree should be exposed for selection of a folder into which the bookmark should be filed.

This problem is new with Firefox 3.0.
