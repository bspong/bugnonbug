missing titlebar in all window

My titlebar and the rest of the border is missing from Firefox. I'm using WinXP SP2 and I just upgraded to FF 1.5, but wa experiencing this same problem with FF 1.07. It just started recently and had been working fine. I can't think of any setting or extension that I have changed/added/updated. This is perfectly consistent in FF, but no other application are affected. Any popup window are missing their titlebars also.
I have discovered that resizing the window in any way, including entering 'javascript:top.resizeTo(600,400)' at the locationbar, cause the titlebar/borders to show up.

Having one window open with titlebar visible (having resized the window) and starting a new instance of the browser doe not make the titlebar visible in the new instance.

I've checked my extension against the problematic extension list, I've searched the Mozillazine Knowledge Base, and found nothing on this.

I've tried loading FF in Safe Mode, and I get my titlebar back, but don't want to work in safemode forever.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, this is driving me nuts. I drag window around a lot between my two monitor and am at my wit's end.
