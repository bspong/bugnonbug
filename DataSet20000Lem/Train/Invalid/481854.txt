i hibernate my computer and rarely restart it (to it perspective) I noticed many old file for round of firefox sessions, mostly flash video files, but also many file wthat were directly opened from the internet.

Firefox should have exit handler that run even if Firefox crash unexpectedly that clean up these files. The only time they should be acceptable to remain is if Firefox wa killed with -9 SIGKILL.

Reproducible: Always




i just upgraded to 3.0.7, but wa using 3.0.6
