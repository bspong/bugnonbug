I wa testing switching development channels, and a I switched from Aurora to Beta, there wa a problem. When I clicked on the "Apply and Update" button, the update did not start.

After closing the about window and opening it again, it said it wa checking for update IIRC (but it might have said that there were no updates; I can't remember). However, nothing happened.

After closing the window and waiting for about half-an-hour, I opened it again and it checked for update and the download began.

Just now, I have tried to change back to Aurora, and the expected behaviour occurred, where the download began a soon a I clicked on the Apply and Update button.

Reproducible: Didn't try
