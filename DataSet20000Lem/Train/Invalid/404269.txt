Can't get rid of the closed tab list in the tab context menu and it is really damn annoying and slows computer speed. I tried from the tabmix option but that doesn't get rid of it since it's not the same a in the window context menu.

It's especially annoying because when I just want to unclose a tab the stupid thing is disgustingly always in the way and flash this big list of garbage that slows thing down on my computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put your computer under a heavy load.
2. Right click a tab.
3. Scroll to unclose a tab.
4. Be prepared to be disgusted by a flash of a long list of closed tab and for your computer to slow to a crawl.
5. Unclose a tab and feel disgust at having to repeat the process to unclose a tab each time and feel like throwing up.
Actual Results:
must view a disgustingly lost list of unclosed tab

Expected Results:
To be able to get rid of the closed tab list or rearrange the menu or put it somewhere else on the menu where you don't have to see it.
