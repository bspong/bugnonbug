Windows Vista slow start with Base Filtering Engine service

If Windows Vista "Base Filtering Engine" service is running, it take 7 - 10 second to start Firefox. If I turn off that service, FF start in 1 - 2 seconds. The same problem occurs with Thunderbird (2.0.0.6). I have turned IPv6 off everywhere, no help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have BFE service running and start Firefox.
2. Reboot machine.
3. Turn off BFE service and start Firefox.



Propably something to do with the new network feature of Vista. If I turn off that same "Base Filtering Engine" service, the local Apache (win32) service responds very fast. With BFE on, Apache sends data very slowly.
