Windows created by "newWin = window.open(url, name, features)" cant get focus from creating window by "newWin.focus()" in Firefox 2.0! Additionaly the flag "dependent" or "modal" are not more working (dont work) like described in http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:window.open!
Should that by a new Feature against spam-Windows/ annoying Windows - they mostly work in that way (loading in the background)?! There is not a chance to bring a Properties Dialog, a Filechooser, a Imagegalerie in front to the main window by the main window if they lost the focus.
