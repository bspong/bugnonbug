The URL I provided contains a link to a document called "IPC::Open3.html" at the
very bottom of the page. This link ha no other components, so FireFox think
it is a an 'ipc' protocal and pop up a complaint dialog saing ipc is not a
valid protocol. Internet Explorer doe not have this problem, speculating that
perhaps it build the URL by assuming the current URL a a prefix.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open page
2. click on link called "IPC::Open3" at the bottom of the document
3. profit

Actual Results:
Same thing that always happens: dialog box claiming ipc is not a valid protocol
(and I didn't profit)

Expected Results:
It should have opend the IPC::open3.html page, like IE does.
