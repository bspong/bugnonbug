When I try to login to "reddit.com" with Firefox, on a daily basis, I'm required to reset my password, or it will otherwise say "invalid password". I originally thought this wa a problem with reddit, obviously, but then I tried logging in on my cell phone, and on Safari, and it work fine. I have tried retyping my password (in case I made Firefox save an incorrectly typed password) but the login fails regardless.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close Firefox (or clear login history)
2. Try logging into reddit.
3. Shed tear of sadness.
Actual Results:
Reddit try to login, but say "invalid password" and give me the opportunity to "recover my password". After resetting the password, the login work fine, but this problem re-occurs after restarting Firefox (which clear my login cache/history in the process)

Expected Results:
It should redirect me to being logged in.

I think I've explained everything already.
