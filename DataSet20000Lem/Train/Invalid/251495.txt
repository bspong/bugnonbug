I guess that beginner may confuse when extension asks them whether they want to
install it in profile or in program directory (and they also may have trouble if
they don't have enough permission to change that directory).

Also, many user always install in profile directory, so dialogue box is
bothering in this case.

Finally, it is a great question whether one user have right to install
extension for all user without their explicit consent (specially if they all
have permission to change program file dir).

So I recommend setting new advanced preference option "always install extension
in profile folder" that would be enabled by default

Reproducible: Always
