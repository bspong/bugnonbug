When opening 'Options'of Fasterfox and coose 'Adjustments' the tab 'Cache' and 'Connection' are not readable and not adjustable cause of wrong Window-Architecture.

Note: The same bug exists in Optionmenue of Firefox2.0 and 2.0.0.1. German Version, wich can be fixed with a known workaround.

It is probably a specific problem of the german Version of Fasterfox a it is in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to 'Extas' and open 'Add-Ons'
2.Open 'Fasterfox'
3.click on 'Options' (5 Tabs are available)
4.click on 'Adjust'
5.choose 'Cache' or 'Connection' (both window are malformed)
Actual Results:
No possibility to adjust 'cache' and 'connection' in option-menue of Fasterfox.

I took no special setup steps. I followed simply the setup routine of Firefox2.0.
on XPpro SP2. In the previous Version of Firefox this Bug didn't exist.

Expected Results:
Possibility to adjust cache and connection in option-menue of Fasterfox.

There's no other Add-On I have tried so far, which provides same or simular issues.
At the Moment I run Fasterfox with the 'optimized' Option.

The bug still occur with the default theme.

Until now I didn't found any workaround on this bug
