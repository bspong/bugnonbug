When right clicking a link and selecting "open link in new tab" the tab doe open and show the URL correctly in the address bar, however it doesn't load the page but wait until i enter the tab, mark the address and click enter.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a multi link page (such a facebook for example).
2. Choose a link and right click it, and select "open link in new tab".

Actual Results:
When clicking on the new tab (in order to view it of course) the page is not loaded, but seems to be in a sort of a "stand by" mode, waiting for the instruction be loaded to be given manually.

Expected Results:
I would expect the tab to be loaded automatically a it ha with former versions.

If it is of any relevance, I'm using the "Bright Blue Abstract" Persona.
