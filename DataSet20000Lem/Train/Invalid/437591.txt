I use HP Credential Manager to automate logins to website using my inbuilt fingerprint scanner. In order to do this, the software detects which application or website us a login and I enter and confirm it. Since the release of FF3RC1 the HP software no longer detects individual webpage and instead just see FF a being a single application.

Hopefully you can help a my security software is essential to my computer use.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to website with log-in screen. e.g. Facebook
2.Enter detail
3.Credential Manager pop-up asks for confirmation of detail for Mozilla Firefox and not for webpage used
Actual Results:
Credential manager input detail stored for only one username on every log in site.

Expected Results:
Multiple account should be stored.
