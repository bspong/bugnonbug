After starting Firefox, With previous session restore on, Firefox memory usage is consistantly pushing the 80mb mark with 3+tabs open.
Currently running 9 tab at a memory cost of 103,560k (Private working set)
Have log of this occuring from window Vista performance logs. Memory usage spike during downloads (no browsing) and during browsing (heavily switching tabs)

Excessive memory usage lead to eventual crashing if firefox is left open across many session (I use hibernate rather than shutting down and losing open tabs)



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Open 3+ tabs, for maximum effect, run about 10 tab
3.Check memory usage in WTM (Windows Task Manager)
Actual Results:
Decribed above, Program is using too much memory

Expected Results:
Memory usage should not exceed 100,000kb.
