New empty favicon make the tool bar jump
When yo remove the current URL from the url bar the favicon becomes an empty square, but the square is apparently smaller than a normal favicon, so the complete tool bar change it height, becoming smaller. You can see this easily by deleting the URL and then pressing ESC, the favicon will come back and the tool bar will jump again, back to the original height. It's pretty irritating.
