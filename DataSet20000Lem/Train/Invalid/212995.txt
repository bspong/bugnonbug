Font size decrease when pressing only the CTRL key after using my trackpad to
scroll (from the middle of a page) to the top or bottom of the page. A good
example is when reading a page, and scrolling to the bottom. Press CTRL (in the
process of pressing CTRL-L) and the font size for that window will decrease.
Does not matter if it is in a tabbed window or a "complete" window.
This only is confirmed with my Synaptics PS/2 trackpad when I "auto-scroll" to
the end of the window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Scroll to top/bottom of window from middle of page (hands-free scroll)
2.Press CTRL button
3.

Actual Results:
Text size decreases.

Expected Results:
Nothing to the text size (unless I had pressed "-" in conjunction with the CTRL key.
