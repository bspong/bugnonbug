Tabs cannnot be closed (zombie tab still there) when max-width is overridden by userChrome.css
By Bug #380960, closing tab animation is now available. It finish closing process of tab by "transitionend" event from changing of "max-width" property. However, by Bug #574654, we possibly fix "max-width" to our favorite value. When max-width of tab are fixed by userChrome.css (or third-pirtys' theme, addons ,etc.) transisionend event never fire and zombie tab are left on the tab bar.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Put following style rule into your userChrome.css:
------------------------------------------
.tabbrowser-tab:not([pinned]) {
max-width: 250px !important;
min-width: 100px !important;
}
------------------------------------------
2. Start firefox and open new tabs.
3. Close a tab.

Expected result: The tab disappears.
Actual result: The tab is still there, and cannot be closed.
