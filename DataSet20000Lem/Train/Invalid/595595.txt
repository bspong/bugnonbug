I have installed the Catalan version and the locale are set to Catalan (1st) and English (2nd).

Even though all this, when I type Google on the omnibar, Firefox go directly to the Spanish version of Google (www.google.es) ignoring the Catalan version (www.google.cat).

If I type "Wikipedia", Firefox go directly to the Spanish Wikipedia, and not to the Catalan version.

If I go to www.google.cat and search for "Wikipedia", the first result is the Spanish wikipedia. The Catalan version is the second one.

If I do the same on Google Chrome, all this result show the Catalan version first.

Why Firefox doesn't respect my first locale and keep showing result not related to my locale?

I live in Catalonia (Spain), but there is no reason to show result in a language that I haven't chosen on my configuration. I guess this is related to my location (Spain), but it shouldn't be this way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From Catalonia. Set locale and language to Catalan.
