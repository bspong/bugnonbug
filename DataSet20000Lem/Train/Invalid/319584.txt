PDF Plugin doesn't work!

I'm sorry for my bad english, im german and will do my very best to describe my problem.

If i try to open a PDF File in Firefox i get the Open/Save Dialog instead of displaying the PDF through a PDF Plugin. I tried it with Adobe Acrobat Reader 6 and Foxit PDF Reader PRO.

I am sure that only one plugin for PDF wa installed. I deinstalled Acrobat Reader before installing Foxit PDF Reader PRO.

In Extras --> Preferences --> Downloads --> Download-Actions
I checked if Firefox is advised to use the plugin. In both case the option for PDF wa to use the Plugin.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Search a link to a PDF
2.Click on it
3.Open/Save Dialog open

Actual Results:
I just get the Open/Save Dialog instead of showing the PDF through the Plugin in the Tab.

Expected Results:
Show the content of the PDF through the Plugin in the Tab.

It seems that this bug only occurs on Win9x Windows Systems.
