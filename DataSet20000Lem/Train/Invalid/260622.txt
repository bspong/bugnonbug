Cannot accept/reject cooky on the fly

Using preview release of Firefox 1.0 for Mac OS X, under OS 10.3.5.

An unwelcome change from Firefox 0.9.3 -- Firefox 1.0PR will not prompt me whether or
not to accept cooky for each web site loaded. In the preferences, we can turn this off
completely or manually add site into a list, but there is no way to ask Firefox to ask me
for each site. It will only ask about retaining cookies, not setting them.

If I can only filter out unwanted cooky by manually editing a list, FireFox will be
unusable to me. I'll either stick to v0.9.3 for now, or continue with Mozilla 1.7.x.

Thank you.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to a web site that set cookies.
2. The cookie will be set automatically, there is no prompt whether or accept or not.
3. Check preferences, there is no option to have Firefox ask for each site, only option to
turn off receiving for all cooky and for how long cooky should be kept.

Actual Results:
Firefox accepts cooky from every site loaded, usually against my wishes.

Expected Results:
It should prompt me if I will allow the site to set the cookie, and include a check box if I
want all cooky from this site handled the same way.
