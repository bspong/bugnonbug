When a Javascript window.open directive includes "location=0", "menubar=0" and "status=0", the location bar, menu bar and status bar are still displayed in the new window, rather than being suppressed a they should be.

I have checked that the example page I indicate below behaves in the expected manner in other browser (such a Opera and Konqueror). Interestingly, I have just noticed that in Firefox 2, the status bar is displayed in this case, even though it should not be, though with FF2, the location bar is correctly suppressed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.beermad.org.uk/jsdemo.html
2. Scroll down to the facility section and click on the "legend" link.
3. New window opens, showing location bar, status bar and menu bar.
Actual Results:
Menu bar, status bar and location bar are displayed.

Expected Results:
Menu bar, status bar and location bar should not be displayed.

I have created the page quoted so a to isolate this from any other possible error in a page. I actually see it every time on other sites.
