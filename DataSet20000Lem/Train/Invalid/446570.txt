It's a error impossible for you to replicate: I'm a lawyer in Portugal and the website (https://citius.tribunaisnet.mj.pt/habilus/myhabilus) used to send case to the court via Internet (after logging in) display a message stating that I have to install Java Plug in 1.6- wich is already installed. Running FF 3 in safe mode allows the site to load the file transfer plug-in and to upload file to the court servers. Previous FF 2.XX version did not have this problem, allowing to normally load the applet without need to run in safe mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load https://citius.tribunaisnet.mj.pt/habilus/myhabilus/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fhabilus%2fmyhabilus%2fMenuEntElectr.aspx
2.type user name and password (wich I cannot provide)
3.try to send an attachment via the Java applet
Actual Results:
a messagem stating that I need to install Java plugin 1.6 apears in the window were the file transfer java applet should appear. If runing FF 3 in safe mode, the applet load noramlly, allowing file transfer.

Expected Results:
the file transferinf java applet should load, allowing the selection of file to upload to the court's server.

older 2.xxx firefox browser allow the page and applet no load without a glitch. FF 3 safe mode also allows the applet to load
