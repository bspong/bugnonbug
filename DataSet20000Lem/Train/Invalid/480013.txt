I even restarted the computer and it wa still saying that Firefox (3 Beta 5) wa offline. In fact I couldn't get online to report this bug until I inserted "The Ultimate Boot Disk" and had it boot the hard drive.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I'm new to this bug reporting and don't know how to reproduce or what that means.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
The browser continued to be offline after I had clicked on the browser button for both Firefox and the operating system I'm using (openSUSE) which is a Linux system.

Expected Results:
I hoped that the button would give me a clue on how to access my browser, but even that information wa unavailable because of the offline browser.

I wa online for about a minute and my computer went off while I wa trying to check my email. When I got the computer logged back on it gave me the message that my Firefox wa offline. I clicked on the icon on my browser for Firefox and OpenSUSE, the Linux system I used and still got the message that Firefox wa in the offline mode. I logged off and restarted the computer but I still had that message a well a the KDE bug message which wa a signal 11. I had to insert my "Ultimate Boot CD" and push "First Hard Drive" to be able to access Firefox (3 Beta 5) to get online to report the bug.
