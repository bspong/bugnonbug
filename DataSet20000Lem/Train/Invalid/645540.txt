User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

HTML issue: Firefox 4.0 display "&reg" a a "registered" symbol (i.e. R in a circle) even if it is NOT followed by a semicolon, which is an HTML error. It should diplay this symbol only if the string "&reg;" (with a semicolon) is present.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create an HTML test page with the following string (for example): "&regex"
2. load it in Firefox 4.0

Actual Results:
Saw "®ex"

Expected Results:
should have seen "&regex" (as this is not an HTML symbol).
