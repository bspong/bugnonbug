Could someone please create an addon that copy a block of command line code from a web page, for the installation of a program in Ubuntu, and convert them to a single line of code with && between each line. The result can then be pasted in one go into terminal.

It is usual to have block of command line listed in a code box on a page. They are not separated by && and so each line ha to be copied and pasted to the terminal. It would be much more convenient if the whole box could be copied in one go and then pasted into Terminal in a form that would run each line automatically. I have been told this would mean adding && to the end of each line before concatenating them. I propose the addon be activated by a button and work once the code area ha been blocked by the mouse.
