When I go to 'File> new window' or click on the 'new window button', or right-click a link and select 'open in new window' this will not launch a new window. Instead, nothing happens. Although sometimes, after closing, Firefox seems to still be running (it's in the task manager). Invisibly though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to either option to open a new window
2. Click on it.
3. Be er... surprised?
Actual Results:
No new window.

Expected Results:
I closed the browser, or tried again a few time in the beginning. Now I 'know better': new window are not possible. This is bad.

Open a new window (very needed for banking and so on).
