when trying to sign in to view an adult profile, after i click on the "sign in"
button, it just brings me back to the page that say "you have to be 18 or older
to give this page..." and when trying to sign in to edit my profile, it just
brings me back to the sign in page.

Reproducible: Always

3. sign in with a user ID that ha your age set to 18 or older

3. sign in

adult profiles. and back to the sign in page for editing progiles.

Expected Results:
for adult profile - taken me to the profile. for editing my profile, taken me
to the edit page.

using basic install of firefox. only extentions i have are the "bug me not" and
"view this page in IE" ones. i also have it set to ask me before saving any
cooky on my computer. i dont think it a cooky problem though, the rest of
yahoo work with signing in (at least all that i do on yahoo).
