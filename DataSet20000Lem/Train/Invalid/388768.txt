hi!

after the recent update from 2.0.0.4 to 2.0.0.5 i cannot display any webbapge. the message "server not found" is displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox 2.0.0.4
2. update via "check for updates"
3. start new installed firefrox 2.0.0.5
4. type in a url
Actual Results:
no page is displayed only the error message "server not found"

Expected Results:
diplay the page

i found out that the problem is the DNS request. sniffing the network traffic show me that firefox doe not request the dns server. if i type in a url with the ip (instead of the name) it works.

in win XP if i try to ping a FQDN (out of a command box) it works, the resolution to the ip address works.
