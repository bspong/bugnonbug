This might be a duplicate of othe "Lost Tabs" bugs, but here I have a specific cause.
Quite simply, I have found that if you are using multiple tags, open a fresh window (with a single or new tabs) close the first window first (or it happens to get shut first on system shutdown) the only tab which can be recovered are in the second window.
There are many scenarios, seen in the othe bug reports, where this can occur accidentally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create several tabs.
2. Open a new window (single tab appears)
3. Close the first window
4. Close the second window
5. Start Firefox again.
Actual Results:
Only the tab (if any) in the second window are remembered.

Expected Results:
At least "Recently Closed Tabs" in history should show the tab from any previous window, if not all the tab be reproduced in the new instance.
