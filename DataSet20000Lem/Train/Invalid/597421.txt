The status of the Progress Line below the location bar only seems to be updated on status changes, so when switching to a tab that is still loading, the Progress Line is at first always showing 0% progress, no matter what the actual progress is.

There is no such problem with the Progress Line above the tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load website, like http://arewefastyet.com/
2. switch to another tab
3. watch Progress Line status on the tab
4. switch back to previous tab while it still loading (best when it slow/hanging at some point)
5. compare status of Progress Line below location bar to the previously shown status
Actual Results:
Progress Line below location bar is showing 0% progress, it will only be updated to the correct status when the status changes.

Expected Results:
Progress Line should immediately show the correct current progress status.
