One major, one minor, suggested enhancement.
1. I noticed Firefox wa much slower than my existing Navigator. I wa about to
go back to Navigator. I finally found why: there is a default setting
"Options/Advanced/Tabbed Browsing/Select new tab opened from links" that is
turned OFF. Not logical. If a person clicked on a link, the person want to see
link. But, more importantly, in Navigator it default to opening in the new tab
and you could start reading the news or whatever in that new tab, even a it
continued to load. What I wa doing wa hitting the link in Firefox, then
waiting for the new tab to completely load before clicking on the tab. Firefox
therefor seemed "slower." Once I turned this setting ON, Firefox had the same
speed a Navigator and responded to link a Navigator did. Because most user
wouldn't find this option, which is a bit cryptic, and would probably go back to
Navigator is they were like me, I strongly suggest changing the default from OFF
to ON.

2. I also noticed the default is "OFF" for "Options/Advanced/Tabbed
Browsing/Select new tab opened from links". This is the same setting a
Navigator, and I never liked it. Say I'm in my browser and notice of an email
come in; I go the the email and click on some URL within the email. It then
overwrites overwrites the site I wa just looking at in my browser. Not logical.
If someone click on a link from another application, they don't logically want
to lose any site they have on their browser. It's not vital like the one above,
but because most user wouldn't find this option (which is a bit cryptic), I
would suggest changing the default to "ON" for this option.

Thanks very much for all you folk have done.
