The 'Add Site' input field allows junk value to be stored.
The field also reject a huge field when it contains invalid domain name while
allows other small valid/invalid field.

Expected Results:
The field should not accept any junk value and should filter input by
delimiters such a a dot (.), domain name such a .com, .edu etc and also by
protocol such a http:// or ftp:// or even www.

Follow up tests:
1) We tried entering huge character field into the input field.Tried entering
blank field into the input field.
2) Tested other famous browser with huge text field, however it doe not accept
such huge field dueto fixed character length.

1)Junk value can be input into the input field. Therefore any text can be
entered into the field.Large value may overflow the buffer.This being an
important feature of the program should be fixed.
