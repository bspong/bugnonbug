firefox confuses "id" and "name"

Scenario:

I have a page with an anchor tag with NAME="foo" for use in same page
jumping/linking (neither the source or target anchor have ID's).

I have another separate element on the page (a table element), which happens to
have the same ID a my anchor NAME.

So, the link that is supposed to jump down to my ancor "foo" instead jump to
the table element with ID "foo" (which is further down on the page). Firefox is
confusing ID's with NAME's.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create link at the top of your page that link to an anchor in the middle of
your page
2. Create an anchor tag in the middle, with NAME="foo"
3. Create table element later in the page with ID="foo"

Actual Results:
Link jump to end of page where I have a table element with ID="foo" instead of
to the middle of the page where I have an anchor with NAME="foo".

Expected Results:
Jumping to middle of the page, not the end.
