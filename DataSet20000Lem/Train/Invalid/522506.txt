generic tab thumbnail/preview in Namoroka

When I open several tabs, say, more than 8 or so, the last tab will show some generic thumbnail image instead of the tab content thumbnail/preview.

Steps:
1. Run today's nightly, Namoroka (10/15), and open several tabs, about 10 of them
2. Hover over the Namoroka icon in the task bar

Expected: All tab should show a preview with it tab content thumbnail

Actual: Some of the tab show a generic thumbnail icon.

This also happens in IE, however, and I can't see a pattern of when this happens except that it happens when several tab are opened, more than 10 or close to the maximum it can display a previews.
