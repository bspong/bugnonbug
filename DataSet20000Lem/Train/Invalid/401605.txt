Firefox take back focus after mouse moved into and out of Firefox window

I'm using twm, but I do not have NoTitleFocus set. I move the mouse from window A across Firefox to window B. After twm ha already set the focus to window B, Firefox set the focus to itself. Now my keystroke go to Firefox instead of window B, even though the mouse is in window B. I have to move out of and back into B to get the focus set to B.

This happens even if I'm viewing about:blank.

I suspect this is the problem that the time argument to XSetInputFocus is supposed to fix, so perhaps it is not being called with the right value.

I'm sorry if this is the same a bug 88810. As best I can tell, that one ha to do with popping up window or refreshing pages, whereas this one occurs just with the mouse entering the window (perhaps triggering a FocusIn event which cause a race in XSetInputFocus calls).


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put two other X Windows with a small gap between them on top of Firefox.
2. Move mouse between the other two window at various speeds.
3. Sometimes Firefox end up with focus instead of window with mouse.
(If other window are xev windows, you can see FocusOut event where Firefox take focus from other window.)
Actual Results:
Focus in firefox.

Expected Results:
Focus in window with mouse.
