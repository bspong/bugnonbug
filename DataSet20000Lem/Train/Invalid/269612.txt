When opening a new tab (either through use of right-clicking a link and
selecting OPEN IN NEW TAB or through highlighting some text on a page and right
clicking to select SEARCH WEB FOR...) the new tab display underneath any
currently opened tabs, instead of on top, like it used to do with the last
version prior to Firefox. It's just not a convenient to then have to select
the tab one ha just opened to actually read it.

Reproducible: Always

1. Open Firefox to any webpage.
2. Rt click and link, then select OPEN IN NEW TAB
3.

Actual Results:
The new tab will be open, but hidden under the current one.

New tab should open on top of current (or previously) open tabs.
