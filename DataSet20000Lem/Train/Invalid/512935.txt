First of all, this is not necessarily a bug in Mozilla, but it is an issue to consider.

If Google Desktop search is installed and searching Web history is enabled in it (it is enabled by default), then history of site visited while in Firefox' Private Browsing mode is indexed there, and result from it pop up in desktop search results.

It is possible that Google is to blame, but maybe Mozilla developer can consider making the history of Private Browsing le easily accessible to other programs.
