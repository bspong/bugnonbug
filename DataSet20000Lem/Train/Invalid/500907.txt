Sorry for my poor english.

I experienced a big problem with FF3.5rc3 : page "loses" a part when displaying.


The problem occur relatively often (every 4 or 5 sites) and seems to be random.
My problem happens even twice when filling this bug !

I think a few screenshots are better than a bad explication : http://www.flickr.com/photos/33950581@N05/sets/72157620489830803/
