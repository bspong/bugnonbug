New default theme since 0.9

The new default theme is really ugly!


I can't imagine how I can convince people to use Firefox. When they see it they
say "yaaaargh! I prefer IE!"

What can I say? I agry... :-(




I know it's not a bug, I know why the theme ha changed, but I hope version 1.0
will have a better design.
I heard several people say they install both FF and Opera, and keep Opera
because it look better. :-/

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Show Firefox to a friend with default theme
2. Wait for him to laugh
3. Cry because he go back to I€
