Tabmix doesn't always work correctly.

Open up a website and force firefox to close. The website will either turn up "untitled" and blank or if you have multiple site open when forcing it to close, not all of them will be restored, but instead will have "untitled" too.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up one or more site (whether or not it is more likely to occur with many I don't know.)

2. Force firefox to close.

3. Open firefox and wait until all the website show.
Actual Results:
Everyday so far, after having to force firefox to close because of those unhelpful stop script message freezing the browser, tabmix plus fails to restore all the website I wa previously viewing.

Expected Results:
To have all the website restored, or at the very least for the url to be in the location bar so that I can try to reload it manually.

Why in the world ha this not been fixed among all the other bugs?
