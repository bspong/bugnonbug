about blank and pop up message appears while using firefox2

When I start firefox 2, the 1/2 second before my homepage appears, the word 'about blank' appear with a blue-outlined figure next to it. The next problem occurs when I click the 'new tab' button - or when I click a saved bookmark. The problem is, when I do either of these things, a window appears stating 'The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded'. Now, I ran adaware, spybot, AVG antispyware and AVG antivirus in window 'normal' and in 'safe' mode with no success. Then I looked at Firefox 2 extensions. I deleted the lolifox extension and the problem went away. I use Firefox 2 almost exclusively and love it and I know that nothing is perfect. Keep up the good work!
