Clicking "back" button make Firefox stay on the page with javascript prompt instead of going back

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any page in new tab
2. Enter javascript:prompt('test') and press OK
3. Enter javascript:confirm('test') and press OK
4. Try to go back to the first page using the "back" button

Actual Results:
It's possible to go back to the prompt page but not to the first page


Expected Results:
It should be possible to go back to the first page


If in p. 3 you execute alert('test') instead of confirm('test') then you will be able to go back
