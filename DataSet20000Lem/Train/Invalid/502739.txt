I cannot change the tab order by dragging a tab with the mouse. I can see the marker, indicating the new position, but the tab is never moved to this position. Instead, the tab will reload.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs.
2. Drag any tab to a new position within the tab bar.
Actual Results:
The position of the tab doe not change, but the dragged tab is reloading.

Expected Results:
The dragged tab should be shown at the assigned position.
