After entering a query into a search engine when browsing from search engine result I am sent to a different page. First stop is to http://copy-book.com/

Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-GB; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008061004 Firefox/3.0

If I write www.google.com into the address bar it will take me to google and the same for any web page. I can perform a search, for example mozilla, and will get appropriate results. When trying to browse from those result the first time I click through it will always take me to http://copy-book.com/ and then onto another,it look like random, web site. The second time I click on the same it will take me to the correct web site.
