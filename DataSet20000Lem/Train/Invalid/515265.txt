[Taskfox] Make arrow key + tab work for secondary page
When browsing search result from Taskfox, you can't currently use the right arrow key or tab to enter the secondary (detail) page. Currently, the only way to get to it is by using the mouse.

We should add the right/left arrow key + tab/shift-tab for back/forward navigation.
