Event 1517 in Windows XP Application log after running Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

After installing Firefox 1.0 on 3 different computer I get this error in the
Application log any time I shut down or restart after running Firefox. If I
don't run Firefox during the session I don't get the error. All machine are
WinXP Service Pack 2. Two are domain member and the other is a standalone. No
service are running a a local user account. I am logging in a a user with
full administrative privileges. I never got this error before installing
Firefox and I tested it several time to verify that it wa connected with
running Firefox before I reported it. It may be minor but it make me wonder if
it could be connected with other problem or if it might indicate that some
handle are not being released. Even if it is harmless it would be nice to fix
it so it doesn't clutter the event log.
