I'm working on my website and have the error console open to the left frequently for javascript testing. I load my site and see error (good). I clear ALL of my private data (with my site and the error console still visible) and then click on my homepage button to revisit the page from scratch. This time, the error console remains blank (shows nothing). I repeat these step (clear private data, go back to website) and again no error are presented.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open error console sidebar
2. Visit a webpage with error
3. Leave both the error console and the page open while clearing ALL private data.
4. Return to the very same page and notice the blank error console.


Expected Results:
The same error should be presented if not already corrected by the designer.
