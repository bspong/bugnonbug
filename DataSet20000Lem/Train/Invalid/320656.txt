I searched for the solution and found "rtsp is not a registered protocol" message at: http://www.gryzor.com/rtsp.html and followed the reccomendation, but it did not seem to help.
I added this string in "about:config":
network.protocol-handler.app.rtsp
Value: /usr/X11R6/bin/realplay

I am just using the default theme and no extention. This is a new Fedora Core 4 install.
