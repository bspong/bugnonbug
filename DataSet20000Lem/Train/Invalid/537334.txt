I will suddenly get "firefox ha created error and must close...". It then close suddenly and I am at the desktop. I can immediately open it, but if I have it reload the page I wa on, It may crash again or it may not. Seems to be on page that are a little complex, but not always. Sometimes it will close when I have clicked on something on the page, but not always. I didn't seem to have this problem before 3.6.4, but constantly since. I hoped it would disappear when I upgraded to 3.6.5, but it hasn't. On my other computer, running xp, it doesn't close, instead I get a bluescreen so brief I can't read it and the computer restarts. Otherwise seems to be the same, while I am using firefox. Hopefully the next build will resolve this. Otherwise, I'll just go back to 3.5

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.always when actively using a webpage.
2.Sometimes when scrolling, sometimes when clicking.
3.sometimes, apparently, when there are several moving item on the page.
Actual Results:
Can't reproduce it at will.

Expected Results:
If I'm on the net and have switched to several page it may happen.

just not have "generated an error". seems to be related to 3.6.5 or the immediately prior release.
