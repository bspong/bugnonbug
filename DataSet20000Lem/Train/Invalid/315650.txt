tool > clear private data > ask me before... option is misleading
The option labelled "Ask me before clearing private data" is potentially misleading, and might cause a user to believe that if they were to click the [Clear Private Data Now] button they'd get a confirmation dialog.

The option actually mean "when a user selects "clear private data" from the tool menu, pop up this dialog so that they can select what aspect of private data to clear".

Suggested replacements:
- Show this dialog before clearing private data
- Always use the setting from Options (inverts checkbox meaning)
- Remember these setting and don't ask me again (inverts checkbox meaning)
