Hi, I use a screen capture tool called Snagit that allows me to capture scrolling web pages, so I can have the whole page in one shot. Unfortunately the latest version of Firefox is interfering with this function. Is there something I can do to the browser setting to fix this issue?
By the way I think Firefox is fantastic and have been a loyal user for many years.

Reproducible: Always
