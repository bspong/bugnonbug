I went to open Firefox. I wait about 5 to 10 minute and then it finally opened. I have tried opening it first after I connect to the internet before I open anything else or after I have used other program first and it still take it forever to open. I tried it on another Windows account and it took le than 30 second to open. I have tried opening it first after I connect to the internet before I open anything else or after I have used other program first and it still take le than 30 second to open it. I went back to the Windows user account where it open slow and delete the Mozilla folder there, uninstalled it, and re-installed it. Then for the first 3 to 4 that I opened it it would open in le than 30 second and then after that it started taking 5 to 10 minute to open again.

I even deleted the profile extension and plug-in add-on and bookmark (after backing up the bookmarks) uninstalled and re-installed Firefox 3.0 and the same thing still happened. I deleted the same file again and uninstalled firefox 3.0 and downloaded Firefox 3.0.1 and then installed it. The same thing happens.

I really don't want to use a browser (Internet Explorer 7) that us too many system resources.

Why doe it take Firefox 5-10 minute to show up.

What is the issue and why is it doing this.

How do I resolve this.
