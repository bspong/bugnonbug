A true download manager in the vein of "Download Accelarator"

Download accelerator is a true download manager. It allows for real pausing of downloads. It doe not "Restart" the download after you press pause > resume (like forefox).
It allows allows multi connection downloads. Where it automatically look for other source of the file you download, in order to speed up the download.

Firefox should at the very minimum upgrade their existing download manager to allow proper pausing and unpausing of downloads on server that allow it. At the moment the feature is completley broken.

Firefox should also allow for a multi connected download, with automatic source search. Specifically a location search based on the country the download is originating from. Ie if you download from australia, it should try and find server with close proximity.

Finnaly, the download manager should include a bandwidth choke measure. When a download is taking up too much bandwidth and is chokign the rest of your net application or net exprience, it should have an option to throttle, in real time.
