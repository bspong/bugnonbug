After installing Freshmeat.net, linux.google.com, and used them for a couple of
days, have they been replaced with eBay, Yahoo, and Amazon.com shopping search
engines.

I have not added these or removed the one I installed.

Looking in my history tell that I have not been at ebay, but yahoo and amazon.
