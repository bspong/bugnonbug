If I try to use copy&paste it doesn't work on this version of Firefox. I can't do that from FF to any other application, a well a from an OSX application to FF and even from an FF window/tab to another.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a text row from an OSX application.
2. Try to paste the text in FF.
Actual Results:
No test is pasted.

Expected Results:
Text should appear.

Others report that this problem wasn't present in the 3.0 series.
