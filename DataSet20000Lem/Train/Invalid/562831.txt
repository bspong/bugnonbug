in Tools->Options->Privacy->Accept Cookies from Sites->Exceptions, when i set an exception to allow a site (e.g. if I want to always allow cooky from Facebook.com), the setting is lost next time I start up FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set privacy with "Accept cooky from sites" checked
2. Set "accept third-party cookies" to unchecked
3. Set "Keep until:" to "I close Firefox"
4. Set "Clear history when Firefox closes" to checked
5. Click "Exceptions...", add "facebook.com", and click "Allow"
6. Exit from dialog
7. Close Firefox
8. Open Firefox, go to exception menu - "facebook.com" exception will be gone
Actual Results:
The site-specific allow exception I added wa gone after restart.
After restart, cooky were not retained for the exception website.

Expected Results:
Exception should persist over firefox close and restart.
For the website specified in the allow exception, cooky should be retained through firefox close and restart.
