JavaScript error: "BMDS ha no properties"
I get this error in a current Firefox trunk build on Linux using a
profile that I know worked just a couple of day ago:

JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarks.js, line 1425: BMDS ha no property

The bookmark menu end up empty.

Earlier, during startup I see:
JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/places/controller.js, line 1876: Cc['@mozilla.org/microsummary/service;1'] ha no property
JavaScript error: chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarks.js, line 103: Components.classes[kMICSUMContractID] ha no property

I'm just wondering if microsummaries is a requirement for bookmark
to work now? If so, could you please enable it by default in the
build system? Thanks.
