Bad rendering of page with XSLT and SVG - produce smaller image with black border.

I have some XSLT stylesheet that transforms xml data to XHTML+SVG graphics.
I have set up Firefox to open local file (when double-clicked) in a new tab.
After installing version 3.0, the file drawing becomes incorrect (if the browser is already open, and the file open in the new tab), it is not of the correct size and the rest of space is filled with black. I have several xml and xsl file in the directory. Strangely, if I move needed file to another isolated directory (without the rest of files), everything draw correctly. If browser is not open before, the graph display correctly (no tab are displayed).
Also, if I right-click on this badly drawn image, the context menu contains too many different element (does not even fit in whole, and ha scrollers at top & bottom).

If I transform the xml file by a differrent XSLT processor, the resulting file open ok.

The reproducibility depends on complexity of XSLT stylesheet, stripping it to bare minimum and replacing all the variable with fixed value elimintates the reproduction of bad render.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser on some page.
2. put my file in directory with some other files.
2. double-click my xml file so that it open in the next tab.

Actual Results:
Image is drawn in the

Expected Results:
image drawn in full, specified size.
