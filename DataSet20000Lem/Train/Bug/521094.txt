Long web page are truncated while printing

With Firefox 3.5.3 on Windows XP Pro SP3 when trying to print this long web
page from:
http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/05/fraudulent_paypay_certificate_published/print.html
only the first page is printed a 1 of 1.
When I go to the "print story" icon on the top of the page it correctly print
all 3 pages, but with different layout of the ads.
In IE 8.6001.18702 it correctly print 2 page with no ads.

The problem is similar to BUG 154892

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/10/05/fraudulent_paypay_certificate_published/print.html
2.Print the long web page

Actual Results:
Only the first page is printed a 1 of 1 with an ad embedded

Expected Results:
Two page should be printed with no ad embedded

Maybe the trick is to avoid including the ad like IE does.

I'm forced to use IE to print long web page correctly. This bug and it variant have been open since 2002 for almost 7 years.
