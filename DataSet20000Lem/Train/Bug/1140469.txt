First time Login Issue when we access our Application in mozilla version 31.4 . Did not face earlier with version 24.8
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.94 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

We have a application that ha an issue when we login to it for the first time using mozilla browser 31.4 . The request do not go from the browser to our server due to unknown reason . But the moment we do a page refresh , everything start working where our application is able to hit the server to fetch detail and show in the user interface. Earlier we were using Mozilla version 24.8 and did not face such issues. To check we have done the downgrading of Mozilla version from 31.4 to version 24.8 and our Application responded beautifully without any issue . But moment i again upgraded back to 31.4 , we go the same issue back where Application doesnt load value since request doe not pas from User INterface back to server. We have also tried with latest version of moziila currently available and see that issue still persists .


Actual results:

Mozilla version 31,4 onwards the UI is not reposnive and doe not interact to backened server to load the page. Can we know the any reason for this in general ?


Expected results:

Our Application should have run the normal way where we do not face issue with other Browsers like Internet Explorer and Chrome . It only happens in Mozilla which is unfortunate and we are looking forward for your help .

Thank you in advance for understanding.
