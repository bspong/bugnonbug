This bug doe require the Java 1.4.0 or greater plug-in to be installed and an
applet that us the JAXP lib to parse an xml file.

The JAXP class request META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory a
one possible way to determine the appropriate parser factory. This request woudl
be be satisfied within the classpath of the Applet. On of the jar doe contain
the service description.

However, in my application it is routed to the server a
/plan-b/META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory (it is treated a a
URL realtive to the codebase), where it doe not exist.

This behavior is not the same with the same JDK and Internet Explorer.

See
http://java.sun.com/webservices/docs/1.0/api/javax/xml/parsers/SAXParserFactory.html#newInstance()
for the JAXP behavior and configuration.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a proxy server, so you can log the request to the server
2. Call
http://www.conficio.com/plan-b/examples/quickbooks/create_account/credit_card/index.html#plan_b_player
a page with the appropriate applet. Download plan-b/bin/player22.jar containing
the META-INF/services/... file
3. See your proxy log for all request

Actual Results:
a request to plan-b/META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory to the
server.

Expected Results:
A request to META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory that is
satisfied from the code jar, that contains the service definition.

I assume this ha somethign to do with the integration of the Java Plug-In.
However, I could only classify it a a general bug. Please recategorieze at will.

This bug indicates to me a breach of the classpath for java applications, which
could be a security risk.
