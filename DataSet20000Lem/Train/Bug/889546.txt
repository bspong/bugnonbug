window.home no longer point to iframe window object
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

This worked in 21.0 and prior but stopped working a of 22.0:
Web application us iframe with name="home" and javascript performs action such a top.home.location.href = url; and window.home.location.href = url; to change the content of the "home" iframe (URL is in same domain, so not a cross domain issue).


Actual results:

Firefox 21.0 and earlier work fine.
Firefox 22.0 throw exception TypeError: window.home.location is undefined

Seems to be related to the fact that home() is now a function that is no longer assigned the iframe's name automatically (which give javascript access to the iframes window object)


Expected results:

"home" iframe should have loaded the URL that wa assigned to it window.location.href

What's a bummer is that this bug will further decrease Firefox's already-decreasing browser usage statistic since our response wa to have all user switch to IE or Chrome (this is an enterprise / intranet web application used by thousand of organization and hundred of thousand of user and due to strict testing requirement at many of our client simply changing the iframe and all code that reference "home" is not an immediately viable option).
