getShortcutOrURIAndPostData callback should be asynchronous
To be able to convert getShortcutOrURIAndPostData to async keywords (that is, to PlacesUtils.promiseHrefAndPostDataForKeyword), we need it callback to be made really asynchronous.

During the conversion to original promise (that were resolving in the same tick) it wa onky made fake-async, but it wa still synchronous in reality. Then when we moved to Promises.jsm that were resolving on the next tick, it wa decided to convert it from promise to a callback due to the high number of test to fix. It wa thus kept synchronous (see bug 989984).

Now, to proceed with the conversion, we need the callback to be really invoked on the next tick, that mean we must fix the test to do the right thing.

this is the test that are currently failing:
