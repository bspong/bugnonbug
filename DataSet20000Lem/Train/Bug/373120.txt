For some reason, the "Apply" button wa not implemented in many dialogs. This is almost an "accessibility" issue, though at least, a "usability" issue.

Many time I want to change a parameter and "apply" the parameter to see the effect -- but I don't want to close the option menu. Currently this ability seems to be broken/missing.

As a specific example relating to accessibility/usability, I wanted to look for font that were more readable. Everytime I change the font, however, I have to press "Ok", which make the font box go away. I then have to goto Tools, find Options again (usually buried near bottom), and re-open. Then I can re-position to the font box, and type in the first few char of the next font -- if I knew the name (font list is long, scroll off bottom).

All this is busy-work, requiring lot of mousing, clicking and typing unknown font name all to be able to go through font and see which look best for a given page, size and language.

I've never understood the desire to force a user to dismiss an option dialog in order to see it affect.

It's very annoying -- and, at times, painful (if RSI acting up), and is always a lengthy process, since I have to bring the window back up with each font I try.
I'd wish it would be considered "serious", but I know it's an RFE, which by definition mean it isn't "serious", and by inference on the list, ha an importance *below* "trivial" :-(.

Anyway..."Apply"! If people have major upset around this, add a config var
Display:Noshowapply:0/1 or something similar.
