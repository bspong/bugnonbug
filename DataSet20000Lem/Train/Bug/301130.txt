Firefox 1.0.5 occasionally go to the WRONG URL when using the Back Button.

I've seen this same bug on a pc at my office and on a pc at my home.

The URL that get returned to is one of the one in the current history.
(Usually 3 or more item in the history list.)

It usually happens when there is ONLY 1 tab in use.

Seems like the pointer in the URL list is improperly updated when the back
button is pressed. (i. e. pointer index seems to be off by 1 or more.)

Seems that when I have hit the button multiple times, without pressing the
button too fast or too often, that when it return to the "root" item that the
pointer is off by 1 or more.

To fix the problem, I have to exit Firefox and restart Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Not sure how to reproduce the problem.

It occurs on different web sites.

Actual Results:
See Details above.

Expected Results:
The browser should parse the history list forward and backwards properly.
