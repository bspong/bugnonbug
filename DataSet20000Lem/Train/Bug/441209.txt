Currently, if I want a site to be allowed to show me pop-up forever and always AND see the relevant pop-up window loaded, I must first go to the pop-up blocker dialog and choose "allow pop-up from this site." If the pop-up is generated by clicking a link on a page first, I must then go click the link again.
It sure would be convenient to have the option of "Show this pop-up and allow from <site>".



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to MLB website http://mlb.mlb.com/index.jsp
2. In the flash window on the left that ha the daily scoreboard, click the "Gameday" icon for a game currently being played (It's a small icon the shape of a baseball diamond).
3. Choose "allow popups from mlb.mlb.com" and then go click the link again to actaully see the new window.


Actual Results:
Frustrating UI that make me click the link twice.


Does this have anything to do with the popup being generated by the flash plugin ?

For the record, I'm using Adobe flash plugin 9.0r124.
