Identity information for site with mixed content say connection is not encrypted
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008062112 Iceweasel/3.0 (Debian-3.0~rc2-2)

Opening the above mentioned URL get me through the "are you sure you trust those scammers?" dance - All fine, all fine. However, even if the page is retrieved via HTTPS, it say the connection is not encrypted - Please look at http://gwolf.org/node/1838 for a screenshot if needed.
This doe not happen with every self-signed SSL page - in fact, so far, I have not been able to reproduce it in any other site (not that I tried too hard, I tried with two others)
I am not using an official Firefox build, I saw this on Debian's Iceweasel. I will try to reproduce it with an official Firefox a soon a possible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open https://penta.debconf.org
2. Accept self-signed certificate, grant exception
3. Look at the address bar. It's still white!


Expected Results:
It should show the security information, warning that it is a self-signed certificate, but that the connection is secure
