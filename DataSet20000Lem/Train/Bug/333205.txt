When 'mailto:' is called using location.href in javascript, gifs stop animating.

When I make a call to "mailto:" by changing the value of "location.href" in Javascript, all gifs on the page stop animating. I need to use location.href because the content of the 'mailto:' is dependant on instance variables. The problem doesn't happen if I call "mailto:" using an anchor.

<A href="mailto:bradofarrell@gmail.com">Link</a> -- Will not cause the gifs to stop animating.

location.href="mailto:bradofarrell@gmail.com" -- <I>Will</I> cause gifs to stop animating.

An error doe not show up in the JS console. I've tried it in Internet Explorer and do not get the same problem. I'm using Windows XP, but someone else tested it on Linux (using Firefox) and had the same problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Execute location.href="mailto:"; in JavaScript
Actual Results:
Gifs stop animating.


Expected Results:
The email client should open, and the page should be unaffected.

This doesn't happen when it's called by setting the href with an anchor.
