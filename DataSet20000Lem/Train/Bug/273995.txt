default text color when only bgcolor in website is specified (not text color) is sometimes wrong

I like black backgrounds. So, I set my default background color to black, and my
text color to a light grey. Unfortunately, many site are poorly designed, and
will only specify a bgcolor (white usually), assuming that we all have whitebg,
with blacktxt a our default colors. However, when I visit such sites, although
the background is set to white, my text color is too light to be read comfortably.

The same issue would arise if a website specifies a black text, but excludes the
bgcolor ... in which case i would not see anything because my default bgcolor is
black.

Perhaps, in the event that either the text or bgcolor are missing, mozilla
should force black-on-white and grey-on-black? Or perhaps, in the Fonts & Colors
settings, multiple "themes" should be defined ... depending on the background
color -- although perhaps this is unecessary, since black and white are the
predominant bgcolors ... and those that are actually colored will most likely
already have text/bgcolor/link/vlink already defined.

Also, while we're on the topic, I think a shortcut to force your preferred
Colors might be useful. Currently I have to perform 6 click and go through 2
dialogues. =)
