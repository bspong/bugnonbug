I am indicating that this is a major issue. I have experienced memory leak with Firefox for a very long time, but I have been respectful of the developers' time by not posting bug without detailed information. This ha finally reached a critical point of frustration for me, and I will try to provide a much information a possible. The significant majority of my leak are experienced during difficult-to-reproduce circumstance which include a combination of extensions, preferences, and browsing history that would cause a developer to reject the bug despite it seriousness. Instead I will present low-magnitude leak such a the above, so that there is no excuse for disregarding plea for help from user such a myself. However I expect this to be taken seriously, because otherwise I can have no hope that the other problem I experience will ever be addressed.
