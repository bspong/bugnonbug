Created attachment 725861
Screenshots demonstrating 'Lost Menu Bar' with 'Fullscreen Application'.

When visiting some Webpages there is available a feature that allows some of the Content on the Webpage to be displayed fullscreen (similar to the feature that is offered on Video Sites like Youtube, except that it doe not occur there).

STR:
1. Visit: http://www.slideshare.net/caulfield2600/tegra-4-outperforms-snapdragon-17176163
2. Click on the "Fullscreen Button" (lower right Corner of the "Slideshare" Frame).
3. When in fullscreen mode do not answer the 'Browser's "Allow Fullscreen" Popup Window', instead hit ESC to return to normal screen mode.
4. Click on the [Deny] Button to dismiss the 'Browser's "Allow Fullscreen" Popup Window'.

Now the Browser's Menu ha disappeared, the "ALT Key" is 'captured' (by the Web Application).


You will need to click on a 'non-clickable area' of the Webpage (click somewhere that doe 'nothing', do not click on a Link) to restore the ability to use the ALT Key.

Now that you have the ability to use the ALT Key again; hit ALT, then "F" (to bring up the "File Menu").

You can "right Cursor Key" over to "View" and "down Cursor Key" to "Toolbars" and check / uncheck "Menu Bar" with no effect; you have LOST your "Menu Bar" and need to exit the Browser and restart to get back the "Menu Bar".


First see a few day ago, but I wa not able to reproduce. It occurs with Aurora and WinXP, but I imagine (since it is a 'Web Application') that it occurs with other OSes and version of our Browser.


Enclosing an Attachment which show what I see.
