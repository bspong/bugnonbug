firefox crashed and error report crashed upon sending data report. Followed by system wa infected with "Bloodhound.Exploit.6"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Upon entering http://www.railroadtycoon3.com/rt3/us/downloads/game.html Firefox
performs an illegal operation. This is quickly followed by the "Report this
problem program" to load up. After clicking continue/next three time the
reporting application also performs an illegal operation. A window then appears
notifying me that i wa infected by a Bloodhound.Exploit.6.

Norton explains the technical detail of Bloodhound.Exploit.6 a "By embedding a
specially crafted URL in a Web page and having that URL refer to a CHM file
containing an HTML file with script in it, an attacker could force the user who
view the Web page with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer to download
and execute files."

I have only use internet explorer to run update and because it is linked to my
virus definition encyclopedia quoted above.

The virus wa found in "Source: C:\Documents and Settings\[username]\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\gegze1d2.Default User\Cache\_CACHE_001_"

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.entered http://www.railroadtycoon3.com/rt3/us/downloads/game.html
2.waited a the shockwave application loaded
3.Firefox crash followed by "Report this problem" crash followed by Virus Alert

Actual Results:
After attempting to reproduce above step nothing occurred. Website loaded
regularly. Does not explain why the virus wa inside the cache files. I wa also

Expected Results:
The software should not have crashed, and the cache should not have been
infected with a virus.

Furthermore, the virus could not be deleted by Norton. The cache had to be
manually cleared. Auto-Protect wa enabled and ha been since the first
installation of the PC. Auto-Protect work like this: a soon a a file is
created, modified, etc it is scanned to check for viruses. I am fully updated
and patched in everything possible windows, norton, firefox. Sygate firewall
wa turned off earlier in the day to allow my lan network to access me, I am
also behind a router with a built in firewall. I am unsure if the report wa
accuretly sent to your data server but the time it wa sent wa 7:08:18 AM est
on 1/2/2005. Checking log might provide for some more information.

After running a full system virus scan I also had Trojan.ByteVerify infected
within Jvb.class, and a generic TrojanHorse in MainApp.class. Both were
located inside Sun Microsystem's java cache. I have never had a problem of this
magnitude with firefox before. I run a weekly virus scan at 8pm every Friday
and today is Sunday.

I could not recreate the occurrance and do not have the offset value which the
crash occured at, I copied it into clipboard and forgot to jot it down.
Apologies. Hope this help current or future occurances.
