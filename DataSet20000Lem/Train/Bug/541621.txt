The WYSIWYG editor is my editor of choice on Overclock.net (when you register with Overclock.net, you have to edit your Options so that you always use the WYSIWYG editor). Ever since Firefox 3.0.5, I have had problem related to the WYSIWYG editor a explained by Bug 498546 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=498546).

There's a new problem in Firefox 3.6: when I use Shift+Tab to go back up to the Title field, I have to press Tab twice while holding Shift because nothing happens the first time Tab is pressed.

But once I press Shift+Tab, Tab to back out of the Message field to go into the Title field, I no longer have to press Tab twice in order to get it to work. I mean, I will press Shift+Tab, Tab to go to the Title field, make my change, then press Tab to go back to the message field. But let's say I want to go back to the Title field again: well THIS time all it work with the normal Shift+Tab instead of pressing Tab twice.

This doe not happen in the Standard, non-WYSIWYG editor (the editor where the BB code must be entered even though you can still use Ctrl+B for bold, etc.).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make an account on Overclock.net (or use a message board where you know it ha a vBulletin WYSIWYG editor).
2. Begin creating new message or a new thread.
3. Before typing or doing anything, place the cursor in the Message field.
4. Regardless if you have typed anything or not, press Shift+Tab.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
The cursor should have been placed in the previous field (with Overclock.net, this would be the Title field which is right above the Message field).

To reproduce this multiple time in a row without starting over, just refresh the page

Bug 498546 is still a problem a well.
