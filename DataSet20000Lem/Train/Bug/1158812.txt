Unable to move scroller in parent window when cursor is in iframe

Steps to reproduce:

I have two iframes(outer and inner) and i have specified my own custom scroller for the body of the outer iframe. When my cursor wa over the inner iframe, i am unable to move the scroller in the parent window. In chrome it is working fine. Please check below code.

<iframe> /* main iframe */

<html>

<body> /*scroller applied */

<div>

<iframe> </iframe> /* sub iframe */

</div>

</body>

</html>

</iframe>
I have used "mouseWheel and DOMMouseScroll" events.In Firefox, when I wa over the Iframe area, the event handler is not triggering when I scroll using mouse wheel, so I am unable to view the remaining content of the parent window. I need to move the cursor to the parent window to scroll using mouse wheel. How to resolve this issue?


Actual results:

Unable to scroll the scroller in parent window, when my mouse wa in iframe


Expected results:

The scroller should move accordingly to mousewheel, when my mouse cursor in iframe
