A popup window not blocked when starting to fill a user entry field or cliking in an empty area/background of the web site

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. First of all, your cache/cookie ... must be free from any visit on this french site
2. go to www.ctqui.com, Start filling the 2nd user entry field in the middle of the screen by just clicking one time
3. wait for downloads completion

Actual Results:
A second firefox window appears with advertising.

Note1: I'm not speaking about the possible small advertising window (often purple colored) that appears
on the bottom left of the main firefox window and which is automatically reduced
by the web site after few second but really about the second main window

Note2: this happens also if you click once on the right side (blue area) which seems to be the background color of the site

Expected Results:
No second main firefox window display if I disable pop-up
