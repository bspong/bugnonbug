Video Audio Sync Bug Using HTML Player Audio Falls Out of Time
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0
Build ID: 20161019084923

Steps to reproduce:

Create a video and upload to youtube. Then playing back the video with my FF browser will result in the video audio restarting from the start after about 3 into the video whilst the video layer is perfect from start to finish... causing it to be out of sync. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGKp7Sc85E4

Tested on other PC and it work fine. Tested on Chrome and it work fine. Tested on Android Dolphin browser and it work fine. Tested on this pc and I get the issue whenever the quality is above 420p... so 720p and 1080p for example will exhibit this issue.

My System Settings:
Win8.1 Pro
Firefox Version: 49.0.2
MSI GTX970 Twin Frozr
i5-4690K
16GB 1866Mhz Corsair Ram
Adobe Flash Player Shockwave Flash 23.0 r0 v. 23.0.0.185 up to date
Vegas Pro 13
All my software is fully licensed.


Actual results:

Then playing back the video with my FF browser will result in the video audio restarting from the start after about 3 into the video... causing it to be out of sync.

Here's a video I recorded to demonstrate the issue to you: https://youtu.be/3UY2dLVHt94 funnily enough this video doesn't exhibit the same problem :/

I will help you repeat these error to solve the problem, email me direct or through here (hopefully I will get an email notification)... happy to sort this out. (also heard a friend found the same problem with the video when viewing).

Kind Regards,
