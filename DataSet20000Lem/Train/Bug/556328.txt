When I run bookmark all tabs, the resulting bookmark name are all, eg, "ploplinux.html" or "downloads.html" or "msg00101.html". The link do work, the URLs are fine, but because the Name field is left blank, I can't easily find them using the Awesome Bar. Also, when I view the folder, the name tell me nothing. Making a regular bookmark save the title in the name. Bookmark all tab not doing the same make me think it's a bug.

I believe previous version populated the name field with the page title tag for bookmark all tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tabs, including specific pages, not just root location
2. Run Bookmark All Tabs.
3. In Organize bookmarks, look at the resulting bookmarks. They will not have user-friendly titles.
Actual Results:
The resulting bookmark will not have user-friendly titles.

Expected Results:
I expect the automated equivalent of creating a folder and bookmarking each page. Using the bookmark page process save the name in addition to the location.
