Uninstalling deleted non-Firefox folder (after installing to C:\Program Files\)

The new Firefox Windows installer - for a custom install location - put the
Firefox file into the top level of my d:\Program Files directory. I did not
want this, so I uninstalled it from the Windows Control Panel Uninstall applet.
It did not uninstall so I logged in a adminstrator and then ran the uninstall.

THe unintall took a long time with lot of disk activity. At the end of it,
about 2/3 of the folder in Program Files had been deleted. I lost dozen of
applications, many of them requiring serial number to reinstall, and all the
associated configuration, etc. Included in the carnage were two other Mozilla
installation and my Thunderbird 0.4 installation, and Winzip which of course I
needed to unzip replacements.

This is DANGEROUS.

Expected Results:
1) The installer should have made clear where the file were going to be put. I
had navigated to d:\Program Files, then typed in Mozilla Firefox 0.8, but the
last step of the path wa not reflected in the edit box. However, some
installers add the last step anyway. So the destination wa not clear, and the
installer had not folled my commands.

2) The uninstaller should NEVER touch ANY file it ha not installed.
