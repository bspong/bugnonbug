so first I want to be serious if you have a site with too many frame (in my
case 5 of them, which contain table and stylesheets) and if that site will
reload every five second or so .. mozilla/firefox will crash..

second part.
that's a serious reason why I don't like mozilla and the community just give a
shit about it! .. that debugging (callback mechanism) is just a joke in my
eyes.. why don't you guy _just_ distribute mozilla with symbol and tell people
to enable coredumps?!?!!!
I tried to write a plugin a year ago for mozila back then only a few example
worked the rest wa like .. am I an alien and should I understand that insane
non-working piece of code?!

third part.
why don't close the ongoing mozilla development and just fix up these damn bugs?
I'm able to crash ff within a few hours, also why don't you tell plugin writer
to not constantly use device like /dev/mixer (mozilla/ff ha to get killed to
be able to unload the driver sometimes)!! it really sucks...

fourth part:
please >> fix up these damn bug that ff doesn't crash everytime (while
monitoring a site that reloads 5 frame within 5 seconds.. a I already wrote
and - or - make a sane description how to report errors) <<


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
create a site with a few frame (which include stylesheets, and tables) that
reloads all 5 second
