Must click twice to close a Bookmark Toolbar folder after dropping a bookmark on
top of a folder inside of it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drop a bookmark from the root of a Bookmark Toolbar folder (or from another
Toolbar folder) on top of a folder within it.
2. Move the mouse up to the depressed folder button fast enough a to not
activate another folder inside of it.
3. Click once to close it.

Actual Results:
The Toolbar folder doesn't close. Click it again to close it.

Expected Results:
The Toolbar folder should have closed after the first click.

You can also reproduce this if you drop a bookmark somewhere inside the folder
(instead of dropping it on top of it), a long a you then move the mouse below
the root dropdown menu and then directly up it to the Toolbar button. If you
instead follow the hierarchy backwards in the correct order, you will not see
the bug.

This bug is minor, but very annoying when rearranging bookmark inside the
Bookmark Toolbar a lot.
