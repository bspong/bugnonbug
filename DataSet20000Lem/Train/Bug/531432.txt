if i open 2 session (using the '+' symbol) to "chase bank" (2 different accts with diff. logins and pwds -one is student loan the other a credit card), and navigate around on one, when i go to the other session, it ha lost it's "session identity (??) and I have 2 instance of one account - rather than one each of 2 different accounts. dont know if this is a mozilla bug or not. this is the only institution where i have 2 logically separate account - maybe it's the bank, but the shared memory (I guess) of mozilla seemed the best place to start looking.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the browser and using the '+' create 2 or more sessions.
2.in one session I log onto "https://chaseonline.chase.com/Logon.aspx"
3.i use different link to access credit card info in this first session.
4.in the second session i log onto "https://www.chase.com/ccp/index.jsp?pg_name=ccpmapp/student_loans/servicing/page/servicing_home&TYPE=33554433&REALMOID=06-08214018-7ba2-1015-afe4-83bd1ad50cb3&GUID=&SMAUTHREASON=0&METHOD=GET&SMAGENTNAME=-SM-U77w9JfpkJA%2f54yAPlG0Clm8lz6LfW6j52XeuRS%2f0Splw95KalT57YTLzIetKeZJ&TARGET=-SM-HTTPS%3a%2f%2fservicing.chase.com%2fedfi%2fsecured%2fStudentLoans%2fAccountDetails.aspx%3fAI%3d213231734" which is my student loan site hosted by Chase
5.in session two, i use different link to access student loan info
6.when i go back to session one that had credit card info, it now ha the same info a is displayed in session two.
7.if i use the back button on session one (the credit card session, that ha changed into a student loan session) I cannot back-into the account that i had orginally accessed.
Actual Results:
the actual result are that i can access the session #2 account information from session #1

Expected Results:
i should maintain 2 separate session into 2 logically separate account with 2 set of separate confidential data.

there is nothing in common between these 2 accounts. session one is my personal credit card account opened many month ago, and the other is an account my daughter opened to manage her student loan. she sent me her login and pwd so i could manage the finance of her account.----- This could be a problem at the bank, but i have no way of knowing since i don't have separate account at another institution where i could test the issue. since mozilla seems to use the same resource for each instance started under one browser instance, i thought it possible that that wa the problem.
