mochitest-browser-chrome: browser_bookmarksProperties.js time out intermittently
This look similar to existing bug filed on this (specifically bug 493355), but not exactly the same, so I'm filing a new bug. This timed out on a Linux unit test machine during a cycle with my patch in it, with no failure in the previous cycle. Since I doubt my patch could've caused this, I'm calling it a random timeout.

The timeout happened after the following output:

Starting test browser_bookmarksProperties.js
*** TEST: Bug 479348 - Properties on a root should be read-only
*** TEST: Bug 462662 - Pressing Enter to select tag from autocomplete close bookmark property dialog
About to focus the tagsField
About to focus the autocomplete result tree
*** TEST: Bug 475529 - Add button in new folder dialog not default anymore
About to focus the namePicker field
*** TEST: Bug 476020 - Pressing Esc while having the tag autocomplete open close the bookmark panel
About to focus the tagsField

command timed out: 1200 second without output, killing pid 11908
process killed by signal 9
