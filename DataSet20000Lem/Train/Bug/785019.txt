Steps to reproduce:

teps to reproduce:
1. Run Firefox nightly version 17.0a1 (2012-08-22) [Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 64 bit]
2. Open about:config and set plugins.click_to_play to true (see bug 711552)
3. Open https://ebanking.sampopankki.fi/html/index.html?site=SBNBEN&secsystem=E2 (Login page for the internet banking service for SampoPankki which is a Finnish subdiary of Danske Bank of Danmark)


Actual results:

The page stay at "Starting Java..." state forever.

(The page requires Java plugin to be enabled and a a result of click_to_play I get next to invisible lego brick in front of the URL bar to notify me that page requires plugins to work correctly. If I click the lego brick, I get option to activate plugins and the page start to work.)


Expected results:

The current behavior is okay except the fact that the lego brick is next to impossible to notice (the brick is white brick with light grey border on white background and it appears at the same moment the whole page appears so there's practically no possibility to see it unless the user is expected to know that the brick will appear at the start of the address bar in case of plugin activation is required).

I'd suggest that the lego brick were colored bright yellow or red to make it stand out. Also, Google chrome us the end of the URL bar for notification such a this and it's better position because that area of the address bar is usually white and any addition to that area is easier to notice.
