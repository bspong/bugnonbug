Failed installation; can't write firefox.exe (also unable to manually delete firefox.exe with explorer)
User-Agent: Opera/9.22 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.10

Upon attempting to update Firefox normally to version 2.0.0.10, it could not update, a it wa not allowed to write over critical files. It would continuously loop, trying to update, and I had to manually force firefox to quit. After multiple attempt to find a way around this (i.e., restarting firefox, the computer, and more), I uninstalled Firefox. I can't remember if the uninstallation failed or not, however, I found a way to get the C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox folder deleted, along with it contents. I redownloaded Firefox, and attempted to install it. Manual installation failed, saying that there wa an error, that it could not write firefox.exe, and wanted me to retry. I've tried retrying and cancelling, followed by restarting the entire installation. Nothing ha worked so far, and I really can't be assed to look through possible thousand upon thousand of 'similar' bugs. Firefox is my favorite browser I've tried, and I would very much like to keep using it, a no other browser ha kept up with it quality.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run installation wizard.
2. Proceed normally, accepting terms.
3. Standard and custom install both fail.
Actual Results:
I'm given an error partially into the Firefox installation, with the message, "Error file for writing:
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe", followed by the retry/cancel selection.

Expected Results:
The Firefox browser should have successfully reinstalled, writing the firefox.exe file.
