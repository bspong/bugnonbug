Reduce the number of notification to the main thread done through UpdatePlaces to improve UI responsiveness for import
I would like to keep bug 1332225 open and still have something concrete to track these changes, so I'm filing a separate bug.

I'll put patch up in a second. The TL;DR is that a big part of why history import from Chrome (and to a lesser degree, other browsers) are hanging the UI is that calling the relevant API (UpdatePlaces) doe most of it update per-visit-per-place *and* then sends a number of notification to the main thread for each of those. Specifically, it sends:

1) a notification that a visit to that URL ha happened
2) a notification that the place (ie URL)'s frecency ha changed
3) a notification that the place's title ha changed (if it title changed OR if it's a new place/URL that we didn't know about, the latter of which is very likely for history imports, certainly at the start of the profile's lifetime ie first startup)
4) a notification to any callback passed to the UpdatePlaces API for every individual result / error it sees.

The patch I attach:

a) remove (2) and replace it with a single notification after all place have updated (this is behind an additional flag passed to UpdatePlaces)
b) remove (3) for new place (which fix bug 1280601)
c) remove (4) based on opt-in bools on the observer caller pas in

Then there's 1 extra small patch that tweak two minor thing I happened to notice on the way.

The overall impact of this is that import of my very large, synthetically created chrome history file (~24000 unique URLs) now hang the UI 80% le than it did before a measured through Dão's work in bug 1338522. As a side-effect, the import is 8% faster (speeding up the import itself wasn't my primary aim, and might be tricky to balance with these notification if those are what's hanging the UI - if the import is faster, more of those notification will hit the main thread in the same timeframe).

Unfortunately it is not possible to remove/replace (1) without potentially breaking consumers, so I haven't attempted that in these patches.
