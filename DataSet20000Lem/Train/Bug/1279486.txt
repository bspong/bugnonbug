Page is not automatically scrolled when you activate the last item context menu.mp4

[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 45.0 and up
- Activity Stream 1.0.19-dev

[Affected Platforms]:
- All Windows
- All Mac OS X
- All Linux

[Prerequisites]:
- Latest Activity Stream add-on version (1.0.19-dev) wa previously installed on a clean profile.
- Have enough history so that the "Top Sites", "Highlights", "History" area are populated with visited websites.
- Scroll bar is available in Timeline History page.

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open the browser with the profile from prerequisites.
2. Click the Activity Stream button from the browser toolbar.
3. Hover the last website displayed in portview from Timeline History page.
4. Expand the item's context menu.

[Expected result]:
- The page is scrolled down automatically in order to see all the option of the context menu.

[Actual result]:
- After the context menu expands, only a few option are visible making the user to scroll down in order to see all the option available.
- In my opinion, the scroll action should be handled automatically.

[Notes]:
- The issue is also reproducible in the Bookmarks History page.
- After the context menu appears and the user ha scrolled down to see the rest of the options, if the menu is dismissed, the page is automatically scrolled upwards.
- Attached a screen recording of the issue.
