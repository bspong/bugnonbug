I noticed that when I switch to another tab while a web page load that want to open a pop-up window to display, say, a PDF document, then the pop-up bar doesn't appear.

I assume to get to see this pop-up security bar information even when I browse at another tab.

When Internet connection is slow, I don't want to wait until a page ha loaded. So I switch to another tab and either read what's in there or start another request. When I then get back to the original page, no pop-up security bar appears, though it would have appeared if I had stayed at the original tab while downloading that page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page that want to open a pop-up window after downloading
2. While downloading that page, open another tab
3. After the first page ha finished downloading, get back to the first tab.
Actual Results:
The pop-up security bar is not displayed.

Expected Results:
The pop-up security bar should be displayed, offering to display the pop-up window once.
