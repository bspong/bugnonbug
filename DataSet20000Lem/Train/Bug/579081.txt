I receive "unexpected client hello" error when I try to log in to my gmail account.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefoxver:2.00287 976805093803 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Firefoxver:2.00287 976805093803 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The same error occurs sometimes when I try to access hotmail.com and sometimes when trying to use search engine like Google and Yahoo. I have Norton 360 and sometimes I get a message that Firefox wa prevented from accessing another web page during a search, but that dialog box give me the opportunity to override.
With the client hello error, I get no options. If I try again, the Loading circle go into a busy loop.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Three example of how the problem occurs:
1. Type in a search string to Google or Yahoo. It happens.
2. ALSO if I try to access gmail account, it happens.
3. When Firefox loads, my homepage Google will not come up and I get the error.
Actual Results:
Window with description: ssl_error_rx_unexpected_client_hello

Expected Results:
I expected to get my search result or my email, but I did not.

I cleared my cache, history and cooky several times, in case there wa a corrupt file. No change in error results.
