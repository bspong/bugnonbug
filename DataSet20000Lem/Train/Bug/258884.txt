Bring back chrome bar below tab
With the landing of the (great) Winstripe theme, there wa a change to the
bottom of tab in Firefox. Before Winstripe, there wa a divider between the
bottom of the tab and the start of the web page. Now, there is no divider.

While this look ok initially with a web-site with a white-background, I think
we should bring back the divider.

Pinstripe on Mac OS X handle this nicely with a divider below the tab and
above the page content area (screenshot:

With Winstripe on Windows and Gnome now, the page run right into the bottom of
the tabs:

Here's how it looked before Winstripe landed (Qute):

I think it should have a divider for the following reasons:
- The edge look rough agains non-white background
When scrolling, there's not solid edge for the page to slide behind. This is
especially apparant when text on a white background is sliding under the tab -
you can get half of a line of text showing and it look oddly cut-off.
- The web page portion of the browser should be squarely framed - any opening in
that break up the page and can conflict with page contents.
