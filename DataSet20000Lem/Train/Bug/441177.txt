places.sqlite doe not import bookmark folder (from bookmarks.html AND respective backups) that contain so-called bookmarklets - that is, command-lines containing JS commands.
places.sqlite also DOES NOT backup folder CONTAINING bookmarklets

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.put a bookmarklet in a folder in bookmarks.html (ie using any non-FF3 version)
2.attempt to import that folder into places.sqlite in FF3, using the IMPORT html feature - it will NOT be imported
3. in FF3, about:config edit the pref: browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML to value TRUE
4)in FF3 - find and "bookmark" a booklet (examples at URL (http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/)
4) CLOSE FF3 (to write the backup to bookmarks.html)
5) open and check the content of the backup file - the Bookmarklet is not backed-up, nor is it written to the bookmarks.html file.
Actual Results:
NOT IMPORTING
folder containing BOOKMARKLETS are not available in places.sqlite
NOT EXPORTING / BACKING-UP
after closing FF3 BOOKMARKLETS are not copied/exported to the backup files, nor are the exported to the Bookmarks.html file

Expected Results:
on "IMPORT HTML" the complet bookmark file should be imported, including Bookmarklets
on CLOSING FF3, the COMPLETE places.sqlite "bookmark content" - including Bookmarklets - should be transferred to the back-up file AND to the Bookmarks.html filr (when the pref is set to TRUE, a stated above)

This bug is preventing the transfer of a COMPLETE file "Bookmarks.html" from version prior to FF§ into the places.sqlite DB.
It also prevents the (expected) backup and correct re-write of the *.html file on closure of FF3.
I lable it therefore a a MAJOR breakage!
