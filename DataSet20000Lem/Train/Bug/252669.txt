unable to initially select component for custom installation (items in the dialog are greyed out; unchangeable)
couldn't find an existing bug for this after several queries, but please dup if
needed.

found using recent aviary1.0 branch builds, eg, 2004-07-22-10-0.9 on WinXP. in
the course my testing I need to compare multiple builds, so my habit is to
install Firefox into a unique directory per build. because of this I always
chose Custom installations. however, when I get to the point of selecting
components, the option in that panel are initially disabled.

I'm not sure if this also occurs for those who install nightly build into the
same location --Asa or Tracy, do you encounter this issue?

1. grab a nightly installer build.
2. start the installer, accept the EULA and select Custom installation.
3. for the Install Folder panel, create a new directory for Firefox and select
it a the installation target.
4. click Next to the get to the Select Components panel.

expected: see a listbox of component with checkboxes you can choose from.

actual results: the listbox is disabled, and the bottom two choice (dev tools,
talkback (feedback agent)) are both selected. I cannot deselect them.

workaround: if I click Back, the Next, the Select Components listbox choice
become selectable. odd.
