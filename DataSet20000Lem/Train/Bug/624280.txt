Firefox trunk segfaults when started (in combination with an IBUS warning)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13

When I start a trunk build (checkout from mozilla-central), it segfaults:

bas@bas-laptop:~/mozilla/src/ff-opt/dist/bin$ ./firefox -P -no-remote

(firefox-bin:12555): IBUS-WARNING **: Connect to unix:abstract=/tmp/dbus-ReNkl5p1JN,guid=4f6f97a7851acef87fa9ae5d4c89ff5c failed: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-ReNkl5p1JN: Connection refused.
Attempting to load the system libmoon
Segmentation fault

Ibus came with Ubuntu when I installed Ubuntu, and I have never explicitly done anything with it, changed configuration or something else, therefore I guess (but I'm not sure) that the problem is with firefox.

Firefox build from trunk used to work well on this same system, say, 2 week ago. To be sure I also did a complete new checkout from mozilla-central and rebuild, but I got the same result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Checkout mozilla-central
2. Build it
3. Start firefox
Actual Results:
Get a segfault

Expected Results:
Get a working browser
