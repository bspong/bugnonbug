When I open any website (google, intellicast, ebay, etc) from my desktop, or by typing in the URL with Firefox, I will immediately get a Windows error message telling me that the site cannot be found, that I should check the spelling of the URL, etc. However, the site open almost a soon a the error message appears. This is very annoying even though I do get to where I want to go. When I use IE, the error message doe not appear. Firefox is my default browser and this happens consistently with every site I try to access, except for my homepage when I open Firefox. It is annoying enough that I am thinking about going back to IE. I am certain there ha to be an easy fix to this somewhere. Thanks, Help?
