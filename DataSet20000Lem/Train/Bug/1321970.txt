Entering an opening parens in Rules view kill lot of style from the page
Steps to reproduce:
1. Visit any website, e.g. https://www.wikipedia.org/
2. Open the inspector and focus the <html> element
3. On the first property for that element in the Rules view, replace the value by "(" (no quotes).

Result:
A lot of element in the page — if not all element — become unstyled.

Expected result:
The one property with an invalid value would be dropped, without affecting other property in that ruleset or other rulesets.

Details:
- I’m getting this kind of result with specific characters, but not all illegal values. In my tests, the main culprit are "(", "[" and "{".
- On the other hand, ")", "}" and "]" don’t seem to produce the same effect.
- If you close a parents, like "()" or "(((())))", the following style are not affected. This work for "[]" too.
- Closing curly bracket "{}" doe change the result but there is still some breakage going on.
- I’ve had experience — in my development work, not just when stress-testing this bug — where after this kind of breakage I couldn’t get back to a working state, and had to reload the page, sometimes losing a small amount of work I wa doing (prototyping CSS changes).

This bug affect me when writing valid CSS value such a "url(…)", because when I type "url(" everything go nut until I finish writing that value.
