I use backconnect sock proxy from fastsocks.ru. When I change proxy several time (10-100 times) through Tools->Options->Advanced->Network->Settings->Manual proxy configuration, the proxy change stop taking effect. I tried several other proxy when problem appears, but it doesn't work unless I restart Firefox. The problem doe not appear in Internet Explorer and Opera. I also use shortcut to get to the Manual proxy configuration (ALT+T, alt+o, alt+s).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools->Options->Advanced->Network->Settings->Manual proxy configuration
2. Go to http://linkworlds.net/displayer.php. The REMOTE_ADDR: show the current IP
3. Change proxy server and repeat the action 1 and 2

The proxy change usually stop taking effect within 100 time of repeating the action. Sometimes more repeated action are required
Actual Results:
Proxy change stop taking effect after repeated action

Expected Results:
The proxy change should continually take effect
