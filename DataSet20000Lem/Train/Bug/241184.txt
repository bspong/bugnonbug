Volume changed to zero in soundcard software on installation

I recently installed a CMedia sowndcard, (see http://www.cmedia.com.tw/
Home>Download>CMI8738 )
which ha software setting for volume,...in a program they call the "Mixer"
shortly after, I installed a trial of Firefox.
The sound disappeared, I opened the Mixer, and reset from 0 to a sensible
value, without associating the problem with Firefox.
On completing the trial, and deciding to make it the families' primary browser
I reinstalled it so that all user under XP could access it.
The sound disappeared again a previously described.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox
2.Run a program with sound (e.g. real audio)
3.Note the lack of sound
Actual Results:
The sound doe not appear. Opening the soundcard software Mixer show the main
volume ha been set to 0


Expected Results:
Leave volume level unchanged

The reason I am reporting this - I'm not a developer or techie - is that the
cause of the sound loss is unexpected, and thus the simple solution may be hard
to find for "normal users". Usually they wouldn't touch sound setting once
they are established, and leaf the arcane art of soundcard installation and
setting to a PC supporter.
