When creating form that post I often redirect to another page after the POST
ha been processed to avoid the "Your page contains postdata..." dialog when
people refresh or go back.

Now, after a person ha been redirect if they press the refresh button it
re-submits the form. Here is a case where this is undesirable:

Someone enters data into a form on a message board and press submit.
The form handler script process their message and then redirects them to the
page where they can see the threaded messages.
They want to refresh the page periodically to see if anyone reply to their
message, but instead, it submits the form again.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a PHP that ha two sections:
if(!$_POST){
// show a form

}else{
// handle the form
header("Location: Some.other.page.php");
exit;
}
2. Fill out the form and submit it
3. After being sent to the "some.other.page.php" press the refresh button.

Actual Results:
Form is submitted on each refresh.

Expected Results:
Mozilla, IE and previous version of Firefox simply refresh the page (using the
GET URI specified in the location bar).
