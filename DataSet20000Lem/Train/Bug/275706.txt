Firefox doe not identify itself correctly to iListen voice rec application (Firefox.app v firefox-bin ?)
IListen is the only currently developed and supported voice recognition
application on Macintosh, and is
very useful to those of u who cannot type for various reasons.

In iListen you can create custom command set for applications, and iListen
recognizes when and
application ha been started and activates it respective command set. You can
create a command set
for Thunderbird, but iListen doe not then recognize when the application ha
been started and so doe
not ever activate it command set. The iListen developer have this to say:

"We detect that a program is running by a notification from the
operating system of a "Application Switched" event. We get the
program's PSN from the event, then from that we get the PSN
information record. That record ha the application's name. We use
that name to match against the available application-specific command
sets. If we find a match, then that command set is loaded.

The program name must exactly match the command set name. Now Mac OS
X like to hide part of the name - the extension. So that program
might really be called "Thunderbird.app", but you see "Thunderbird".

If we can't get a program name because the application doe not have
a PSN (process serial number) or a corresponding PSN information
record, we can't load the command set."


Mozilla and Thunderbird have the same problem, but Camino doe not.
