Pages with mixed flash and html content don't reload from the cache (screen flick black) when mouse is moved over a link after clicking on the link
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

On a page with mixed HTML and flash content, clicking on a link and then moving the mouse quickly after the link ha been clicked cause the page to completely reload (as if it were not loading from the cache). This cause a momentary "flicker" of a blank page with a black background where all the content disappears and reloads. This ha been tested with NO JAVASCRIPT and flash content called directly in the html document with the same results. Noticed this same behaviour in Opera 9.6.4 (another gecko based browser).

I have tried changing the wmode for the swf between static and transparent, and the same behaviour is seen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Move mouse over a link.
2.Click on the link.
3.Quickly move the mouse over the area where the link text is displayed before the page loads.
Actual Results:
All page content (including the link that wa clicked) disappears and is reloaded again over a black background.

Expected Results:
Page content that didn't change should stay displayed on the screen with only the new content changing on the page.

No error are reported in the error console when this occurs.
