The download action dialog GUI is poor in many respects. it list pointless (as far a I can tell) and possibly conflictory column for extension and file type, and hide actually relevant mimetype data until you doubleclick. this lead the user to the confusion of seeing a given file extension in there, and then wondering why it isn't following their defined action when being sent with a different mimetype, for example. additionally, there is no option for adding a new filetype. the only way to add a filetype is to actually attempt to download such a file, and then select "do this every time" on the resulting dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open preference dialog and navigate to downloads pane.
2. Open download action dialog.

Actual Results:
See multiple action for various extension (e.g. MP3), unusual information for others (e.g. RAR), and no obvious way to add a new download action (or restore one you've deleted).

Expected Results:
See data that reflects the actual action association (mime type -> action), a well a a button to add a new download action.

there seems to be at least a few question per day about one of these topic on the mozillazine support forums.
