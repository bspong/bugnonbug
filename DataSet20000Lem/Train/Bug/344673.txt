xforms.xpi not being built for win and nix (maybe mac too) since around time of 2006/07/13 nightlies.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
cut/paste from a build log:

mkdir c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Trunk-Cairo/WINNT_5.2_Depend/mozilla/extensions/xforms && cd c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Trunk-Cairo/WINNT_5.2_Depend/mozilla/extensions/xforms && c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Trunk-Cairo/WINNT_5.2_Depend/mozilla/build/autoconf/make-makefile -t c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Trunk-Cairo/WINNT_5.2_Depend/mozilla -d ../..
make -C c:/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Trunk-Cairo/WINNT_5.2_Depend/mozilla/extensions/xforms
make: Entering directory `/cygdrive/c/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Trunk-Cairo/WINNT_5.2_Depend/mozilla/extensions/xforms'
make: *** No target specified and no makefile found. Stop.
make: Leaving directory `/cygdrive/c/builds/tinderbox/Fx-Trunk-Cairo/WINNT_5.2_Depend/mozilla/extensions/xforms'



Expected Results:
xforms.xpi should be built and ftp'ed to server

Looks like it's probably since checkin of bug 339568 .
