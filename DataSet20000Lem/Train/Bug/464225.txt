1. On the left side menu bar, point to 'Booking' and select 'Booking Request'.

2. New Booking submission form will be displayed. Please browse the form to find the section 'Broker' and click on 'Search & Register'.

3. A new pop up window will be displayed allowing you to select the Broker from a long list with appropriate Radio button. In the textbox displayed on top of the popup, type 'LAKSMI'. An autolist will be displayed for the typed name. Click on 'LAKSMI SHIPPING SERVICE'. Click on 'Go', so that you detail will be displayed below with a Radio button.

4. Now clicking on the 'Confirm' button will transfer the detail of the entry we selected in the space provided for 'Broker' details.
