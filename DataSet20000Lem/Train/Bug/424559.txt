I'm using a Fujitsu v5505 laptop. If the computer go to sleep, when it's woken Firefox is able to establish connection to new/current website open in the tab for about 20 mins. After that it won't connect to any website at all. If I close firefox (File>Exit or click the X), Firefox doesn't end properly. I have to go to the task manager and close the process. And then if I open Firefox again, it will connect to site for about 30 min before the same problem occurs. the only way to stop this is to reboot windows. My connection is ok, a I can open website in IE7 when this problem occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Let laptop go to sleep
2.Wake laptop
3.Browse for around 20 minute
4.Close firefox from File>Exit
5.Stop the process in Task Manager
6.Restart firefox.
7.reboot Vista
Actual Results:
Firefox work normally once Vista is restarted - until the computer go to sleep again.

Expected Results:
Connect to websites. End the process upon Exit

I only have the DOM plugin installed. I normally have 8-9 tab open. I haven't tried it with just one tab to see if it still doe this. My tab reopen when I restart firefox.
