firefox improperly applies standard compliance mode based on DTD not error in page

If there is a valid DTD at the beginning of the (x)htm(l) file, firefox assumes it's a valid file, even when gecko report invalid code. As a result, the invalid website is parsed in standard compliance mode instead of quirk mode. If IE start requiring DTDs (for invalid, MSIE compatible code), quirk mode won't work at all because it will never be triggered. To reproduce:

I KNOW what a DTD is. It mean "I am using valid code of format foo." But if the code is not valid (and the DTD is), surely it make sense to switch to quirk mode? Suppose Microsoft changed MSIE to require a DTD? The web designer would figure this out and spread it by way of blog, and all of a sudden, the Internet (tm) doesn't work on firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. have a standard incompliant html authoring program installed (e.g. Dreamweaver)
1. Make a fairly complex web page/site (offline of course)
2. Confirm the presence of and/or add a valid doctype declaration per the instruction somewhere at www.w3c.org
3. View the page in Firefox. Check the page property (right click -> view page info).
Actual Results:
It will be in "standards compliance mode."

Expected Results:
Since your page is littered with invalid code, it should have switched to quirk mode at some point during rendering.

I wasn't entirely certain what to set severity to, so I left it at Normal. You might even call this an enhancement, if you look at it the right way...
