I would love Google's new Browse by Name feature to be the default keyword.URL
for Firefox, you can read all about it at
http://toolbar.google.com/bbn_help.html and since Jesse found the URL (see the
Bug URL) it shouldn't be too difficult to change.
As I see it there are a number of pro and con to this change:

+Mis-typed word won't send you to a potentially not nice URL, instead Google
will try to correct you on it search page
+Likewise, general term typed in the Location Bar won't take you somewhere
unexpected
+If Browse by Name doesn't go straight to a page when certain keywords are used
a user could always override it using a Bookmarks Keyword
+Provides a strong compromise to those who want to see a normal Google Search
being default

-Behaviour's not 100% predictable
-New documentation and explaination is needed, see

- Google us a special cursor to show when a user is being taken to a URL, we
might have to do something similar (more work.)
