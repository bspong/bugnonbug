Mouseover/Rollover Images No Longer Work -- WinXP SP2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

I hope that this is some easily solvable problem, but ever since I installed RC2
of the Windows XP Service Pack 2 mouseover / rollover image no longer work. For
example, in the above website, the icon on the left (academics, info, etc)
should turn yellow during mouseover. It still doe it in IE, but not firefox. As
far a I can tell, this happens to all such image everywhere on the net.

I can try to uninstall XP/SP2 tomorrow at my work machine to correct the problem
and verify that it is the SP that is cauing the difficulty.

I should also note that in IE (with SP2), a warning pop up whenever a page
contains mouseover images, and it attempt to block the javascript (which stop
the image from changing). I really hope that Microsoft didn't force this
"security" feature on all browsers. I have supposedly disabled this feature--now
mouseovers work on IE, but still not in Firefox. :(

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Win XP SP2
2. Go to a web page that contains rollover/mouseover image
3. Note that the image do not change a they should (and do in IE)

Actual Results:
Nothing Happens (Images do not change)

Expected Results:
Images should change on mouseover
