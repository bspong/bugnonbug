Firefox will not connect to the network

With Windows XP Pro 5.1.2600 Service pack 2 Build 2600:
After upgrading from Firefox 2.0.0.14 to 2.0.0.15
the installer request to quit Firefox and restart.
Upon a restart, it could not connect to www.google.com
nor any other webpage (including mozilla.org)
Attempting to "upgrade" again resulted in a message
"could not connect to AUS"

I had to use ie7 to get to the mozilla website to find a solution.
No comment/solution wa found.
I decided to download "Firefox Setup 2.0.0.15.exe".
Before attempting to uninstall and reinstall Firefox,
I decided to reboot.
Apparently rebooting did the trick.
The upgraded Firefox could connect to the network.

I think a clear reference to having to reboot
should be on the website.
Other Firefox "upgrades" did not run into this problem

QED
