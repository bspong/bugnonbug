Since I updated my Firefox I can't open multiple tab without receiving and error message : a script on this page ha been stopped due to a low memory condition
and it either start freezing, crashing, or the text is all jumbled up!

Where I never had any problem before even if I opened 8 tab ! I do a lot of digital photo work and designing and have to access several website and online storage site to keep my work animated, so it is crucial that I have the ability to continue to open a many tab a necessary without my browser crashing, freezing, or receiving the above error message.

This is getting very frustrating. I don't have this problem with the other browsers, but I love Firefox and would love to continue using it if I could resolve this problem.

Looking forward to getting this resolved and thanking you in advance for any help you may be able to give me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Firefox open but is slow
2.Once opened it work well a long a I only use one tab
3.Once I open another tab I get the error message: a script on this page ha been stopped due to a low memory condition
4.I have plenty of memory space on my PC and virtual memory check out fine
5.When a second or more tab is opened sometimes not only do I receive the above error message but the word on the newly opened tab will be jumbled up and some of the info will be missing on the site pages, e.g. add a photo tab, etc.



I wa using the Nasa Theme, but I uninstalled it and went to the normal theme thinking a conflict between the update info and this may be the issue, but it still didn't resolve the problem.
