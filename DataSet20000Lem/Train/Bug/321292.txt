Intensive image browsing cause various situation in FF

I wa browsing a forum which serf a lot of image through Imagevenue and Imageshack. Those image hosters use Javascript to display first a resized image and on a click to display the original size (actually the image is loaded in the original size anyway, only the script make the resize first).

Now, after hundred of picture I had several effect in FF 1.5:
- image are not displayed anymore with size larger than the monitor screen size: image larger than the monitor screen size are not shown. Switching the tab to another one and back show up the image a expected.
- image after not loaded anymore: I had the case (reproduceable) that large image are not loaded anymore (sizes above the monitor screen). Even the function "Show image" showed me an error page that the picture wa not found on the server. If the picture is embedded in HTML a broken image is displayed instead. The picture exists on the server for sure. Closing and loading the picture again showed me the picture a expected.
- memory grows significant: the memory usage of FF grows and grows. It went up to 200MB on a machine having 1GB memory. After a while FF dropped down to about 65MB, but still got stuck and slowly when opening new tabs. Only solution: restarting FF

All these effect happen after about 2 hour intensive image browsing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take about 2 hour time
2. Browse Imageshack or Imagevenue image (best is to take a forum serving image hosted on those services)
3. Open 10 new tab with viewing the images, close them, open anoterh 10 new ones, close them again, and so on. Reproduce that for the next 2 hour and your browser will run into weird problems. :)

Actual Results:
- Browser get slow
- Eats up memory, free it after a while but still get stuck
- Does not show image anymore which are larger than the monitor screen size (most important negative effect!)


I know that this bug is surely hard to reproduce. I surfe a lot of image a day and it get weird, specially when you collect image and do not know anymore if the not shown image is because it is really missing on the server or your browser simply do not show them anymore.
