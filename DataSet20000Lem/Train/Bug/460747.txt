Under Linux, Firefox3 ignores any printer setting entered and system printer settings.
Regardless of input (or system defaults) FF3 print from MultiPurpose-tray non-duplex and upside down!.

This is specifically a Forefox 3 issue - Firefox 2 work correctly.

The printer used is an Epson C4200 via cup

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any webpage
2. File | print
3. Check the printer setting are correct and the correct paper tray is selected (i.e. 'Cassette 1')
4. Press 'OK'
Actual Results:
The printer will now prompt for paper in the MultiPurpose tray, (even though cassette 1 wa selected).
If printing portrait, the page is also printed upside down - (i.e. the bottom of the page exit the printer first!)

Expected Results:
The printer should print via cassette 1 (and right way up) a per the dialogue.

This is specifically a Firefox 3 issue. Firefox 2 (and every other application I have tried) print properly.
