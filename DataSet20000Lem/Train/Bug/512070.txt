When I go to any website wherein payment ha to be done, the website redirects me to payment gateway (citi bank gateway - india). At the first screen, I enter all the credit card detail and click the submit button. The gateway directs me to error page saying the transaction failed a the user pressed back/forward button, or browser cooky are disabled/not supported or session ha expired.

If I navigate the same gateway & website using the mozilla's "ie tab plugin" in browser the payment work out properly. This ha happened with my transaction for 2-3 time due to which I am not able to use firefox for payment websites. (The total time from logging in to reaching payment gateway with error is approximately 1-2 min). I have checked for cooky and they are enabled & working properly (for email accounts).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any payment related website
2.Go to payment gateway
3.After entering all the credit card detail when submit button is clicked an error page is raised saying that transaction failed a back/forward button pressed or cooky are disabled or session expired.
Actual Results:
Transactions fails due to session expiration/ cooky not supported/ navigation error.

Expected Results:
The transaction should end a successful.
