Have to login twice to HP Systems Insight Manager (HPSIM) 4.0

When accessing HPSIM, it is necessary to enter the login credential twice. The
first time, user are returned directly to the login page almost a if the login
failed. The second time they login, everything work a expected. The actual
HPSIM application appears to work a normal once logged in.

This happens on XP workstation connecting remotely, and also on the Windows2000
Server when using it locally.

I cannot test this with HPSIM4.1, a there is no upgrade path from 4.0 to 4.1.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open HPSIM login page
2. Enter credential and hit login
3. Enter credential again, and then work a normal

Actual Results:
The first login return me to the login page without any errors. The second
login open up the main management window a normal.

Expected Results:
It should only be necessary to login to HPSIM once.

MS IE Patch MS04-025 caused IE to block access to HPSIM (more info here
http://h18004.www1.hp.com/products/servers/management/hpsim/index.html).
Firefox wa our saviour, a it wa unaffected by the IE patch and allowed u to
access the system. HP released an updated Java login component to allow patched
version of IE to login to HPSIM once more. Firefox's need to login twice
happened both before and after this patch, which lead me to believe it may be
something to do with the way Firefox is handling this login applet. That is, of
course, merely wild speculation on my part.
