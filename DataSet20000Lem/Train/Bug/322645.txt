When selecting an area from a web page to print and epecially when more non-default setting are applied, printing is either not achieved at all a Mozilla then 'encounters a problem and need to close', or the printing is invariably faulty with most icon and picture displaying thickish grey and black horizontal line instead of the intended icon and picture of the page concerned. This doe not occur with Internet Explorer.
My printer is an HP Deskjet 1220C.
Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Web Page. E.g. 'My eBay' item.
2. Select area of reproduction with mouse.
3. Go to File - Print Preview - Page Setup (set up a required) - Print (preferences a required) - OK
4. Mozilla 'has encounterd a problem and need to close' OR printing is with most icon and picture obliterated by grey and black horizontal line (even Link icons)




Printed properly, a previously. Please note that this ha only been encountered after installing Mozilla Firefox 1.5, but this could be coincidental. The problem is le so if no area Selection is made and if Default setting are applied. However the tendency to occur still exists to an extend if the attempt ha been preceded by a faulty/failed one without then closing and re-opening Mozilla.
