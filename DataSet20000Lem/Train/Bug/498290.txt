Couldn't open Firefox or Internet Explorer 8 after downloading Firefox 3.5B4.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11

I downloaded and installed Firefox 3.5B4 over the current public version, Firefox 3.11. I then tried opening Firefox or Internet Explorer. During this time I also opened the Task Manager and looked to see if Firefox or Internet Explorer 8 wa working. The process were running, but they weren't starting. I then rebooted and tried to open IE8 and Firefox 3.5B4 again and it still didn't work. I then went to My Computer>Control Panel> Add or Remove Programs. I then uninstalled Firefox 3.5B4 but still kept the other Firefox (Firefox version 3.11.) I then opened Firefox and IE8 after uninstalling the Firefox 3.5B4 version portion of it and it worked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Uninstalled Firefox 3.5B4 portion of Firefox.
2.Opened up Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox and it worked.
3.

Actual Results:
Internet Explorer 8 and Firefox 3.11 were again starting up.

Expected Results:
Would have installed a file that stopped from Firefox or other browser from opening.

I thought my system had gotten damaged, but I wa wrong and is working like it wa before I downloaded and installed the Firefox 3.5B4 portion of Firefox.
