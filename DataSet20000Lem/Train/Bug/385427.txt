I have a calendar system which us Javascript DOM to update a DIV with the current time. When the time is updated it writes to the innerHTML of a layer within the calendar (the current date). This happens every 0.5 seconds.

When tabbed browsing is enabled, Firefox writes empty line break below my calendar. When tabbed browsing is not enabled (by closing the tab or opening a new window) the calendar time work fine without writing new line break until the page is refreshed.

I've looked through all of my code and it's verified by the W3C, so I don't believe that my code is in error. Also, it probably wouldn't work at time when the tab are not enabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Not sure, but I have javascript writing layer into layer within HTML layer and tables. I'm not sure how reproduceable it is unless I provide exact code.

2.
3.


Expected Results:
Not write extra line breaks.
