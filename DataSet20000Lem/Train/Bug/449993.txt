This "firefox-bugreport.txt" wa generated at some point on one machine, I'm not sure what caused the bugreport and I'm not sure it's related. The problem, that the first page in a new window is bare html, however, seems to occur in both SuSE 11 installs I'm running (on two different machines), it occurs in Gnome, KDE3.5.9, KDE4.1, and with or without NVidia driver installed.

The URL is to a screen capture and an possibly related auto-generated bug report. The URL for the page Firefox display is http://nielsolson.us/index.html

Here is the text of the "firefox-bugreport.txt" that wa generated, though again, *I have no idea if this is related to the bug I am reporting*, especially since I only got this bug report on one machine, which, a I think about it, may have been related to some really bad audio from KDE4's phonon earlier today when I wa painting the livingroom. But I'm not sure, so I'll give you the text of that auto-generated bug report, in case it's related. But just to make sure, let me say again, I'm not sure it's related. I'm sorry, I just don't know.

Since I can't cut and paste it, it's in the URL above.
