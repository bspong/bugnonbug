1. In firefox 3.0.1, after acknowledging the warning gmail encounter a transmission problem. You have to turn the warning off in gmail instead of just acknowledging the warning.

2. This warning turn off from time to time for no apparent reason. Most recently, it went away when firefox 3.0.1 downloaded.

3. I deserve a medal for omitting the obscenity in this one. In light of 1 and 2, I just sent a password to "The Netscape Unofficial FAQ" with no encryption. Those idiot promptly sent it back to me in email. I'm done with that page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the warning. Upgrade from whatever I wa running before to 3.0.1.
2. Sorry, I don't usually notice right away and I am not usually sure what got me. I Don't know how to reproduce this one. I guess just set the option and check it more often. Is it possible for a script to clear this without me receiving a warning message?
3. Go to The Netscape Unofficial FAQ (http://www.ufaq.org/) and create a new account. Then remove them from the link on your web page. Then forward this report to them after inserting swear words.
Actual Results:
1. gmail keep coming back with:
Oops... the system encountered a problem (#103) - retrying in XXs
2. I end up signing up for a new website which doesn't encrypt the message a you establish the new password which make me angry.


This is a security problem so long a there are web page a incompetent a the one for Unitrin insurance and the one for the Netscape Unofficial FAQ
