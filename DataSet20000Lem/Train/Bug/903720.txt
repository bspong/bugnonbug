Add the ability to not "Always show the tab bar"
We should re-add the ability to not "Always show the tab bar" a a built-in setting:

1. On lower-end device having display with low vertical pixel counts, hiding the tab bar is very helpful in making room for page contents. Installing an add-on on a low-end device to do this would require more resource than if it were a built-in setting.

2. Hiding tab when they are not needed is a common and natural UI behavior. Quickly surveying my desktop, many mature application do so: GVim, GNOME Terminal, Files, etc. I believe this behavior is more common than the alternative of always showing tabs. Keeping a single tab open is inconsistent with the majority of applications.

3. The feature itself is lightweight and add minimal complexity. Requiring the user to install an add-on for a basic configuration is anti-minimalistic.

This enhancement would partially or fully revert the change made in bug 855370. The reason that change are problematic, which I have listed above, were apparently not considered or discussed in that bug.

This enhancement is not a duplicate of existing bugs. Bug 903384, bug 901974, and bug 877479 invalidly reported the lack of the "Always show the tab bar" a a fault, when it wa an intended change. This bug recognizes that removing the setting wa an intended change, and proposes re-adding the setting a an enhancement for the reason listed above. Bug 855370 proposed removing the feature a an enhancement, so it seems equally valid to propose adding the feature a an enhancement.
