see below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On any web site, click on the site icon (left of the location bar).
2. Click on the "Tell me more about this web site..." link.
3. Without clicking on any other area, click on a button of the newly opened page info window.
4. Try step 3 again.
Actual Results:
After step 1, the Location pop-up open (correctly).
After step 2, the page info window open (correctly).

But the Location pop-up is still present and ha the focus. This is incorrect.

In step 3, instead of activating the button, clicking only remove the
focus from the Location pop-up and close this pop-up.

The expected action of the button (e.g. view cookies) is not activated.
This is incorrect and confusing for the user:
I want to click on a button and don't see the expected action.

Only in step 4, the button click produce the expected result.

Expected Results:
After step 2, the focus should be removed from the "Location pop-up" and
the "Location pop-up" should be closed.

In step 3, the button click should result in the expected action.

I don't know the official name of the UI elements.
I made up the name "site icon", "Location pop-up" and "page info window".
I hope the bug report is understandable nevertheless.
