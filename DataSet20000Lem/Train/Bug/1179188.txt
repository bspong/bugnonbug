When Firefox lags, text character typed during the lag are repeatedly output when typing thereafter until it is restarted
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Build ID: 20150511103303

Steps to reproduce:

I have this problem whenever I experience lag in Firefox and I'm typing at the time. Examples can be:
- Loading a new tab and starting to type an email
- Typing a message in one tab while something in another tab cause the browser to lag (e.g. a slow loading page, video etc)


Actual results:

If I start typing, then it lags, it seems to 'remember' some of the character I wa typing.

When the lag ha passed and I continue typing, those character keep getting output in the middle of the text I'm writing, at regular intervals.

So, if I wa typing:

"It's a nice day today"

and it lagged on "nice d"

Then when I am typing

"But it's really rather warm"

it appears a

"But it's nice dreally rather warm"

I have this happen frequently and this affect all Firefox tabs, even if I close them and open, it's still happening. Other application are fine - I can type the text into Kate and copy/paste into wherever I want the text to go, and it doe not include the random chunk of text.

The only way I've found to get around this is to restart firefox, thereafter the problem resolve until the next lag. Sometimes this can be week between it happening, sometimes hours.

The most common place I find it happen is Gmail, where I am writing an email in a compose window.

I use Kubuntu with Firefox 38 and I had this problem on 14.04, 14.10 and still on 15.04 so it's been long standing, but haven't ever reported it.

I have never had this problem on my phone with Firefox Beta.


Expected results:

The text I type should not have random character being inserted!
