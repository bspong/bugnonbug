One of the most popular search engine addition for Firefox is the
"Wikipedia" addition. Currently Firefox ha several generic web searchers,
and a dictionary, but no encyclopedia by default.
Normal user are very familiar with using encyclopedias, and encyclopedia
are very broadly useful, so it's a capability that most user would find useful.
Also, Wikipedia's development approach is very consonant with the
Firefox development approach - the two project have much in common, and
highlighting Wikipedia will probably help highlight Firefox a well.
It also creates a special ability in Firefox that it competitor don't have -
it then come with a built-in capability to search an encyclopedia.

Yes, obviously people can add Wikipedia a a search option. But by
including it by default, EVERYONE can do it, without having to install
anything. Since it's a very popular addition, it'd be great to build it in.

Note this is a generalization of bug 268166.
