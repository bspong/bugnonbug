In serveral online forums(like Fark.com), when refreshing the page in IE or Safari, the browser keep the current place, and you are free to continues scrolling down and read the conversation, and this is the type of beharior that is to be expected when you reload a page. Unfortunatly, when I do this in Firefox, it seems to keep it's position in relation to the bottom of the page, thus making the reader have to scroll back up and find the original position, before continuing reading. If anything, it would be nice to have some sort of option that allows you to specify keeping the position in relation to the top of the page instead of the bottom.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with forums, like Fark.com, and enter on of the disscusions.
2. Scroll near the bottom of the page so that the last couple comment are visible, and the begining of comment box.
3.Wait a moment(like how long it may take to read the comments) and then refresh the page
(Note: the actual position in page noted above is just to make it easier to see what is going on with an easy point of referance after the refresh)
Actual Results:
Assuming new comment were added, ffter the refresh, the previous comment I wa viewing are now "above" my browser window, thus cause me to have to scroll up to find them again.

Expected Results:
I should have found myself at the same comment I wa at, thus able to continue scrolling down and continue reading.
