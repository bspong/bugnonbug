Firefox display from 2 different server over X11 forwarding are merged to one process on the first server and no new window is created (tab is added to existing window)

I recently noticed something strange with X11 forwarding Firefox over SSH. I wa running X11 on my Mac (OS X Server 10.4.8) and had two separate SSH session open to two different Linux box (I used the -X flag). I started Firefox on the first box and then subsequently started Firefox on the second box. But instead of starting a new process on the second box a new process wa spawned on the first box - I ran top to verify this and there wa no Firefox process running on the second box, while there were two on the first ! I tried this a bunch of time and still
the same thing happened. I've also tested this on a Windows box using putty and Xming(or any other X window client) and still the same result. I have also tried connecting to the Linux box using the SSH -Y flag and still the same result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. SSH -X (or Y) to any linux box that ha Firefox installed
2. SSH -X (or Y) to any second linux box that ha Firefox installed (while still running firefox on the first box)
3. Notice that the new process that should have fired up on the second box ha actually just jumped to the first box a another tab. No new process actually start on the first box.
Actual Results:
Firefox opened a new tab on the firefox window from the first box

Expected Results:
Firefox should have started a new process on the second box with a seperate window being displayed back to the user.

It appears to have something to do with X forwarding
