In print preview or even after printing it, picture e.g. on page 11 and 12 of
preview are cut. If two picture are horizontally next to each other, the first
part of the left picture is printed on the first page and on the following page
there is blank space for this part. The right picture is printed correctly
non-cut on the second page. This problem is in all versions!
It would be a lot better, if both picture were printed on the second page only
and on the first page there is a bit blank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open print preview
2. go to page 11/17
3. there is the problem at the bottom and the rest is on the above part of page 12
(at the end of page 12 the same happens again)
This happens on other pages, too.

Actual Results:
The left of the 2 picture is half on page 11 and the second half is on page 12
under a blank part, where the first part of the picture should be.


Expected Results:
Both picture printed on page 12! The same should happen, if there's only one
picture at the end of the page. Only if picture are longer than page this is
after a question: "Do you want to scale it down, or print it over to pages?" ok.
For scaling "image zoom" extension is available.

This happens on every page with picture at the end of the page!
