it worked previously, but now the History bar on the left is blank when I click on "By Last Visited" or "By Most Visited." I have not and am not clearing my history. It is still all visible when I use "By Date."

If I leave it up and browse the web, it will repopulate, but if I click a different sort and then click By Last Visited again, it will be blank again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select View, Sidebar, History on the menu.
2. Click View.
3. Select By Last Visited or By Most Visited.

Optional
4. Select By Date.
5. Select By Last Visited or By Most Visited again.
Actual Results:
The Sidebar will be blank.

Expected Results:
The Sidebar should be populated with all of the website that I have visited.

I use Firefox Portable and I have been successfully using Microsoft SyncToy in order to copy my setting back and forth. I have been successfully doing this for about 9 month without this problem.
