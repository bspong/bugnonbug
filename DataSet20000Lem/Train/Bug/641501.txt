CPU usage very high with many tab open. Pages are idle, content is 100% loaded, CPU is veryhigh.

I loaded 67 tab in chrome, safari and Firefox 3.6.15 and Firefox 4.0 RC1. The Firefox 4.0 RC1 build us at least one complete core just being idle and sometimes go over 100% of one CPU and 50% into the second CPU without even counting what the plugin container is doing, thats another 20%.

These page are not loaded with dynamic content, JS, or flash that is outrageous, so I dont understand how CPU usage could be this high.

I noticed this when testing firefox 4.0 a the laptop got hot for the first time since I've owned it, over 4 month now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start 67 tab - should not be overly rich, just basic news site
2. let them finish loading
3. watch how bad idle CPU is
Actual Results:
result now is that firefox 4.0 rc1 is at least triple 3.6.15 wa in the same situation. safari and chrome are much better a well.

Expected Results:
Why should idle page and idle content melt the CPU. CPU usage should be at most 25% of one CPU core.

Please take these seriously - with all the browser being optimized for embedded usage, tablets, phones, laptops, it CRITICAL that browser respect power usage and heat creation in portable devices.
