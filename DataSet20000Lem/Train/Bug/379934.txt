firefox.exe cause 99% CPU usage on any textbox edit
User-Agent: Opera/9.20 (Windows NT 5.1; U; de)
Build Identifier: 2.0.0.3 (de)

When I am editing any textbox on a web site (e.g. google search input box) or the Firefox frontend (e.g. URL entry or empbedded google search) the browser hangs. This can be single/double clicking, pressing a key or paste within such an inputbox. This cause ~99% CPU usage and a slight increasement of memory usage (from about 70'000K to 95'000K) of firefox.exe. I have waited about 5 minutes, then firefox get responsible again. This happens only the first time in any session. Every further interaction is just fine until re-starting Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox.
2. Click into any textbox.
3. See the process hanging with 99 % CPU usage.
Actual Results:
The process firefox.exe is using about 99 % of CPU usage for about 5 minutes. Afterwards, when the task is getting responsible again, the interaction work fine until restarting Firefox.

Expected Results:
Let me handle it a usual ;) !

I have followed the guidance of http://kb.mozillazine.org/Firefox_hangs already:

1a. Restarting Firefox.
1b. Rebooting the operating system and starting Firefox.
2a. Disabling all extension and theme and restart Firefox.
2b. De-installing all extension and themes.
3a. Starting Firefox in fail-safe mode without any addon.
3b. Resetting all setting within fail-safe mode.
4a. De-installing and re-installing the latest release of Firefox (2.0.0.3).
4b. Deleting all remeining file after de-installation (e.g. profiles) and re-installation of Firefox.

It seems like the problem is popping up since the latest release and/or the latest patchday by Microsoft. However, I can't reproduce the problem on any other host and/or plattform.
