Since upgrading to Firefox 3, Microsoft's Windows Live (my.live.com) time out a lot on the r feeds. This happens on every Firefox 3 install I use, but not Firefox 2. It also work fine on IE7+8. Only some of the r feed display.

Since upgrading to Firefox 3, Microsoft's Windows Live (my.live.com) time out a lot on the r feeds. This happens on every Firefox 3 install I use, but not Firefox 2. It also work fine on IE7+8. Only some of the r feed display.

I therefore have to use either IE or use a different my homepage such a igoogle, or my.yahoo.com. igoogle is no good a it only support 3 columns, and my.yahoo.com is no good a it ha adverts.

I use my.live.com a my homepage, but it's frustrating using Firefox 3 because only some of the feed now work.

Thanks
