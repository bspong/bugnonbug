nbsp in list cause getChildAtIndex to fail

This one took a VERY LONG time to track down. If one embeds an &nbsp; in a list, it will cause the accessible hierarchy for the list to become corrupt - you can get what seems to be a valid child count, but getChildAtIndex will return None.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open attached HTML content in Firefox. It might be illegal HTML, but it's a snippet from a test HTML document tossed at u by the Firefox team.
2. Run the attached test program.
3. Arrow up and down in the HTML content. You'll see the ERROR line(s).
