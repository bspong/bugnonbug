firefox (all) hang when viewing page with a lot of text

I wish I could get more detail on why this is happening, but here's what I've
got. When I'm using any version of Firefox that I can find (nightly builds,
alphas, bettas, stable releases) I consistently run into a problem where it
will open normally, load the homepage normally, and then a soon a I start
browsing around to different site it will (seemingly) randomly lock up for a
long a a minute. In that time, the window doe not respond AT ALL. I can't
scroll, I can't exit, minimize, open links, new tabs, etc. The only page I
have found that consistenly doe it is the "Most Frequently Reported Bugs"
page for bugzilla. Does not happen exclusively on http pages. Tried
uninstalling and reinstalling, installing different version with new
profiles, still no dice.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open browser
2. go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/duplicates.cgi?
sortby=delta&reverse=1&maxrows=100&changedsince=30
3. scroll up and down until it hang

Actual Results:
browser hangs, cant close the window at all

Expected Results:
should have continued to respond

pretty high end machine. no stability problem with any other programs.
