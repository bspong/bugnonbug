In tools--> Options under home page click on "Use Bookmark" button. Now select a
folder from your bookmark and click ok. Now when one reopens the browser,
firefox try to open all the bookmars under the folder specified. But it load
some and fails to load some with an alert. If we change the homepage to some
other page, problem still persists. Restart of browser doe not help. But
rebooting the system solves the problem

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto Tools--> Options. From Home Page setting click "Use Bookmark"
2. Select "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder". Click Ok
3. Close the browser and start it again
4. Some link are loaded while others fail to load
5. Set any other page a homepage. Restart the browser
6. Firefox still fails to load the homepage

Actual Results:
When the browser is started again some of the link from the bookmark load while
others fail with an alert message.

Expected Results:
The firefox should open with all the tab loading link properly. If we do not
want the user to specify multiple url a homepage then the Options UI should
not allow a user to set them in this fashion

Restart of system cure the problem
