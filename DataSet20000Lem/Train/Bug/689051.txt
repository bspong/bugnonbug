drop the drop shadow on the back button for Windows 7
Created attachment 562321
side by side view of back button with and without drop shadow

+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #603790 +++

We removed the drop shadow from most toolbar button in bug 603790. There's still a slight shadow effect created by having the bottom border of the button be darker than the top borders. This is nice and look great.

The one button that didn't get this same treatment is the large circular back button. That button still ha a slight drop shadow.

That button is unique in our toolbar in that it's large and round and sort of sits "on top" of the forward button. It might make some "physical" sense for the back button to feel raised up off of the toolbar but I don't think it make for an ideal visual sense.

I propose that we fully drop the drop shadow on the back button and rely on the top and bottom border color difference to give it all the raised quality it needs.

I've attached a screenshot of the current button and the minor modification to it I've made of removing the drop shadow. You can see the two side-by-side at regular size and magnified to see the differences. It's subtle, but I think it's a win.
