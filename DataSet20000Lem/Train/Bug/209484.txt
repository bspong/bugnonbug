While using Firebird a default browser and Thunderbird (061303 Build) a
default E-Mqail client the following occurs whenever a URL is clicked in a
HTML-formatted message, the following error message is issued by Thunderbird:
"Error launching browswer window
TypeError:Components.classes['@mozilla.org/appshell/component/browser/instance.1']
ha no properties."

When using Thunderbird with other default browsers, i.e. Safari, Thunderbird and
Safari link properly whenever a URL is clicked in a message within Thunderbird.

Firebird work properly with other e-mail client such a GNUMail, Mail.app, etc.

Reproducible: Always

1.Set Firebird a default browser in OSX.
2.Set Thunderbird a default e-mail client in OSX.
3.Click on Thunderbird's throbber, or any URL in a HTML-formatted email message

Actual Results:
See details.

Expected Results:
Firbird should have gone to the web site represented by the URL in the e-mail
message.

Talkback wa not invoked. To clear the error message in Thunderbird I had to
force quit the app and relaunch it.
