There is no way of controlling the text size output on printing or print preview. Altering the size on the page ha no effect. I wa trying to print bank statement at a reasonable size and wa forced to go back to IE6 to manage it.

This bug may very well be a duplicate, and I've found some like it, such a 304412, but it seems to have existed since 2003 and this bug is in Firefox 1.5! It keep getting classed a 'minor', but that's wrong a it is a lack of functionality at a basic level. Class it higher and it might stand a chance of being fixed.

I'm running Firefox 1.5 (latest thus far) on XP SP2 with all update through Dec 2005 bulletin. However, I doubt you care a this seems to be a bug that reproduces on everything for the past two or three years.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Resize text on a page.
2. Try print preview or just print.
3. Screw up printed page and throw in bin. Yell, scream, shout, thump computer.

Actual Results:
My computer love me but won't let me control print size.

Expected Results:
A lovely result would be that I can control print size on printout of web pages.

No theme in use.

Consult bug I mentioned above and trace it back in time for maximum embarrassment to Mozilla. Cringe over your coffee cup.

Do not class a minor or it'll still be here in 2007. Firefox look silly when IE6 can outperform it so easily.

Emotions caused by bug: Stupid shock and disbelief that Firefox failed.
Irritation at having to use IE6 for something so simple.
Frustration at time consuming nature of reporting bug.
Hope that someone might fix this, finally.

Strength of tea now required (I'm English): Spoon remains vertical in cup.
