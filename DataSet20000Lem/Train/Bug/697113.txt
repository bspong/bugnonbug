Muscle Memory security issue with Open Link (on link in text the context menu offer "Open link" where "Copy" usually is)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110817101822

Steps to reproduce:

Find a domain name that doe not use IDN character and is not a hyperlink.
Highlight text with mouse
Look at contextual menu for what to do with highlighted text


Actual results:

First option is "Open Link"


Expected results:

First option should have been "Copy".
The reason - muscle memory can result in opening a url that the user intends to copy and not open.

Two example of where this might be bad - text page describing:

- This new exploit JavaScript can be found in the wild at www.evilpenguin.tld

I highlight www.evilpenguin.tld to copy it to add it to my company proxy blacklist, but due to muscle memory, instead of copying - I open the link.

Example two -

"Hey kids, want to see a cool easter egg? copy www.cooltrick.tld and paste it into twitter!"

people then accidentally open link due to muscle memory for where they expect copy to be.

Copy is used often enough at the top of the contextual menu after highlighting text in a browser (and other apps) that FireFox should not make it the first item when a domain name is highlighted - especially when such domain name is not a hyperlink already.

If offering to open link, place that option further down in menu (and have some consistency - don't behave differently for IDN domain name than traditional)
