After some of the upgrade unsure if it's 2.005 or 2.004 have noticed that if i have lot of tab opened and after pc come from hibernation,firefox seem to be incapable of resolving those website or new one without me having to close it completely and restart firefox. I don't believe this is a problem with router or my dns server co internet explorer work fine. The page would just be saying loading and will never completely load and after a while(long time 5mins+) i finally get page cannot be found(normal dns error). The only i can take care of this is to open a brand new firefox after making sure the previous one and all it's tab are closed . This seem to happen after several hibernation sessions.

Expected Results:
