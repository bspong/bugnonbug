When any scripted window (with window.open method) open in javascript, new window opened open in different (always 1st monitor), where else we use dual monitor desktop (iMac with additional ViewSonic monitor).

When we open same website on Internet Explorer and Javascript effect open new window on the same monitor where the parent (opener) window resides.

But on firefox this window open always in first monitor, this cause problem a user press some button like open and they expect window coming on their screen which open in different monitor.

This procedure work well with Safari on mac, window and IE on windows. Firefox fails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Dual Monitor
2. Switch Firefox to 2nd or 3rd monitor
3. Open any website, which will open a new page on new window with javascript or else open following html...

<html>
<body>
<input type=button onclick="window.open('www.mozilla.org','_blank');" value='click me to open'>
</body>
</html>
Actual Results:
Window open in first Monitor

Expected Results:
Window should open on the same monitor
