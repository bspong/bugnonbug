Only when I restarted firefox, opening the Site Location of an RSS feed I bookmarked in my personal toolbar took me to the new place, otherwise I wa still sent to the old location.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark a link to an RSS feed (in my case the feed on http://www.ns.nl/storingen/index.form); I put it in the personal toolbar, in a subfolder to be most exact.
2. Go the the property of the feed, and change the Site Location to a different location. (The one in my example indeed doe not exist (yet), so you'd want to change it.)
3. Select the link from the menu, and in the submenu click 'Open ...' at the bottom.
4. You will be taken to the original website.
5. Restart Firefox and perform step 3 again. You will now be taken to the correct website.
Actual Results:
After updating the site location, Firefox took me to the site before update.

Expected Results:
It should have taken me to the new location.
