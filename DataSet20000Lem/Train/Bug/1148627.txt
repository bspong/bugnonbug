Window manager: i3 wm, tiling, borderless

Started a WebRTC conversation, either with Firefox Hello or any other online WebRTC service.


Actual results:

A little widget, including an iceweasel icon, in addition to a mic and a cam toggle buttons, pop up on the upper side of the browser window (actually in the tab bar and covering tab themselves).
Anyways tab are not the only one to be covered, since if the browser window is resized or moved, this little widget overlap other window too, since it stick to the upper side of the screen no matter which window is behind it, and it even persists across workspaces.
In general, this widget can be dragged horizontally, and when clicking on the mic/cam toggle icons, the confirmation dialog pop up following the same behaviour, i.e. not taking care which window/workspace it appears onto, so it always spawn on the focused workspace and in the position it wants.
An explicative screenshot may help to understand the annoying situation. It wa taken on a workspace different from the one containing the browser:

(i also attach it in case it expires)


Expected results:

The widget should not affect other windows/workspaces, maybe it should be contained in the browser window, better not overlapping tab (the webcam icon spawning in the toolbar some version ago wa nice), and giving the user the possibility to disable it.

If more information are needed let me know.
Thanks.
