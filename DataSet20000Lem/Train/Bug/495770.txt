When i change web page using either the URL field or a link firefox freeze for a second just after having finished loading the page. This seems to be due to firefox updating the Bookmarks places.sqlite. This is from a strace:

23:15:19.765912 fsync(35) = 0 <1.652567>
And this is an except from lsof:
firefox 10709 1000 35uw REG 254,0 3522560 704560 /home/zinob/.mozilla/firefox/fwz552fg.default/places.sqlite

If I make my FF-profile dir a RAM drive the problem disappears, and I have not experienced it on my stationary computers, with fast hard disks. But nither when i used FF 1.5 on this computer. I tried vacuuming the database, but it did not shrink much, still at 3.5MiB

Reproducible: Always

2. Try scrolling, you will notice the scroll for a second about a second after the page finish loading
Actual Results:
The window stopped responding to everything for a second, and the scroll halt to make a big jump-scroll when the browser thaw again.

Expected Results:
A smooth scroll and continuous response.

quick and dirty benchmark of the disk:
zinob@mist:~$ sudo hdparm -T /dev/mapper/maindisks-lv_home

/dev/mapper/maindisks-lv_home:
Timing cached reads: 1166 MB in 2.00 second = 582.51 MB/sec
zinob@mist:~$ sudo hdparm -t /dev/mapper/maindisks-lv_home

/dev/mapper/maindisks-lv_home:
Timing buffered disk reads: 98 MB in 3.01 second = 32.52 MB/sec
