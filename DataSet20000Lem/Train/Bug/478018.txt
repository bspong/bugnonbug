Firefox show auth pop-up when doing NTLM auth

The Linux version of Firefox present me with an authentication pop-up when I connect to an intranet site. The pop-up is populated with previously entered value (the user only ha to press "enter" or click "ok"). Still, this is annoying.

The "network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris" configuration option is set correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure "network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris" to contain a list of URIs.
2. Connect to a site that us NTLM authentication.
3. Ask Firefox to remember the password.
4. Restart Firefox and connect to the site again.
Actual Results:
The user is presented with a pre-filled pop-up.

Expected Results:
Firefox should silently connect to the site, using previously entered credentials. Only if that fails, the user should be presented with a pop-up.

On Windows this behaves a expected (i.e. doesn't ask for credentials, even when connecting for the first time).

If I'm not mistaken, this used to work in Firefox 2.
