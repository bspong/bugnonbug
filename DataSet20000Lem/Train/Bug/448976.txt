turn the Session Restore prompt into an error page
Created attachment 332147
extension (mostly) implementing the described behavior

Turning the Session Restore prompt into an error page would fix several outstanding issue (among others bug 407117, bug 426123, bug 371031, bug 380862 and bug 381887). The new behavior would be the following:

* In the non-crash case, nothing change
* In case we crash, we add an error page a the first tab to the first opened browser window (which might already contain other tabs, although the user's homepage won't be loaded)
* Firefox is fully usable with this error page open. The error page get saved by Session Restore a any other tab and would be restored in case of a crash while the error page is still open
* The error page offer by default to either restore the crashed session or to load the user's homepage(s)
* The user can additionally display a list of all the windows/tabs contained in the crashed session and selectively uncheck tabs/windows from being restored (as a bonus, individual tab can be restored through middle-clicking)
* When the session is restored, the tab with the error page is automatically closed and the session is restored into new windows. The window containing the error page will remain, if other tab have already been opened - a will other windows.

Alex: Please install this extension and do a UI review of the behavior. If you agree UI wise, I'll try to turn the extension into a patch. Note that the string aren't finalized, at all. I'd like to get this behavior for Firefox 3.1.

Marco: How doe this extension work from an accessibility point of view? Do you get the error text read first before the focus move to the "Restore Previous Session" button? And is displaying the tab list discoverable and usable?
