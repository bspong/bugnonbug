If my plugin installs via the xpi installer technique; the situation of plugin
in memory is handled by renaming the old plugin and telling the end user to
restart their browser. "Download Failed: Restart to Complete". When the end user
restarts their browser, the new plugin replaces the old plugin. But the mime
type of the plugin remains the same a the previous version of the plugin. When
this situation occurs, no amount of restarting will ever update the Mimetype to
the correct values. This is a bug in Netscape 7.2 and Firefox 1.0.3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a plugin with a mimetype
2. Make a new version of the plugin, with a different mimetype
3. Install the plugin version 1
4. Browse a page that embeds the plugin, thus loading it into memory
5. Browse a page that xpi update the browser plugin to version 2
6. Witness the error message "Restart to Complete"
7. Restart browser
8. Note that about:plugins show the version 1 info, even though version 2 is
now installed.

Actual Results:
about:plugins show the version 1 info, even though version 2 is now installed.


Expected Results:
Refreshed the registered mimetype to match the new plugin dll.

I think this is serious, so I marked it major. No one us xpi installer for
plugins, bug like this make it obvious why.
