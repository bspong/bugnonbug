If you try to open any non-Firefox readable document (PDF, .doc) with firefox via the open with dialog, the unselected dropdown menu will show something other than Word, even if you have selected word via the finder window that come up when you click choose. If you click on the dropdown menu, the one entry in the menu is the correct application, but it is not what is shown when the menu is not clicked on. In addition, the Choose Application option go away after an application is selected or if a MIME type default exists.
