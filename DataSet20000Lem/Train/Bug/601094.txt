When the main page contains a Silverlight application Z-ordered below an iframe, which in turn contains an iframe, input focus go away from the inner iframe in certain scenarios.

In my sceanrio, the inner iframe is a tinyMce editor. It is a fairly complicated thing, which may mean that this bug only surface in very special circumstances. I have not tried it with something else a the inner iframe.

Switching between tab seems to direct input focus back to the correct location, until the next click.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Steps 0-2 are completed for you in the attached repro case.
The attached repro case includes a blank Silverlight 4 application (just a compiled empty project a created by Visual Studio).

0. Prerequisite: simple.html from tinyMce example (I used 3.3.9 to repro)
1. Create an HTML page which ha a Silverlight application covering the entire page. The Silverlight application can be anything, even the default blank project generated by Visual Studio.
2. Add the simple.html a an iframe that will be visible on top of the Silverlight application.
3. Upload this page to a web-accessible location.
4. Open this page in browser.
5. Click on the tinyMce text editor. Type a few word to verify all is OK.
6. Click on the tinyMce text editor again. Try to type.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens - the tinyMce editor doe not receive any text input.

Expected Results:
My keystroke reach the tinyMce editor iframe and the letter appear.

This only seems to happen on Mac OS X.

The windowless parameter of the Silverlight application is set to true in my case, but a I understand this parameter is always interpreted a true on Mac OS X by Silverlight, so it is probably irrelevant.

Switching between tab seems to direct input focus back to the correct location, until the next click.
