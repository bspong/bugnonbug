Changes to nightly on 20150524 and 20150525 wiped out my history yesterday when compiled.

Steps to reproduce:

When I pulled and compiled nightly on 20150523, around midnight GMT, history wa working fine after I installed it. By that I mean tab completion worked when I used it. I didn't actually examine history, a I normally don't. I do have it set to keep a large amount in about:config so that tab completion pull up rarely visited sites.

When I pulled and compiled nightly on 20150526, history wa completely blanked. I noticed it because tab completion failed. When I looked at the history, there wa nothing there. I asked it to restore from one of the backup it listed, but that failed.


Actual results:

History wa erased.


Expected results:

History should have been retained.

I used backup fox to save both bookmark and history on 20150522, fortunately. I tried to restore history from that JSON file, but it worked no better than restoring from one of the internal backups. It's possible that the issue is caused by something backup fox did. But I usually only turn it on long enough to save a backup, then turn it off. That avoids a lot of unnecessary file writes a I browse. So it wa off when this occurred.

I imagine there will be a lot of unhappy user if this actually is a bug in firefox and make it into any kind of release version.

firefox seems to be saving history again, a it ha accumulated the last couple of day worth.
