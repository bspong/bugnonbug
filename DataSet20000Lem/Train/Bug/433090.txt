Warning: This bug may be very hard to produce, and may a well be filed on another project's site! (Wine)

My OS: Linux, using Wine to emulate Windows 2000

(Ubuntu 7.10)

Firefox Version: 2.0.0.14

What happened:

After a long time, the gui went crazy:

- the link kept opening up in new tab (not supposed to)
- You can NOT focus on any textbox and type in it
- Using mouse wheel make font increase - not scroll anymore
- Clicking on any thing- text, etc show a black border around the element
(NO extension installed to do that)
- other tab worked ok, but still had mouse wheel problem

There could be possibly 3 cause to this bug:

1. Security bug (highly unlikely)
A security bug may have got in and made Firefox malfunction.

2. General bug
Just a bug....

3. (likely) Wine bug
Note that it could be Wine's problem.

Reproduction: may not be possible. Any way to get stack trace?

(note: after killing wine, then starting Firefox again, bug disappears)

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
