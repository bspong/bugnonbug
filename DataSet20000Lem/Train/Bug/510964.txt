If this "bug" need to be entered in a "request new feature" category, please either do so or tell me how to do it and I will.

After almost 1/2 an hour of searching the mozilla website I could not find a place to request a new Firefox feature, so am entering this a a bug. This "bug" is preceeded by "Fixed" bug
462289, 501981, 509768, 418521, 333513.

I would therefore suggest this usability problem be at least partially re-enabled by adding a "right click" drop menu item feature that allows the user to instantly move the tab to the "home" position or to the "end" position in the tab queue. (This would be the same EXISTING drop down menu that currently contains the command "New Tab", "Reload Tab", "Reload All Tabs", "Close Other Tabs", "Open in a New Window",...,"Undo Close Tab, and "Close Tab")

I would suggest the name "Move Tab to Front of Queue", and "Move Tab to End Queue".

This would help impaired users, a currently "dragging" a tab to the "front" and "end" position of the tab queue requires precision control of the mouse over protracted period of time. That is very difficult for me and others to do.

Having the "focus" and relocate ability of tab (as reported in the "first" bug 462289 on this topic) intentionally taken away from the user ha been a significant navigation burden in a multi-tab enabled browser.

Apparently it is unacceptable to retain previously available mouse-controlled tab management functionality if it is inconsistent with global usage requirement (see "bug" 333513), and I can understand that. But the original implementation may not have supported mult-tabbed browser support and therefore did not foresee the need for this tab navigation functionality.
