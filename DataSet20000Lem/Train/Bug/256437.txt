The location of the tab closing and Update gadget are very poor, being
adjacent to the scroll up and down arrow respectively. Just slight mislocation
of the cursor, quite common with a touchpad mouse, cause the tab of interest to
close, or the Update dialog to come up, in which case the user ha to wait for
it to finish loading, then see the button on it are ghosted out (Why?) and to
finally get to the dialog close gadget, all when simply trying to scroll down a
page a little. It is horribly inconvenient.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a page that is larger than the window
2.Notice how carefully you must position the mouse to scroll instead of closing
the tab or calling the update dialog (which gadget doe not even have a visible
icon, poor design)
3.

Actual Results:
Slight mispositioning will close the tab of interest or call up the update dialog

Expected Results:
Slight mispositioning of the mouse should not cause large delay in browsing,
like reloading the page or messing with a poorly designed update dialog
