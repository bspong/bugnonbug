When typing in a URL using the floating tablet input panel in Windows Vista the autosuggest window that come up after typing a few character will appear over the TIP window, the result is the TIP window close automatically assuming the user ha moved the carrot out of the address bar input box and onto the suggestion box below, which take no text input. This make using firefox 3.0 impossible for tablet user who have no physical keyboard a typing in any url result in the autosuggest coming up, and the TIP support can not be turned off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.0 B2
2. Visit Slashdot.org
3. Close Browser
4. Open Browser
5. Go to address bar and start typing slashdot.org
6. by the time you type sl, the autosuggest window will pop up, and the TIP window will close a a result
Actual Results:
Tablet Input Window close

Expected Results:
Ideally, firefox should render the suggestion window both below the TIP window without stealing the carrot so the TIP window doe not close, a well if possible it should be aware of the tablet input panel and render the autosuggest pane below the tablet input panel. This behaivor is visible if using Internet Explorer 7 in the same usage pattern. If you start typing a URL in IE7 with the TIP panel open, the suggestion to complete the URL render below the TIP panel, a a part of it
