after a href to an external site opening in the same window (tab) clicking a menu option of the site the page will open in a new tab and the menu is disappeared. The page should appear in the same tab in a iframe and keep showing the menu. This work fine in ff3.0, but fials to do so in ff3.5. You can use the url www.weespweggeluid.nl, go to LINKS, select a external link, if the extrnal page show in the iframe select a page from the menu e.g. NIEUWS. The site is in dutch, but the problem will be clear. If you need more information of html or php code I can provide you with them.
