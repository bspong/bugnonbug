Major memory leak - the longer firefox is left open, the more memory it us

I've had this problem for some time now with older version of firefox also, and now still with 3.6.12. On both window machine (windows XP) with older firefox version (haven't tried 3.6.12 on window yet) and Macintosh's using both older version of firefox and now 3.6.12 also. After firefox ha been open continuously for some time, it's memory usage climb until the firefox start responding very slowly, lot of spinning wheels, and finally I have to close and restart, or it becomes hung up completely. It is close to that point right now, using 3.76 GIGABITES of memory between real + virtual. This happens even if only a very few tab are open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use firefox continuously for a day or two without shutting it off.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
example, right now I've had firefox open for roughly 12 to 24 hour and it is up to between 3.76 and 3.84 GB of memory being used by a very quick check of activity monitor several time in the last few minutes. It is responding slowly, and I'm getting a lot of spinning wheel when I try to even scroll down a page - or type in this box a few time too.

Expected Results:
It shouldn't keep using more and more memory the longer it is open, until it hang or becomes unusable and ha to be quit or even force quit to shut it down and restart.

I'm using the default theme. While I know these add-on make firefox use a little more memory than if they aren't being used, I don't believe they are involved in this problem (I've tried disabling them in the past, and still had this problem). Even so, to be thorough in this bug report - I am using adblock plus 1.3.1, download helper v 4.8, fireFTP v 1.0.9, and session manager v. 0.6.8
