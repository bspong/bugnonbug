The criterion for Firefox not retaining session history for form seem to not be tilted enough in the data-retention direction. I've had many instance of filling in a form to submit a comment, clicking a link before hitting submit, and then going back (via Back button) and finding my form cleared. It seems that Firefox is reloading page instead of using the already-loaded page in much wider circumstance than, for example, Safari.

Perhaps the criterion for retaining form session history can be expanded. Losing form data just by looking at another page then going back doe result in a lot of pain for user who can easily lose large quantity of data.

There are other bug that mention this, but they don't seem to directly address just how frequently this can occur, nor do they describe what the criterion are for dropping form data. One bug is #303638.

Is there a document that explains this choice, if it truly wa a choice to drop data so often?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with a form (example: http://babelfish.altavista.com/)
2. Type in some information.
3. Click a link (or choose a bookmark) to load another page.
4. Go Back.
5. Realize everything you had typed in is gone.
Actual Results:
Data loss.

Expected Results:
Data retention.

Now, I understand there are case where form data should not be retained, but it seems to me that the example I mentioned are NOT case where form data should be disposed.
