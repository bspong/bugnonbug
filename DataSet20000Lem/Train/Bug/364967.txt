Real player (or any other audio player) can not play sound track on the above page when opened with Firefox. However, these are playable when opened with Intenet Explorer.

When opened with Firefox these are opened with "smi.cgi" extention and Real Player complains that it doe not have software update to play that type of clips. When opened with Explorer, the clip are opened with only "smi" extension, by somehow peeling off the "cgi" part. Real Player thus play the clip (only with smi extension) opened with Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the web page given in above url
2. Click any song track (any of 50 listed in the page) that will prompt the default player to download and play the clip.
3. Follw the prompt given by your default player. (My default player wa Real Player. I tried to play with Windows Media PLayer too with same results).
*** Your default player must be configured to play smi/smil type clips.


Actual Results:
Firefox open the clip on Real Player with smi.cgi extension. Then Real Player request to download update to play that type of clip and contact it website. The "real" website informs it doe not have requested updates.

Expected Results:
Firefox should open the clip on Real Player with only smi extension (as done by Internet Explorewr by peeling off the cgi part).
