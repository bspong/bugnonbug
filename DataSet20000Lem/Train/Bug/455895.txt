As far a I understand it, the Tab Preview and Last Tab extension take a snapshot of the background tabs, somehow, and display those snapshot when you hover over the tab or Ctrl+Tab through the tabs. Somehow, though, this particular page yield noticeably wrong-looking results: the code sample are rendered in the wrong font relative to the rest of the page, which I think is a rendering bug in handling media-specific CSS.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open above URL, and at least one other tab
2. Have the Tab Preview extension installed (http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/tabpreview/)
3. Mouse over the MDC tab while it's in the background
4. Have the Last Tab extension installed (http://timothyhumphrey.name/firefox/)
5. Ctrl+Tab until MDC tab is previewed
Actual Results:
See the attached picture for the preview I see with Tab Preview; the Last Tab result are identical. For comparison, the right side of the picture show the preview when CSS is disabled -- you can see that the font look much more reasonable.


Last Tab and the new Ctrl-Tab extension are incompatible with each other, so I can't test whether Ctrl-Tab yield the same results. I'd bet it would...

In Tools->Options->Fonts->Advanced, I have my monospaced font set to Courier New 13pt, nothing exotic there, so I doubt it's a missing-font kind of problem.

Finally, I haven't checked this yet in a nightly Firefox; maybe some of the CSS fix going into Fx3.1 will fix this?
