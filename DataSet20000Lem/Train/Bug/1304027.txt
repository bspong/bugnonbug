Uplift recent awesomebar improvement to Firefox 50
[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

We made various improvement to Firefox 51's awesomebar that will fix the following issues:

a. Enter sometimes is not delayed until the first result comes, that mean when typing fast sometimes we may open the expected url, sometimes a search page. The behavior is not consistent.
b. Enter sometimes is ignored and handled later, at the wrong time, that mean we may visit a "random" page from user's history.
c. Enter may be delayed by a long time, even 2 or 3 seconds, that mean from when the user press Enter to when we start loading the page, we could be waiting that time.

Fixing this requires all the recent patch we landed, that is:
1. partial uplift of Bug 1180944. Only the autocomplete code part, not the one-off feature, since other patch are built on top of that autocomplete code.
2. Bug 1301093, all the three part to fix the wrong enter handling
3. Bug 1283329, this fix the long delay
4. Bug 1302472, this fix a regression in toolkit/autocomplete that may affect some add-on (currently under review)

So I'm building a merged patch with all these changes.
Every part ha an automated test-case.

I know this is big, scary and non-trivial. The fact is that these awesomebar improvement are so important for our end user that delaying them to Firefox 51 (24th of January) may be problematic.
I'm currently testing patch on Try.

This is an heads-up for release-drivers.
