Printing a HTML page with a table spanning multiple page Firefox will only print one page of the table and supresses the rest of the table. All text passage before and after the table are printed.

It look like a serious error and is reconstrucable regardless of the used printer and is therefor a application (Firefox) error. It's a page handling error on large table AND landscape page orientation.

Reproducible: Always
