"Force link ... to open in: the same tab" break some site
Bug 172962 give the user the option of folding new window back into the opener
("force link that open new window to open in the same tab/window a the
link.") Despite this just being a scary and seemingly technically inadvisable
thing to do, it pretty much works. Some thing however will not work.

Websites coded to pas data between the opener and opened window obviously
won't function correctly, since the opener is gone. Sites that will experience
this problem are generally site that treat the opened window like a dialog.
http://www.magic.gov.uk is an example. There are of course many others. Sites
with complex opening code like this

var w = window.open("about:blank")
w.location = "http://www.mozilla.org/"

won't work, again because the script abort when the opener window is replaced.
(Note that this:

var w = window.open("")
w.location = "http://www.mozilla.org/"

doe work. I wa able to finagle that.)

Obviously full-on Single Window Mode ha disadvantage and I hope user will
lean toward tabbed Single Window Mode, which doesn't have the same fundamental
inability. It occurs that FoSWM could be fixed if we actually opened the new
window into a new tab, presumably without showing the tab bar. Now both window
remain open simultaneously and script should work. Close the new tab and the
window reverts to the original window/tab. Navigate away from the new tab and we
know we can close the original tab. (Generally. Multiple layer of "dialogs"
wouldn't work if we were too eager to close the original tab.)

I'm not seriously suggesting we implement this. But it is an issue with full-on
single window/tab mode, and I expect this bug will collect duplicates.
