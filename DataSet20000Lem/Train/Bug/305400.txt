Hi Just a small suggestion about adding a feature to
clear only "selected" item (perhaps via checkboxes) in the privacy section in
options.
For example I would envisage checking or selecting "history" and Cache" and
pressing a new button "Clear Selected"

I don't know if this will reach the power that be, but any insight on passing
this idea to them
will be appreciated.

Reproducible: Always
