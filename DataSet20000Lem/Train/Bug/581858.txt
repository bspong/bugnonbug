When the Firefox button is active (eg menubar is disabled), the very top of the window doesn't respond to mouse event like hover or click.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activate the Firefox button by disabling the menubar.
2. See that the Firefox button go into the titlebar of the window.
3. Size/position the window so that the top of the window is up against the edge of the screen. (Aero snap the window to the left or right side, or just resize vertically up to the top of the screen.)
4. Move mouse cursor to the top of the window (over the Firefox button, or over the window caption buttons).
Actual Results:
The Firefox/caption buttons' hover effect aren't shown, and click aren't registered on the button until you shift the cursor down a few pixels. The cursor also doesn't change to the window resizer icon when you're at the edge of the window over an empty part of the titlebar.

Expected Results:
The hover effect and click work when the cursor is at the extreme edge of the window.

I've tried this on a clean profile on the latest trunk builds.

It's mildly annoying now (I don't resize/close window that often), but it'll get worse when people start adding "move tab in titlebar" customizations (I do switch tab fairly often).

All of this work just fine if the menubar is enabled, by the way.
