2. Enter e-mail address in the text field; select "No, I will create now" checkbox
3. Click the Continue button

The firebird window disappeared

Expected Results:
Firebird should have gone to another page which would have been generated by the

One important point to note. The same problem doesn't occur in Mozilla
(Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3) Gecko/20030314) on the same
system. Both had been compiled with gcc-3.? with Xft/gtk2 support. I downloaded
the pre-built binaries.
