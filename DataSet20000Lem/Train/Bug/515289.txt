I wa wondering why my back button seems to go on the fritz, certain page like news.yahoo.com if you look at the tab indicator, firefox appears to reload the page when it really just doing ajax calls. The result is I have to hit back a many time a Firefox think it reloaded the page. Which is more than the correct number of time I should have to hit the back button which is once.

Ultra lame, using safari until this is fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to news.yahoo.com
2.watch the tab indicate more than one page load
3.hit the back button until you get back - it more than once - totally crazy
Actual Results:
history is wrong, ajax call cause history to add a page multiple time

Expected Results:
hit back button once to go back

havent seen this on PC only on OSX. Not happy this is the most significant downer in year of using firefox. Can you guy move forward without so much regression? Im sorry if MAC isnt where it at but Im using the really lame safari now because I like my BACK BUTTON to work.
