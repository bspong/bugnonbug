Define reference platform for official build
This is a tracking bug to solicit input to define a reference platform for the three major platform we ship on.

The specification for these reference platform should not just include thing like compiler toolchain, but the OS itself, any applied patches/security updates, any supporting tool (cygwin/darwinports wget/ssh, etc.) any extra downloads of tool (the MS compiler extension come to mind), and anything else that's necessary to re-create a machine from the ground up to reproduce a build from a specific point in time.

The goal here is twofold:

1. Complete build [environment] reproducability.

2. To hold an explicit discussion about the support requirement for the environment we want the shipped bit to run on, which may be affected by the build enviornment. Translation: which Linux distros do we actually care about. We actually may be able to support more than we think if we think about it (see bug 329517). Of course, this impact Macs a well (bug 327092, with it matrix of required-build-but-supported-runtime OSes), and Win32 (all the VC8 requests, including a specific statement about the support of various Win32 client OS version for each branch) a well.

dbaron point out that this would be a nice opportunity to make profiling work again too.

This bug will block a bunch of upgrades, a it is our current intention to create machine (images, where possible) that meet the requirement specified in this bug, rather than replace/upgrade old tinderboxen, the content of which we may need to reproduce older versions/builds.
