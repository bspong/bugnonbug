I have dialup internet, and if I had Firefox and tab open while off the internet, and I connect the internet and I want to refresh a page it doesn't work. The "Server not found" error shows, and I can press refresh a thousand time it won't work. But other website do.

If offline I wa on Facebook, I connect to the internet, and I refresh that tab, I'll get the above error. But if I went to any other site it they would work. If I came back to the Facebook tab, press F5 or the refresh button, the loader at the bottom of the screen come up and go away. If I google that url I wa on, and click the link from Google, it still won't work. It doe happen to work about a minute later miraculously, but it extremely annoying. And I can't go closing/opening the browser, because.. damn thats more annoying.

This doesn't always happen though, I tried the step I posted to reproduce it, and it didn't happen. So it just decides to do it now and then. I get it alot at http://my.deviantart.com/messages/

2. Connect the internet again
3. Refresh that page
Actual Results:
There wa no problem. As I said it happens now and again.

Expected Results:
It should refresh whenever I click refresh or press F5.
