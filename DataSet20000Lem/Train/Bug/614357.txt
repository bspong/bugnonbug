Using dual monitor cause network setting vanishes

I have a dell studio xps 16 (x64 - an up to date vista home premium). And Firefox 3.6.12. I have set a socks5 proxy for Firefox. I turned on my second monitor and started to work. I moved some tab to the second monitor by dragging them and then maximized the Firefox in second monitor. DISASTER: Firefox in second monitor doe not use my network settings! It is a disaster because in "some" place in our world some part of internet is blocked from inside and outside and a secure connection may worth a human life.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox with a network connection setting set on using a socks5 proxy.
2.Drag some tab to your second monitor and place them within one packed page.
3.Firefox in second monitor doe not use your network settings.


Expected Results:
Firefox must use a network setting globally along within all running instance AND these setting must be global even if it ha been set after running some instances. (Sorry) Something like internet explorer connection setting.
