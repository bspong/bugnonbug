Expose animation performance information in DevTools
Bug 1196114 add a new chrome-only API that provides the following information:

1. *Which* animation property are being run on the compositor (until now there ha just been a single flag say if one or more of the property is running on the compositor)

2. For animation that normally *could* be run on the compositor but aren't, the reason why.

An example of 2 is if the is an element where we're animating the 'left' property at the same time a the 'transform' property, we'll deliberately *not* run the transform animation on the compositor because it will look odd because the different thing affecting the element's position won't be synchronized.

(Some background I forgot to add: currently *only* 'transform' and 'opacity' can be animated on the compositor. In future, we'll add 'scale', 'translate', 'rotate' etc.)

Another example of 2, is if we animate 'transform' but the element ha an SVG transform attribute or a backface-visibility property then we don't do the animation on the compositor due to limitation in Gecko.

In any case, the idea is that by exposing that information to developers, they can analyze and optimize their content. e.g. Perhaps when we hit one of those type-2 scenarios, the lightning bolt could be outlined and have a tooltip explaining why the property wasn't run on the compositor?

CC'ing Helen since she might have some idea about how this could look.
