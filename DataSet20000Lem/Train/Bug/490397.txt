After installing Firefox 3.5 Beta 4, when Firefox reopened the download page for Firefox 3.5 Beta 4 opened again and I wa asked to redownload the file. That's normal. What wasn't normal is that the Opening <file> window asking me whether I wanted to "save as" or "cancel" wa truncated. The grey box that outline the available option wa cut off a it reached the bottom and the option to "do this automatically for file like this from now on" wa also missing, obviously due to the fact it wa in the area that wa truncated. All wa fine in Firefox 3.1 Beta 3. Testing other link (such a item at Microsoft Download Center) also produced this "cut off" opening window.

Closing Firefox 3.5 Beta 4 and opening Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 the Opening <file> dialog box wa fine again. Going back to Firefox 3.5 Beta 5 produced the problem again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website (using Firefox 3.5 Beta 4) that ha executable (exe) file you can download
2. Click a link to download an exe
3. Observe the window that pop up asking you what to do with the file
Actual Results:
An Opening <file> dialog box appeared with the option to 'save as' or 'cancel' but the option to 'do this automatically for file like this from now on' wa cut off.

Expected Results:
An Opening <file> dialog box should've appeared with the option to 'save as', 'cancel' or 'do this automatically for file like this from now on'.

Using the default Firefox theme
