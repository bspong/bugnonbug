Dragging a bookmark from the bookmark toolbar to the tabstrip to open a new tab seems to break most of the functionality of the bookmark toolbar. Once the new tab is created the bookmark toolbar is 'frozen' clicking bookmark doe nothing, the iBeam cursor from the drag operation is still showing, none of the live bookmark or most visited tag folder will expand, bookmark can't be dragged anywhere.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.New profile
2.Drag a bookmark from the bookmark toolbar onto the tab strip to open a new tab.
3.
Actual Results:
Notice how the bookmark toolbar is now 'frozen' clicking bookmark doe nothing, the iBeam cursor from the drag operation in step 2 is still showing, none of the live bookmark or 'Most Visited' tag folder will expand, bookmark can't be dragged anywhere.

Bookmarks in the bookmark toolbar to behave normally

You can activate bookmark and expand folders, but only if you have the mouse cursor right at the bottom a few pixel from the border between the bookmark toolbar and the tabstrip.
