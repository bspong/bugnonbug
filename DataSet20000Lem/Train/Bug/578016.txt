Clicking the Toggle Toolbars (pill) button on Mac OS should affect View -> Toolbars
This bug is about one of the problem I described in bug 578013:

Clicking the Toggle Toolbars button on Mac OS (the one in the far right of window title) currently simply hide the toolbar, but they can still be toggled (with no visible effect) using the View -> Toolbars menu. I think that's quite a misbehaviour. I see too possible solution to this problem:
1) uncheck all toolbars in View -> Toolbars when that button is clicked, and allow to check and enable each of them individually. A drawback for this solution would be that after re-enabling just one toolbar, the Toggle Toolbars button should then again hide it instead of showing others. And that single toolbar would become the new "set" of toolbars that would be enabled on clicking Toggle Toolbars button again.
2) disable the View -> Toolbars menu when the toolbars are toggled off. A potential drawback here is that unless the user doesn't know what the Toggle Toolbars button does, they won't know how to get the toolbars back.

I personally think that option 2 is better, because the Toggle Toolbars button is standard on OS X, so the user should know what it does. Someone else may prefer option 1 though...
