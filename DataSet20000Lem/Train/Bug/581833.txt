Need two major step to bookmark a page (generically, "bookmarks not saved") in Firefox 3.6.x
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100724 Firefox/3.6.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100724 Firefox/3.6.8

I "bookmark" a page (sometimes with the "Name" edited) in a "Folder" of my choice.
I check - it is there OK.
I exit Firefox.
I restart Firefox.
The bookmark is at the bottom of the main "Bookmarks" list with the original name (whether I edited it or not, originally).
I can drag it (for example) to the originally intended Folder.
Now the entry is stable (as it should have been from the beginning).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmarks > Bookmark This Page > "Edit This Bookmark" (dialog box)
2. I may edit the Name
3. Choose a Folder.
4. Press "Done"
5. Check in the "Bookmarks" list. Everything OK: The page is with it (new) Name in the proper Folder.
6. Quit Firefox
7. Restart Firefox
8. The page entry is no longer in my Folder. It can be found a separate entry at the bottom of the Bookmarks drop-down list.
9. I can left-drag the entry into the intended Folder, maybe re-edit the Name, etc. in the Properties.
10. The page entry is stable now.
Actual Results:
Bookmarking a page is performed in two major, complicated step involving exiting and restarting Firefox.
Note: The step 8 and 9 above can be done in "Organize bookmarks"
(say, by double-clicking "Bookmarks Menu" and taking it from there).
It is more unreliable, Cut and Paste doe not seem to always work (if at all)

Expected Results:
Once you bookmark a page, it should _stay_ bookmarked and edited in the (sub)folder where you placed it, in one single operation.

Problem continues unabated - started way back, 3.6.0?

Firefox compiled from sources.

I've tried all the trick "in the books". In short:
1. "Unable to add new bookmark or make other changes"
2. Create new ("clean") profile.
3. Upgraded Firefox each time. I am at 3.6.8 now!
4. Deleted places.sqlite*, etc.

To no avail.

Note: I have two machines, with the same behavior.
I think I'm always up to date (kernel, related software, etc.)
There can be something "dirty" somewhere, specific to my systems, but I have failed to find it. (I'm surprised no other people seem to have encountered this - to me an obvious and terribly annoying problem.)

PLEASE
Ask me any detail (and how) in order to resolve this problem.
