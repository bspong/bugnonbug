(Better) compliance with "Designed for Windows" guidelines, le clutter in %ProgramFiles%
User Agent: Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.0; U; de) Presto/2.10.289 Version/12.02

Steps to reproduce:

Install Firefox and/or Thunderbird and/or SeaMonkey and/or other Mozilla products.


Actual results:

Every installation creates one or more directory "Mozilla <product>" directly in %ProgramFiles%, and Gecko is installed in each of them.


Expected results:

Use a base directory "Mozilla" in %ProgramFiles% and place the different Mozilla product in subdirectory "Mozilla\<product>".
This complies with the recommendation %ProgramFiles%\<vendor>\<product> of Microsofts "Designed for Windows" guideline and reduces the number of directory in %ProgramFiles%.

And, if possible: install the common component (like Gecko) either in their own subdirectory below %ProgramFiles%\Mozilla\ or into their own directory in %CommonProgramFiles%\Mozilla\ (that's another requirement/recommendation of the "Designed for Windows" guidelines).

JFTR: please dont try to counter that with "but Microsoft (or another vendor) us countless directory 'Microsoft <product> in %ProgramFiles%" too: even MSFT should follow it own guidelines!
