Well, I can't really put my finger on what's going on here.
I have extensive saved bookmarks, since Mozilla 1.x.

Lately, I have noticed a vague issue, which likely most people would never see.

I notice an interesting site, and to save it I drag the url box icon into the bookmark folder I want to put it in. It doe not appear.
It's there and examining the bookmark file in the ctrl-B sidebar generally show it. But I have a lot of folder inside folder in my personal toolbar.

I suspect the problem is the size and heirarchy storage of the bookmarks.html file ha been reached. I checked and my bookmarks.html file is 2,875,831 bytes.





Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Drag new bookmark into folder in personal toolbar for storage.
2.Click on folder, examination show the new item is missing.
3.Drag it there again, still not showing.
4.Examine the folder in the ctrl-B bookmark and all copies, even extra are there.

Actual Results:
Some bookmark in folder do not show, but they are there.
Often after a reboot they are showing, even extras.

Expected Results:
After I drag a site into a folder it should be visible.

I suspect this is a problem where there is insufficient space to show the new entry in bookmarks.html. The file is there and in good condition but I have reached some limit which most people would never see.

I have noticed this intermittently in recent months. Not all the time, but often. My bookmarks.html file in my profile folder is 2,875,831 bytes.
