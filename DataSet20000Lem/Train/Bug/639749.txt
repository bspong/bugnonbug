Went from Facebook Games page to play FB Cafe World app but got "Invalid URL" instead then went to my email with email from FB friend but when I clicked on the gift they sent, I got "Invalid URL" for each. I downloaded Firefox because Windstream said that the problem I wa having with Facebook apps wa due to Safari but I'm getting the same problem with your browser. Please report the issue with both Firefox & Safari to Facebook & ask them to fix the Aynga game issues!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Facebook on an Apple computer
2. Try to go to Cafe World app
3.Get Invalid URL message instead of functioning app.


Expected Results:
got "Invalid URL" instead of the Cafe World app loading & letting me play

Was told by Windstream that this wa only a problem with Safari but, not so am getting the same result with Firefox. I changed browser because I wa told this FB app wa not a problem with Firefox.... ha!Ha!
