I can attempt to attach my Acrobat Pro CS3 latest .pdf file; but it doe not get sent out. JPEG file and Word file and all word processing file go out. Only the .pdf file do not go out. I have to resort to Apple Mail, which doe send the file out. I cannot tell if it is a bug in Gmail, Firefox, Safari or Opera [same problem with Gmail attachment of .pdf files], or if it is a bug in Adobe. Nevertheless, the file DOES go out with Apple Mail. Where is problem? Gmail or the other browsers, but not the Mail browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Attach Acrobat Pro .pdf file [current verion, CS3].
2.See it attached in the bar.
3.SEND
Actual Results:
File go out, the letter; but never the attached .pdf file

Expected Results:
Sent fold show email, but not the attachment. Recipients ask, What wa attached?

The attachment of a .pdf file should have gone out, or been sent out. Same file doe go out with Apple Mail.
