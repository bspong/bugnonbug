In about:home, make any searchable keypress focus the search box, and restore ctrl+f to invoke the find bar.
I'm not convinced at all of the benefit of this behavior.

I think that rather than "weak", this isn't a valid argument at all. Even the add-on manager search box present the result embedded in the page (even if it fetched them remotely), consistent with all the other example that Ctrl+F "does something in-page". Whereas about:home's search box actually change url to display the results; this fall more in the dominion of a "search" than a "find".

A stronger argument yes. But consider this scenario:
- go to about:home
- surf away to another page (by clicking link often found in the small welcome message below the search box)
- open the find bar by pressing Ctrl+F
- go back to about:home

The find bar is now accessible and fully functional. Which begs the question, if the find bar can be used in about:home, why can't I open it via the usual method? A stronger consistency point would be to actually disable the find bar in about:home, since you can technically follow the same step for the add-on manager or about:config, but the findbar won't actually work there (maybe it should be hidden automatically there, but that's a whole other thing).

I'm not claiming that it doesn't have it usefulness a mentioned, just that it's not enough to completely change the browser's expected behavior on a specific page [1].

Moreover...

What happened to this?

Or better yet, why not make it a quick-find style instead, where any keypresses of searchable character go directly to about:home's search box (like the google homepage)? This would leave all normal/expected shortcut available, while still keeping the usefulness of about:home's search box more readily available.
