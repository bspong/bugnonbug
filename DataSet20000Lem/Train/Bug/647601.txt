Installing more than one addon, that need restart to work, without restarting in between fails and addons do not show a installed and do not work at all. The bug applies also to addon updating. The bug is 100% reproducible with new profile created each time. Applies to different addons (for example, Stylish and Greasemonkey, or Downthemall and DOM Inspector). It doe not matter whether the addons are installed from web or from downloaded files; it doe not matter whether the restart is via the restart prompt after installing the second addon or via File -> Exit. At the same time, if I do restart after each installation, the problem doe not happen!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new profile.
2. Install, for example, Greasemonkey and Stylish in the same session.
3. Restart Firefox
Actual Results:
The addons do not show a installed and do not work. They are actually written to the extension directory.
The extensions.log contains the following:
