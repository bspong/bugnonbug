[UX] Design: Mark privacy-impacting preference in about:preferences
After some design exploration done for bug 1044308, we found that consolidating all privacy-impacting preference in one place had too many downsides.
What we can do instead is to mark privacy-impacting preference e.g. with an icon and a tooltip that indicates that some data is being sent to some server in order to make that feature work.
This way we can be transparent about what happens to our users' data without messing with the information architecture of preferences.


+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #1044308 +++

Some user want to turn off all Firefox integration with external services. It's possible to do that now, but not that intuitive. E.g., the Safe Browsing prefs under Preferences > Security, the geolocation pref (only exposed in about:config under geo.enabled), search suggestion (click dropdown in search bar, checkbox for "Show Search Suggestions"), FHR/Telemetry/Crash Reporting (under Advanced > Data Choices).

Compare that the Chrome, where all service integration (geolocation, Safe Browsing, suggestions, spelling corrections, etc.) are grouped under Advanced > Privacy.

We should make it easy for user to opt-out.
