When Firefox is opened the following happens:

a dialogue open and display the following script:

chrome://xcm/content/xcmOverlay.js.210

Additonal info: NoScript is loaded. I uninstalled this plugin after loading 5.0beta and problem persists with every browser windo I attempt to open. Also, MS Taskmanager display memory usage for firefox.exe between 100K to 120K. When I select the "Stop Script" button the memory usage drop and some functionality in the browser returns.

Also, when the NoScripts button display at the bottom right corner of the window, it doe not function. Only the small red "close button functions.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Firefox browser
2.As the window open the memory usage skyrocket and the application stalls. MS Task manager show 2 instance of the application "not responding."
3. the "No Scripts" box open and show a check box for "do not display again" and the "Cancel script" and "Continue" buttons. Selecting the "Cancel button will stop the memory usage issue.
Actual Results:
As noted above.

Expected Results:
Open the window immediately. If there are script running that are not blocked a "No Scripts" button should display with option to block or "allow" or "temporarily allow."
