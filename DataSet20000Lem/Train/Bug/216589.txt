This issue applies to a page with multiple textfields (all with different
autocomplete data in each text field. If the user us autocomplete on one
textfield and then move to another text field and press the down arrow, the
autocomplete option presented are wrong. Instead autocomplete present
whatever the last selection option from the other textfield.

2. Fill in some data in the text field and hit the "conect" button
3. Go back to the same page again.
4. Select and use an autocomplete option on the first text field (any method is
ok, whether it be keyboard or mouse). In other words, fill in that text field
using autocomplete.

what you filled in in the previous text field.

textfield.
