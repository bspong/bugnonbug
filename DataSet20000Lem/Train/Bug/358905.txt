Entire browser lags, when several tab are being loaded/rendered at the same time

When you load several tab in a short time (a good example is opening 15-20 link of recent change in a wiki using mouse gesture which open each link in a new tab), the browser first wait for server to response and then it stop responding, when the large amount of data start arriving simultaneously. It keep lagging until most of the tab are fully loaded.

I guess it is because all the tab are handled in the single processing thread, affecting all the other tab and windows, even those, that are already fully loaded and rendered. This prevents the user to scroll and read the already loaded text, because there are thing loading somewhere in the background.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use mouse gesture to open link in tab or use bookmark and click "open all in tabs", when there are 15-20 link to recent change of wikipedia.org.
2. Wait until the server start sending data.
3. Try to scroll in the already loaded tabs, while the other tab are still being loaded. You may need a good connection speed in order to allow the amount of data to arrive.
Actual Results:
The entire browser stop responding for a while or lag a lot, preventing the user to scroll the text or switch to other tabs/windows. Depends on how many tab were opened and how long are the page being loaded.

Expected Results:
Other window and tab should remain unaffected, especially those, that were loaded a long time ago.

No other extension add-on were used than mouse gestures.

I suggest, that each tab should load and render in a separate thread. This would prevent the lagging of the entire browser, when one tab stop responding for any possible reason.
