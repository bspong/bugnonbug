Fire Fox changed My ATT Yahoo theme page somehow. When I go directly into Internet Explorer the set up I had for type, colors, and size of type wa exactly a I wanted it. When I go through Firefox to get to my page at ATT Yahoo,It is all
different. The style, colors, and type is smaller. I can't read the page now. IF it stay this way, then I will have to revert back to using Internet Explorer a my default browser. Do you have any suggestion on how to change it back the way it wa this morning. PS It wa ok this morning on my PC, and this evening after 5pm it wa this new looking style. Sincerely, Nancy J Bell

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Logged onto FireFox
2.When to ATT Yahoo account
3.Page wa changed and other WEb Pages followed the same look.
Actual Results:
I have no answer or result for this.

Expected Results:
I would like the ATT Yahoo page back the way it was. I use Fire Fox to go to other sites, but it all look the same now from today's change. Am I making any sense???

WHen I logged into Fire Fox and gone to ATT Yahoo, it should have looked like it did this morning.Since I don't know what caused this strange thing to happen, I am at a loss to fix it myself.
