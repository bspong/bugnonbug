In Firefox's Cookies dialog, the selected cookie can be deleted by pressing the Remove Cookie button or the Delete Forward key (Del on platform other than the Mac). On Mac laptops, which don't have a dedicated DelFwd key, Fn+Delete is used -- not a very discoverable shortcut. So in addition to DelFwd, the dialog should allow the Delete (Backspace) key to remove the cookie. This behavior would be consistent with other Mac applications, such a Safari (Delete to delete a cookie), Camino (same), and Cyberduck (Delete to delete a file).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Firefox (Mac), open the Preferences dialog.
2. Go to the Privacy tab, and click the Show Cookies button.
3. Select a site or individual cookie, and press Delete (Backspace).
4. Now press Delete Forward or Fn+Delete.
Actual Results:
Pressing Delete doesn't remove the cookie, whereas pressing Delete Forward (or Fn+Delete) does.

Expected Results:
Both shortcut should remove the cookie.

This bug also affect the Popups Exceptions, Images Exceptions, Cookies Exceptions, Saved Passwords, and Addons Exceptions dialogs.
