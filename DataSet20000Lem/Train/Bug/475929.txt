Mac OS X and newer laptop implement scroll wheel style control with a 2 finger trackpad gesture. Firefox used to use this gesture to scroll the tab left and right when there are so many that they don't fit along the top of the window. The latest Shiretoko/3.1b3pre break this behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open enough tab such that it put the arrow up at the left and right of the tab bar.
2. Try to scroll the tab with the 2 finger trackpad motion (should be equivalent to the scroll wheel on a mouse).

Actual Results:
The tab bar doe not scroll with either left/right or up/down 2 finger motion.

Expected Results:
The tab bar *used* to scroll left and right.

I've been using the Shiretoko/3.1b3pre build for a while. I restart the browser every week or so. I just noticed this after restarting and letting it auto-update to the latest build. So I assume this wa broken between now and a week or so ago.

Actually looking at the version number it look like my build is from 1/23. I'll update to the latest and see if it's fixed.
