I am using Firefox running on a remote machine using an XServer (Cygwins XFree
Implementation on windows) on my local machine.
Moving the mouse and browsing through firefox' menu usually consumes about 2-8%
of my network bandwith (10MBit). When nothing happens on screen the X-Server
connection us close to 0 bandwith.

However: If I open the "About Mozilla Firefox" dialog from the help menu, it
nearly kill my X-Server connection. With the only the about dialog open and no
other action on screen, the connection us a bandwith of 45-50% from my 10MBit
line.

This seems odd, since there ar no animation or similar thing in the about
dialog so there shouldn't be anything which the XServer ha to update.
If it helps, I can provide ethereal logs.

MfG

Sebastian

Only consume the normal idle X-bandwith. Perhaps the about dialog get's upadated
too often, which isn't neccessary since it's static
