It seems Firefox running on PC with Windows XP PRO EN SP2 with 2 or more tab
open doesn't restore normally after "hibernate". Every instance of Firefox loses
ability to make new connections. After closing all instance sometimes it
resurrects and start working normally, but more frequent practice is that
reboot is required. When rebooting several 'XP-COM not responding' window are
popped up, sometimes hanging up the system. In such case 'firefox.exe' is seen
in task manager, but task manager is unable to terminate it.
