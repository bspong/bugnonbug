firefox -remote 'openurl(...,new-tab)' return error if the process ha no controlling terminal
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071015 SUSE/2.0.0.8-1.1 Firefox/2.0.0.8

A firefox 2.0.0.8 process that ha no controlling terminal (i.e. all application launched from the desktop), and which wa called as:

firefox -remote 'openurl(...,new-tab)'

return the error:

"Error: Failed to send command: 500 command not parseable"

The issue did not show with version 2.0.0.7. Therefore, it's likely that the issue wa introduced in version 2.0.0.8


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. An initial instance of the firefox browser must be running (PROCESS_1).

2 Another process (PROCESS_2) try to send a command to the already
running instance, using the "-remote openurl($URL,new-tab)" command line
option. I've been using the following bash command:

/usr/bin/firefox -remote 'openurl(http://www.google.com,new-tab)' 2>
/tmp/ff.out

*Important*
PROCESS_2 must have been launched *without* a controlling
terminal. The simplest way to achieve that is to create a desktop icon
or a desktop panel item, and make it execute the above command line.
Ensure that any (advanced) option w.r.t. "run in terminal" is
deselected when creating the desktop item. I'm using the KDE desktop,
and hence KDE terminology. Therefore, these feature may be called
differently, depending on which desktop you're using.

Note:
If PROCESS_2 wa launched *with* a terminal attached, then firefox behaves a it should.

Actual Results:
PROCESS_2 return the following error message in /tmp/ff.out:

"Error: Failed to send command: 500 command not parseable"

and the google web page is not being loaded.


Expected Results:
- PROCESS_2 ought not return an error
- /tmp/ff.out ought be an empty file
- PROCESS_1 ought load the google web page in a separate tab.


Note: The reproducible step are outlined for linux because that's where I encounter the issue. That doe not mean that other execution environment are unaffected (see below for a specification of the execution environment).
