Location bar auto-bookmarks/history-search need to consider search shortcut

I've noticed that the auto-search/completion function of the location bar (which wa one of Firefox's 3 new feature and which automatically check whether keywords entered in the location bar match website stored in bookmark or history) treat search shortcut a keywords, while it should ignore them instead.

Example:
1. Say I've defined 'g' a a shortcut for google search, and I've also stored Bugzilla in my bookmark (Title "BUgzilla", Tags "bugs, mozilla, firefox").
2. Because I have a weak memory, I've forgotten about having saved Bugzilla a a bookmark, hence enter 'g firefox bugs' to look for the correct site for filing bugs).
3 Now, the expected behavior would be that firefox would simple display the bookmarked and tagged Bugzilla page at the top of the auto-search results. However, the 'g' among the keywords apparently distorts the location bar's auto-search results, a a result of which the Bugzilla page is moved a couple of notch down.


This is not a major annoyance, but it certainly would be more user-friendly is the distortion wa corrected.

Reproducible: Always
