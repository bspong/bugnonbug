using a WYSIWYG plugin http://xstandard.org in a form and including a fallback input or textarea a alternative content for the object. on form submission, both the object value AND the alternative content's form control value are submitted (causing a doubling up at the receiving end). per spec, if the object is succesfully rendered by the browser, i believe the alternative content should NOT be submitted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download free xstandard plugin http://xstandard.org (or adapt the testcase code to any other object that work on your system)
2. load up the testcase and submit the form
3. check the GET request (or, to see the same effect happen in a POST request, analyse the sent HTTP headers)

Actual Results:
both the object value AND the value of any alternative fallback form control within the object are submitted

Expected Results:
if the object wa rendered succesfully, only the object's value should be submitted. the alternative content inside the object should be completely ignored (to take it further, the entire alternative content should possibly be expunged from the DOM altogether?)
