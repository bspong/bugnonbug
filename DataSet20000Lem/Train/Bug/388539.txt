Ok, when i go to certain website like runescape.com and others of that sort. Firefox crash a soon a it try to load the application itself. For example i can go to runescape.com and other site that use Java, without it crashing, until it try to load what is on that page that us Java. At first i thought it might have been a problem with Java and Firefox thinking you have a version of Java that you do not, since a similar bug ha been posted about this. Everything seemed to check out fine, just in case I updated Java since I had an older version. Firefox would still crash, I went into internet option looking for something related to Java. I found that if I uncheck the box to Enable Java it will not crash, but it will not load what is trying to use Java. Also there is no problem with Flash like I have seen somebody post in a comment to a similar report to this one. I have tried erasing my cooky deleting my history changing security options, and there seems to be no solution. I am not sure whether this started occurring when I updated Firefox or very soon after.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.runescape.com
2.select existing character
3.pick the display quality (neither matter)
4.also lower on the page you can pick which Java applicate you wish to run (I have tried each of them)
5.choose a world
6. then it will start to load the game and immediately crash
7. this happens with everything trying to use Java
Actual Results:
Firefox would close itself out completely. I would either click start new session or resume. if I resume it would load the last thing before it did crash. if I start a new session and go back to revisit it is not stored in the cooky that I have even been there at all.

Expected Results:
should have loaded the website without shutting itself down

I have Fasterfox which hasn't given me problem before
I have VideoDownloader which also hasn't given me problem
After this incident started occurring I have gotten a new them and Tor
I have the latest Firefox browser and Java plugin for Firefox
