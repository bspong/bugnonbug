I built this form to allow user to create online Gradebooks. For a long time, the form worked exactly a expected. I have recently added some small feature to the form (specifically an extra text input for each column of the form you see). Now, almost every time I try to submit the form, the browser crash completely.

I am unable to provide a Talkback ID for this bug a my internet provider appears to be blocking (? maybe?) the port that Talkback us to send their information.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.unitorganizer.com/drupal5/node/add/gradebook
2. Enter in the information to the form.
3. Click on 'Grading Categories' and fill in the 'Create New...' text input.
4. Click on 'Update Categories' or 'Submit'
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes. Form information is not saved upon re-opening Firefox.

Expected Results:
Form should be submitted and the updated information should be displayed.

This form work absolutely a expected in Internet Explorer 7 and Opera 9.
