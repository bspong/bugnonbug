I can reproduce this error every time. At first I thought it might be a
certificate thing but I don't see any option there that might indicate that.

Every time I try to visit www.cardmemberservices.com or online.firstusa.com with
Firebird 0.7, the browser stall for a minute or two and return saying that it
could not access the page. I've e-mailed their tech support and have told me
that they are not having any problems. I've tried another browser (Mozilla 1.4)
and I can access the site fine.

My setting are identical in term of ad blocking so I don't think it's that.

here is the redirect snippet from www.cardmemberservices.com:
<meta http-equiv="REFRESH" content="0;
url=https://online.firstusa.com/bolHome.aspx">


Do you guy have any thought on what's going on?
