Windows XP machine with the Geneva font (a TrueType font popularized by Apple) display garbage character where that font is called forth by a web page in any size larger than 100%. For example, an H2 specified via CSS to be in Geneva will appear a garbage characters.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install geneva.ttf on any WindowsXP PC and restart.
2. Visit a website that us CSS to specify that H2s should appear in the Geneva font, such a www.radio1190.org

Actual Results:
3. Note that the H2s appear a garbage characters.
4. On the same machine, launch IE and visit same url, note that the H2s appear fine (necessary to confirm that geneva.ttf is not corrupt).

Expected Results:
Ideally, Firefox should render Geneva correctly. An unacceptable but perhaps necessary workaround would be for Firefox (and only Firefox) to force Geneva to appear a Helvetica.
