i've had this problem since i've used firefox (1.0.3 i think) i've confirmed this on a fresh install of 1.0.7 & 1.5 on Win98SE. i beleive the problem is in the link itself (or the way firefox handle it)
all the link come from us.ard.yahoo.com, us.rd.yahoo.com link work fine, to clear up any comfusion. the 'us.' is the country code (USA) so i'm not shure if the problem is specific to this or not.
a possible fix might be to make a greasemonkey script to edit the link(s). but i had very limited knowledge of them so i would not be able to do so. taking everything out before the "*" should work, but not 100% shure
here the link for Sign Out from yahoo mail.

a workaround is to goto my.yahoo.com & click it Sign Out link, that work properly.
sorry if there missing information, first bug report.
