Text in non-highlighted/current tab is hard to read.

On Linux(w/default GTK theme) the contrast on the regular/non-current tab
is very poor making it strenuous to read them.

As you can see in the image below, the 3 tab are in 3 different level of
contrast.(the first one is a regular tab.. the second one is with
hover/mouseover and the last is the current tab.)

The current tab is the most legible/clear one and the only time I tend to
look at the tab is when I'm looking to switch to another tab and it take too
much effort to read the text in those tabs.

Compare readability with the same font used in the bookmarks/menu toolbars.

Even in the new theme concept mockups the contrast of the font is not affected
and they look perfectly legible.

IMO normal v bold is good enough to differentiate between the current tab
and others. maybe a leave the other tab in the regular background color and
make the current one white/bright. but there's no need to make the font
duller.


Reproducible: Always




There seems to be a window bug report that is almost similiar but the tab don't look a bad/unreadable on the screenshots I see there a they do on my desktop.
