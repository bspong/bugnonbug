save this html to a file a "test.html". Open it, and click the test button a
fast a you can. You will notice that the javascript open many window with
the same name "myWindow". Note that this won't work if the popup window is
opened by the time you click the second time.

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>

<script language="javascript">
function openNamedWindow(){
var myWindow = window.open("./test.html","myWindow","width=50,height=50");
if (!myWindow.opener) myWindow.opener = self;
myWindow.focus();
}
</script>

<button onclick="openNamedWindow();" >Test</button>

</body>
</html>

It appears that I cannot reproduce this bug in IE, because there is a forced
pause after it open a window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. save the attached file test.html somewhere
2. open test.html in FireFox 0.8
3. click on the test button many time a fast a you can.

Actual Results:
multiple window name "myWindow" will be opened.

Expected Results:
only one window with the name "myWindow" should be opened.
