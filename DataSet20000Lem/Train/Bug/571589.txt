Firefox hang (almost) completely. Oddly enough - at least to me, is that the window will minimize and restore, but it won't repaint itsef. I another window is above it then removed, the visual content are still within the firefox window.

When this happens, I open gnome-system-monitor, and it show firefox in a "futex wait" state. This is always the case!

I have tried to see if there are any correlation to specific apps or actions, but it doe seem very random, although it a tab is loading, and you try to scroll or open a menu, or even switch to a different tab, this seems to cause the problem a lot, but on some occasions, this ha happened when sending the tab to a new URL.

FWIW: I typically have two or three tab open, and I know at least one of them auto-refreshes ad on it.

I do have cool-previews running, but I get the same problem with or without it.
