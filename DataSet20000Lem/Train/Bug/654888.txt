Hello
I have been upgrading Firefox for many year and I have seen a display problem that show only when certain .asp* webpage are opened with Firefox. The problem is that the header or the footer info are doubled or misplaced. At first I thought it wa poor programming on the part of the webmasters. But then I noticed that this problem doesn't show on other browser such a IE or Google chrome or Safari. Now I am writing you because I am now convinced that this problem is only related to Firefox because today I wa browsing Office 365 website (also an asp webpage) and the same display problem occurred. And now I have info that I can give you so you can fix it. Please open the following 2 page and see what I mean:

I hope you will fix this problem a I have migrated to Firefox from IE for a year now and it is frustrating that this problem repeat with other asp webpages.

I would appreciate a feedback when you have fixed it. Thank you

FYI I am no a web developper. But I have strong programming skill so I can decipher code. So when you communicate, please speak more English than IT language. Like you would speak to a user and not a programmer.

P.S.: I did not upgrade beyond 3.6.## version this time because the cookie editor that is available from Mozilla work only with 3.6.### version and not later versions. Until I find a reliable cookie editor from Mozilla, I will keep upgrading to the 3.6.## versions. In any case the problem only happens with Firefox browser and not the others.
