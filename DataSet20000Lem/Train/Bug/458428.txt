Firefox connection to internet fails-after Tbird 20017 used

When firefox 3.0.3 is started, it work perfectly. I installed the broadband speed test and diagnostics add-on, and the connection is perfect. I then start thunderbird 2.0.0.17 and check my email. After that, firefox's connection to the internet is broken. This usually occurs the first time I check my email. The diagnostics tool show it cannot resolve the domain name server for my dsl or even my IP address ("undefined"). It also say my hob 2 connection ha been lost. Firefox on other computer on my small network are not affected, they can still connect to the internet. This go away after about thirty minute or when I reboot. I have yet to try ipconfig -release (kinda forgot that command - duh, brainlock). I have just installed tbird 2.0.0.12. I'll know in the next day or two if this ha solved the problem. I have a dual boot system. If this reoccurs, I'll check it on XP.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open and use firefox
2.open and check email with thunderbird 2.0.0.17
3.firefox cannot find domain name server after that.
Actual Results:
After being locked out of the internet for about 30 min, firefox get it DNS server connection back. Trying to reproduce the incident after that is intermittent. Sometimes checking email will cause it to happen again, sometimes not. It almost always happens when I check my email for the first time.

Expected Results:
I don't remember this problem at all before about two week ago. I always check my email while surfing the web.

During the DNS lockout, tbird work fine. It still connects to my email account and downloads email. Only the gmail account is inaccessible.
