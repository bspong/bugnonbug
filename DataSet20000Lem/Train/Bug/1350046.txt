Fix React-related console error in grid layout panel
There are a couple of React-related warnings/errors showing up in the console browser. We should fix these, a mentioned by Patrick:

When opening the panel for the first time:

"Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of `GridList`. See https://fb.me/react-warning-keys for more information.
in GridItem (created by GridList)
in GridList (created by Grid)
in div (created by Grid)
in div (created by Grid)
in Grid (created by bound createElement)
in bound createElement (created by Accordion)
in div (created by Accordion)
in div (created by Accordion)
in div (created by Accordion)
in Accordion (created by App)
in div (created by App)

in Connect(App)
in Provider
in div (created by Tabs)
in div (created by Tabs)
in div (created by Tabs)
in Tabs (created by Tabbar)
in div (created by Tabbar)
in Tabbar"


And this one too:

"Warning: Unknown prop `object` on <span> tag. Remove this prop from the element. For details, see https://fb.me/react-unknown-prop
in span (created by ElementNode)
in span (created by ElementNode)
in ElementNode (created by Rep)

in div (created by GridList)
in GridList (created by Grid)

in Tabbar"


I also see error when I click on a checkbox to highlight a grid in the layout panel:

Warning: setState(...): Cannot update during an existing state transition (such a within `render` or another component's constructor). Render method should be a pure function of prop and state; constructor side-effects are an anti-pattern, but can be moved to `componentWillMount`.


Looking at the stack trace, it seems to be coming from this location: updateBoxModel/lastRequest< resource://devtools/client/inspector/boxmodel/box-model.js:172:7

Finally, I see a lot of error when I start hovering over cell in the outline. The stack trace tell me these come from: onHighlighterChange resource://devtools/client/inspector/grids/grid-inspector.js:301:5
