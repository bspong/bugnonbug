This problem ha been occurring since the first alpha of Firefox 3.6

I've got a shortcut named "en" which load page http://www.thefreedictionary.com/%s

Now when I'm already on the page of some definition, with the search box focused, and when I enter a new word in the location bar ("en my new word"), the location is sometimes not correctly updated:
after hitting enter, the page's search box is focused back and from time to time, the "enter key hit" seems to be sent to that search box, loading the word entered in that box instead of the location I just entered.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (This might be optional) Have a shortcut "en" which redirects to http://www.thefreedictionary.com/%s
2. Go to some definition page on http://www.thefreedictionary.com, and make sure the search box is focused
3. Cmd + L to focus the location bar
4. Enter a new search: "en my new search" and hit the enter key
Actual Results:
The page's search box is focused back.
From time to time (I'd say one in twenty tries), the word in that box is loaded (as if the enter key hit had been sent to that box also and had taken precedence on the new location)

Expected Results:
The new location should have been loaded since the enter key wa hit while in the location bar.

I wa able to reproduce it on a barebone namoroka profile, though it took me several try before it happened: sometimes, it will happen twice in a row, sometimes it will only scarcely happen.

It may also be dependent on the application responsiveness but I wasn't able to measure that.

And each time it occurred, the page had finished loading (in case you wonder if this stem from the search box being autofocused on load)
