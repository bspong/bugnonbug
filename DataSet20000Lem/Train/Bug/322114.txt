I read the bug correspondence back in FEB/MAR 05. I cannot contribute anything on the technical side. However, If you need to test software in a "controlled" environment, I believe I can arrange this with about half of my students.

I'm a Business School Prof. (international management) and strongly promote open software including Firefox and Open Office. My school is Euromed Marseille Ecole de Management in Marseilles, France (www.euromed-marseille.com). We use Cyberlibris for our library need (www.cyberlibris.com). I have around 200 student per year in my classes.
