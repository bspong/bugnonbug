I would like to sync my bookmark to a public or private place on www.

Then when I'm using another computer than my own I would like to fast an
easy connect to my private or public folder on www and get those bookmark imported to a subfolder in the bookmarksfolder of this computer. .. or similar.

Then when I add/change/delete to "my" subfolder on the borrowed computer, then I would like my bookmark on the www to be updated automagically.

Likewise, when I add/change/delete to bookmakrs on my own computer, then I would like my bookmark on the www to be updated automagically.

I belive this would be a nice feature for people that are travelling a lot.

Today, I would have to:
First remember to export my bookmark to my email.
Then I would have to import the bookmark to the borrowed computer.
Then I would have to remember to export the bookmark to my email again, from the borrowed computer.
Then I would have to remember to import the new bookmark from my email.

Not a very easy task.

If Firefox cannot provide an online storage place for the bookmark then Firefox and Google (or some other) might want to do this together.
I belive google or some other www company would offer this storage for free a long a they could display add in the process of syncing the bookmark between the www and current computer....

Reproducible: Always
