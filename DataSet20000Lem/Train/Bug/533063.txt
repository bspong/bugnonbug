Network lost after sleep using wlan

As most Macbook Pro user i normally close the display when i'm not using the laptop. This put the laptop into sleep mode which mean my wlan connection drops. So far so good.
But when i open the display my wlan connection connects up properly but Firefox dont seem to be able to pick up the connection.
It simply show page not found all the time.
I have found a work-around for this problem but it is a bit annoying now that i have dont this so many time so i file this bug-report.
My work around is:
- After i open the display and WLAN connects again
- Open Preferences in Firefox
- Go to Advanced-->Network-->Settings
- Change from "No Proxy" to something else like "Auto Detect" and back to "No Proxy"
- Now the connection is resumed/found again in Firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Close the display (go to sleep)
2.Open the display (resume)
3.Use Firefox
Actual Results:
Firefox dont see the network

Expected Results:
network should be found and i should be able to browse page

I have given all the info i have in detail but please contact me if you have further questions. I love Firefox and would love to help if i can.
