Please, just add a little toggle to switch between "portrait" and "landscape" within the print dialog box so user can make the choice.

Please, please, please make this change. You guy are geniuses. I am developing a web application that print a report and I have made sure everything work perfect in Firefox, but this is the only thing holding my development back and delivering to the client. If there is a Javascript, Java, CSS or Actionscript solution for your browser please let me know. Otherwise, can you again please make this change.
