Having a maximized Firefox, open a popup using a javascript window.open and a fixed size. The popup is opened maximized, then the resize animation get triggered until it get to the correct size, which is pointless and le productive than a popup having the correct size since the beginning.

Reproducible: Always

1.Launch firefox and set it maximized
2.Open the sample given in the Additional Information field below in Firefox4.0b8 nightly
3.Click on 'Open Me' inside the sample.
Actual Results:
Open the popup with a maximized size, then trigger the resize animation until it reach the requested size.

Expected Results:
Open the popup with the correct size since the beginning without animation.

Easy test case : copy and paste the following html in a text file and rename it 'popup_test.html' then open it with firefox :

<html>
<head>
<title>Popup resize animation test case</title>
<script>
function OpenPopup()
{
window.open("about:blank","_blank","height=380,width=400,resizable=no,status=no");
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
First, set Firefox4.0 beta a maximized, then click on <span style='color:blue;cursor:pointer;' onclick='OpenPopup();'>Open me!</span>
<br>Nasty animation which take forever before showing this 'about:blank' window, huh ?
</body>
</html>
