For about a week now, Minefield nightlies crash on quitting the app. When I quit the app, 1-2 minute later a crash dialog window appears stating the app ha crashed. What's weird is that upon launching Minefield, I get an additional icon in my dock (my default one and a new one) a if 2 different version are running. Both are showing a active. I only have 1 install of Minefield (not two separate apps). At first, I thought it wa perhaps due to the fact I have it installed in a subdirectory within Applications. Even if I move the app to the root, the problem persist. To troubleshoot this a few day ago, I deleted all my Firefox/Mozilla file (preferences and everything else) to start fresh. The problem went away. I don't know if upon restarting it a second time, if the problem would have continued fixed by I do know that on my next install of a nightly, the problem returned.

I've been running nightlies with extension for quite a while with no problems. I even trimmed the extension down to just one (1Password) but the problem remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start app.
