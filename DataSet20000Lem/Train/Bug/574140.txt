After a firefox crash, the popup is maximized, it is not supposed to maximize it.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; sk; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; sk; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

So, the java messed up the firefox, made it crash, then the firefox upgraded (co-insidence).

I know how to crate this mess.

Try to open some popop which wasn't maximized by default, then shut down the PC, or make it crash however you wish. Start the FF. You will notice that the popup which wa opened during the crash is always opened maximized, forced to... No know way how to fix this. no need to touch any settings, I tried to resintall the FF, it did not help. Only new profile helped.. Which is not an option.

So now, when ever I want to open the gmail IP Details (bottom of the page), it is simply opening so fuscreen-maximized, and it look extremely ugly. I'm tired of resizing it all the time back no normal.

My question, HOW to fix this ??

Thanks
