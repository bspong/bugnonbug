When attempting to send email to a M/Soft Outlook (2003) Web Access (OWA) server, a pop-up JanusSeal security classification pop-up appears. In Firefox 3.x, when selecting any item in the list in the pop-up window, the wrong option is highlighted (usually the one above it in the list) & sent to the server, and the email is not sent. It worked perfectly in Firefox 2.xx (all versions). This problem ha been repeated by others at work using Firefox 3 on different platform (Win XP & Linux), and at home (Linux).

Reproducible: Always

Woked OK in Firefox 2 - problem only affect Firefox 3.0 (and up).
