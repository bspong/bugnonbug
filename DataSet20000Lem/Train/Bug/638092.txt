Gravity Forms is a WordPress plugin. It collect data using a form. You have the option to export this form a a .csv file. When you try to do this in Windows 7, with FF 3.6.13, instead of downloading a .csv file, you download a .csv.txt file. The default program list is therefore populated with Notepad, Word, etc., rather than Excel, Open Office, etc.

Then, when trying to use the 'Open With' function (to open with Excel),the data is not imported correctly: it appears to be a mass of text on the spreadsheet, without being organized by column.

This is not an issue with Internet Explorer 8, Chrome 9.0.5, or Safari 5 (with Windows).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Gravity Form in WordPress (at least one field).
2. Submit an entry to the form (from the end user perspective).
3. From the WordPress Dashboard, select the 'Import/Export' option under the 'Forms' category.
4. Select the 'Download Export File' button.
5. The download box will pop up, displaying the file ending with .txt.
6. Try to open the file with one of the recommended applications.
6a. Open the containing folder of the download.
6b. Right click on the file, choose 'Open With.'
6c. Select Excel.
Actual Results:
6. Trying to open the file with the supplied applications, the .csv file ha been turned into a single paragraph.
6c. Trying to 'Open With' result in the same paragraph view.

Expected Results:
Pre-populated the application list with application that are able to open and view a spreadsheet correctly (Excel, Open Office).

Using the 'Open With' function, the file should be opened with Excel, and displayed correctly.
