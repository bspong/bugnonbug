Firefox very slow and hang for some time with warning "plugin-container: /usr/lib/libnss3.so: version `NSS_3.12.10' not found"
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1
Build ID: 20111120135848

Steps to reproduce:

Open any sight with plugins etc., like java/flash


Actual results:

Firefox hung for some time.
I started it from terminal it show message like
plugin-container: /usr/lib/libnss3.so: version `NSS_3.12.10' not found

After 10-20 seconds, it start working again


Expected results:

No Hang. Infact, I know the issue.
I do not have superuser access on my work machine RHEL5.
Due to this reason, I have to install firefox 8 in my home directory.

Now firefox pic libnss3 from /usr/lib instead of picking it up from firefox install directory. This is seriously weird. Firefox ha the latest libnss3 in it home directory, but it going to usr/lib

This problem wa not there in older(7.0 or older) version of firefox, and is coming from 8.0 onwards.

Its there in firefox 9(from betachannel) and also in firefox 10 (from Aurorachannel)

I think a simple code fix would be to first check for all libs in firefox install directory, and then go to /usr/lib

I think this is not implemented currently a many people install firefox a superuser through their package managers, which result in firefox lib in /usr/lib

But this is a flawed model. First it should check where is firefox installed.

For example., somebody may have stable firefox in /usr/lib and a Aurora or Beta channel firefox in home directory for testing.

Hopefully, we will see the fix in the next firefox update.

For people who install firefox from tar.gz packages, firefox executable and libs are in same directory.
So a simple check could be to look for libs in the directory where firefox executable resides, and then go to system dirs.
