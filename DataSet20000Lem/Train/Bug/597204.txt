This issue is not only tied to the internet explorer 9 test drive page, but that is the cearest example that I could find to demonstrate this bug. When I am IE9 testdrive page and under each of the section I press the more button, instead of showing me the option I get an error window which states, "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (javascript) isn't associated with any program". This issue also occurs on other site such a youtube, while it is loading the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the website http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/
2. Under the performance section there should be a called "more", whic must be pressed. (This issue will also occur if the "more" button from the other section is pressed.
3. Once the button is pressed, instead of showing all of the options, Firefox 4 give an error whichs states, "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (javascript) isn't associated with any program".
Actual Results:
The browser gave an error stating, "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (javascript) isn't associated with any program".

Expected Results:
The browser should have showed me all the options, when taht button wa pressed, the option should have collapsed in. This collapsing issue is not only limited to this site, it ha ocured on certain other where the information is not shown.

I am using the new "Firefox 4 Button UI" theme which is considered the default theme. GPU acceleration is enabled, Directwrite support is enabled, and smooth scrolling is also enabled. Also, a a side note this issue doe not occur on this website or another website on the Mac version of Minefield (Firefox 4), it could be a platform specific problem.
