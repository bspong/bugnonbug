On meebo when i start a webcam chat with someone the webcam is running but is disabled. I go to enable the webcam and sometimes the webcam filter for special affect and "Firefox ha stoped working" appeared. That didn't always happen though. It used to do that after i enable it and meebo say it couldn't save the setting from the last session because the browser crashed. It crash everytime I enable it and it always disable because it always crashes.

Reproducible: Always

1.Log-in to http://www.meebo.com.

6.Re-enable the choice(s) you choose above if you see a message saying that it couldn't save the setting from the previous time because it crashed.
