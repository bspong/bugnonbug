When the Bookmarks Toolbar ha been moved to the right of the Menu Bar, when starting Firefox the Bookmarks get laid out a if the window wa narrower than it actually is. Maximizing and Restoring corrects the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to View-->Toolbars-->Customize, drag the Bookmarks Toolbar to the right of the menu bar (next to the "Help" menu). Click done to exit the Customize dialog.
2. Fill up the Toolbar with folder or bookmark so it is almost full.
3. Have the Firefox window unmaximized, with a normal web browsing width. Observe the Bookmarks layout, which should be correct.
4. Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:
The first few bookmark show correctly, but then a » sign show indicating extra bookmark exist (see attachment 1), but it shouldn't, because a lot of empty space is there that should be used to layout the bookmarks.

Expected Results:
To see the expected results, just maximize the Firefox window, and then Restore it. The bookmark now take up all available space, and no » is required. See attachment 2.

Speculation: it look a though, on start up, the Bookmarks are laid out before the Firefox window is fully set up, and the width that is taken into consideration a available is narrower, for some reason.
