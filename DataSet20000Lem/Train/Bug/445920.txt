I recently upgraded to mac os-x 10.5.4, and noticed that when a dropdown menu wa open and the pointer passed over a banner ad with an interactive flash animation behind the menu, it would behave a if the menu wa not there.

With certain banners, the pointer is not displayed while on top of the banner; when a menu is open, it disappears when it pass over the flash banner and doesn't reappear until clicking somewhere to close the menu. The pointer remains hidden when passing between menus, and when not over a menu. This happens with both live bookmark and the top menu bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to sfgate.com/news/ or another site with banner ad near the top of the page.
2. Reload until a flash ad appears that hide the pointer and includes an animation that follows the pointer; specifically the comcast ads.
3. Open a live bookmark that cover the banner, and pas the pointer over an item on top of the banner.
Actual Results:
The flash animation responds to the pointer, which disappears when passing over the banner, and doe not reappear when moved away from the banner.

Expected Results:
The pointer should not disappear.

I never noticed this problem in the previous version of the OS.
