Ctrl+I, Ctrl+J, Ctrl+K differ between Windows and Linux

First, I'm sure this ha been brought up. I searched and searched and couldn't
find anything though, so if it's out there I'm sorry.

There's big difference between the prebuilt window packages, and the
self-built linux package for Firefox 0.9x. My linux distro is Gentoo, and I
use portage, of course, to do my software installs.

In windows, Options is in the tool menu (where I prefer it). In linux, it is
under edit.
In windows, Ctrl-K is "focus search bar". In linux it is Ctrl-J. In windows,
Ctrl-J is "popup page information box".
In windows, "Backspace" is "go back" which (I admit it!) I'm used to from IE,
and is a convenient 1-key shortcut. Doesn't work on Linux.

I'm sure there's more, but that's what I've noticed so far. It would be *very*
beneficial for people like me using linux at home but forced to use window at
work to have the browser work the same.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install window binary of Firefox.
2. Build Firefox from source via emerge in gentoo.



Expected Results:
Same program work the same way on different platforms.
