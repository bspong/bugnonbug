In Firefox 1.0.x, hitting the reply button would quote the text in the message window for the post you clicked the reply button for. It now still doe that, except that the font is changed and then the text is NOT quoted in the post, once you click on the submit post button. I have started a thread in the Playstation forum and both Mac and Windows user with Firefox 1.5 are seeing this issue. I tried the latest build of mozilla and it functioned correctly, a Firefox 1.0.7 wa for me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into the Playstation forum, Racing, Gran Turismo, and select any thread.
2.Click on the reply button next a message, then wait for the next window to completely load.
3.Click on the white quote icon (cartoon message bubble) then add text below that and click the submit post button.

Actual Results:
The new message will post WITHOUT quoting the text it showed to be quoting in the message window.

Expected Results:
It would quote the text exactly a previously formatted and in the same font.

I'm using the standard theme and have not installed or updated any other software on my system concurrent to the upgrade from Firefox 1.0.7 to Firefox 1.5.

I'm running this on an Apple dual 800 Mhz G4, with 1.5 GB of RAM and Mac OS 10.4.3
