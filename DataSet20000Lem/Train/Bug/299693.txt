When I go to my site and add a second tab my site doe not reload on the
OnResize event. This is not when the browser resizes by the user in the sense
of resizing the full window but that when the browser area change due to tab
now reducing the available vertical-client height.

Now that it cross my mind can I assume that OnResize should also be occupanied
by something that detects a change in document.body.clientHeight in order to
support tabbed browser or should OnReize be made to include the condition of
change space on account of tabs?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page with a script (such a mine) that reloads the page if the window
is resized.
2. Open a 2nd tab.
3. Go back to the first tab and see how the bottom frame is now mostly covered.

Actual Results:
Bottom frame covered by reduced space due to tab being added.

Expected Results:
Either OnResize should be made to accomadate this or I'm sure someone else may
have a fine suggestion?

I have not attempted to try to detect change in the document.body.clientHeight
in order to reload the page so I don't know if there is a work around.
