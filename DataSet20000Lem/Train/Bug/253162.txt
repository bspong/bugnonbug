When FireFox is set to hide tab when only one website is open, and a new tab is
opened while the first one is actively loading or seeking out other information
or data (as indicated by the activity icon in the upper-right corner), an
activity icon is placed in the tab of the new session, but not in the tab of the
original session (which, obviously, now ha it own tab).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. In FireFox, under Tools > Options > Advanced, under 'Browsing', make sure the
check box next to 'Hide the tab bar when only one website is open' is checked.
2. Go to a site (say cnn.com) that ha long load time for any given link
(combination text, pictures, links)
3. Select a link; while session is attempting to find the link you requested,
open a new tab using either Alt+T or File > New Tab.
Actual Results:
Tabs are created for both sessions, but no activity icon is created on original
session's tab. After this point, however, if any link is followed in the
original session, an activity icon *will* appear.

Expected Results:
User should see an activity icon created, even when a lone session is suddenly
made 1 of x.
