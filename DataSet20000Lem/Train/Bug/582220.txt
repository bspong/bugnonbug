This problem have some variations:

-Setting "dom.ipc.plugins.enabled" to "true" doesn't change the bug behaviour.
-Setting "dom.ipc.plugins.enabled.npswf32.dll" to "false" while "dom.ipc.plugins.enabled" is set to "true" display this error message while loading the video player:

“A script in this movie is causing Adobe Flash Player 10 to run slowly. If it continues to run, your computer may become unresponsive. Do you want to abort the script? Yes / No.”

Clicking no continues to render the player. Clicking yes make the "player bar" disappear, rendering the player useless.

-When these option are in default("dom.ipc.plugins.enabled" on "false" and "dom.ipc.plugins.enabled.npswf32.dll" on "true"), you have the problem without the script error.
-This problem happens even on a clean install with only plugins installed.
-Using the following add-ons:

-Fission 1.0.9
-Download StatusBar 0.9.7
-Flashblock 1.5.13
-Adblock Plus 1.2.1

-Enabling or disabling hardware acceleration doesn't change anything.
-Using Firefox in safe mode doesn't change anything.
-3.5.11, 3.6.8(which I'm using), 4.0 beta 1 and Minefield have the exact same problem.
