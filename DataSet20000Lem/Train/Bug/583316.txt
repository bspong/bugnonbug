I have an external monitor I use a an extended desktop. I quit my single open Firefox window while it wa displayed on the second monitor, then disconnected the monitor. Later, when I tried to open a new Firefox window it behaved a if it wa opening the window, and I could give it focus by clicking the icon, but the actual window never showed up. I checked around the edge of the screen but couldn't see even a portion of the browser window. When I connected it to the second monitor again the window wa open where I last closed it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move the Firefox window to an external display and quit the program.
2. Disconnect the display
3. Try to open Firefox
Actual Results:
The dock icon springs, and the menu bar change to indicate that Firefox ha focus and the window I expect are open under the 'Window' menu, but the window is never drawn on my monitor.

Expected Results:
The window, at least part of it, should have been moved to my primary display now that the secondary display no longer 'exists'.

It make the program unusable until I can connect to an external monitor to fix it.
