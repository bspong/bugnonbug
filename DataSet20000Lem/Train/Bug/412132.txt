after changing a bookmark's location, need to update the frecency of the "old" uri.

we already update the frecency of the "new" uri for the bookmark.

From the current patch in bug #394038, see nsNavBookmarks::ChangeBookmarkURI()

// upon changing the uri for a bookmark, update the frecency for the new place
// no need to check if this is a livemark, because...
rv = History()->UpdateFrecency(placeId, PR_TRUE /* isBookmark */);
NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv);

#if 0
// upon changing the uri for a bookmark, update the frecency for the old place
// XXX todo, we need to get the oldPlaceId (fk) before changing it above
// and then here, we need to determine if that oldPlaceId is still a bookmark (and not a livemark)
rv = History()->UpdateFrecency(oldPlaceId, PR_FALSE /* isBookmark */);
NS_ENSURE_SUCCESS(rv, rv);
#endif

notes:

1)

Q: "no need to check if this is a livemark, because..."?
A: the reason we check if a bookmark is real child of a livemark item is that those should not appear in autocomplete (so frecency should be = 0) if they are not visited. When changing a bookmark's uri, the new url is a legit bookmark, so we want it to appear in ac, even if not visited.

2)

if we don't fix this, here's an how the user would see it:

say I have a legit bookmark to foo.com/story1.html and that is also a livemark item for food.com/feed.xml. foo.com/story1.html is not visited, but since it is a legit bookmark, and not just an item of a livemark feed, it should show up in the ac results.

now, say I change the uri for the legit foo.com/story1.html bookmark to be foo.com/story2.html.

the current code will call UpdateFrecency() on foo.com/story2.html, and pas in isBookmark = true, so this will now be visible in ac even if not visited.

but, the disabled code will not call UpdateFrecency() on foo.com/story1.html, so it will appear in ac result even though it is only an unvisitied livemark item.
