Tag list is not updated when manually adding, renaming, or deleting tag from within the tag field
In the new dialog for adding a bookmark, there is a text box to type in tags. This ha an expansion arrow next to it that show the tag that are available (having already been used for other bookmarks).

Whether this section with tag is displayed or not is a sticky session. Once the user open it, it will be open whenever the "Add Bookmark" dialog is brought up. If it is closed, it will stay closed.

I found that if it is expanded and a *new* tag is added to a bookmark, the new tag will not be added to the list of available tag immediately. If the user is on the page where the new tag wa added and invokes the "Add Bookmark" dialog, they will see their new tag in the textbox for tag but not the list of available tags.

If the expansion arrow next to the tag text box is selected to close the tag list and then selected again to reopen it, the new tag will *then* appear in the list. This happens even if you are bookmarking a different page. Any added tag do not appear in the list of available tags, at least in that session, until the list is collapsed and re-expanded.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to a new page.
2. Select control/command-d to add the page to bookmarks.
3. Select the button next to the "tags" textbox to expand the tag list.
4. Type in the tag, '1234', into the tag textbox.
5. Select the "Done" button to close the dialog.
6. Navigate to a different page.
7. Select control/command-d to add the page to bookmarks.
8. Look at the tag list (the list will be expanded). '1234' will not be in the list of available tags.
9. Select the button next to the "tags" textbox twise, to collapse and expand the tag list.

Result: '1234' will now appear in the list of tag when it wasn't there before.
