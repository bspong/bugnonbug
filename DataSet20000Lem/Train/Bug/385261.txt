Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; ru; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

My Internet connection configuration:
Outpost Firewall Pro (http://www.agnitum.com/products/outpost/index.php) with plugin "HTTP Log"(can show all request to Internet)
toonel.net (http://www.toonel.net/), mapping-127.0.0.1:8081
HandyCache (http://handycache.ru/), external proxy-127.0.0.1:8081, access point-127.0.0.1:8080
Firefox addon "SwitchProxy Tool 1.4.1", manual proxy configuration - all mapping to 127.0.0.1:8080, Socks v5, no proxy for "localhost, 127.0.0.1"

in Outpost Firewall I enable SVCHOST.exe (for DNS requests), jawaw.exe (for toonel.net), firefox.exe (enable only TCP to 127.0.0.1)
in this configuration all work fine.
BUT, if I disable access to Internet for everything(through Outpost Firewall), for example, in 5 minutes, and then enable own again, I can't access to Internet. Any Internet request I can see in HandyCache monitor window, but in this case nothing happened. I close all Firefox windows, but shell command tasklist show me proccess Firefox.exe. I can't access to Internet through Firefox until I kill proccess Firefox.exe.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install any firewall, that can disable all Internet traffic.
2. Install local proxy HandyCache.
3. Setup Firefox for using local proxy.
4. All must work fine. In HandyCache monitor window you can see all requests.
5. Disable Internet traffic for everything in 5 minutes.
6. Enable Internet traffic.
7. Try open any URL.
Actual Results:
Firefox wait response a long time and then seems like no Internet connection. In HandyCache monitor window no new records. If I configures "Internet explorer" in same option, it's work.

Expected Results:
URL must open. In HandyCache monitor window must appear this URL.
