Plugins do not render at all.

I find that any page that is meant to launch a plugin, including Quicktime, Windows Media Player and Shockwave, fails to display any visuals in the area reserved for the graphic. If the associate medium ha a soundtrack this can be heard.

When I used Firefox 1.0.x I experienced a similar bug but the plugin would render if it's area wa made to overlap an edge of the visible page area.

All plugins appear a they should in Safari.

My system is a G4 667Mhz PowerBook (gigabit ethernet, no DVI), 768mb RAM and a 16mb ATI Mobility Radeon graphic card - the bare minimum for Quartz Extreme. OS is OS X v10.4.3, all latest software update applied.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/lum_adelson_check_shadow/index.html
2.
3.

Actual Results:
I am presented with a page featuring a gradient backdrop, the heading "Adelson’s “Checker-shadow illusion” / From Michael’s “Optical Illusions & Visual Phenomena”", a table with a completely blank top box that fill about 2/3 of the display area and then a lower box with text that start "What to do / You will, in all likelihood, perceive the above picture a a 3-dimensional scene..."

Expected Results:
A Shockwave Flash interactive animation should appear in the top box demonstrating a simple checkerboard optical illusion.

As stated, other plugins fail to render also. For example, http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3667906664707520844 display a righthand series of picture showing scene from a video concerning remote control car but the main area on the left that should contain a video window is completely blank. After a short wait, the sound of the video can be heard.

The video display perfectly in Safari. I have not deliberately adjusted any setting in the OS or Firefox concerning plugins.
