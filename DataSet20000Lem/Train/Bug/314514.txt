I cannot login into an user account on www.sipgate.at when using Firefox 1.0.x browser and Netgear FWG114P router (latest firmware 2.0.18).

The symptom are same in WinXP and Linux, the SSL connection hang after entering login data. Everything work in the same configuration with Konqueror browser or Internet Explorer. The problem is definitely not related to MTU setting a the same issue can be reproduced on 100MBit connection w/o any DSL inbetween.

Now, the funny thing is, if I replace the crappy Netgear FWG114P router with another one, e.g. AVM Fritz Box or Draytek everything work ok, even with Firefox.

The case is filed at Netgear support but there are just sucking moron screening the developer from customers. What i'd appreciate to hear here is, what is the main difference in how Firefox handle the SSL connection from IE or Konqueror ?

Ahm, an a short remark: I can see quite many SSL packet retransmission of unreassembled packet between the router and PC.
