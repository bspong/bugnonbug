Pop-up blocker faulty - Blocks new tabs/windows
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100701 Firefox/3.5.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100701 Firefox/3.5.11

After browsing for a few hours, Firefox start blocking all new windows. It show the message "Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window" even when "Block pop-up windows" in Options>Content is unchecked i.e. turned off.

Any button on any web-page/website that lead to a link that is supposed to open in a new tab/window get blocked. Right clicking the original link and selecting "Open link in a new tab/window" bypass the pop-up block message.

A Firefox restart also fix this problem for a few hour but I loose all open tabs/windows on restarting. It happens again in few hours.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse FF with a large number of tab open
2. Clicking many link which open in more new tab
Actual Results:
Suddenly FF pop-up blocker start blocking most of the link clicked on any website thinking it a a pop-up and show the message "Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window" even when "Block pop-up windows" in Options>Content is unchecked i.e. turned off.
