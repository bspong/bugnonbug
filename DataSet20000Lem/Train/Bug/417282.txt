When I access the URL "primusville.com/bullboard", that page remains constant and access content from the "prawnsong.com" domain for it's frames. Since FF3b2 and before, the "Remember Me" feature ha always worked correctly. Now in FF3b3, I must instead start at URL "prawnsong.com/bullboard" for the "Remember Me" feature to still work.

In short, these cross domain frame don't keep proper credential or cookies, I'm not sure which. I've changed no setting since upgrading to FF3b3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to "http://www.primusville.com/bullboard"
2. Login under a user name and password with "Remember Me" checked
3. Leave the site and return; Board doe not "Remember Me"
4. Go to "http://www.prawnsong.com/bullboard"; This domain doe "Remember Me"
Actual Results:
(Step 3 above)

Expected Results:
(Step 4 above, only in the "primusville.com" domain)

I have three active add-ons: DOM Inspector (duh), Customize Google, and Adblock Plus (with a fourth, ViewSourceWith, disabled for FF3b3).

I don't know if this issue ha greater security implication elsewhere.
