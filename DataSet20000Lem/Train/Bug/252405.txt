proxy setting import doesn't strip http:// if present in IE
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Firefox 9.1.2

When importing setting from Internet Explorer via the Windows Firefox
installer, the installer seems to incorrectly set the proxy settings.

IE had the proxy setting set like this:
http://proxyhost:8080/

And Firefox installer setup the proxy setting in Firefox a
Host: http://proxyhost
port: 8080

Either:
Firefox should ignore the http:// prefix, or the installer should strip the
http:// prefix.

This seems like a pretty straight forward problem.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Internet Explorer proxy setting to http://proxyhost:8080/
2. Install Firefox
3. Select to import setting from Internet Explorer

Actual Results:
Firefox complains of invalid proxy host.

Expected Results:
Either, firefox should ignore the http:// part, or the installer should strip it.
(Though this isn't the place to suggest it, it could also be possible for
firefox to understand the http:// part and allow proxy over http even. (good if
you want to surf privately on a non switched lan).


I rate this problem "Normal" rather than trival, because although there is an
easy work arround (simply remove the http:// part, it should definatly be fixed
because it will cause user to think firefox doesn't work with proxy server (as
I initially feared till I tried removing the http:// part).
