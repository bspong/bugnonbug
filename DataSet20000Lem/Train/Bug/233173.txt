missing "block/unblock cokies from this site" menu item (same thing for popups)
User-Agent:

I would like to have a "unblock cokies from this site" menu-item (resp "block"
if cooky where unblocked previously). Similar for Popups. Also "open cookie
manager" ("open popup-manager" respectively) would be nice.

Mozilla had those in the tool menu (i think), and i really came to like it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
look at the menu

Actual Results:
If i visite a site (using firebird) that doesn't work because cooky (resp.
popups) are bocked, i have to go to
tools->options->privacy->cookies->exceptions, look for the site and change the
status. VERY inconvenient.

Expected Results:
I would like to have a "unblock cokies from this site" (resp. "unblock popups")
item in the tool menu, and/or in the page-context-menu. It would also be an
option to integrate site-specific popup/cookie/image-settings etc into the
Page-Info dialog.

In Moz this used to be one click (ok, two with opening the menu). I WANT THAT
BACK! becaus other than that, i like Firebird better ('cause it's smaller,
faster and nicer. thank you very much...)
