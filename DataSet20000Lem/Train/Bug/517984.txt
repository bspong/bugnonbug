When i try to download and save a file, i often create a new folder on my HD.
I do this by rightclicking on the save a dialog window and clicking on New - Folder.
However no new folder appears in the dialog window until i press F5 to force the dialog to refresh.

I have verified:
- that this bug is present both in the file open and file save dialogs.
- that this bug is only present in Firefox. Internet explorer doe not suffer from this bug, nor doe explorer.
- That this also work when deleting a folder. The deleted folder doe not disappear from the dialog window until you refresh.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on File, then on Open file, or on Save page as, resp. Either works.
2. Rightclick on the area of the dialog showing which file are in the folder to open the context menu, press New, and then Folder.
3. The new folder is not visible until you press F5 to refresh the content of the folder.
Actual Results:
A folder created in the file open or save a dialog is not shown until the view of the folder is refreshed with the F5 button.
A folder deleted from inside the file open or save a dialog is not removed from the dialog until the content of the dialog are refreshed.

Expected Results:
The content of a folder should be updated immediately without a manual refresh.
