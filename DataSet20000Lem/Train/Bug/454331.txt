I am a web programmer and often have to resort to using PHP script to process some mass data

Recently I noticed that the script I ran did not run a expected and appeared a if I had run them already, when I obviously have not. Luckily I put in some code to avoid duplicate entries.

I then noticed that when I typed in the URL of my script in the address bar, the little icon on the left side of the address bar did a little animation when I finished typing... I am assuming this is a auto preload feature of the browser.. can you please either turn this off or at the very least give me an option to turn it off? This little feature of yours may cause problem for programmer like me in the future and if someone wa unlucky enough not to notice this and did not put in some sort of protection code or backed up their data they may end up with something like an empty database without ever knowing why.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type in URL
2. little icon on left doe animation
3. my script wa 'run' without me even running it
Actual Results:
my script at URL load before I want to

Expected Results:
URL stay there without 'preloading'
