Determine impact of stub installer default browser checkbox
Before we completely remove this checkbox (bug 1272162), I'd like to have a clearer understanding of it direct impact. Usually, the way to measure this kind of thing would be to do an A/B test (eg Funnelcake), and compare the test to a control group. Changes to the stub installer require a full-up build and release, so a Funnelcake repack isn't possible here. Instead, we'd like to do the following, which is basically doing an A/B test in a normal release:

1) The stub installer will hide the checkbox for a small, randomly chosen test cohort. EG: if(random() < 0.01) { hidden = true; }

2) When the stub installer doe this, it will tag the install a part of the test cohort. Probably with a registry key, similar to what wa done in bug 1041514.

3) Firefox will record that registry key in opt-out telemetry.

After this hit Release and soak for a while, we'll run a telemetry analysis to compare user retention, usage hours, etc for the two cohorts. (IE, Win 7/XP user who got the checkbox a normal v those who didn't a part of this test.)

If there's no significant difference, we should proceed with bug 1272162. If there's a small difference, we should discus if the qualitative benefit mean we should should still proceed with bug 1272162. This will give u the clearest understanding of the specific impact of what we're doing, and enable u to make an informed decision on deliberate change.

[Verdi suggested we could arrange for a heartbeat survey to see if user who didn't get the checkbox are happier a a result, which would help build the case for such qualitative benefits; good idea, separate bug.]

This is a minimal change to the stub installer, and since Jared's already done similar work in bug 1041514 he'll pick this up.
