On frequent occassion, page file usage increase to the point of slowing the computer to a freeze. This seems to be related to the use of Yahoo Mail. Page file usage go over 1 Gig. As soon a I force the closure of Moxilla, the page file history drop to 400 mb or less. The effect is immediate, so it is definitely Mozilla cranking up the page file usage.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a large amount of Spam mail or other mail in the spam folder or other folder

Actual Results:
Page file usage climb rapidly by a few 100 megabytes, causing Mozilla to appear fozen.

Expected Results:
There should no be this dramatic page file use that slows the computer
