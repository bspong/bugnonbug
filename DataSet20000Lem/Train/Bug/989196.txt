Do not show open Captive Portal automatically when OSX Captive Network Portal Assistant ha been opened
Note: Implementation followup from design Bug 878566
Spec: https://github.com/vtsatskin/FX-Captive-Portals-Design/blob/master/design/spec.md

As part of Firefox's Captive Portal Design, this bug add OSX Captive Network Assistant observation event and detects when Captive Network Assistant failed.

Starting in Mac OS X 10.7, a window appears when a captive portal ha been detected by the OS.

This may cause duplicated captive portal on the screen. If it's possible, Firefox should watch to see if Captive Network Assistant open a captive portal. If it does, there is no need to automatically open it in Firefox. However, if the system doe not properly detect a captive portal, Firefox should behave a defined in this spec.

For users, the outcome is that if an OSX-level Captive Portal is visible, a captive portal doe not automatically open in Firefox.

Acceptance Criteria:

- Firefox determines if an OSX-level captive portal is visible to the user in the foreground.
- If the user log into the OSX-level captive portal, Firefox never automatically open the captive portal in a tab.
- If the user doe not log into the OSX-level captive portal, Firefox automatically open a tab in the active window with a captive portal
