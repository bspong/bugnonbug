Full screen capture bar height should be customizable (and hideable)

When running Firefox 3.0 in fullscreen mode (using F11), a 5px bar appears at the top. I will call this bar the "capture bar" a I have not seen it named anywhere else. Please suggest a better name if one exists.

In Firefox 2 with the Fullerscreen Add-on, it wa possible to switch to a view in which the client area consumed 100% of the screen real estate.

It appears that in Firefox 3 with the built-in fullscreen capability, it is not possible to assign the client area 100% of the screen a the first five vertical pixel are reserved for the capture bar.

I propose a simple enhancement which is a configuration value for the height of the capture bar, with allowed value including 0px. This feature would enable the user to customize the size of this window a well a effectively disable it by making it a zero height. The developer/implementer may choose to instead implement this a an enabled/disabled flag, although this provides le customization for the user.

This enhancement is related-to, but distinct from #422867, which ha come to address the issue of the capture bar appearing when no toolbars are present.
