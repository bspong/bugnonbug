Windowless Silverlight App Takes One Click To Give The Object Tag Focus And Another Click To Interact With The Actual Silverlight App

I'm developing Silverlight apps for my company's back-end UI and Firefox doe not treat Silverlight apps the way IE8 doe with interaction and focus. In Firefox, I have to click on the object tag once to give the object tag focus and then click again to actually interact with the Silverlight app. This is giving my user the appearance that they clicked on a button and it doesn't work, but in reality their click only gave focus to the object tag. IE8 doe not have this issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page that contains a silverlight app. The app must have the param tag set to windowless
2. Click on the silverlight app. You'll notice that the object tag get a dotted border on it, indicating that focus wa just given to it.
3. Now click on a button or something that allows you to interact with the app.
Actual Results:
Once you click on the object tag, it's given focus.

Expected Results:
I would expect the user to directly interact with the Silverlight app and not need to double-click it.

The Silverlight app should act like a HTML control in that clicking over a button should give the Silverlight app a click event without the need to give the object tag a manual focus first.
