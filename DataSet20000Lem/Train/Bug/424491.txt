This bug concern the Download Helper FF extension that ha been updated for FF3.
After clicking on the flv file I wish to save in the Download Helper menu, a save-as dialog box pops-up. When trying to type the filename I wish to save as, the cursor very frequently freeze or disappears completely, at which point letter typed do not appear. The effect of this is that I have to wait about 1-2 second between typing each letter. This is not a memory/caching problem because the letter never appear after you type them, even after waiting for a really long time. I have emailed Mig at Download Helper about this, and in his reply he said that this sound not to be a problem with DH, but rather with FF3. I have not had this problem with DH on FF2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Youtube.com.
2. Go to watch any video.
3. When the Download Helper icon start to animate, indicating that there is downloadable medium in the page, click on the DH icon and select the flv file to download. At this point, the save-as dialog box will pop up.
4. try typing in to the filename field at regular typing speed.
Actual Results:
you will see that it choke up sometimes and letter stop appearing. you have to type really slowly, like 1 letter every two second to have everything come out right.

Expected Results:
displayed every typed letter, regardless of how fast i'm typing.
