In a window with many other tab open, upon reaching the bottom of a long list of item in Google's RSS reader, the page becomes unresponsive; clicking on link won't work, clicking on other tab change the page title, but the tabbed page won't come forward. Instead, the page remains stuck on Google Reader.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up google reader page (presumably, you've subscribed to many RSS feeds)
2. Click on "All Items"
3. scroll through until you reach the end of the item
4. Sidebar indicates that there are still some item unread, though you've reached the bottom of the list; attempt to click on one of the listing in the sidebar to see unread items.
Actual Results:
The window appears to be unresponsive, except that clicking on other tab change the title bar; the tabbed page don't show up themselves.

Expected Results:
The page, and all tabs, should continue to behave a they normally do, and respond to clicks.

Having tried to reproduce the problem, and finding that it didn't happen just now, I suspect that this problem only happens when Google Reader update one of the RSS feed while I'm reading the listings. This never happened when I read the listing one feed at a time--only when I read them in the "List All" format.
