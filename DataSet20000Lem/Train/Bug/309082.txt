Tried to book a room at
http://www.choicehotels.com/ires/en-US/html/HotelInfoServices?hotel=KY083&sid=BEA5.aUXVggpQ1g.6
Received available room at price in the 80's but when I attempted to book, I
ended up with none available. Ran the same data through MSIE, got higher rate
and booked. Can provide screen snapshots. Data - Oct 14 & 15, King bed,
Smoking, 50+ Mature Traveler. I've duplicated the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.URL
http://www.choicehotels.com/ires/en-US/html/HotelInfoServices?hotel=KY083&sid=BEA5.aUXVggpQ1g.6
and use Oct 14 & 15, King bed, Smoking, 50+ Mature Traveler.
2.http://www.choicehotels.com/ires/en-US/html/Availability?sid=fjGp.IxPVggZJ7g.5
and you get low rate room available. Click one of those and you'll go to
3.http://www.choicehotels.com/ires/en-US/html/Availability?sid=fjGp.IxPVggZJ7g.5
and sometimes it will ask you to fill out the form w/name & Card info, while
other time it will tell you none-avail

Actual Results:
The result varied according to wheather I repeated the process without closing
FireFox, or closed firefox and then retried. No matter, I could never book at
the quoted price. I blew off once, and got a non available for the 50+ rate.

Expected Results:
Same request (yes, I double checked) with MSIE gave me initial higher rate but
wa not only available but allowed me to book and gave me a confirmation number.
I love FireFox but this one is a bit of a puzzle.

Web Site result problem....
