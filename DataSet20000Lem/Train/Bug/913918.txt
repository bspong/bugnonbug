we may need to hotfix app.update.certs.3.* for digicert
See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912675#c7

We would likely want this hotfix for all Firefox version back to 10, on all platforms.

+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #912675 +++

Greetings,

The current Firefox is pinned to accept only either Equifax or Thawte for SSL certificate on aus3.mozilla.org (for updating). Equifax is in use right now, and Thawte is a backup.

This cert is about to expire and we'll have to renew, but we don't yet know which of those 2 vendor we can renew with. So, we don't want to change either of them at this point.

We do, however, want to add Digicert a an allowed vendor. They are our new/current SSL certificate vendor.

The new entry would be:

app.update.certs.3.commonName
aus3.mozilla.org

app.update.certs.3.issuerName
C=US; O=DigiCert Inc; CN=DigiCert Secure Server CA

We'd like to do this a soon a possible (uplift to Aurora/Beta even, so it go out on next release)... the sooner it's available on release, the sooner it becomes realistically feasible to start using Digicert (we have to wait for a significant level of penetration, so we can't go right away... an extra 2-3 version would help).
