"DragAndDropJacking" (?) + javAscript: URL = XSS
Created attachment 576026
A sample HTML page to exploit the vulnerability. It can go to an Iframe.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0
Build ID: 20111104165243

Steps to reproduce:

It is possible to do Cross Domain Self XSS by using the:
1- HTML5 Drag and Drop feature that can lead to bypassing the cross domain policy.
2- Bypassing "javascript:" protocol protection by changing the characters' cases.
i.e. dragging and dropping "javascript:alert(1)" to a new tab doe not work. However, dragging and dropping "jAvAscript:alert(1)" work successfully.

Now, if you can embed your malicious IFrame in another website such a Facebook, you can conduct a Cross Site Scripting against that website.

I have created a test case for you that the victim "soroush.secproject.com" can be exploited by "www.0me.me":
http://soroush.secproject.com/downloadable/demo/FF8.0.SelfXSSHost.html

I will attach both of "FF8.0.SelfXSSHost.html" and "FF8.0.SelfXSSTarget.html" to this issue a well.

I tried to create a real example to show how dangerous it can be. All the Javascripts are harmless and will only show you document.location+document.cookie.


Actual results:

It is possible to drag and drop a javascript (for example "JaVaScripT:alert(1)") to a HTML page that use HTML5 drag and drop feature to conduct XSS attack.
Now, if you put this HTML5 page in an Iframe, the malicious script can be run on the domain that include the Iframe.


Expected results:

First of all, "javascript:" protocol should be validated properly to not be run by upper-casing the character a an example.

The script that is being dragged and dropped, should be run under the same domain (not any other domain).
