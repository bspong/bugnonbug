The XPI file referenced in the URL field above is a signed plugin installer. On
on NS6, NS7, Moz 1.5, 1.6 or 1.73 it say the signing is valid and installs
properly.

On FF 1.0 it say "signing could not be verified".

If the file is not signed, it doe install.

We want to distribute signed xpi only. Please fix Firefox so that it recognizes
our signature just like Netscape and Mozilla do.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download http://www.swiftview.com/product/sv_710/svinstall_p.xpi to your desktop.
2. Drag and drop the file onto NS6, NS7, Moz 1.5, 1.6 or 1.73 if you're
skeptical about it being a valid, signed, plugin installer.
3. Drag and drop the file onto FF 1.0.

Actual Results:
Step 2 result in installation.
Step 3 result in the message
Firefox could not download the file at
C:\Documents and Settings\steves\Desktop
because: Signing could not be verified."

There is then no option to install it.

Expected Results:
It should have verified the signature just a netscape and mozilla did and
executed the installer.

I chose 'major' a severity because if FF want to gain acceptance in the
business world, full support for plugins is necessary. Part of support is
signing... you can't expect end user to install unsigned plugins on a regular
basis.

Note: if you do succeed in installing the plugin, you will notice that it
doesn't do anything! That's because version 7.1.0 of our product wa made for
Moz and isn't FF aware yet. To manually install, if you want to see it work,
you need to install it on one of the other browser it doe work on (ns 6-7, moz
1.5-1.7) and copy the npsview.dll into the Firefox/plugins folder.

The eng version of SwiftView already ha this fixed. We're committed to
supporting Firefox, hope you guy can return the love!
