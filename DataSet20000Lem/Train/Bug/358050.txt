Firefox crash all window when using synchronized xmlhttprequest

Firefox crash when my script do the following:

Open a popup, then performing a lengthy synchronized xmlhttprequest. Both the popup and the main window stop responding. The synchronized xmlhttprequest will not finish executing unless the popup is closed.

The problem is that XMLHttpRequest seem to halt all other Firefox process (atleast window opened by the window performing the XMLHttpRequest). It work well in Opera and in Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a popup window.
2. Once the popup is opened perform execute an XMLHttpRequest synchronized.
3. When the user click a button in the popup, the xmlhttprequest should complete.
Actual Results:
Firefox halt all window while the XMLHttpRequest is performing.

Expected Results:
I would expect and accept that the main window *script* stop responding, but not the popup and not the button in the browser. I would also expect the stop button to work; so that the xmlhttprequest is cancelled.

Opera performs this script well. It open the popup, the popup works, while when I try to give focus to the main window it is not responding, but browser button do work.
