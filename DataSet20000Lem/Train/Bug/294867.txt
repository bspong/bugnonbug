memory leak flooding mem and causing hang (not responding) since 1.0.4

this happens nearly every time i open site with some more medium (like a gallery
of panorama-images. but i even got it after opening some random page a tab
from a google search.
a plugin automatically restores the tabs, so after restarting firefox i have to
manually stop loading or close them to prevent it from crashing again.
this happened not one time with 1.0.3 for week of extensive usage.

it always start with slowing my whole system. firefox then start to eat up 99%
cpu and memory usage becomes bigger and bigger. now it can't redraw h window
anymore. (normally i kill it before it get an mem overflow error).

additionally i can trigger it by opening Extras->Extensions. (wich never opens.
even if i try it 2 or 3 times)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to a site with many embedded (img/plugins) stuff OR open Extras->Extensions
2. open your task manager and watch mem-/cpu-usage for 30-60 sec
3. try to force window-redrawing of firefox

Actual Results:
Firefox window not responding.
CPU @ 99% for firefox.
MEM @ ~200MB for firefox.

Expected Results:
Load and display the page OR Show extension window

I can't get a list of my plugins, but i think this could possibly matter...
(don't know how to get the list elsewhere.)
