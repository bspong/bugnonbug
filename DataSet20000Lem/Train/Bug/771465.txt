No security warning by clicking forward or backward
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:15.0) Gecko/20120705 Firefox/15.0a2

Steps to reproduce:

Test Case:

1. Open a new tab
2. Navigate to about:config and click I'll be careful, I promise
3. In the filter box type security.warn
4. Double click security.warn_entering_secure and security.warn_leaving_secure if the value are FALSE
5. Open a new tab and navigate to http://www.google.com and click OK/Continue if a warning appears
6. Navigate to https://www.verisign.com and click OK/Continue if a warning appears
7. Click the BACK button and click OK/Continue if a warning appears

Be sure to set security.warn_leaving_secure and security.warn_entering_secure back to false by going back to the about:config tab and double clicking on it.



Actual results:

4 This step is incorrect a the value security.warn_entering_secure and security.warn_leaving_secure are already set true
5. After step 5 no security warning
6. After step 6 no security warning when you click back
7. After step 7 no security warning should appear when you click FORWARD

I have one more query to the developer who look into this issue : irrespective of we make the status of the value "security.warn_entering_secure "and "security.warn_leaving_secure" either "TRUE" or "FALSE" . It show the same behavior.

so can you please double check such test case and make sure that they are correct test case and give clear understanding ?


Expected results:


1. At step 5 , A security warning should appear when you access a secure site
2. After step 6 A security warning should appear when you click BACK
3. After step 7 A security warning should appear when you click FORWARD
