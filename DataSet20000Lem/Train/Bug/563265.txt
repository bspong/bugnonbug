On logging on to pcu at cpfcu.com from main site, I can walk through the log into the online banking, but cannot complete the process due to incompatibility in browser. Their OLB module report Firefox 3-6-3 on Windows 6.1.
The OS version is incorrect in their window (6.1 wa Vista sp2). Belarc advisor 8.1 report OS a 12.0 - and Windows should report the version a 7.0 or 7.1 for version 7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into cpfcu.com
2.Walk thru an online banking log on
3.Supply secret answer and password - should return improper credential
4.Click on supported browser
Actual Results:
Browsersupport page will open when clicked on from last window an report incompatible browser and/or OS.

Expected Results:
Improper logon credential note came up on page.

I should have received a banking summary for each account I own, both saving and checking.

No special theme were installed but I do have the "Add bookmark here", "forecastbar", "Roboform pro", "download sort", "download helper" and "Tab Mix Plus" installed. Winamp with application detector is also installed. Was able to log on previously when only one medium player wa installed, VideoLAN.
Will test again without the winamp player installed. This will be done after the credit union unlocks my OLB account.
