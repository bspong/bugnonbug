Back up option (settings, bookmarks, extentions, etc)

As people install more and more extensions, the setting become more
complicated, and harder to reproduce again on another computer, e.g. being one
notebook or a friends/new user computer.

So I would like to suggest a entry in preference called Back up. When pressed
the user should see something like this:

-----------------------------------------------

Select the item to back up

* Bookmarks
* Extensions
* Extension setting
* FireFox setting
* Themes
____________________________
Back up file: |____________________________|

-----------------------------------------------

The idea should be, that it should output a tar.gz file containing everything
that the user selected.

Selecting "extensions", "themes" should include the extension and themes.

If the extension can't be copied from the current computer, it should download
the xpi file, and include that in the final tar.gz file.

Losing the Adblock blacklist or Cookie white list, would not be fun at all, so I
see great need for such a feature.
