Installer mess up ASPI and DirectX

Whenever I install Firefox, it mess up my APSI and DirectX settings. After this, any program that use ASPI to burn CDs or need DirectX 8 or above no longer function. I haven't been able to fix the ASPI problem at all, so all my CD burner are useless. As for DirectX, I have to completely delete directx using dxerad and reinstall. I've had to do this twice so far, once when I reinstalled 98se and had to reinstall Firefox, and later when the Firefox binary became corrupted and I had to reinstall. Both times, the installer messed up DirectX and ASPI.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Win98SE
2.Install some CD burning software (e.g. Nero)
3.Install some game that need DirectX 8 (e.g. GuildWars)
4.Install DirectX (8 or 9)
5.Test to make those software work
6.Install Mozilla

Actual Results:
Try the software again. Nero hang waiting for the drive to be "ready." GuildWars report it cannot initialize 3D. Run dxdiag and run the 3d test. DirectX 7 test will pass, DirectX 8 test fails.

Expected Results:
Firefox Install shouldn't affect ASPI or DirectX Settings or file (I mean why WOULD it?)

To fix the DirectX problem, use dxerad (old version that work with '98 like 109B), then reinstall DirectX (8 or 9). This can be ugly because some program that load on startup often lockup the machine if there's no DirectX. I hope I never have to do it again.

I STILL haven't fixed the ASPI problem, so until I reinstall '98 again, I can't use my CD burners, and even then not after I install Firefox.
