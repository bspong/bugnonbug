Initial opening of Mozilla Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I an running this version of Firefox: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I am repeatedly experiencing the same following situation.
When I open firefox initially after starting my laptop or after being offline for ten or more minutes, I get a Google search results, not my designated HOME page, which happens to be AT&T.
This started after I downloaded the above-stated version of Firefox several day ago.
I DO NOT want this, a I have to shut down & restart the browser every time.
DAMNED aggravating.
I have been unable to locate any setting to correct this problem.
WHAT IS GOING ON??????????????????????
I need to correct this NOW.
THanks,

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Google Search result (EVERY TIME)

Expected Results:
AT&T Home page, with my preferences, a I USED TO be able to go to every time I started Firefox.
