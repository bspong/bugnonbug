It's pretty cool , the MineField is the fastest browser ever started on my P3-650 , it's beautifully rendering the alpha animated pngs but it's an other interesting thing: still not the CSS targeted custom cursor (are still first frame only pngs) [ http://myspace.com/tyotyo ]

The bug : so the plugins , such a i mean : Flashes on my page is so fast a i've never seen before , but poor MAIN MENU of the MineField ha not enough task time or priority to drop down, when i'm looking those my page i've written above. So just stay pushed over but does'nt drop down the any menu while the main window display so fast the Flashes. On a simple page, like google.com without plugin all Menu come down easily.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start MineField on a tweaked :) Windows 2k [to make my p3 like a p4 ;-] on a Machine approximately slower than 1 GHz
2. go to a page ha more than one processor eating plugin, and/or ha complicated CSS and Javasript, DHTML and so much mixed (together) content, like an avarage myspace lamer's page... (mostly with Adobe Flash > 8.0)
3. try to open any menu like Bookmarks



Maybe this is by my overtweaked win2k so i'm going to try on my winXP too.
