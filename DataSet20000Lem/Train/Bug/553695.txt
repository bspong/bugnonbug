Focus issue with shaped window (created from a java applet) on MAC and since the 3.6 update.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.307.11 Safari/532.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; fr; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

Our java applet creates a "zone selector" which allows you to select a part of your screen to record it afterwards.

Since the 3.6 update it doesn't work anymore because of a focus issue. Firefox loses the focus (it becomes gray), and wherever you click, it's like if you were clicking on the visible part of the selection shaped window (the dashed black/white rectangle).

Another issue:
After recording, the fields/buttons in the java applet are working fine but if you scroll in the page then you cannot click on the right side of the fields/buttons anymore.
It seems that there is a cursor position received by the applet is wrong. It's 200px on the left of it real position. You can see that by moving the mouse over the button or clicking on the left side of the fields.

Thanks,
Ludovic.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.screentoaster.com/record2
2. Accept certificate
3. Click in the browser (on the logo or any html parts, not on the applet) without releasing the click and move the mouse.
Actual Results:
You can drag/move the selector by clicking on an invisible part and you cannot use the browser which doesn't have the focus anymore.

Expected Results:
On previous version of firefox (before 3.6) it would just give the focus back to firefox and you would still be able to navigate the website.
