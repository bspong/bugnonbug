Global .close-icon class to get the appropriate close icon for the OS
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.0; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox currently contains the following close button (with more to come in the restyle of the Awesomebar):

TABS:
.tab-close-button
.tabs-closebutton

SIDEBARS/TOOLBARS:
#sidebar-box .tabs-closebutton
.findbar-closebutton
#addonbar-closebutton
.webconsole-close-button
#highlighter-closebutton

PANELS/TAB-PANELS/POPUPS:
.messageCloseButton
#allTabs-tab-close-button.tabs-closebutton
#tab-view .groupItem .close
#tab-view .tab .close
.messageCloseButton.popup-notification-closebutton
.panel-promo-closebutton

I've left out the "search-close" button because this is technically a functionally different button, but all of the one listed above are functionally identical. Half of these are brand new to Firefox 4.0 and up. Each and every one of these requires theme support in the default theme a well a every 3rd party theme. This can cause problem if a theme author miss a new feature then the new close button will not appear (documentation on theme-impacting change is currently provided almost exclusively by akayser in a MozillaZine forum thread).



Expected results:

I'm requesting a global .closebutton class defined in global.css for each and every one of these elements, a well a any new close button created in new features. Alternatively it may be even more functional to have three new class so that each kind of close button can easily have a distinct visual style per usage:

.tabs-closebutton (already defined)
.toolbar-closebutton
.panel-closebutton
