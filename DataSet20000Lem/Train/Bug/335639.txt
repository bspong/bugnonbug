Graphics & animation don't load on some web page in Firefox

There are a number of web page that just won't load graphic and animation in Firefox. The icon for QuickTime show up, looking grayed-out, or just placemarkers appear. When the same page is loaded in Internet Explorer, it usually ha no problems, but some of the same behavior can show up there, too, on very rare occasions. The graphic could contain link that may be important to the user or contain information pertinent to a search or similar things.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a website either from Thunderbird, via e-mail message, or from Firefox
2. Upon noticing grayed-out graphic and/or animations, perform a reload function
3. Notice that this will not change anything

Actual Results:
The web page or site didn't change.

Expected Results:
It should have loaded all graphic and animation flawlessly.

I'd like to be able to use Firefox more of the time, or exclusively even, but thing such a trying to login to a site or find a pertinent link are sometimes impossible in Firefox because they aren't recognized or some such thing. I appreciate any help, of course. Thank you.
