Sometimes, Firefox get hung up and I need to forced quit it. On relaunching, Firefox present a restore session dialog. The dialog's button are usually unresponsive and after a short time, the Force Quit Applications dialog in OS X indicates that Firefox is "not responding". At this point, I force quit Firefox and relaunch it. This behavior often repeat numerous time before eventually Firefox "gives up" hanging and then present the restore session dialog with responsive buttons.

I am unable to reproduce this by merely force quitting Firefox and relaunching it. It may occur only when Firefox had originally been busy with a lot of window on the screen in the previously running session that I force quit. Or it just may be random.

I sometimes see journal file to the mysql database file but not always, so the cause doe not appear related to their being present.

The question is what code could possibly be running when Firefox is displaying the restore session dialog. I don't see that it should be do much of anything but waiting for the user to click a button.

Reproducible: Sometimes
