firefox.exe executable grows to an unsual size over the day's use, reducing performance of the system.

I have noted that toward the end of each day's use, my system performance begin to degrade, to the point that it becomes unbearable. In opening the Windows Task Manager, I find that Firefox.exe ha grown to 600 or 700 MB in size, and that a file (I believe from the CA Security Suite) known a "mdmcls32.exe" ha likewise grown to 600 or 700 MB. This condition did not exist when I wa using the various version of Firefox 2 in the same environment (including the CA Security Suite), and so I am reporting this bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Turn on computer and begin using it each day.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
The same result occur, each and every day. Just turn on the system, open Firefox, use it and leave it running throughout the day, and the condition occurs.

Expected Results:
The same result occurs.

Firefox.exe and mdmcls32.exe should remain more stable in size, and not drag down the performance of the computer.
