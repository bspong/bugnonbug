Issue when rapidly pasting into form field

I have seen this happen 4-6 time now since upgrading to 3.0rc2 and then wa able to replicate (nearly 100%) after upgrading to 3.0 (including safe mode).

For work, I often have to paste a lot of information into form field and have gotten quick about copying, clicking on the field, and then pasting.

The issue seems to occur when I paste just before releasing the left mouse button (and possibly involves a short right-ward movement of the mouse). The form field I am pasting into move to the right, and the text I wa pasting in replaces it original position a actual text on the page.

You can see three screenshots of this that I took when replicating on http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-register.php

You can see the progession of the password bullet appearing a text, then the word "funkiness", and then the username field disappearing altogether:

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
My ability to reproduce is still hit or miss, sometimes I cannot get it to occur at all, sometimes 1 out of 7 tries, and other time close to 50%:
1.click in a form field
2.paste in text
3.repeat until you see this occur.
Actual Results:
The pasted text displayed a text on the page, with the field shifted to the right

Expected Results:
The text should appear in the form field which should stay where it was.

I think this may occur if you depress the left mouse button in the field, press ctrl-v, then release mouse button (possibly involving some mouse movement).
