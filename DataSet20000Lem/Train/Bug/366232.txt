In form using input field with type="text" or textarea multiline inputs, I'm unable to use the keyboard to navigate in the box (except for the arrow keys).

I would appreciate if I could use CTRL (or COMMAND, don't care) LEFT / RIGHT to jump word wise, HOME and END to jump to the first or last character of the line and PgDn / PgUp to scroll pagewise within an input field. Those feature work in Windows and Linux without troubles, but not with my Mac.

I'd love to use them :)

I found this problem to exist with Firefox 1.x, Mozilla 1.x and SeaMonkey on a PowerPC Mac and with Firefox 2.0.0.1 (German) on an Intel Mac, both running Mac OS X 10.4.

The same problem exists when editing Mails in Thunderbird (I'll add a bug there and reference it over here, they might be related).

And no - it's not a Mac-keyboard-problem: Those function are available with all other Mac programme I use.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit some text.



No special themes, out of the Box install of a .dmg
