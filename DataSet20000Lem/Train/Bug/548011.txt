I have about 2 page of bookmark in the bookmark menue. When I use the mouse and point on the Down Arrow key it scroll my bookmark up like there supposed to but when I point at the bookmark and then use the down arrow key on the keyboard it will only scroll the first page but will not scroll the bookmark up so I can see the rest of my bookmarks. When I press the up arrow key it won't scroll to the bottom of the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click Bookmarks and move the pointer to point at one of your Bookmarks.
2.Then hold the Down Arrow key and it will not scroll through any page of Bookmarks after the first page like it supposed to do.
3.Hold the Up Arrow key and it will not scroll to the bottom of the last page of Bookmarks like it supposed to do.
Actual Results:
wa only able to see only the first page of bookmark

Expected Results:
When pressing the down arrow key it wa supposed to scroll the Bookmarks up. When pressing the Up Arrow key it wa supposed to automatically jump to the last Bookmark on the last page of bookmark and scroll the Bookmarks down. And the latest Mozilla Minefield 3.7a2pre doe not do this.

I am using the Summer Clouds theme.
