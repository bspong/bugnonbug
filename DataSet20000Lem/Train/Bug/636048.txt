Firefox 4 nightly build frequently terminates abnormally
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0b12pre) Gecko/20110221 Firefox/4.0b12pre

I recently set Firefox to restore previous session by default, and it regularly can't restore the previous session of "about:blank". I thought this wa a bug in session restore and reported bug 631882. The response wa "Firefox is working correctly, probably an abnormal termination". Since then I've been verifying that the firefox-bin process actually go away before I shut down my computer (just in case it wa exiting too slowly and being killed by the shutdown). but I still keep seeing the messages.

Is any information saved about the nature of the abnormal termination that I can recover to assist in figuring out the problem at exit?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set Firefox to restore previous session at startup.
2.Close all tabs.
3.Exit Firefox.
4.Verify the firefox-bin process ha exited.
5.Reboot computer.
6.Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:
Sometimes a session restore error is shown, Firefox is "embarrassed" it can't restore
about:blank.

Expected Results:
about:blank displayed.
