We have a Juniper Networks SA-2000 appliance that we utilize to do webinars with. We uploaded a new cert from Verisign and when user login to conduct a webinar it go to a blank page, which then they have to relog in (and then it let them), and when they go to start a meeting but it won't let them. I checked Firefox 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 (on Windows and Linux) and they don't have that issue, then I checked 3.0.4 and it ha this issue.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to webinar box (which just go to a blank white screen.
2.Relog in again which take u to our meeting (webinar) page.
3.Try to start an instant meeting but it is grayed out.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens. That's the problem. :)

Expected Results:
Allowed u to start an instant meeting like it will in Firefox 3.0.1 and 3.0.2 (what we tested).

I am making the severity Normal, but the issue is widespread throughout our company so user will have to use Internet Explorer until this is addressed.
