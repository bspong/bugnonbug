Want FF to 'remember' where you were when you shut it down AND the o/s

So that when you start your o/s AND first open FF, it give you the option to restore your previous session(s). This is not the same a the third option in preference (restore the session every time you close FF). I can't see the use of this option. Having shut FF down, but not the operating system, why would you want to ALWAYS open the new session at the same place?. However, if you've finished working for the day and close your operating system down a well a FF, it make sense to want to open it when you restart your operating system at the same tab and windows. With FF2, you used to be able to achieve this by not closing down your FF window and tab when you closed your o/s, FF would assume it had crashed and give you the option when you restarted it and the o/s to restore the previous session. This wa a very very useful feature a I often have two or three window open and several tab and it's not one in IE
