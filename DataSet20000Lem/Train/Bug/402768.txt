After crashing, it take too long to restart Firefox (with hundred of tab to restore)

After faulting, even after *three* year of a reported bug, #263160 which is well documented and should have been cleared by now -- Firefox fails to star restore itself in a reasonable fashion. With 41 window & 338 tab it take over 15 minute of CPU time on a Pentium IV to restore itself. I watched the CPU usage during the time frame. The network usage wa busy for a period (perhaps 2/3 of the time), but the CPU usage wa busy for a much longer period.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Crash a Firefox session due to excessive CPU use.
2. Attempt to restore that Firefox session.
Actual Results:
Firefox take excessively long time when reinvoked to return to a functional state if the load prior to it crashing wa "heavy".

Expected Results:
There is no reason why Firefox should not return to a functional state immediately after it re-invocation. All restoration of "previous state" information should be conducted in background mode.

Make a stronger effort to break it and stress test it before releasing it.

I am going to do that in the future and I strongly suspect Firefox will bite it someplace around 80 window or 700+ tab on a Pentium IV. (I.e. between Firefox and X you will eat 100% of the CPU). That should not be the case. On a reasonable system the program in front of my face get 100% of my attention. Everything else get secondary attention. If Firefox is not programmed a such it is not programmed properly.

If the last window, or the active window do not have priority than the design is fundamentally flawed. Even during a 15 minute CPU time suck down during a Firefox restoration the primary active Firefox window should be functional.

And I am talking about Linux here -- I could care le about Windows.
