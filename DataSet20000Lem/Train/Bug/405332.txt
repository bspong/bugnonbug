I have an HP 1320 laser printer a my only printer. When I try to Print Preview __ANY__ page on the internet - try a goole output page, or even www.google.com - page preview show only the header and footer lines, and nothing in between. Of course, if I print these pages, the page print only the header and footers.

In 2.0.0.9, I get an internal error in Firefox - I am submitting an agent-generated report online.

This is a serious problem. This is my only printer, and I can not print.

Same problem with 2.0.0.7. I am working my way backwards through previous versions.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install firefox 2.0.0.7, take all the default
2. load www.google.com
3. Print / Preview
Actual Results:
only the header and the footer appear, nothing else.
Same problem for any text based page, including a google search result page and www.mozilla.org home page


Expected Results:
I only see the header and footer lines.

In 2.0.0.9, I get an internal error in Firefox - I am submitting an agent-generated report online.
