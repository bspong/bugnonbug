Page(s) with nested table initially render incorrectly in Firefox, but OK in Opera 7, Netscape 7.1 and IE6

The URL above is one of many on the site that showed the problem (initially -
see below). It involves nested tables. The inner table (the white part of the
page) is centered and set to 80% of the width of the outer table TD cell, but it
is (was) displaying a 100%.

The code is valid according to W3C and HTML validator a HTML 4.01 transitional.
See http://tinyurl.com/2mwgn I note the character encoding glitch and I'm
getting that fixed (Apache config, I suspect).

Note: I tabbed back to the page after starting this bug submit and the page is
now rendering correctly. It smell like a transient browser bug but I can't
prove it :-)

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open URL http://www.ausaid.gov.au/human/default.cfm
2.View the page
3.
Actual Results:
No white margin around the text - yet a bit later, after tabbing back to it, it
appeared. It seems to have been transient, but it happened on several pages.
Conceivably a server problem, but if you see the same thing, check it in N7 or
Opera7 or (ugh) IE6

Expected Results:
Displayed left and right margin around the text on the white part of the page.
