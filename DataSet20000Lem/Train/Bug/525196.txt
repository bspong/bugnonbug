Hello, I have noticed that, after upgrade to new Firefox version, some setting of the integrated download manager are reset. For instance 'show when starting a new download' behavior change from checked to default (I guess), not checked.
It ha happened at least to 3.52. > 3.5.3 upgrade too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Firefox 3.5.3 installed
2. Change the 'show when starting a new download' behavior to checked
3. Start a download to see the Download manager window opened
4. Check for upgrade
5. Apply the upgrade
6. Verify the 'show when starting a new download' behavior to see if it is unchecked again
7. Optionally start a download to see the Download manager window is not opened
Actual Results:
The setting of the Firefox integrated download manager are reset at Firefox upgrade.

Expected Results:
The setting of the Firefox integrated download manager are kept at Firefox upgrade.
