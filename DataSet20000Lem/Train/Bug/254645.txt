After uninstall and install with le aditional component Firefox can't start.
Problem is in file "C:\Program Files\Mozilla
Firefox\chrome\overlayinfo\browser\content\overlays.rdf", that contains invalid
information.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install with some (developer, quality) aditional component
2. Run&Exit (?)
3. Uninstall (keep directory!)
4. Install with NO aditional component to even directory (as wa installed previous)
5. Run - Firefox not show main window - freeze - I must kill him


Actual Results:
In overlays.rdf is (for example) additional line
"RDF:li>chrome://inspector/content/tasksOverlay.xul</RDF:li>", and this line is
out-of-date. This component is now not installed.


Expected Results:
Solve freeze on start with broken (out-of-date) overlays.rdf file.
Or in installer can be check, if in file overlays.rdf is other component, that
will actually install and update the file.
