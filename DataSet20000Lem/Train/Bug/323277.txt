I experienced a strange bug when I updated FF 1.0.6 to 1.5 : On my blog and some other page that have link that open pop-up windows, the opened window is systematically reduced to the third or the fourth of it specified dimension.
The most annoying part of that bug is that some of these pop-up window are not resizable.
I could not determine what wa the cause of the problem, so I created a new Firefox profile. The new profile had no problem.

But today morning, I experienced the very same problem. I am certain that the problem did not appear yesterday late afternoon. The only unusual thing I did between these two time wa to install the GreaseMonkey Extension. Uninstalling GreaseMonkey then closing all Firefox window did not resolve the problem. The other (default) profile hadn't GreaseMonkey installed, and I uninstalled each extension step-by-step for no result.

For the moment, I will create a third profile, but this bug is extremely annoying, a there is no apparent reason for such behaviour.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. er... trie to install GreaseMonkey, for example ? (the only unusual thing I did between the sane situation and the corrupted situation)
2. go to some weblog (go to the specified URL to see mine, which is a good example) that ha link that open pop-up window for comment
3. click on such link

Actual Results:
see the magnificent 50px-width and not-resizable pop-up window to put your comment on the weblog

Expected Results:
see a 200px-width pop-up window...

the theme is not in cause, a it is installed since weeks.
