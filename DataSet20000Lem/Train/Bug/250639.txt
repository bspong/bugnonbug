User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

1) close google/searchengine bar if not already closed.
2) restart firefox
3) firefox should now be started without any searchengine bar
4) type some text into the url/location bar
5) go to some webpage and select some text and drag and drop it into the
url/location bar. The text you originally had in the url/location bar will be
overwritten and google's i'm feeling lucky will take you to the i'm feeling
lucky webpage for the text that wa drag dropped into the url/location bar. It
should have appended the drag dropped text and done nothing more.

Dumb fix:
1) Now place the search bar back into the toolbar area. Right click on the
toolbar->Customize->drag and drop the search bar into the toolbar area.
2) Repeat from step (4) above and you will see that it appends the text and doe
nothing more a it should.

The text should be appended irregardless of whether the search bar is visible in
the toolbar.

But some people want stuff overwritten all the time. Then maybe one
implementation approach might be that dragging selected with left mouse button
overwrites url/location/search bar and dragging with right mouse button appends.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1) close google/searchengine bar if not already closed.
2) restart firefox
3) firefox should now be started without any searchengine bar
4) type some text into the url/location bar
5) go to some webpage and select some text and drag and drop it into the
url/location bar. The text you originally had in the url/location bar will be
overwritten.

Actual Results:
Google's i'm feeling lucky will take you to the i'm feeling lucky webpage for
the text that wa drag dropped into the url/location bar.

Expected Results:
Append the text you drag/dropped into the url/location bar and wait for <cr>.
