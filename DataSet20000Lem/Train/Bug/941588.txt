No error returned on XHR call to unauthorized domain from non-origin sources.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create an HTML page with performs an AJAX request on any URL which doe not return a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header, such a http://dotancohen.com
2. Save this page to disk and load it with the file:// protocol, a opposed to using the http:// protocol (i.e. don't use Apache to serve the page, but load it in Firefox directly from the file system)
3. With Inspect Element open, notice that the AJAX request show a having succeeded (HTTP/1.1 200 OK 323ms) however the resource is no available (i.e. call to JQuery's Ajax success function do not run)

It seems that the issue is that the origin is not set (i.e. NULL) and therefore "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" cannot be verified. However there is no indication of such and the developer is left wondering why nothing works.


Actual results:

Absolutely nothing!


Expected results:

Firefox should have thrown an error in the JS console along the line of "Access-Control-Allow-Origin cannot be matched due to your origin being NULL".
