I wa offline and using the "acehtml" program to work on my webpage - acehtml
allows you to use your browser window to view your work - if I'm viewing my
webpage in a firefox window and I click my quick launch firefox button to open
another firefox window to connect to the internet to look for something - the
new window cannot go online - it search for the startup page on the internet
and then time out - it will not connect - I have to close all other firefox
browser window that I wa using and had open prior to going online - then
reclick the quick launch firefox button to open another browser window again and
then firefox connects to the internet no problem - when I wa using internet
explorer prior to moving to firefox, I could use an IE window to view my file
while using acehtml and then go online without having to closer other instance
of IE - the going online issue also arises if another application us a
firefox window to display it help file in and then you decide to go online -
you need to close the help window in order for you new window to connect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open acehtml - open saved html file - click icon "start external browser" -
html file is viewed in firefox browser window that open (I usually have 3 or 4
window open at the same time in order to view 3 or 4 different html file to
compare how code change look in one version versus other html files)
2.while doing this I find I need to do some research say concerning a way to do
something in CSS - I click on the quick launch firefox icon to open up another
firefox window
3.firefox open a browser window but it cannot connect to the internet - it
search for the startup homepage but cannot find it - the browser window time out.
4. I need to save all my work in acehtml - close all firefox window that I had
opened, the restart firefox and it connects to the internet with no problem

Actual Results:
firefox did not connect if other firefox window were open prior to going online

Expected Results:
new firefox window appear to be dependent on other firefox window that are
open - but you should be able to open window independent of each other - a in
Internet Explorer
