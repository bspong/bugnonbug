Firefox will not open if I open any program other than Firefox after booting my computer. For example, if I open Microsoft Word after my computer boot and then click on Firefox, Firefox doe not open. When I open the task manager, Firefox is not listed a a running application; however, it is listed a a process. I am then unable to open Internet Explorer unless I end the Firefox process. I've had this problem for a few week now.

If Firefox is the first program I open after my computer boots, everything is fine. I am able to open and close the Firefox whenever I like, and all of the program work, too. Thunderbird work no matter what program I open first.
