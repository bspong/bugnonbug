Changing the text size doe not work in the same manner a IE
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 2.0.0.8

I would expect that changing the text would change only the newsletter portion of the web page a it doe on IE instead of changing everything on the web page a it doe with Firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select VIEW
2. Select TEXT SIZE
3. Select INCREASE
4. Repeat step 1 to 3 four time for Firefox.

Follow step 5 to 10 for IE
5. Select VIEW
6. Select TEXT SIZE
7. Select LARGEST
8. Select VIEW
9. SELECT TEXT SIZE
10. Select SMALLEST

Actual Results:
All the text is information on the web page is changed by Firefox. However, only the text portion of the newsletter is changed by IE.

Expected Results:
The expected result are that only the text portion of the newsletter are changed.

This is considered a serious bug since the visitor to the web page can not easily read the information in the newsletter if using Firefox.

In contrast, the visitor using IE can easily read the entire content of web page regardless of the TEXT SIZE.
