The scrollbar is one pixel indented to the left, leaving a one pixel that will display whatever is currently in memory at that location when a div is position absolutely inside of another div that ha overflow set to auto.

This is most noticable when using tabs, you can see the content of the previous tab when swapping back and forth.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a div with a static width/height and set overflow to auto
2. Create a div inside of previous div with a height to produce a scrollbar
3. Create another div still inside with position: absolute
Actual Results:
The scrollbar is indented to the left one pixel, leaving one pixel directly to the right of it that will display whatever happens to be in memory for that location (from another tab etc.)

Expected Results:
The scrollbar to not be indented to the left one pixel.

This problem occurs under mac o x for x86 and ppc.
This problem doe not occur using windows.
