With the cursor on a jpg and you right click the option "save image as" the file size that is saved is 1k. It save a placeholder jpg icon but the not the image. If you save from the thumbnail it save correctly and includes the full size of the file. This sometimes happens on imbedded jpgs on web page a well.
Everything look normal a it give you the option to "save image as" but when you go back and check it ha saved a place holder "jpg" icon but the file size is only 1k.

1.click on thumbnail and load image
2.right click image and save a
3.image saved

actual size of the image that is saved is only 1k. look like it save til you try to open image. save an icon that look like a jpg but doe not open.

Expected Results:
should saved the image regardless of being a thumbnail or actual image if it give you the option to save a a jpg.

i have had this happen both on single image that i have clicked on from thumbnail and actual imbedded image in web pages. These are not protected image because it give me the option to save them. It look a though it did save a the image ha a jpg icon but the file size is incorrect. should be 316k and it only 1k. 1k= no image saved. default theme used.
