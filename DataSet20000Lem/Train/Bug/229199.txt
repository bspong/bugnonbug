When the Navigation toolbar is hidden and you press Ctrl+L, the old style
location window pop up(the one that look like Ctrl+Shit+L in Mozilla). typing
an address and hitting <enter> open a new window (in modal mode, so you cant go
back to the prev window without closing this one) but doe not load the page.
The previous window still ha the "open location" dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hide Navigation toolbar(right click, uncheck nav toolbar)
2. Press Ctrl+L to bring up "open location" dialog box.
3. Enter a url and press <enter>

Actual Results:
FB open a new window in Modal mode. It doe not load the requested URl. The
original window is still there in the background with the open location dialog
still open.

This happens weather you chose to open in a new window/this window or new tab
from the drop down in the open location dialog box.

Expected Results:
opened the new url in the appropriate window/tab and hidden the open location
dialog.

This problem doe not exist in mozilla 1.5
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007.

I have not checked newer Mozilla builds.
