Non-functional "new pages" open occasionally

Occasionally I will be browsing any website and I will open a new page using the "CTRL-N" command. For some reason, I am unable to type within the address bar, or any other field on that page. My home page is google, and I cannot even type in the search bar. I do make sure that the correct browser window is selected and that the cursor is blinking in the correct field.

If I open another new window, that one usually seems to work fine. The last still doesn't and I simply have to close it. I am also not able to paste anything into any of the fields, and though I can highlight, it doe not let me copy either.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Well I have updated my version of Firefox on 3 Windows XP system and 1 Windows Vista Ultimate system. One of the XP system wa just newly installed, and the problem still occurs. It is a problem that ha only surfaced for me with the newest version of Firefox. It only occurs when opening new windows, and randomly at that.
Actual Results:
The problem continues to occur on all 4 systems, and it happens on the computer in my school lab that have Firefox installed. They all have the most up-to-date version a well. It only occurs when a new window is opened, or so I've noticed.

Expected Results:
Well....when you open a browser window, you should be able to type in it. Not just stare at a blinking cursor.

It doesn't seem to be affected by the plugins installed since all the system have had different plugins in general. I've noticed that the newest version of Firefox seems to be fairly le stable than the last. I also have trouble with copy and paste command because the keyboard command don't work, and the "right-click" command or the "Edit" command sometimes work. Very frustrating.
