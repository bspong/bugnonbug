Since latest Firefox update cannot access email page in Charter.net
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

It seems since the latest Firefox update - I can access Charter.net and my home page but when I click on "check email" I get returned to the same home page of Charter.net. I am able to access my email using Microsoft Explorer. I did not have this problem prior to the last Firefox update.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access Charter.net - no problem - then
2.Log-in and get to my Charter.net home page - but
3.when I click on "check email" I get processed back to my Charter.net home page
Actual Results:
when I click on "check email" I get processed back to my Charter.net home page

Expected Results:
Get me to my Charter.net email page where my email are listed. I can access them if I use Microsoft Explorer. I consulted with Charter but they do not know what the problem is and they do not support Mozilla.

Since I did not have this problem prior to the last Foxfire update I suspect the problem lie with Firefox. I do not seem to have a problem accessing other web sites.
