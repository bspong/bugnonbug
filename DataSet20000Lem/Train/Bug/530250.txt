Actual Results:
Dangling vertical line extend below table cell borders.

Expected Results:
No dangling vertical lines, I expect the table to look like it doe in IE8 where the same bug is absent.

Also, try scrolling up and down to hide the dangling line and then reshow them. They will change length and maybe even become little stubs.
