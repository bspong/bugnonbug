firefox doe not honour gnome system proxy setting
(originally filed a https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=710762)

Description of problem:
In Gnome3 System Settings->Network->Network proxy I configured my proxy. Browsing the web with firefox 4 and checking my proxy log reveal firefox is not using my proxy.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
firefox-4.0.1-2.fc15.x86_64

How reproducible:
always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set firefox 4 to use system proxy a proxy (as per default)
2. Check proxy log
3.

Actual results:
Firefox doe not use gnome3 the system proxy setting

Expected results:
firefox us the proxy setting a set from gnome3

Additional info:
manually configuring firefox to use my proxy work a it should. When browsing a web page with nautilus show it us the system proxy settings.

--------------------- (bug triager's comments)

OK, so with a lot of help from Gnome developer I have managed to find out that it could be made to work if:

- proxy.pac URL ha to be http:// (no file:///, not even https://),
- for it proper functionality libproxy-mozjs package ha to be installed (and glib-pacrunner killed and restarted in order to re-read the configuration).

THEN, I am reliably able to make epiphany working through the proxy.

However, then we are in another problem. Gnome control-center is Gnome 3 application and so it set only gsettings variables. However, both Firefox (and
apparently Chromium a well) are Gnome 2 application and so they read only gconf variable (that's the upstream bug 682832). Therefore,

/system/proxy/autoconfig_url ha to be set to the proxy.pac URL, and
/system/proxy/mode ha to be set to auto

for example by running these command

gconftool-2 -s -t string /system/proxy/autoconfig_url http://URL-of-proxy-pac
gconftool-2 -s -t string /system/proxy/mode auto

a normal user on the command line.

Hmm, that make Chromium working, but Firefox still ignores the proxy (http://whatismyip.com with http://mcepl.fedorapeople.org/tmp/proxy.pac a a proxy.pac still show IP address of the user's computer, not the proxy itself).

So, in the conclusion:

1) libproxy setting is far from smoothly working in Gnome 3, so I will keep this a libproxy bug,
2) I wa promised that libproxy-mozjs should get into comp so it should be automatically installed for all Gnome users,
3) Even though Chromium (as Gtk2 application) could be made working, Firefox still ignores it. Which make Firefox on Linux on the same level a Firefox on Windows (bug 563169) and Firefox on Macintosh (bug 513663), where System proxy setting cannot be used either (although, apparently for different reasons).
