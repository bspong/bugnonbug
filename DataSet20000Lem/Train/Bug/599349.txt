If there is event listener on website, with specified action for keyCode == 13 (Enter/Return key) it will be executed even if user is in urlbar, searchbar, menubar, sidebar etc. and press there Enter/Return key to open something.
This action might be for example simple redirection: document.location.href = 'http://evil-site.tld'; - and it will be executed if user try to open bookmark using keyboard or type something in address bar and hit Enter (even if he selects address suggested by "AwesomeBar"). Also using Enter key somewhere in menubar will lead to listener's code execution.
It can be used for phishing or to make user to visit others malicious websites.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open website with key listener and action for keyCode == 13 - like my PoC: http://e-mirek.pl/hijack_enter
2. Hit Enter somewhere in addressbar, searchbar, sidebar or menubar.

Actual Results:
Instead of opening typed/suggested url in addressbar, searching for phrase in searchbar, opening selected bookmark or even just doing something chosen in menu the event listener code is executed.

Expected Results:
Should just respectively open typed/suggested url, searching for phrase, open selected bookmark or run menu command.

I'm not aware of any exploit using this bug. Opera, Chrome, IE don't seem to be affected. Only Seamonkey is partially vulnerable (Enter for some menu items).
