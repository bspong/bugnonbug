Testing environnemnts:
-DSL connexion 11Mbits/s (home) + LAN connexion 100 Mbits/s (office, government network),
-websites hosted on different level 1 domain name and different country to eliminate national/regional/local ISP access problem.

Accessing several web site (each one in a separate tab) trigger the page loading process (wheel animation on tabs). The loading process seems running forever like if there wa traffic jam (like a DNS/routing problem).
Multiple repeated (on a really short period of time) aggressive access request click sometime make the targeted page display instantly.

There is a significant "burst like effect":
traffic is blocked, loading process seems loop, and suddenly the jam disappears.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a bookmark folder containing several bookmark pointing on different website (hosted in several country and level 1 domain name to eliminate country/regional/local ISPnetwork problems)

Actual Results:
Wait up to almost 1 minute before the "traffic jam looking like" symptom disappears and the page ALL load in a "burst effect".


Expected Results:
The web site complete page loading in a short delay thanks to DSL/LAN speed.

The page start loading and the loading process run forever, looping.
