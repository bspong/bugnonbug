Using firefox 3b2
going to https://mondossier.rrn.fgov.be/ you get an error page: sec_error_unknown_issuer. It state that certificate authority is not recognized. This certificate authority is "Government CA" (CA: URI: http://certs.pki.belgium.be/belgiumrs.crt)

However, website https://ccff02.minfin.fgov.be/CCFF_Authentication/choseLoginMethod.do work properly. It's certificate authority is "Government CA" (CA: URI: http://certs.pki.belgium.be/belgiumrs.crt).

Question is, since Governement CA certificate autority is signed by Belgium ROOT CA (unlimited intermediate certificate authorities) itself Signed by GlobalSign Root CA (unlimited intermediate certificate authorities), why isn't it recognized?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://mondossier.rrn.fgov.be/
2. Enjoy an error message
Actual Results:
Error message related to unknown issuer

Expected Results:
Issuer recognized, a it provides Trusted chain rooting to GlobalSign ROOT CA

This website is one amongst other website making use of belgian eid. Those all use ssl certificate to protect user and require user to have a belgian eID card + pin for authentification. Because firefox now stop access to those website, it can become difficult for belgian people to use some e-governement website using firefox 3. Another such example of unrecognized certificate authority can be found here, also related to eID applications: https://readers.eid.belgium.be/index.cfm?Content_ID=3636344.

While new feature to block instead of just warn when certificate issuer is unknown is much more secure, i think this will lead to trouble for belgian e-governement user if firefox doe not check the certificate authority chain for a trusted root CA.
