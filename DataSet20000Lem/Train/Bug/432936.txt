Went to site a usual, the list window (java) took 4 refreshes to load content. I played at a few tables, had cause to hide the java window in the dock, when it wa restored from the dock nothing worked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use a Mac and have a pokerroom account
2. log in to instant play (java – play in browser)
3. play some tables, hide table select window in the dock, do something else (I went to a Wikipedia page)
4. restore the pokerroom window from the dock - many function do not work
Actual Results:
1. hovered over a 'classify player icon' and the pop-up message would not clear
2. no scroll bar or menu item worked
3. could go to table I could see in the list, but no other click I tried worked

Expected Results:
I should have been able to change table type and/or price range and scroll the list of table I could see - lot to click with no effect - other than being able to click on a table I could see and play at the table. I should have been able to scroll to more table and select different 'table sets'

I love the new look but why are you not doing it all Mac? The pop-up menu now use Mac resource but why don't the button in Yahoo! mail look Mac? Is that a Yahoo! thing?
