This problem occurs on every 1.x and 2.x version of FF I have tried on Linux and Windows; I think it ha been reported on Mac's, too. It doesn't happen on every page every time, and usually go away either when the page is reloaded or you navigate to another page and back. It act like an uninitialized variable; I don't have direct control over the website so I haven't been able to play with the cs to see if I can make it go away. It doe not seem to happen in any version of IE, Opera, or Safari. It appears the same or very similar to bug 362331.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the front page http://www.bnl.gov/rhic/news
2. Navigate into one of the story with the "More..." link to an internal story
3. If you go to enough internal pages, you'll find that one or more of them is cut off at the bottom
Actual Results:
The bottom of one of the internal page is cut off.

Expected Results:
It should have displayed the whole page.

I will attach a screenshot of a typical truncated page.
