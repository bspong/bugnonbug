The Firefox Plugin Finder, being a great tool, doesn't offer it service a often a it should, at least with Flash installation. In most of the page (like YouTube) instead of flash content, when flash player plugin is not installed, you get a website text saying that you need to go to Adobe's webpage to get the Flash player, while actually the Firefox's own Plugin Finder would do that automatically for you; yet it never prompt you to intall missing plugins.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox without the Flash Player.
2. Go to YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miuGBs325v4
3. Notice that you get text and nothing pop up.
4. Go to this internet speed test page: http://www.auditmypc.com/broadband-speed-test.asp
5. Notice that Missing Plugins dialog now appears at the top of the screen.
Actual Results:
Firefox offered to use it Plugin Finder only when going to the latter website (and so work for a minority of webpages).

Expected Results:
Firefox should offer you to get flash player every time you go to a webpage that requires it, even if it ha a link to Adobe.

Although I'm not sure why Firefox behaviour is so inconsistent, but the only difference I saw between those two page is that in the working page, the <embed> tag ha a parameter pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" while YouTube doesn't have it.

I've tested this only with Linux (Xubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope) Firefox 3.0.8, but I believe this happens elsewhere a well.
