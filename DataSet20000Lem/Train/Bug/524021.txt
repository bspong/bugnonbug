After watching the show presented, my twitter account did not display correctly.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en; rv:1.8.1.23) Gecko/20090925 Camino/1.6.10 (like Firefox/2.0.0.23)

Hi, the bug is described a follows:

After browsing to the above url the display resolution wa changed such that the maximum screen resolution wa incorporated. I tried to delete thing like cooky and cache to no avail. Ultimately I deleted all history.

The only way to correct the display of twitter.com is to enter private browsing. Otherwise the display is compromised.

The problem doe not affect Camino so I started using that browser instead. Please tell me what file is being affected so I can fix the problem on my end. I already downloaded a new version of Firefox but still suffer the problem.

The problem also doe not affect browsing of any website other than twitter.

Thanks for looking into this, I look forward to learning what you discover.

Best regards,

Brad
