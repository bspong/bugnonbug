QuestionPoint is a browser based chat service that allows librarian to chat
with their patron via an JavaScript based 'qwidget'. The qwidget is using
textarea to post the message from the user (patron) to the librarian.

We have report of patron having problem typing message while in chat using Firefox and our qwidget


Feel free to contact me via email to arrange a time to test.

1. User visit a page containing the qwidget.
2. User submits a question to a librarian
3. Librarian pick up the session
4. The user attempt to reply when they experience the symptoms.

Actual Results:

- The user is unable to type in the qwidget’s message box even after clicking
the cursor in that box repeatedly.
- The use’s chat message will ‘drop’ character a they type in the Qwidget’s
message box

the patron will be typing but won’t see what they typed until it appears in a
burst.
