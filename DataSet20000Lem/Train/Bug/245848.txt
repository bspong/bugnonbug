Andrew Sullivan us JavaScript to open link to other site in new windows.
When I tried to use the Bookmarks menu in such a new window, the requested site
opened in the original window with www.andrewsullivan.com open, rather than in
the new window.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.andrewsullivan.com/ .
2. Click a link to another site. This cause a new window to open.
3. In the new window, click a site on the Bookmarks menu.

Actual Results:
The site from the Bookmarks menu opened in the original andrewsullivan.com
window. I didn't realize this until I closed the new window and saw the desired
site in the old window that had contained andrewsullivan.com.

Expected Results:
Used the new (current) window to open the desired site.

Linux kernel 2.6 in Slackware 9.1 + -current, Gnome 2.6, Sawfish window manager.

I'm not sure if General is the correct component for this report; my apology
if something else wa more appropriate.
