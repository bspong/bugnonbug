Status bar icon should be inaccessible (collapsed) when hidden

When the status bar icon (for updates, livemarks, popup blocking, security,
[and style switching if it ever come back]) are disabled (thus invisible), they
are still accessible by mouseover and click.

Since **you should not be able to interface with invisible items**, something
need to be changed. [Opinion: The empty placeholder slot look stupid anyway.]

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the strange empty area in the status bar when the popup blocker icon
normally show up.


Actual Results:
The popup blocker menu pop up out of the strange empty space.

Expected Results:
Nothing, I think.

When element that trigger these icon do not exist, one of two thing should occur:

1. These element should take a collaped:true state (like the progress meter
does); or
2. These element should have a greyed-out icon in place (unlocked security
lock, greyed version of everything else).

Note that if #1 (my personal preference) happens, it is almost exactly the
opposite of bug 251588. If we still want user to be able to initiate update
checking and popup setting when there aren't any pop-ups, #2 is the answer.
