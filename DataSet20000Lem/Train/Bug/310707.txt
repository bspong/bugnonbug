Run Mode=Silent config.ini setting not poputaling Start menu icon
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0.6

If I extract the file for the 1.0.6 build and edit the "config.ini" file and
change it to "Run Mode=Silent" thing seem to work with the exception that the
Start menu and icon are not populated (I think this go for the desktop and
QuickLaunch icon a well). The step I used worked just fine for build 1.0.5
and thing worked fine before. The program seems to execute properyl if I use
the .EXE located in the pgram directory, but there's just no Start menu icon.

Also, the "Run Mode=Auto" still doesn't work - but I think that wa noted a a
bug in previous build already.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the setup file.
2. Manually execute the setup file, but do not complete it.
3. Copy the content on the extracted file within the Temp folder to get the
installation file needed.
4. Edit the "Config.ini" file and change the line to "Run Mode=Silent" and
save the file again.
5. Double-click the "setup.exe" file to launch the installation.

Actual Results:
The installation run silentlt, displaying no dialog or progress window a
expected. When it's finished there are no Start menu or desktop icons. I
believe there is a "Mozilla Firefox" folder generated, but it's empty.

Expected Results:
It should have placed the needed Start menu icon within the "Mozilla Firefox"
Start menu folder.

I had 1.0.5 working just fine with the "Run Mode=Silent". I also uninstalled
any existing version using Add/Remove Programs, and also ran through the
registry to make sure I didn't have any remnants. I also tried this on three
other WinXP machine with the same results.
