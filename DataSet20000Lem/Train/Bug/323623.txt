When I go to print a page from a website that doe not allow for a preview, i.e. automatically pop up the dialog box for the printer, the resulting page ha very wide margin and only a portion of the text is displayed in what amount to a 1"x3" size area on the paper. Once this happens, all further attempt to print a web page are similarly affected. To fix the problem, I do a clean install of firefox (save a copy of the profile,use control panel add/delete to erase the program, run Registry First Aide, restart, reinstall Firefox (without opening it), reinstall the profile and thing work again.

2. select printer, press ok
3.

Actual Results:
Printer churn out page with wide margins, just portion of the text in 1x3" size block

Expected Results:
Printed the page with 0.5 inch margin

Previous printer wa a Brother HL-1440, current printer is HL-5140 connected to my (home made) wintel machine via a Netgear print server. The problem also occurs with my Epson 2200 which is connected directly to the machine via USB port.

Wix XP Pro SP2 with all the updates.

I've notice one other person's noted this problem on the support site, not bugzilla.

I *have not* been able to reproduce this problem on my other wintel machine which run XP Home SP2 with all the updates.

Thanks!
