universal problem - web display (every website), unable to type clearly in message box (everyplace I've tried)

This problem appeared with the first of several FF patch I installed in 2008 -- I'm an early adopter. It got worse with every upgrade/patch. What happens is:

(a) when viewing ANY and every website, type crunch on top of type, worst is the hyperlinks, which sometimes are 2-3 layer deep. I even see this on your website.

(b) when typing in any box -- such a this one, in my Yahoo mail, in other submission box on any website -- the text also overlap so that by the time I am toward the right-hand margin, the cursor is usually two letter to the left, so I'm effectively "typing blind."

NOTES: I do not experience any of these problem on the same site when using a PC. However, my computer is a Mac, so the option of using a PC is not viable for me. I am on a MacBook running OS 10.4.11. I imagine I have minimal plug-ins.

I would describe this in typographical term a a problem with horizontal tracking or variable spacing -- not sure what you folk call it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch FF.
2. visit ANY website -- yahoo, yours, honoluluadvertiser.com, starbulletin.com, etc. Any professional website ha the problem; sometimes there is a degree of difference.
3. attempt to read the page.
4. attempt to type in a message box like this one without
doing a hard return after say 30 character of typing.
Actual Results:
see above. I don't really do anything except try to use your browser.


Expected Results:
I would like to be able to see web page without text overalapping and
to be able to type in box like this without horrible typos.

I think the only change I have made to your default setting are to restrict cooky and popups. Other than that, I've left well enough alone.

I have marked this a "major" because you are my preferred browser and yet I cannot even rely on FF to use in sending a professional-looking e-mail -- ie one without spelling errors.

Thank you very much. I hope this can be resolved so that I don't have to switch away from you.
