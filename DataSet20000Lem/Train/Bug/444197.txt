Firefox 3 bug demo: page http://uuroanoke.org/firefox3demo/ us frames. It call on a menu frame and a content frame page, frame1.htm which work perfectly by itself, but which doe not work a a framed page in Firefox 3. To see this, click on the link on this page. These link work correctly in Firefox 2, IE 7, and Opera 8.54.

Notice that the first five link all seem to work, but the last link doesn't. The file for case 5 is identical to the file for case 6. Only the path to the content is different.

Please try this again, looking at only this page without being in a frameset. It will work.

Thanks for looking at this. JDH.
