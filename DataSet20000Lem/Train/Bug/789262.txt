Firefox 15 ha problem with Wiki-on-a-Stick and More-Wiki-in-a-Jar
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:14.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/14.0.1
Build ID: 20120713134347

Steps to reproduce:

After the recent update to Firefox 15, I tried to view data I had entered in the personal desktop wiki More-Wiki-in-a-Jar, but after every few links, it would disconnect from localhost:3003. I therefore tried creating a new installation of Wiki-on-a-Stick (which us a single html file rather than Java) so I could move the data over there.


Actual results:

When I tried opening the WOAS html file, I got error message saying "WoaS Unhandled Error" and "Save Failure During Integrity Test" and could not get into the database, although I could still use my earlier installation of WOAS without problems. The same thing happened when I copied an existing installation of WOAS into a new folder and also when I tried using Firefox in safe mode. I finally reverted to Firefox 14 and wa easily able to create a new installation of WOAS, although I did get a message warning of a possible security vulnerability that I had to override. After reverting, I also found that More-Wiki-in-a-Jar wa working again without the repeated disconnects. (I am running Firefox on Windows XP, SP3.)


Expected results:

I should have been able to do in FF15 what I am able to do in FF14, but it appears that the security protocol have been strengthened to the point of making that impossible.
