if I have firefox maximized (which i always do) when i go to the above URL and click on a show to get the detail on it the popup will load maximized instead of in a normal non-maximized window, which make it difficult and time consuming to close, because of just being able to quickly hit the X button to close i have to move it al the way to the top right of my screen(which is a long way on a 27" screen). I'm sure that this bug could be replicated on other site that you the same javascript ShowPopup method. If Firefox is in a regular non-maximized window and you click on a show to get the popup detail it work a expected with the window poping up at the pre-determined dialog size window a it should an a it doe in IE/Chrome.
