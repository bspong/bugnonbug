When installing a new searchplugin from a slow page, opening the popup with the search plugins in the searchbar (search bar) before the download of the engine ha completeted cause the plugin to appear _under_ "Add Engines". After hiding and showing it again, the menupopup contains one separator somewhere between the list of engines. And another one at the right position above AddEngines.

(The bug always affect only one window. It look a expected in all other windows.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Head over to http://mycroft.mozdev.org/ or another not-so-fast site with search plugins
2. Choose a random Search-Plugin and install it
3. be faster than the download of the searchengine and click the icon in the searchbar to open the popup with your searchplugins
4. wait for the download to complete
Actual Results:
When the download finishes, the engine is *under* the "Add Engines..."-option. After hiding the menupopup and showing it again, there is a separator between two random searchplugins and another one above "Add Engines".

Expected Results:
The new plugin should appear above the menuseparator. After hiding and shwing there should only be one separator that is located above the Add Engines-menuitem.
