Updating Firefox result in "This application ha failed to start because xpcom_core.dll wa not found" when opening pages/clicking link

Every single time I update Firefox I get a message on every URL I go to

Missing Component

This application ha failed to start because xpcom_core.dll wa not found. Re-installing the app may fix the problem

I then have to uninstall firefox and reinstall it. I am at the point that I either will not install updates, which could be a problem or I need to switch to a different browser, which I would rather not do.

Since I get update regularly this is a rather pain. If it happened once I could understand it but every single time. I have posted on the tech support forum only to not have a solution. I am not looking for a temporary solution, I want the issue fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Update firefox when I get update
2. Enter browser and go to a web site
3.
Actual Results:
I get this message

This application ha failed to start because xpcom_core.dll wa not found. Re-installing the app may fix the problem

Expected Results:
installed properly without me having to go and uninstall and then reinstall the program

This ha been happening for about a year now.
