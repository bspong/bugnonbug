Two day ago I wa automatically updated from Firefox 2.0.0.12 to 2.0.0.15.
Although the 2.0.0.12 ran fine, with the newer version I have a great deal of difficulty printing from the web. (It's impossibly difficult) Only one sheet or two will print and several page will be omitted from what should be a multiple page printout. I can't seem to find a remedy no matter what I do. I have a HP Deskjet 6988. It's not the printer-- Safari still print fine!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select a web page from splitcoaststampers.com gallery or from a blog that includes picture
2.Choose file and then print; pick print from the print dialogue box, choose to print all page or whatever selected page are desired to print. The print Preview will most likely show that significant part of the material that is supposed to print have been omitted.
3.Check with preview if desired
Actual Results:
The printed material leaf out significant part that are not printed. Even in the print preview view these page are omitted.

Expected Results:
All part of the web page should print unless selected otherwise and ALL part of the page should show in print preview.
