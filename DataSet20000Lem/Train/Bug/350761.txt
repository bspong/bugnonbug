In the left pane of the Bookmarks Manager, the expand/collapse widget (plus/minus icon) appears whenever a folder is non-empty. This includes the case when the only content of a folder are bookmark with no subfolders. This appears to mimic the behavior seen in the right pane where empty folder have no expand/collapse widget available because there is nothing inside of them to see.

However, in the left pane, the expand/collapse widget should only appear next to folder that actually have subfolders. Presently, clicking on the plus icon next to a folder without subfolders just toggle the icon and doesn't do anything useful. Removing the plus/minus icon where it is not needed would also have the benefit of allowing user to see at a glance which folder actually do have subfolders rather than clicking on each one to see if it expands or not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bookmark folder and put one bookmark in it.
2. Launch Bookmarks Manager.
3. Click on plus icon next to folder in left pane.

Actual Results:
Plus icon change to minus icon and folder open slightly.

Expected Results:
Plus icon should not even appear next to folder without subfolders in left pane.
