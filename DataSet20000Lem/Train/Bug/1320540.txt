Can't update my website with IE after latest Firefox update.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Build ID: 20161104212021

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox is my standard browser but after the latest update on November 17, 2016 I can no longer use Internet Explorer to update my website. I've tried to put IE a my standard browser but still got a Firefox crash error even though Firefox wasn't open. I've added my website a a trusted website, I've refreshed the firewall to accept the newest version of Firefox (I tried to remove Firefox so that I could then put it back in a a trusted website but it wouldn't let me delete firefox). I've attempted to upload my site via Filezilla instead of IE but there too I get a can't connect to server error.


Actual results:

Every time I try to publish my website (using Magix Web Designer 10 Premium which automatically us Internet Explorer to publish) I get a time out error. If I try to force it to continue I then get a Firefox crash even though I've got IE open and Firefox closed.


Expected results:

Previously up until 10 day ago, I would click Publish website and IE would open, export my website, update the necessary information and close again. After that I saved my Magix information, closed Magix and could go back to use Firefox a normal. The only time IE get used is to update my site. I've contacted Magix, they're not experiencing any server problem and they suggested Filezilla but there too, even with Firefox a my standard server, it won't allow me to access the Magix server to update my website.
