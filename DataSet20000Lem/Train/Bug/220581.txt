Bookmarks manager - problem interpreting ampersand in imported bookmark

Whenever I delete my Firebird main and profile folder and reinstall Firebird, I
have to import my old bookmark to be able to access them. When this happens,
it appears Firebird want to edit my bookmarks.html file and replace all & that
are not followed by character entity code with &amp; to make the code more
valid. For example this:
http://forums.devshed.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=5

would be converted to this:
http://forums.devshed.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=5

The problem come when I try to open these bookmarks. For some reason the &amp;
is not parsed out of the URL into a & and the second URL of above is sent
through. This often break the CGI script the query string is sent to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a clean install, import a bookmarks.html file with a bookmark whose URL
contains an ampersand.
2. Open the bookmark.

Actual Results:
The location bar show the original URL with all "&" replaced by "&amp;".

Expected Results:
The location bar should show the original unadulterated URL with all "&" still
intact.

It's worth noting this is only a problem with bookmark and not hyperlink in
downloaded files.
