[Mac] Firefox mouse cursor will not change after cmd-tabbing and hiding another app
I've only tested this bug on a Mac, but I'm guessing it's limited to Macs because it requires the use of the Mac's cmd-tab feature. Under certain circumstances, the mouse cursor will not change when hovering over context-sensitive items, such a a text field, a link, or a button. The bug occurs in all Firefox version from 8.0b1 until 20.0. The bug doe not occur in 7.0 and earlier.

==========

Steps to reproduce:

1. Ensure Firefox is hidden.
2. Hit cmd-tab, and hold the cmd key. Hit Tab a few time until Firefox and the Finder are NOT the app that is selected, then hit the "H" key to hide/show that app.
3. While still holding the cmd key, keep hitting the Tab key until Firefox is selected, then release the cmd key.

Actual result:

The mouse cursor will not change anymore. If you hover over a textbox, for instance on Google, the cursor will not change to the text insertion icon. If you click on the text box, though, then the cursor will change icons, and now it is stuck a the text insertion icon.

Expected result:

The mouse cursor should still be able to change a usual, based on whatever it is hovering over.

==========

There are some quick way to fix this while I'm using Firefox and this happens to me. I can either move my mouse outside of the Firefox window, or bring up cmd-tab and then return to Firefox.

I'm thinking that this bug perhaps is somehow related to how Firefox recently changed it design, making the browser more native-looking on Macs? The pre-7.0 Firefox version had a darker toolbar, whereas the new one have a lighter one.
