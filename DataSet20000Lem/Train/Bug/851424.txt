make 64-bit+32-bit version of ff, tb, etc available

Steps to reproduce:

want to use firefox on 64-bit machine natively


Actual results:

I get a 32-bit product (to my knowledge)


Expected results:

the installer should provide the either both or the correct kind of executables.

mingw-w64 (gcc) give me 64-bit and 32-bit executables (separate compiler for each).
what I usually do is make a 32\ and 64\ directory and for window I make shortcut to the 64-bit exe and make the working directory the 64\ or 32\ so it see the appropriate DLLs in that dir. i believe they also have compiler for linux too.

voila, you now have 32+64-bit ff, tb, etc. and I think this same method is portable to linux and not sure about mac - someone knowledgeable about mac would have to answer on that.

mingw-w64 you have to stay on the mailing list and prod once in a while when compiler landscape change to see what's viable. right now rubenvb's compiler are the thing to get. they need donation and work to have buildbot working again for windows. so for now, only the personal build are kept up to date.
these build work for auto build (32-bit and 64-bit target, windows):
