Full disk seems to allow duplicate extension installation.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.3a4pre) Gecko/20100317 Firefox/3.7a4pre

My home partition, where my Firefox profile resides, wa effectively full (only a few KiB were free), unbeknown to me, and I tried to install FlashGot. The installer seemed to succeed, but I wa not given an option to restart Firefox. I restarted manually, and the extension wa present, but in a crippled/incomplete state, a though it had not fully loaded. I wa still unaware that my disk wa full, so I just tried reinstalling the extension. It installed, but it did not replace the old installation. After restarting Firefox again (manually), there were 2 entry for FlashGot in the Add-ons manager. After removing both, clearing up some disk space, restarting, and reinstalling FlashGot, all wa well.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill disk on which Firefox profile exists
2. Attempt to install extension
3. Restart
4. Attempt to install same extension
5. Restart.
Actual Results:
There were two entry for the extension in the Add-ons manager. The extension did not actually work.

Expected Results:
The second installation of the extension should have overwritten the first, or the installer should have informed me that the disk wa full or there wa a write error.
