If I visit a page (e.g. the google code page above) and click on a link that load content into frame using javascript, the content load but is almost immediately (up to 1 second or so) overwritten by the original frame content. In Yahoo! Mail, this overwrites the inbox content with the Yahoo Mail front screen; in Google code, it overwrites the product window with Android descriptions, flipping between this and a blank (copyright only) frame. This problem doe not occur in Internet Explorer on the same system.

Problem first noticed in Yahoo! after complete system rebuild and upgrade to Firefox 2.0.0.14. Java version 6u6 and 6u10 have both been tried, a ha cleaning the system and reinstalling Firefox and Java.
