Mozilla fails to put in the expected vertical space of one blank line between a
text paragraph (defined by the <p> xxx </p> tags) and a table that follows it.
On the test page above, there are several table that follow paragraphs. Each
table ha a red back-arrow image and say in red text "Back to Main Coaching
Page", etc. Several of these table fail to have a blank vertical line space
separating them from the paragraph leading up to them. This usually straightens
itself out if I reload and everything display okay.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.soulmateoracle.com/test.html
2. Click on the "test" link, which will take you to test2.html
3. Look to see if any red text "Back to Main Coaching Page" is not separated
from the black paragraph text that precedes it
4. Reload and see if it corrects itself
Actual Results:
3 of the table containing red text "Back to Main Coaching Page" were not
separated by an expected blank link from the text paragraph that came before it.
All 3 fixed themselves upon reload and showed the blank line between them and
the preceding paragraphs.

Expected Results:
All table containing red text "Back to Main Coaching Page" should have a blank
vertical line on top of them, separating them from the previous text that come
before them.
