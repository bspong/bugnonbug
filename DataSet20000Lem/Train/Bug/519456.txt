Much of the time it crash a soon a I execute the search. I execute the search several ways: pressing "Enter," clicking on the magnifier in the search box at the top, clicking on the search link within a page.

Crashes also occur within Google when clicking on a search result link.

1. Enter search term in the search box at the top of the page (seems to work only with Google)
2. Press "Enter" or click on magnifier in search box
3.If crash doe not occur immediately, click on first link in search result page.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, come back with an "I'm embarrassed" box for restart.
