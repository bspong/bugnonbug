Software installation is disabled error when trying to install XPI

For the Past 3 nightly builds, I have been unable to install any extension
because the following error occurs:

Software installation is disabled.
You can enable it under Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced -> Software Installation

This is most interesting a I'm using Firefox, and thus the preferenced dialog
is not at Edit -> Preferences. There is an option to enable/disable software
installation, but it is already enabled and changing it didn't make a difference
for me.

This problem is on a fresh installation of Firefox on a laptop that ha
previously never seen any browser other than IE. I haven't tried any other
computer to see if the problem happens on other computers.

Based on the error message, I would guess this is the result of some bug fixed
in Mozilla (possibly the one to disable software installation by default?) which
got carried over to Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a nightly build from the past few day ( > 20040606)
2. Try to install an XPI (I've tried Optimoz and Adblock)

Actual Results:
You will receive the error mentioned above.

Expected Results:
The software installation dialog should appear and proceed normally (assuming
software installation is enabled).
