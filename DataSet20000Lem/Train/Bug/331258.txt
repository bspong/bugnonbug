If a span element is created dynamically using document.createElement and is then positioned absolutely to the current mousemove coordinate the new span is visible and correctly positioned but fails to fire any mouseup events.

possibly related to bug: 201512

ps: the span is created using in the following code:

objItem = document.createElement("SPAN");

// Setup the bar
objItem.id = sVBarID;
objItem.style.position = "absolute";
objItem.style.top = "0px";
objItem.style.left = "0px";
objItem.style.height = "0px";
objItem.style.width = "2px";
objItem.style.background = "silver";
objItem.style.borderLeft = "1px solid black";
objItem.style.display = "none";
