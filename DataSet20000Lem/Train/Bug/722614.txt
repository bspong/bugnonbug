Steps to reproduce:

This ha been happening whenever I go to Youtube. I haven't used many other Flash video players, but I believe it's happened to them too. Furthermore, and most cryptically, I've been getting this problem on Youtube's HTML5 video a well, though the latter format ha not, to date and to the best of my knowledge, caused my system to freeze.


Actual results:

When playing a video, I will frequently experience a sort of stuttering in which the video freeze but the audio play just fine. This normally last for at most a second or two but happens constantly.

However, on occasion, generally when the video ha just started, freeze not only the video, but the control a well. The audio keep playing normally, but at this point my system becomes unresponsive a follows: Initially just the video is frozen, but Firefox quickly hangs. After this I am still able to interact with the taskbar for at most half a minute; by interact, I mean I can highlight the button for different windows/programs, and right-clicking give me the context menu a normal, though telling Firefox to close this way accomplishes nothing. Eventually the taskbar freeze a well, leaving me with only the ability to move my mouse, but shortly after the taskbar freeze so doe my mouse cursor. At this point I have to force a hard shutdown on my system.


Expected results:

I first noticed this issue this past December; before that, video on Youtube and elsewhere always played normally.

I suspect this bug and bug 697739 are strongly related if not identical, since the one time I managed to open Task Manager to see what wa eating my CPU it turned out to be plugin-container.EXE, and forcing the process to end immediately gave me a watchdog.sys BSOD.
