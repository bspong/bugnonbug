When a label contains input other than text, the onclick event fire twice.
It should only fire once.
It's ok if it doesn't call any function that doesn't determine if the checkbox is checked or not but for me it is a real pain...

I have a sample to demonstrate using the link I provided.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the text "Show Div".
2. Click again the text "Show Div".
(The following step should display the correct output:)

3. Click on the checkbox.
4. Click again on the checkbox.
Actual Results:
1. 2 alert dialog box will appear one after another, click ok. A text will appear "The div is shown", Notice: Current number is set to 0 (it must be 1).
2. Again 2 alert dialog box will appear one after another, click ok.)
The text will disappear, Current number is set to 0.

3. 1 alert dialog box will appear, click ok. A text will appear "The div is shown", Current number will set to 1.
4. Again 1 alert dialog box will appear, click ok.)
The text will disappear, NOTICE: Current number is now set to 0.

Expected Results:
When clicking the text beside the checkbox and clicking the checkbox directly should have the same result. (clicking the checkbox directly ha the correct result)

The label which contains input inside such checkbox must fire onclick event only once!

check this page: http://dev.familylink.com/~sricaforte/dev.wererelated.com/a1/test.php

try clicking everything. You'll notice that label with input inside always fire twice.
