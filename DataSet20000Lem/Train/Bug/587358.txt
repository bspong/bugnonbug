In-page context menu option aren't selectable until the mouse button is released (regression from 3.6 and 4.0b2)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b3) Gecko/20100805 Firefox/4.0b3

In Firefox 3.6.8 and Firefox 4.0b2, a user can select a context menu option by right clicking (or ctrl-clicking) and holding then releasing on the option they want (this is the proper OS X behaviour). In Firefox 4.0b3, nothing in a context menu is selectable until the mouse button is released, and releasing the mouse button while hovering over an item doesn't trigger the item.

This only applies to context menu inside the rendered page--right-clicking inside the tab bar, a toolbar, or the status bar still work correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click and hold anywhere in the page, move the mouse cursor over a menu item, then release.
Actual Results:
The menu item being hovered over doesn't get highlighted, and isn't selected when the mouse button is released.

Expected Results:
The menu item should highlight a it's hovered over, and should be selected when the button is released.
