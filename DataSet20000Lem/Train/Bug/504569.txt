We have an AJAX-type application that contains many synchronous XmlHttpRequest calls. Many of these call are utilized within a wrapper function that first show a progress bar, then us a setTimeout to invoke the worker function itself which make the XmlHttpRequest call.

Occasionally this code will cause firefox to stop execution of all javascript on the page and not go any further. I'm pretty sure it the setTimeout pattern because when this is removed the problem doesn't repro.

There are no error being reported in the javascript console, and usually a refresh or two and the problem will go away.

In 8 hour of use per day with our application this occurs appx 10 time (just to give you an idea a to how frequent it is.

My guess to repro would be to write a frames-based application that ha a setTimeout pattern where the function invoked by setTimeout call XmlHttpRequest and do this in more than one frame of the frameset and you may be able to see this after awhile.

It happens more often on my quad-core then it doe for the rest of my team member with dual core, so it may be some kind of threading issue?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:
javascript stop execution

Expected Results:
javascript should continue executing, but it look like it waiting for something... Deadlock? Race condition? Feels multithreaded to me anyway, but what do I know?
