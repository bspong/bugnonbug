When reading any email, a company's name or product name is encountered and we
would like to know the detail about the company. Most of the time there would
be a website with .com name.

If we double-click on the name and copy the word than a trailing space is also
copied. Than we open a new tab and paste the text and hit Ctrl+Enter which would
fillup the URL with http://wwww. and trailing .com. But it doe not truncate the
word.

So if we have copied mozilla word and pasted in address bar and hit enter than
it would be formed a http://www.mozilla .com and say URL is not valid.

Also when a link is copied and we paste in address bar, than we have to position
the cursor and hit enter. It would be nice if it ha GO button like IE so that
we can paste the URL and click on GO button.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. double-click any word in any website and start new tab and paste and hit
ctrl+enter
2. enter url a mozilla with a space after and hit ctrl+enter


Actual Results:
URL is invalid

it should trucate the address bar and show the web page
