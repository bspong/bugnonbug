Shared computer.
Cookie persisted from MSIE, and automatically logged in a user XXXXXX.
Went through logout/login process, to login a user YYYYYY.
Login for XXXXXX persists.
Attempted to login a user YYYYYY in manner of:
"http://www.hottopic.com/default.asp?LS=0&M=YYYYYY&"
where M= the user ID number.
Login for XXXXXX persists, and subsequent link change URL to M=XXXXXX
Logins can still be changed in MSIE, and they persist in MSIE until changed, but
have no effect on new Firefox windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. login to hottopic.com
(you can use sample URL replacing XXXXXX with a 9-digit number if you do not
have people with different logins)
2. attempt to login a different user
3.

Actual Results:
Page said Welcome USERNAME1 even after several attempt at login under USERNAME2.
Using URL with correct user number still wa logged into wrong account, and
switched to that account's user number if clicked thru.

Expected Results:
allowed another user to login

login/logout feature still work in MSIE.
custom URLs work in MSIE.
Hot Topic's Java web-design is poor with flaky Java and 1/2-done encryption.
