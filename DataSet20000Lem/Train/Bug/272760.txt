when not initially connected, load URL http://www.perlmonks.org/... when http://perlmonks.org/... is entered in the location bar

If, while I am initiating a dialup connection via a separate (non-gui) process,
I start Firefox and enter a URL beginning http://perlmonks.org/, a "Choose a
network connection" dialog window pop up. Once the dialup connection is ready,
I switch to the popup and select cancel or hit escape, and Firefox start
loading a page from www.perlmonks.org instead (without any change to the
location bar). While the content on the two site is identical (sometimes they
point to the same server and sometimes they don't), I maintain separate cooky
for perlmonks.org vs. www.perlmonks.org and don't want the www. one sent when
I'm not using the www. URL.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. disconnect dialup
2. open firefox
3. enter location http://perlmonks.org/?node=Fullpage%20Chat
4. (popup should come up; leave it alone)
5. establish dialup connection (I use rasdial)
6. Cancel popup

Actual Results:
Saw Connecting to/Waiting for www.perlmonks.org... on Firefox's bottom grey bar,
though the location bar still properly say
http://perlmonks.org/?node=Fullpage%20Chat. userpass cookie for
www.perlmonks.org sent instead of one for perlmonks.org.


Expected Results:
Loaded the page using the domain name specified in the location bar.
