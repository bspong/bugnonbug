The new version load really fast but if the website (many site tried with same result - specifically livejournal.com and plentyoffish et al) doe not perform quickly enough the page seems to load but then freeze (no more item finish rendering) and then if you click on any pulldown menu or any other link the program crash or go into application not responding. I am really not impressed with the overall stability which wa firefox's basic best feature before this!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load a page
2.click through to load a java item before page finish
3.crash
Actual Results:
it may take a number of page but the darn thing crash often - I have rebooted my computer several time and force quitted the program over and over.

Expected Results:
it should just run page even if they are not fully loaded

I think you should roll back the upgrade!

If I don;t get a patch soon I'm going to try Chrome.
