Firefox messed up my bookmark after signing in from another pc...
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170518000419

Steps to reproduce:

I signed in to mozilla account from my new Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10. This wa the first time i signed in to mozzila using this device.


Actual results:

Once i signed in from my new Surface Pro 3 and after the sync ended successfully i noticed that i dont have all the bookmark that i had on my other pc (the one that i am using to file this bug report). I thought that the sync messed up the process and lost some of the bookmark but when i got to my most used pc (the one that i am on at the moment) i noticed that even on that Firefox the bookmark are missing and are the same one a on my new Surface Pro 3... As i can notice the bookmark are not missing actually but they are returned to the state from few month ago (and the newer bookmark are lost only and they are the one that i really need).


Expected results:

When i signed from my new device Surface Pro 3 after the sync of firefox i should have got all the bookmark imported to that firefox and on my old pc the bookmark should have stayed a they were...
