Downloads option have multiple error now. I'll list them separately.

I have the window Taskbar configured to Autohide, docked to the top of the window.

IF the Downloads window is left open before download, after a file finish downloading, focus is transferred to the highlighted Downloads button on it. This cause the Taskbar to "unhide" and drop down and stay down until the Downloads button is clicked.

This happens whether or not [ ] "Show the Downloads window when downloading a file" is selected and even if [x] "Close it when all downloads are finished" is selected.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set window taskbar to Autohide
2. Open FF Downloads window
3. Download a file
Actual Results:
After the download finishes, the Windows Taskbar drop down, the Downloads button flash a few time then stay highlighted. The taskbar fails to autohide. It stay down, covering the top of my working window until I click on the highlighted Downloads button, which then allows the Taskbar to hide itself again

Expected Results:
Focus should not be transferred to the Taskbar Downloads button after a download.



I tested this with this selected or not:
1 [ ] Show the Downloads window when downloading a file is selected

2 [x] Show the Downloads window when downloading a file is selected
[ ] Close it when all downloads are finished is selected.

3 [x] Show the Downloads window when downloading a file is selected
[x] Close it when all downloads are finished is selected.

If the Downloads window is not opened beforehand, then all 3 of the above option work a expected.

The problem seems to be having the Downloads window already opened before a download.
