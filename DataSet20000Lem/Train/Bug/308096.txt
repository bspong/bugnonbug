whole system(win2000 professional)just dies,Nothing can use ,no response at
all,Even I press ctrl+alt+del.
1\when the page open,everything is ok.
2\when the pic continues loading,the operation system becomes slower and
slower,and the memory just growthing.
3\the firefox begin to hangup.
4\the whole system stop response ,what I can do is to reboot by the reset button.

but when I use opera 8,Everything is ok.

I searched first,find a lot about the memory leak(maybe).
