Folks, this is the most basic of requirement of any app. Until you fix this bug, you should not release another update. I know I will uninstall this app if it happens to me again. You have had enough time to fix this very serious issue! Get it done already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an older version
2. Save some links, customize the toolbar, setup all other perference option
3. browse to create history (yes, people do reference this!)
4. Run the next upgrade.
5. Verify that the user history, bookmarks, preferences, etc. are still maintained!!!!!!!
6. Now you have earned your paycheck.
Actual Results:
Currently, the history is still wiped out.
Most recent update did not kill all of the bookmarks.
Let's get the next release right, OK?

Expected Results:
User prefs, settings, etc. should NEVER get wiped out by an app, including from install or upgrade!!!!!
This should be considered critical, since user are losing their data., and software should not be released with critical bugs.
