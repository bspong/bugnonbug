Sync reverts changed password if old password entered before sync complete
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

1. Set up Firefox Sync (easier to reproduce with two installation on a dual boot).
2. Synchronise saved passwords.
3. Change and sync the saved password to an online account.
4. Reboot (or otherwise switch to) another Firefox installation.
5. Attempt to log in to account with changed password before sync occurs (setting a master password make this easier to notice, not sure if it affect reproducibility).


Actual results:

The login attempt failed with an incorrect password message (in this case, Google informed me that I had changed my password a while ago). After synchronisation wa completed, the new password wa overwritten with the old password on all device set up with sync, making it impossible to log in with the saved password.


Expected results:

Ideally, sync should have picked up and used the new password immediately, although of course that's not possible under all circumstances. It probably should have eventually picked up the new password, and definitely should not have reverted the password on all synced devices.
