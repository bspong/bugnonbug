firefox crash on PRINT PREVIEW
User-Agent: Opera/9.24 (X11; Linux i686; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/2007101500 SUSE/2.0.0.8-1.1 Firefox/2.0.0.8

I didn't found any other bug that could reproduce my findings, so I'd better start a new one here:
in my new SUSE 10.3, with the last update of Firefox (2.0.0.8) I can't use anymore the Print Preview function.
It crash the browser, on any URL you can imagine; it even reproduce on local edited HTMl files; for example the following HTMl "code":
<html>
<title> my test page </title>
<body>
<br>
just a print prevuew try.
<br>
</body>
</html>

I tried the same with the "vanilla" version, taken from ftp.mozilla.org, and the same crash.
I even verified with older versions: the same with version from 2.0.0.4 up to 2.0.0.8 !!!
Only version 2.0 -- 2.0.0.3 seems to not have this bug !
With every version tried, I first removed ~/.mozilla folder to make room for fresh setting every time (so no plugins used either !)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start the browser :)
2.open any URL (or, better, a local saved page)
3. try the Print Preview function
Actual Results:
browser crash with the following error:
/path_to_installed_folder/run-mozilla.sh: line 131: 19991 Segmentation fault "$prog" ${1+"$@"}

Expected Results:
a clean print preview :)

The strangest thing is that with SuSE 10.1, and "vanilla" Firefox 2.0.0.6 this never happened (ar any other crash at all, at least for me :))
