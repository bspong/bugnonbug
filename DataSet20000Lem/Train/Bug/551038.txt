It actually doe this on numerous website a far a adding comment or logging in. It just sends me to an error page. If I use the back arrow, sometimes it will work, sometimes it won't.

Also, if I have typed a message, I go to add it, it loses the message and go to the error page.


Sometimes when closing it go to 100% cpu usage a well for a minute or so.

Reproducible: Always

1. attempt to login, just go to blank login and won't allow a login
2. attempt to add message, either go straight to error or if you can type a message, it won't post it, instead going to error page
3.

Upon clicking on login, I should be logged in.

Occurs with any theme, including default.
