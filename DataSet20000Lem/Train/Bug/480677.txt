After a system crash caused by another program firefox wouldn't start anymore. When attempting to start firefox the entire system would stall. First other program cannot be started anymore, then a few second later running program would start to not react anymore until the entire system freeze and a hard-reset is the only option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
Actual Results:
System freezes.

Expected Results:
Firefox start

Facts:
I run a Vista 64 SP 1 with all recommended update except the Silverlight update.
I had no problem running firefox before the system crash. I did not change any relevant system configuration or updated firefox in between the last successfull running of firefox and the system crash. I cannot recall if firefox wa running during the system crash, but it's very possible. The system crash wa propably not due to firefox (I wa running a game when my system blue-screened on me; I wa not able to recognize the error code), but it may have been.
Reinstalling firefox without removing the user data would not fix the problem.
Purging firefox (including user data) before reinstalling it fixed the problem though. Firefox run fine now again.
I cannot reproduce the failure now anymore.

Speculation:
The crash left firefox (more precise it user data) in a state that would cause the entire system to malfunction when firefox wa started.
Sadly I did not backup the firefox user data before purging it, so I cannot provide the propably corrup data for inspection.
