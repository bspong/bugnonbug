Since upgrading to 3.6.16, I've noticed that after an unspecified period of time -- for the sake of argument, let's say 15 minute -- Firefox fails to attempt to reload a web-page when I click my Reload button under the tab I currently have active.

It doesn't matter the website or what script are running on it.

For the sake of argument, let's say I have two tab open -- one wa open for 15 minutes, and the other wa open for 5. I can continually refresh a page under the tab that wa open for 5 minutes, however when I attempt to refresh the page that open under a tab that wa open for 15 minutes, Firefox make no attempt to do so. It's a though the button functionality while the 15 minute old tab ceases, although, within the tab itself, the hyperlink on the page still function.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new tab & website
2. Wait ~15 minute
3. Click the reload button (it won't try to reload)
Actual Results:
Nothing. I had to close the tab and re-open the website in a new tab.

Expected Results:
Refreshed the web-page a expected.

Nothing more than that.
