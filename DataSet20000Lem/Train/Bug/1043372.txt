Figure out keyboard-accessible alternative for the webrtc global indicator
The current global indicator can't be focused with the keyboard. This mean that a keyboard user can only manually search for the sharing tab and use tab navigation to activate the doorhanger to stop sharing.

We should figure out something better to do, like:

- use registerhotkey ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/windows/desktop/ms646309%28v=vs.85%29.aspx ) on Windows to provide a hotkey to access the indicator, and then rely on simple tab navigation inside the hotkey.

Downside: how do you expose the hotkey? Can we do equivalent thing on other platforms? How do we pick a non-conflicting hotkey?

- add a menu somewhere (under "View"? "Tools" ? "Edit"?) which list the sharing tab so the user can quickly find them.
Downside: relies on the old-style menu

- add a visual indicator to make it easier to spot tab that are sharing content

Downside: need more visual assets, tab are already small and so the indicator might crowd out text, and would still need a lot of scrolling manually to find the offending tab if you have many tab open.

Gavin, can we get this on the roadmap so we fix this for 34 even if it miss the 33 boat due to l10n? :-)

Philipp, can you think of another option that I've missed and/or indicate what solution you'd prefer from a UX perspective?
