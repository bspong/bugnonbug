After upgrading to version 1.5.0.3 from 1.5.0.2 firefox fails to grab window focus from the operating system after it is launched from the sidebar. Although a new browser window appears, the previously used program continues to occupy the navigation bar until firefox is selected by clicking the browser window or using apple+tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch firefox by selecting the icon from the dock (new application instance.... firefox must not be a running process!)
2.a new firefox browser window will appear. Note that "Firefox" is not the application for which the drop-down menu are listed, it will instead be "itunes" or "finder" etc. until the browser window is selected
3.

Actual Results:
Firefox launched, but ran in the background.

Expected Results:
Firefox should run a the top-most window (i.e. have focus on the browser window and display the drop-down menu associated with the program)

This problem MAY be operating system specific or may be a general issue with 1.5.0.3. It wa not a problem with firefox previous to this release.
