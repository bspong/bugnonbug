The bug seems to be an incorrect handling of webpage who call history.back() when they're fully loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a webpage at http://SERVER/LOCATION/index.html containing the following (replace SERVER and LOCATION so they match your setup):

<html>
<head>
<title>PING!</title>
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
function run() {
var z=''+window.location;
if (z.indexOf('http://SERVER/LOCATION/?u='==0)) {
window.history.back();
}
}
//-->
</script>
</style>
</head>
<body onload="run()">
<h1>PING!</h1>
<p id="download">Drag this bookmarklet into your bookmark toolbar: <a class="bookmarklet" href="javascript:window.location='http://SERVER/LOCATION/?u='+window.location">ping!</a></p>
</body>
</html>

2. Surf to that page and save the 'ping' bookmarket.
3. On any website XYZ, click on the bookmarklet.
4. Your webpage at http://SERVER/LOCATION/ get displayed for a second, then history.back() get called and you're back at website XYZ.
5. In the View menu, select Page Source.
Actual Results:
The displayed HTML source is from the webpage at http://SERVER/LOCATION/

Expected Results:
The displayed HTML source should be from website XYZ.

Note that if I input "javascript:alert(location)" in the address bar and press enter, the correct URL get reported (URL of the currently opened document).
