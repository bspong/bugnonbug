I tried to send an email via Yahoo. Tor wa enabled. And after I wrote email and clicked on send button Mozilla crashed in a few seconds. I experienced this few time long ago. But since yesterday after my browser updated itself i experience this every time I wanna send an email. I tried over a 100 times. And I didn't send email not even once. I tired to switch to other version of Mozilla (Tor compatible) but it give me the same result over again (by 30 hour now).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Toggle Tor Status (Tor Enabled)
2. Log in my Yahoo mail.
3. Write an email
4. Press "send" button

After this Mozilla crash in a few seconds.

Actual Results:
Mozilla crash down before sending my email. I can't submit a report or restore my sessions. And mail it's not sent.

Expected Results:
Email should be sent and Mozzila should not crashed. I also lose cooky when I open Mozilla again.

I use Torbutton 1.2.5.
I use Mozilla 3.6 since this morning.
Yesterday my browser update itself. From 3.6.16. to 3.6.18 (not sure)
Since that I can't send email via Yahoo when Tor is enabled.
