Firefox 19 crash using msn.co.uk a homepage, always ha worked before, just past 2 days, only work using blank page a home page.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20130215130331

Steps to reproduce:

I have always used Firefox and I use MSN.uk a my home page. 2 day ago I opened Firefox and it crashed (screen frozen), had to shut it using task manager.


Actual results:

Opened Firefox again and same issue, again closed it using task manager. I can access Firefox menu bar, but a soon a I touch any item on the homepage it crashes. I cannot access any of my saved bookmark either a Firefox will crash doing this a well. I opened Internet Explorer and had no problem using MSN a homepage, hmm!


Expected results:

I usually just open Firefox and can open any item from my MSN homepage, not for 2 day now. I have put in a temporary fix whereby I use a blank page a my home page and therefore can use my saved bookmarks. I originally thought that it might be the new version of Firefox, but since this ha happened after several day of using the new update, I think not. I have tried disabling plug in etc, but no use. I find that I can use other home pages, but not MSN, again MSN work with IE, seems to be a compatibility issue here?
