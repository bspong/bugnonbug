SVG object cache retreives wrong image
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061205 Iceweasel/2.0.0.1 (Debian-2.0.0.1+dfsg-1)

I had an xhtml file on the local disk:
In it, I had:
<OBJECT data="bb_dvd_.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="64" height="64" style="float: right">
DVD image
</OBJECT>
<OBJECT data="phone_sergio_luiz_araujo_01.svg" type="image/svg+xml" width="64" height="64" style="float: right">
DVD image
</OBJECT>

The icon are from the open clip art collection.

I displayed this page in iceweasel.

Then I edited the file to remove the phone SVG and copied and pasted a second copy of the bb_dvd_.svg reference near the bottom of the document.

When I hit reload, the page wa displayed with the DVD icon at the top and then at the bottom it displayed the defunct Phone icon. This suggest that the object cache is working by position number or by accidently summing the
content of the object tag rather than the data attribute.

Hitting reload repeatedly did not fix the problem (the svg file had not changed on disk). Shift reload did.

Hopefully irrelevent details:
- The DVD icon wa edited to give width="100%" height="100%" instead of
absolute measurements. Not that it mattered, iceweasel still did not
rescale it properly.
- The Phone Icon also doe not scale properly so it appears with scrollbars.
