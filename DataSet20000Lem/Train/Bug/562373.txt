annoying "URL is invalid and cannot be loaded" popup due to middlemouse.contentLoadURL set to TRUE by default

with middlemouse.contentLoadURL set to TRUE in about:config, whenever I use the middlemouse button (or two finger click with my asus laptop) on the default Firefox 3.6 install on Ubuntu Linux 9.10, I get the most annoying popup which state "The URL is invalid and cannot be loaded" because it is trying to load the content of the clipboard a a URL.

this should not happen. if the URL is not valid, it should just do nothing. but the real problem here is that this functionality should be disabled by default. it is not useful and I only ever have it happen accidentally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have anything (besides a URL) in your clipboard
2. accidentally middleclick



this is critical in that if you accidentally middle-click while you were in the middle of something, you'll be swept off to a useless search page. you can click back, but you'll lose your place or (with flash content) have to start over.
