website popup cause Firefox to be non-resposive
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_7_4) AppleWebKit/536.25 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/6.0 Safari/536.25

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox bug: (16.0.2)

http://www.justsomelyrics.com/175946/Pescado-Rabioso-Sombra-De-La-Noche-Negra-Lyrics

This site display a popup menu.

In Safari and Chrome the menu is shown full size and can be dismissed with the circle X button in the upper right of the popup




Actual results:

In Firefox:

1.) Only the extreme top and bottom margin of the popup are displayed and even these, incorrectly.

2.) Only a quarter of the dismissal button is shown.

3.) The dismissal button is inoperative.

4.) The page can be dismissed via Macintosh "Red Button" but by then at least two important menu item are inoperative - e.g. New Window (which is not grayed) band and Quit.

5.) When Force Quit is activate the Firefox process is **not** marked "not responding" - the process manager think everything is OK. Forcing quit and restarting Firefox give the "This is embarising" message about not being able to restore something.

A retest on this site doe not display the popup but still lock Firefox (likely a cookie supressing the popup, so your response to the site may be fatal).

Firefox must be forced quit and restarted to recover.


Contact me if you need more info or testing for fix on this error.

Expected results:

Should display popup correctly and allow it to be dismissed, in any event should not lockup Firefox.
