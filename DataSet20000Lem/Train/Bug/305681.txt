What should happen: when mousing over small image at bottom, large image
change (along with text) to match smaller image, but smaller image SHOULD NOT
MOVE. In Safari 2 (Mac OS X) and IE 6 (Windows 2000) this work a expected:
large image changes, smaller image do not move. In FireFox (1.0.6 for both)
large image change a expected, but smaller image jump around a follows:
After load, if mouse over left small image, all small image move down about
1em; When mousing over left then center then right, small image move down by a
large amount (height of image?).
