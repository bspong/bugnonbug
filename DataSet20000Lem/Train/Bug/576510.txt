When a nsplugin is used that show a top level window, then the browser will crash on exit even if the page is no longer shown.

This wa reproduced using a modified example from the QtBrowserPlugin (which is also referred to the in the URL (this URL also utilizes this plugin when it used). However since this doe not crash with Opera using the exact same plugin then the bug appears to be with Firefox.

This is also a Windows specific issue a it doe not crash on Linux.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the page that utilizes the plugin
2. Click on the button that show the top level window
3. Close Firefox
Actual Results:
The browser crashed

Expected Results:
The browser should have exited cleanly

I can provide the plugin in binary form and also in source code form if necessary if it help to to solve this problem. Just contact me for it.
