Anchor Chat Windows to Bottom of Browser and Allow for Tear-off
The interaction that SocialAPI, a well a Facebook's sidebar, is designed for is passive social browsing. This mean that user can browse the web while still being linked to their social network and conversations. Rather than needing to interrupt their current task to check Facebook, user can carry social interaction with them a they browse.

For user to seamlessly shift between their browsing task and conversations, chat conversation need to be a part of the browser window itself. Conversations cannot be separate window only, a these must be managed and may be lost, defeating the purpose of keeping social interaction passive and simple.

The UX team ha had the goal of eliminating these separate "floating" window throughout Firefox for a long time. We're gradually moving many part of the browser, such a Bookmarks, Add-ons, and Preferences, into the content area. There are a few reason we're doing this, including the ability to display Firefox in fullscreen mode and across devices. For chat, this is even more vital, because conversation must be something the user doe not need to manage explicitly, but can carry with them.

The attached mockup show chat window a opening in the bottom of the browser window, to the left of the social sidebar. The user can minimize or tear off the conversation by using the icon in the top right.
