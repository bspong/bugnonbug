Firefox would not let me download Java. Yes I have been to the Java Site but no luck.Instead of improving you are making Firefox worse.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.NA
2.NA
3.NA

Actual Results:
I wa not able to print my postal shipping label and after all the trouble of
trying to find and correct the problem, I took a chance and re-downloaded
FireFox 4.01 and everything worked great like before and no more headache's.

FireFox 5 is a big problem at this time and I don't want it.

Expected Results:
The Java box should never have come up asking where on my computer do
I want to save it. Like before I should go from step to step and then print the
shipping label without any box asking where do I want to save a Java Script download which I wa unable to do.
This never happened with FireFox 4.01.

I Re-installed FireFox 4.01 and everything worked great like before.

You also took away the Reboot button that wa on every Firefox until version 4.

FireFox 5 is no good at this time.
