I've seen several post about invisible caret but none of them really fit what I am experiencing.

I created some kind of javascript user interface that generates divs with content on them.

These divs (position: absolute) are added after a fixed div (for design's sake).
Whenever a div is above this fixed div, the caret becomes invisible on any type of input-field (text, password, textarea, designmode) that is put on that div.

When the input field is not completely over the fixed div, the part that is not, doe have a visible caret.

This example show the problem, try to edit the field and move the caret over the fixed div:

<div id="somefixeddiv" style="position:fixed;top:0px;left:0px;width:120;height:500;background-color:#000000;visibility: visible;">
</div>

<div id="fiets" style="position: absolute;top: 100px;left: 100px;width: 200px;height: 200px;background-color: #400000;">
<input type="text" name="wortel" value="fietsen is gezond">
</div>

Reproducible: Always
