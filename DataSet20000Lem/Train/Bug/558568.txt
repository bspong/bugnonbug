Both firefox AND thunderbird hang on exit
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; fi-FI; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100409 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.3

If I start firefox and exit it, it leaf a process running. Exactly the same happens with thunderbird. When I start either of them again, they complain about the earlier process still running and won't start again. They both started to do this about a week ago. I used Ubuntu 9.10, firefox 2.5.8 and Thinderbird 2.x. I assumed this would get fixed when updating to Ubuntu 10.04, which ha FF 2.6.3 and TB 3.x, but the *same* problem still exists.

I tried to disable all add-ons, but it didn't help.

This is very annoying. When I'm loggin out, I have to p ux | grep thund and then kill the process AND do the same for FF.
I have started to reboot always when I log out. It is easier...

hmm.. maybe opensc and/or certificate could be the cause?
