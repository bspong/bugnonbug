Problem occurs while using Microsoft Virtual Desktop Manager (from XP Power
Tools available here:
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx).
Sometimes when switching to the desktop where firefox is located, the window
vanishes. It seems a though it get set to 0 size and repositioned to negative
window cooridinates. The only way to get it back is to select "Move" option
from the taskbar button and reposition it onto the desktop. Firefox is the only
application that I have seen exhibit this behavior so I don't think it a
problem with the virtual desktop software.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install MSVDM
2. Open firefox.
3. Switch back and forth between desktops. I'm using running a number of other
application scattered between desktop and Firefox is usually on my first desktop.

Actual Results:
Window get mapped to negative screen coordinate and reduced to 0 size.

Expected Results:
Window should be displayed.
