lose HTML formatting when paste HTML into Mail.app from firefox but can paste HTML from Safari
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Below is a "table" of what work and what doesn't work. You can paste the data
no matter what, but on certain configuration support retaining the HTML
formatting when you paste.

Safari to Mail.app HTML pasting work fine.
Firefox to Thunderbird HTML pasting work fine.
Firefox to Mail.app HTML pasting loses the formatting.
Safari to Thunderbird HTML pasting loses the formatting.

Clearly Mail.app and Firefox have the ability to cut+paste HTML so I assume the
problem is in how Firefox present the clipboard to Mail.app. Mail.app doesn't
realize that the clipboard ha HTML in it perhaps?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use firefox to select and copy some HTML to the clipboard
2. Compose a new message in Mail.app and paste.
Actual Results:
The text is not pasted a HTML but rather a plain text. Also notice that the
Paste a HTML menu item (under Edit) is not highlighted.

Expected Results:
Paste a HTML should be highlighted and by default HTML should be pasted into
the Mail.app message rather than plain text.
