When submitting form currently there are two security settings:
1. No warning about submitting data over unencrypted connection
2. with warning.
Problem is that on some popular sites, for example search engine like google, each submission result in the popup warning. The only alternative right now is to turn warning off.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Tools->Options->Security->Warning Messages->Settings->Show a warning dialog when:
check: I submit Information that's not encrypted
Apply the change
2.access google.com; enter any search word; press "Enter"
3. Observe popup with a warning anout sending information over unencrypted connection


Expected Results:
ENHANCEMENT
Introduce parameter which will allow to have warning only if connection from
the website to user is encrypted (https), but connection from the user to the website is not encrypted.
This way warning popup will appear only when user expects connection to be secure because lock is shown and address bar turn yellow, but the security is only one way from website to user - connection from user to website is not encrypted.

Current setting result in warning popup unless connection from user to website is secure. In every day browsing moajority of access are over unencrypted connection (web seearches for example). Acknowledging the popup on connection where user doe not expect it to be secure becomes tedious and many will turn the warining off.
Having ability to have warning only when user excpects security will result in many more user actually using the warning which is conditional.
