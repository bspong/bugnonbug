If two table cell are separated by white space in the html source, a spurious space is inserted in the field on the left when the table is copied to the clipboard.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Store the following html in a file and open it in firefox:

<table><tr><td>Foo</td> <td>Bar</td><td>Foobar</td></tr></table>

2. Copy the table to the clipboard and then paste it into cat > foo (followed by an end of file).

3. Do od -c foo.

Or paste into an openoffice spreadsheet using paste special unformatted text.
Actual Results:
output from od -c:

F o o \t B a r \t F o o b a r \n

There is an extra space at the end of the first field, but not the second. Removing the space after the </td> remove the space in the result.

If you paste into an openoffice spreadsheet, the space is visible (well, if you move the cursor to the end of the field).

Expected Results:
F o o \t B a r \t F o o b a r \n


It also happens in the Linux version of Firefox.
