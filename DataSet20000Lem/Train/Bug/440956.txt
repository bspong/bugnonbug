way to work around SSL domain mismatch should be provided

When visiting a misconfigured SSL site, often "domain mismatch" warning appear. If visiting the domain (without a path), a good workaround (link in error message) is provided, which is great. However, if visiting single page on a domain, the link doe still point to the domain and not the url. Example:
I want to visit https://google.com/adsense, I get the domain missmatch error, but the link point to https://google.com/ instead of https://google.com/adsense.

Just fixing the link is not a good idea (imagine a user visiting https://example.com/stupidlogin.php?user=me&pass=supersecret, getting spoofed and clicking a link to https://evilspoofer.com/stupidlogin.php?user=me&pass=supersecret).

These warning are most often caused by a missing or additional "www." in front of the domain. I suggest to add an "evaluation" message inside the missmatch error, that tell the user what the warning probably means. Examples:
- "[green icon] The certificate belongs to www.example.com, while you wanted to visit example.com. Probably everything is all right, a the only difference is the WWW. Click here to be redirected to www.example.com/the/path/the/user/wanted/, or click here to continue, ignoring this warning, or click here to abort" a checkbox to tell firefox to remember the decision should be provided.

- "[yellow icon] The certificate belongs to www.example.com, while you wanted to visit shop.example.com. In certain cases, this might indicate an attack, for example if you are visiting a web site that allows user to put up their own web sites." (regular exception handling applies)

- "[red icon] The certificate belongs to paypla.ru, while you wanted to visit paypal.com. In most cases, this indicates an attack. You should not continue unless you are an experienced user, know what caused this warning and that both domain belong to one organization"
