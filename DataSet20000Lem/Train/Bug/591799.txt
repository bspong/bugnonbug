I am unable to access any portion of window live, hotmail from any site in 3.6. it seems to be the only bug since i downloaded beta 4.it work in beta 4,however. I can not get to hotmail in 3.6 safe mode either. I get an error message that the site is unavailable. i can use msn to get a list of email but can not go via a link or directly. have tried with add ons disabled and still can not use 3.6 for any hotmail access.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.type hotmail in location bar\
2.use hotmail link in msn home page
3.try to get to window live log in page from any source, bookmark, address, google
Actual Results:
result in access not available or allowed page every time

Expected Results:
i wa able to get to hotmail directly or get to log in page, can do neither now.

simply ha blocked access to window live in 3.6. hotmail and window live web page are not able to access.
