I have two monitor positioned side by side. I believe that the right one is the primary display since that's the one the machine's BIOS message appear on. Windows manages them a a single extra-wide screen and you can move the mouse pointer from the left monitor to the right one, straddle window between them and so on.

With the most recent Minefield update and after a reboot, dropdown menu from the bar at the top don't appear if the browser window is on the right-hand monitor. The word 'File' (or whatever) get 'pressed' a normal, but no menu appears. On the left-hand monitor it's fine.

I experimented with dragging the browser window so it straddle the two monitors. It seems that the menu problem happens when more than half of the window is in the right-hand monitor.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Start Minefield. Un-maximize the window if it's maximized. Drag the browser window onto the right-hand monitor, which happens to be the primary display on this PC. Press 'File' in the menubar.
Actual Results:
The word 'File' get depressed like a button, but no menu appears.

Expected Results:
The file menu should drop down.
