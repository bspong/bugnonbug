Steps to reproduce:

I have several profile - one for phonegap development, others for banking, facebook, video downloads. With the exception of Video profile, no other profile ha any plugins installed. Video ha "Video Downloader" installed. If I open the console (CTRL+SHIFT+J) a console.log message get displayed (see screen print)






Actual results:

When I open any tab within any profile, I get the console message
Warning: NetUtil.asyncFetch() requires the channel to have one of the security flag set in the loadinfo (see nsILoadInfo). Please create channel using NetUtil.newChannel()

I have Windows 7 with a fresh update from 47.0.1 to v48 earlier today. I do not recall this message occuring in 47.0.1


Expected results:

I believe the message should not occur. It left me wondering if it wa created by my own code until I opened tab in other profile without having any website open and the same message occurs within the console. Its just a distraction - I'm not aware of any other impact.
