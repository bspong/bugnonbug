Restore native theming to browser tab and recreate transparency effect with CSS
Hear me out on this one, okay?

Apart from ignoring user choice (which admittedly isn't that valid a point, since most user don't choose), the new style tab break with high contrast mode or large fonts. They get rid of the bright coloured bar over the top of selected Luna tabs, which I'd apparently been subconciously relying on.
They also seem to require this pixel-perfect image adjustment, causing minor visual glitch that, even if only shipped in a beta release, will cause a significant amount of wasted feedback in duplicate bugs.

Now, apart from the lack of colour (which seems to be a theme here, no pun intended), I really can't see much difference between the new tab and the natively-rendered Luna tabs. The only change I've noticed are the transparency effects, which should be easily reproduced with a few CSS rule on top of the native themeing, i.e. a more specific version of the following:

tab {opacity: .6}
tab[selected="true"] {opacity: 1}
tab:hover {opacity: .9}

Image coming up, showing how this is a reasonable compromise between making it easier to see the selected and background tabs, and respecting OS native look and feel.
