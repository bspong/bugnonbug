Clicking in any applet text field show a cursor but keyboard event do not produce text in the text field. If there are HTML text field or text areas, keyboard event may or may not be directed to those field instead.

This bug is similar, but not exactly the same a other bug I have found.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load any applet that ha a text field, or other input field.
2. Immediately click in any applet text field and try to type.
3. If typing works, repeat the above steps. It should take fewer than 8 try to reproduce the bug.
Actual Results:
Keyboard event do not go to the applet.

Expected Results:
After clicking in a text field on an applet, the applet should receive all keyboard events.

The following two workarounds fix the problem and may provide clue a to the cause.

1. If the browser wa maximized when the applet wa loaded and the bug appears, the browser can be minimized and then restored, and then the applet can get keyboard focus and keyboard event will go to the applet (typing into applet text field will work).

2. If the browser wa not maximized when the applet wa loaded and the bug appears, the browser can be resized in any way (even by only one pixel), and then the applet can get keyboard focus and keyboard event will go to the applet.

This bug seems to appear about 25% of the time, apparently randomly. Once it appears, As far a I know, it only happens on Linux. The applet wa written with version 1.5.0. The plugin used wa 1.6.0, which should work fine.
