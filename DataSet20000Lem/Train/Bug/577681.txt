Hi

Every time I load Firefox, my home page come up.


When I try to type, nothing show up on the screen.

If I wait (approx) 3 minutes, then eventually I can type.

If I type before the 3 minutes, eventually after the 3 minute or so is up, the word appear from what I typed a few minute earlier.

Anywhere I try to type. In the input field of my home page, or on the browser search bar. Just nothing work for 3 minutes.

Can you help??



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Firefox icon on desktop
2.Once Firefox load to home screen, try to type
3.The keyboard wont work for 3 minute
Actual Results:
All I do is click on Firefox and once I am at the home screen, I try to type ANYWHERE on the screen and nothing show up. The cursor just blinks.
