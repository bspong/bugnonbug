After a few hour of surfing, or a few hour of idling [e.g. overnight] FF3.03 will no longer load any new page nor will it reload/refresh already open pages.

This doesn't appear to be a memory leak in the classic sense.

Sometimes I will get a "warning" of sort -- website with heavy java will load with multiple error per firebug... site like The Weather Channel will no longer play their streaming video. Other times, webpage will load a "skeleton" version of itself -- it load text and html, but no javascript element [at least that's how it look to these amateur eyes].

Clearing the normal cache will not fix the problem, usually closing the browser and running cccleaner will fix the problem. But other times, only a full reboot will get FF up and running again.

Its almost like there is a "memory leak" in the java platform... it get "clogged" and won't allow any more info to flow into FF.

Disabling all av/as/firewalls make no difference.

Any ideas?
