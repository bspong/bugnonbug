Whenever I go to my Netscape ISP (netscape.com) Email service, I can still reply to Emails from others, but can no longer compose NEW Emails (under "Compose")! This problem only happens with Build 1.5, and doe NOT happen with Build 1.07 (which I have currently gone back to because of this). Under "Compose", 1.5 still allows me to write-in the address and heading, but will NOT allow me to move a cursor into the message block in order to begin an Email. I am unable to move a cursor into the message area with either a mouse OR the keyboard! I switched back and forth from 1.07 to 1.5 several time to test this, and 1.5 continually blocked me from composing a message, whereas 1.07 had no problems!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign into netscape.com Email.
2. Click "Compose".
3. Write-in sendee's Email address and subject heading (optional).
4. Attempt to move cursor into message area of Email.

Actual Results:
I am unable to get a cursor into the message area in order to write an Email, either by mouse or keyboard. This happens whether or not I have already written-in the sendee's address and subject heading at the top (Step #3 is therefore unnecessary in order to reproduce the problem).

Expected Results:
The 1.5 software should have allowed me to place a cursor into the message area so that I could begin to write an Email!

I contacted Netscape ISP Help about this problem, and they said that it wa a browser malfunction and not a problem on their end.
