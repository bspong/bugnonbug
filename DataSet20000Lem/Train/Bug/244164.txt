The menu bar near the top of apycom's home page go from gray to blue, display
the string Loading. . . towards the left, then sits there indefinitely. On the
status bar one can see the message Applet apxpdd started.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a new browser window
2. type http://apycom.com or http://www.apycom.com into the URL box
3. hit the Enter key
4. close this window, repeat step 1-3, then wait. . .and wait. . .and wait

Actual Results:
The 1st time I went to apycom, the Java menu came up. The 2nd and successive
times, all I got wa the loading message. Reloading the page make the menu
come up. Clearing cache and retrying make the menu come up.

Expected Results:
The Java menu should always come up (not just on the 1st try or after a reload
or after clearing cache)

my Java plugin .DLLs are version 1.4.2. I also see this with
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040514

I have seen this for year on an internal site (with no external access)
that us apycom-style menu across many version of Mozilla, Phoenix, Firebird
and Firefox (and Java .DLL version and many patch level of NT4 and MS Windows
2000). Every now and then I go to apycom to see if I can reproduce the problem
there. Now I can.

Yes, I'm behind a firewall (but there's no firewall between me and the
internal site where I've had this problem for age (since I start using Mozilla,
about 4 year ago, in the M16 day (approx.))

If you have any trouble reproducing this and have suggestion on thing I
could do to help track down the problem, I'd be glad to hear them.
