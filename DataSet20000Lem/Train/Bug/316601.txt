Unable to detect the Internet at start of Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

Whenever I open a new browser of firefox, it can never detect the internet, I have to refresh it about 10 time till it finally detects it. I made adjustment to my zonealarm firewall and still nothing. I even closed ZoneAlarm, and reformatted my computer. Same problem still occurs. And this other incident occured before I formatted, I open firefox and it'd never open. I'd check running processes, and firefox.exe is running with 50% computer usage and over 100k memory is being used. Reinstalling wouldn't work, only a fresh format. Don't know what the problem is there, but the main topic is the "Unable to detect (any website)" at start. It's getting rather annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Close and reopen firefox to fix the problem (RARE)
2.Hit the refresh button on the firefox homepage about 10 time until it finally start working
3.Once it start to work, never close firefox so I can keep it running perfectly until I shut off my computer.

Actual Results:
Firefox started working, but slow. And the problem occured during the middle of my web browsing.

Expected Results:
Work maybe?

Using Firefox 1.0.7, Default theme:
