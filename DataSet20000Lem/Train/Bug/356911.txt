de-hibernation infinite loop of firefox, mozilla, netscape
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

Problem applies to:
- XP-home & XP professional
- Firefox (all versions), Mozilla & Netscape 7.2 and earlier
- IBM, Fujitsu, Dell, HP, etc. machine
When one of these browser (or a combination of them) is used when one stop the machine via hibernation then one ha a fair chance that they enter infinite loop when the machine is de-hibernated. If so they will consume all cpu cycle and on older machine it may take upto 15 minute before the user get control back of the machine - obviously then squashing the run away process in the Task Manager.

Reproducible: Sometimes



Expected Results:
Perhaps the browser process are not always stopped properly; perhaps their saved info get damaged by MS; perhaps they recover erroneously. Who knows?
Perhaps it is caused by defective disclosure by MS about hibernation.
And if one is paranoid enough this could be deliberate ....

I have reported this problem >>>for years<<< to different vendors, but they do not want to deal with it. They are only willing to deal with IE problem ....
