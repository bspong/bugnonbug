Websites I can normally load perfectly are loading with strange size and dimensions, sometimes too small to read, sometimes too large to fit the screen

When I visit hulu.com the web page component are all too large, overlapping the page, and I can't use the site. On the other side, if I visit Netflix, everything is too small to even read. I am a supporter, advocate and long time use of firefox and mozilla, and want to stay with this browser, any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I have also experienced more random crash than usual, and the browser is usually unable to reload the closed tabs.

Thank You

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
I open the browser, enter the url (examples: hulu.com and netflix.com) and the screen show up disproportionately.

Expected Results:
The same

Displayed the website in regular size and proportion to the screens, a it ha always done up until a few week ago. I may have automatically updated my browser to the latest version right before, I can't be certain a it happens automatically.
