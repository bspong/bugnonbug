The new visual style of error page implemented in Bug 982347 look really sweet and good, but there's this little thing bugging me.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Get an error message page - for example by disconnecting your computer from network and performing a network action in Firefox.
2. Move cursor over the "Try Again" button.

Expected results:
Cursor doesn't change (keeps "cursor: default" CSS).

Actual results:
Cursor change to a "hand" pointer (has "cursor: pointer" CSS).


Likely, this is determined by Project Chameleon at http://people.mozilla.org/~jgruen/chameleon/#nav1. Then again, the project page clearly say it's a work in progress, so this should be a subject to (discuss to) change.

The "Try Again" button shouldn't use Pointer a a hover cursor. A button is a button, not a link.

Every operating system us the standard cursor for button - even some website (if they have their own button styling, like Google) and all web browser - including Internet Explorer, both old&new Opera, and Google Chrome do. There's no reason to go against the crowd now - and not ever.

I'd also like to point out that Firefox's inContent preference styling us the default cursor for button too (which is good).
