I've encountered people who don't like HTML5 context menu feature and would like to turn it off, because it may change their normal workflow with mouse (when fast-clicking RMB and Back/Forward). However, there is no way to get rid of this feature.

Therefore, I propose a few change that may possibly satisfy these users.

1. Add a config switch to enable/disable HTML5 context menu
People who don't like this feature could simply turn it off. After all, since none of other browser support it, it's hardly something that could break websites' basic functionality.
(boolean) html5.contextmenus.enabled
- true - enable HTML5 context menu (enabled)
- false - disable

2. (Add a config switch to) Move HTML5 menuitems to the bottom of the context menu
HTML5 menu item are currently added to the top of the menu, which may surprise some people, a they may expect classic "Back", "Forward", and "Reload/Stop" command there. Moving the HTML5 menuitems would likely cause far le confusion new users.
(boolean) html5.contextmenus.place_at_top
- true - place HTML5 context menu at the top of the context menu (default, nothing change from current behavior)
- false - place at bottom

3. If HTML5 context menu item present, open context menu with a vertical indentation
Context menu with HTML5 menuitems would open a few pixel higher from mouse cursor, a seen in the attachment

4. Combine previous suggestion
(integer) html5.contextmenus
- 0 - disabled
- 1 - enabled, place at top (default)
- 2 - enabled, place at bottom
- 3 - enabled, place at top, open context menu with indentation

5. Assign classnames to HTML5 menuitems
Currently, HTML5 menuitems don't have any class name nor unique ID, making it impossible for people to just hide these menu item with userChrome.css. Assigning these menu item their class name would make this possible (example: menuitem.pagemenu {display: none;}).
