Can't print to a network printer.

I installed Firefox 1.0 last week. There are two printer on my home network.
One printer is directly connected to one of the PCs and work fine. The other
printer (HP LaserJet 5) is connected to a Dlink Dl704P-B1 router. Once Firefox
installed that printer began misbehaving. Now when I try to print a document,
from either PC, the first page contains what appears to be printer commands,
then the document prints. Unfortunalely, when printed the document is missing
text, character are over-printed and sometimes, depending on the document,
strange character are included. If the same document is printed on the
directly connected printer (HP LaserJet 6100 all-in-one) it is fine. I
disconnected the LaserJet 5 printer from the network and connected it directly
to a PC then it printed the document correctly. Also, I downloaded and
installed all new printer driver but that did not help. Lastly, I download and
installed the current software version for the DLink router but that did not
help. I used Microsoft's "Add / Remove" software to remove Firefox from one of
the PCs but that did not help. Also I noticed Firefox doe not come with an
uninstall feature to remove / reset Registry changes. My suspicion is that
Firefox changed a setting in the Registry not expecting to come in contact with
a faily old HP LaserJet 5 printer. In the grand scheme of thisgs this problem
is probably consided "Normal" however, because of the way these printer are
used to run a business, not having that other printer ha a major impact and is
causing considerable cost to the business.
