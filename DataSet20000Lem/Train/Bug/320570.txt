need short term solution to allow user to remove a search plugin
Until bug 232272 is resolved (likely to be Firefox 2) a short term solution is required to help user remove unwanted search plugins. We're seeing a lot more people adding search plugins and then asking to remove them, probably due to the increased promotion of that function for the Firefox 1.5 release.

The solution should be lightweight, require minimal l10n work (or none if we can manage that) and be easy to document so that we can create a page on addons.mozilla.org that tell people how to do it.

Some suggestions:

1) add a delete item to context menu on the search plugin drop down

- pros: easy, consistent with other remove metaphor in UI
- cons: context menu on drop-downs == danger! danger! in XUL

2) support use of the delete/backspace key when a search plugin is highlighted in the drop down list

- pros: easy, no l10n
- cons: not very discoverable

3) add a "Remove Engines..." that show a dialog which list the plugins,
allows a user to pick one and click "remove"

.------------------------------------------------.
| Select a search engine to remove |
| .--------------------------------. |
| | [F] Foo Search | [ Remove ] |
| | [B] Bar Search | |
| | | |
| | | |
| '--------------------------------' |
| [ OK ] |
'------------------------------------------------'

- pros: best UE and discoverability
- cons: we'd need l10n on this starting RFN

(In all case we need to consider the question of what happens when someone try to remove the Google or Yahoo! search plugins, and then want to get them back.)

Shaver point out that we should probably start doing l10n on this piece right away, a it's low cost if we end up not using it and we don't want it to become the barrier once we close on a solution. Axel, could we get you to work on the following re-usable entities?
* "Delete %s?"
* "Remove %s?"
* "Remove"
* "Delete" <-- I'll bet this one is already done
* "Remove Engines ..."
* "Select a search engine to remove"
