I do not use Adobe Acrobat. I'm using the default Debian Lenny install, which I think is relying on Evince or similar for pdf viewing.

A single pdf can be opened in a tab and it will appear in the browser and work perfectly. However, if you try to open a second pdf in another tab, without closing the first pdf, then a new window is spawned outside of the browser which lack a title bar at the top and which therefore is not minimizable or movable. It must be closed with the File | Close option (and one cannot even click Alt-F to get that menu to open, you have to mouse-click on "File."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a pdf in one tab.
2.Don't close that pdf/tab.
3.Attempt to open another pdf in a second tab.
Actual Results:
Second pdf doe not appear in browser, but in a separate window that lack a title bar.

Expected Results:
Second pdf should have appeared within the browser window.
