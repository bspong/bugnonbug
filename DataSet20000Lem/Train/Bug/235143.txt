GTK2 Firefox build should allow LTR button order
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040119

With the Mozilla suite, GTK2 build use RTL (Cancel/OK) button order and GTK1
build use LTR (OK/Cancel) button order. This is a good system because the GTK2
build are consistent with Gnome and the GTK1 build are consistent with all
other desktop environments.

However, with Firefox, both the GTK2 AND the GTK1 build use RTL button order.
Firefox still look very consistent in Gnome, but it now look like an alien
application if you use it in any other desktop environment, such a (but not
limited to) KDE.

This is not intended to be a discussion of the merit of one button order or
desktop over another. This is really just a simple usability bug if you choose
to use Mozilla on a non-Gnome desktop.

The Mozilla suite ha already addressed this issue in what I feel is the correct
manner (a GTK2 build for Gnome, a GTK1 build for everyone else). I'd simply
like to see this logic extended to Firefox.

I've rated the severity of this bug "Major" because this cause a marked
decrease in usability when moving from Mozilla to Firefox on Linux. Feel free
to modify this.
