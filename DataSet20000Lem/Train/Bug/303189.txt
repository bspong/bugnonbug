The userContent.css approach to browser pane appearance seems... erratic.
Below I describe: what I want to achieve, how I think thing might work better,
and an example of failed attempts.

What I would like to achieve is: my preferred font and text colour on any web
page, and my preferred background image (or even colour)! Choosing the "always
use my colours" setting get a lot of this, but it is no substitute for being
able to free use CSS to do stuff.

It appears to me that when a page is loaded, the userContent ha some effect on
the subsequent style, but that not everything applies and what doe apply may
be overriden by page style. I feel that there should be two content style sheets;
one applied before page content, setting preferred default style, and a second
applied "over" any page content, to override arbitrary specific thing at will.
Further, there should perhaps be a third ur-style sheet applied before anything
that is a compluted sheet driven of the Preferences settings. However, it should
still be computed and saved in the browser profile directory when preference
are adjusted
a an elucidation of the actual concrete effect and a setting would cause.
That would get you working example for free for user to examine.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
A few of my poor flailings follow:
firstly, it is necessary to turn off the "always use my colours" setting
to get anywhere. Ok. Here is my current inoperative userContent.css, embellished
on an example from the Tips pages.

/* Obviate need to zoom on many sites. */
html>body {
font-size: 100% !important;
line-height: normal !important;
background-color: inherit !important;
background-image:
url("file:///home/cameron/var/cache/file/e2/e8d2c88ca204333e1564464746974c.png")
!important;
}

body {
background-image:
url("file:///home/cameron/var/cache/file/e2/e8d2c88ca204333e1564464746974c.png")
!important;
}

That PNG is a dark wallpaperish image.
It never applies.

I've set background-color to yellow (to be really obvious), and it
applies, and is then overridden by page CSS. There seems no way to set it for
everything.




Expected Results:
Effective control of the page background and colours.
