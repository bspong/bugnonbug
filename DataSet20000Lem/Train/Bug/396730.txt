Firefox will not open until the stop script option is clicked and then it is painfully slow

When I click on the Firefox icon, the busy light go on and after several minute a dialog appears which says, "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script right now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete." Following that are two button labelled "Stop SCript" and "Continue" If I choose "Continue" the busy light continues and Firefox never open (and I have waited 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes). If I choose "Stop Script" the busy light pop a few time and Firefox opens.

I have re-installed Firefox (latest build) three time for the same results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on icon (double click left button) or right click and choose "Open"
2. Wait a few minute and dialog appears to stop or continue script
3. Choose stop and Firefox open or choose "Continue" and one might a well open IE by Microsoft

Identify the script trying to execute. BTW, I have the latest update Antivirus by McAfee and it doe not detect a malevolent script.
