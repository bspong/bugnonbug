Inputting character using a non-roman input method result in no character or improper letter being put into the text field. This is a new bug. It doe not exist in FireFox v2.0.0.16 or in Safari v3.1.2.

This is on Mac OS X v10.5.4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to sample URL (http://www.tizag.com/pics/flash/form1easy.swf)
2. In FireFox v3 try to input character in a Flash textfield using Japanese or Korean input method
Actual Results:
No text show in the text field

Expected Results:
Appropriate Japanese/Korean character show in the textfield.

This is *not* a bug in Adobe Flash. Using Flash 9 on FireFox v2.0.0.16 at the same website, this bug doe not manifest. It seems that it wa injected into FireFox code in the v3 development cycle.

Note that this look like a duplicate of bug #357670, however I can reproduce this on the most recently posted (29 July, 2008) build of FireFox v3.

This may also be related to bug #442660.
