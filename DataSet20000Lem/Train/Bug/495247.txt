(on fedora 10) After hibernate/resume (software suspend) audio doesn't work unless I kill firefox and restart
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042708 Fedora/3.0.10-1.fc10 Firefox/3.0.10
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.5 Beta 4 (firefox-3.5b4.tar.bz2 downloaded early May 2009. Still current I think.)

Problem occurs while using this version of Fedora10 2.6.27.21-170.2.56_1.cubbi_tuxonice.fc10.i686 (tuxonice instead of normal suspend). Everything work fine with Firefox en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042708 Fedora/3.0.10-1.fc10.
But with Firefox 3.5b4 if I try to run a video with sound, or an audio recording, the sound doe not work properly. For a while it is silent, then I get what sound like a repeated syllable, a bit like a cracked gramophone record. If I kill firefox and restart it, everything is fine, till after the next hibernate/resume. I gave up using FF3.5 for this reason.
(In case it is relevant, I have removed pulseaudio. It ha never worked for me.
I am not the only one!)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.hibernate linux while firefox 3.5 is running
2.reboot-resume.
3.try playing something with sounds, e.g. BBC news videos.
Actual Results:
Sound doesnt work. It's hard to describe the symptom, but most of the soundtrack is lost and it is a if some tiny part of it is just being repeated. First time it happened I thought the video file wa corrupted.

Expected Results:
Sound should work, a it doe in FF 3.0.10

When video can't play in firefox I have no problem using mplayer or vlc to play thing that I have on my hard drive. It affect only firefox. Sounds a if some recently added part of FF providing integrated resource for audio need to be made hibernate-resume aware.
