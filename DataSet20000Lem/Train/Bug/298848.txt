KDE provides a well thought-out and efficient mean of accessing file outside
of the root file system. For example, KDE application can open up and save
file to un-mounted Floppy, Network (SMB, SSH, FTP), and other Storage Media.
Currently, Firefox can't take advantage of these capability because it “Open
File” and “Save As” dialog only see the root filesystem (in other words, only
what's currently mounted).

It would be very nice for Firefox to use the native KDE “Open File” and “Save
As” dialog box because it is much more flexible and customizable than the
current Firefox dialog boxes. After all, Firefox ha always used the native
Windows file-accessing dialog box when running under Windows, so it should use
the KDE counterpart when running under KDE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use K Desktop Environment (KDE)
2.Click on File -> Open File
3.Click on File -> Save As

Actual Results:
A limited dialog box show up that *cannot*:
1)Access file outside of the filesystem
2)Rename any file

Expected Results:
Wish to see the powerful native KDE filde dialog that *can*:
1)Access file outside of the filesystem
2)Rename file
3)Be customized

Here's a screenshot of the native KDE "Open File" dialog (preferred):
