Mozilla 0.6 doe not exhibit this behavior.

Local web page served by Apache. Page is just a simple title and 11 link to
stuff on my hard drive. (Page can be provided upon request.)

This doe not happen with any other browser I have tried (Mozilla, Netscape,
Opera, Omniweb, Safari, or iCab. Disinclined to believe it is a problem with my
home page since is work correctly with all those other browsers, and if typed in.

Let me know what else you need to reproduce this problem. (Is there a way to
attach the web page or should I just paste it in this info box.
