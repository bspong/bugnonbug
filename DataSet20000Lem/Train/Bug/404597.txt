I downloaded and installed firefox 3 on OS X 10.4
I opened up one firefox window in my primary monitor (external monitor on laptop)
I then opened a new firefox window to drag to my secondary monitor (laptop monitor)
I attempted to type a URL into the address bar in the 2nd window (on secondary monitor) and I couldn't

I typed in first window - no problem
Drag the second window back to primary monitor - can type again, drag back to secondary monitor - can't type

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) open firefox in primary monitor
2) create a new firefox window
3) drag new window to secondary monitor
4) try to type URL into secondary window on secondary monitor
Actual Results:
No ability to type in Address bar, Google Search box or any form element on web page within secondary window

Expected Results:
Normal functionality of browser

Performed on MacBook Pro (intel) running OS X 10.4
External monitor = Dell LCD, functioning a Primary Monitor
Laptop Monitor = functioning a secondary monitor
