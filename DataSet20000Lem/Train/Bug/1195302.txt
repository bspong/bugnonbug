Using the inspector trigger CSP violation report

Steps to reproduce:

If you set up CSP on a website without style-src 'unsafe-inline', the Firefox inspector send a LOT of CSP notifications, kind of :

{
"csp-report": {
...
"script-sample": "top:62px;left:720px;",
...
}
}

I’ve set up a testpage here, all CSP notification on it are sent to report-uri /csp-parser.php and put into a database.

Here are the step to understand the issue:

1) Open http://csp.nicolas-hoffmann.net/
2) The page is going to generate a unique id, ex http://csp.nicolas-hoffmann.net/?id=foo
3) Wait some seconds. The page doesn't find any notification in the database.
4) Now inspect the page with Firefox inspector, please highlight some elements.
5) Close the inspector
6) Refresh the page with the id you have : http://csp.nicolas-hoffmann.net/?id=foo
7) It is going to find a lot of CSP errors.


Actual results:

A lot of CSP notification are sent to report-uri.


Expected results:

I suppose that it shouldn't send CSP notification (they are not shown in the console). I've tested the same step on Chrome, Opera, Edge, it didn't send any CSP notification.

If you set up email notification instead of database, if somebody open the firefox inspector on a page, you can receive 100 email by minute, especially annoying when you use it to remove inline-styles :-\
