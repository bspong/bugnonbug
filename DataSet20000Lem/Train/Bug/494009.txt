The Gmail Voice and Video chat plugin, that allows video chat in Gmail, doe not work on the latest trunk build. It work on the branch nightly and in Firefox 3.0.10

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install this plugin from Google: http://mail.google.com/videochat
2. Log into Gmail with chat enabled and with a webcam
Actual Results:
1. On Minefield, the video chat doe not load. With a camera connected, the chat icon is a green dot (which is normal for no camera). It should be a camera icon. Going into settings, under the chat tab, Gmail cannot detect a camera
2. In Firefox 3.0.10 and on the branch, it load the video plugin properly

Expected Results:
The video plugin should work

I don't know if this regressed or if it wa something that never worked. I rarely have a camera plugged in, so I haven't been up to date on this.

I do know that it is not because of browser sniffing. I changed the user agent to Firefox 3.0.10 and it still did not work. (It work in Firefox stable)

Do we have a contact at Google who can look at this? i doubt it is a google problem, since it work on Shiretoko builds. And it's difficult because I don't have a regression range.
