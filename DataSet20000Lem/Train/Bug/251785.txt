random crashing/hanging whenever I view a comment page on LiveJournal
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040716 Firefox/0.9.1+

It seems to be completely random, but on LiveJournal when I view a comment
page, Mozilla Firefox will hang and I have to force quit it to be able to
continue. Sometimes after a simple restart of the program, it will begin to
work, but for the most part it will typically always crash. This ha happened
since Mozilla Firefox 0.9, 0.9.1, and 0.9.2. I uninstalled 0.9.2 today and
downloaded the latest nightly GDI build of Firefox, which is called 0.9.1+ ...
It still hangs.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Maybe do some random web surfing
2. Simply visit a LiveJournal comment page, and it will hang. At least it
doe for me.

Actual Results:
Mozilla Firefox will hang. It will appear to display the comment page, but
then it will simply freeze and not display the entire page. Some speculate
that it is because of the new quick-reply function that LiveJournal ha
embedded into their journal specifications.

Expected Results:
It should have showed the entire page loading all images. The quick-reply
dialogue box should open when clicking the "reply" button on any comment page.

I'm using the default theme for Firefox. I do not beleive I am using any
extension because I am working with a clean install.
