Does not display page correctly when compared with Internet Explorer 6
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Firefox version 1.0

When I try to access the above URL firefox seems to hang. After a long time
(compared with IE), part of the page displays. This is unusual because it
doesn't work and because firefox is usually much faster than IE.

A useful experiment is to run Firefox and IE at the same time to access the URL
and watch what happens.

Note that this page cannot be accessed at all unless I set the "User Agent
Switcher" add-on to "Internet Explorer".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the "User Agent Switcher" to "Internet Explorer" in the Tools menu.
2. Enter the URL in the address window and hit return
3. wait
4. bad result

Actual Results:
Firefox displayed the page incorrectly when compared to IE.

Expected Results:
It should have displayed the page data that IE displayed.

I wa trying to access the Microsoft MSDN page to get information about a
programming problem. I have seen this sort of thing before when I try to access
Microsoft web sites.

I feel that this is a major bug because it cannot display a standard URL and
because I am forced to use IE to get this information. I strongly prefer to use
firefox.
