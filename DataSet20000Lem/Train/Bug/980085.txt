Hosting strategy for App Manager template
We want to be able to open template in the App Manager to kick start app creation.

Problem: what's the best strategy to

a) make it easy to open template directly there
b) make it easy for more people to contribute with their own templates-thus fostering a good community

Or in Axel's words, these would be the requirements:

1) The ability for Mozilla to curate a collection of template
2) The ability of developer to be able to try out the template directly on a phone without having to download and deploy first
3) the ability of third parties, especially dev UI framework developer to publish template
4) The ability to access to those template in the App manager
5) The ability to download those template from a desktop browser


And these are the possible hosting option we've discussed so far:

a) Put template in a CDN
b) Put template in Marketplace


Advantages and disadvantage of each one:

a) Put template in a CDN:

This mean we would have a series of *really good* and curated template file (in ZIP format) plus probably a .json file that we'd upload to a server --this would be a pretty similar mechanism to what we're using right now for the prototype.

Advantages:
- straightforward
- we have a mozilla CDN already, we'd need to speak to the right people
- for non official templates, anyone can upload template to their server and through the "magic template detection mechanism" we can get app manager to open them

Disadvantages:
- vetoing process sort of slow/manual
- only mozilla can upload there
- community member have to host their own template somewhere
- discovery opportunity are limited-there won't be a central "treasure trove of templates" unless we maintain a page in MDN linking to the best of the best
- we'd need some sort of "template detection" mechanism so Firefox/Chrome know we want to open certain link with App Manager. Namely protocol handlers.


b) Put template in Marketplace

Anyone would be able to upload template to the Marketplace just a if they were a normal app, via the "my apps" section, and put them under a new "Templates" category. Somehow, we will be able to download these zip file from the Marketplace and import them into App Manager.

Advantages:
- Any one can upload
- Discovery could be easier, more casual, with people finding the template while browsing in the marketplace
- We leverage Marketplace's CDN/hosting system/experience
- Also, let the community decide what are the best template by download numbers/ratings (whatever is the marketplace algorithm)

Disadvantages:
- People who download everything ever are probably going to download one of these template and get very confused when they don't understand what it does. Expect bad rating for otherwise good templates.
- We complicate the Marketplace codebase to allow for this exception: apps uploaded a template should offer a direct "download" link
- Another exception: probably reviewer should not review these template even though they will often be privileged.

I might be probably missing something. Please add your concise thought here!
