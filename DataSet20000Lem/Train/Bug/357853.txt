when passing the commandline argument "-new-tab <url>" to firefox, the <url> will not be loaded if there is no existing browser window (browser window being the main window (tabs, webpage etc)).

the same thing happens if the download/addon/etc window(s) are open, but there is no existing browser window.

the result of passing the "-new-tabs <url>" commandline argument to firefox in these case result in a browser window being opened to the default home page; the <url> is not loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. close all firefox main browser window (you can leave the download/addon/etc window open if you like)
2. run firefox with the "-new-tabs <url>" commandline (replace <url> with your favourite url ;)
3. watch your home page appear :(

Actual Results:
new browser window is created containing the user home page

Expected Results:
a new browser window should appear that contains the <url> specified on the command line
