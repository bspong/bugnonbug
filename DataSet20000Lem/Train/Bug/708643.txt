If Firebug is installed, using "Inspect Element" twice result in 2 inspectors, one uncloseable.

Uncloseable inspector on top of google.ca

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_7) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.121 Safari/535.2

Steps to reproduce:

Aurora version 10.0a2

1. Loaded a page
2. Right click -> Inspect Element
3. Right click -> Inspect Element again
4. Exit the inspector using X on the inspector bar.


Actual results:

After step 3, a new inspector appears on top of the old one.

After step 4, the inspector bar disappears but the screen remains greyed out and the inspector box and bubble remains visible. Reloading the page doesn't help. Running Inspector again doesn't help. Visiting another page cause the screen to remain greyed out with the inspector box and bubble.


Expected results:

After step 3, I expect the element to appear in the existing inspector.

After step 4, I expect the inspector to disappear.

I've only been able to reproduce this problem using a confidential internal application. I can visit another page after step 4, and I will attach a screenshot of what that look like (and another with 2 inspectors.)
