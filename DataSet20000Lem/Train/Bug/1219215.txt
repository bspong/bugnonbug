Closing tab disappears immediately, and that (for 200ms) cause mouse action to apply to parent element (<tabs>). See STR

video - scenario (A) unexpected movement of tabs.webm

STR: (Win7_64, Nightly 44, 32bit, ID 20151027030239, new profile)
1. Open new firefox window.
2. Open enough tab to cause overflow in tab toolbar. Open ~5 more tabs. Scroll tab list to the end
3. Move mouse pointer over the 3rd tab from the _end_ (actually you can try any tab except last one)
4. Move mouse pointer between tab start and tab title start (there's about 5-10px)
5.A) Middle-click where the pointer is placed, then (you've got 200ms of tab width transition)
move pointer towards the next tab (within tab toolbar).
5.B) Middle-click where the pointer is placed, then (you've got 200ms of tab width transition)
middle-click again.

Result: A) 3rd tab from the end closed, and tab moved to the end of scrollable area (<tabs>)
B) 3rd tab from the end closed, and new active tab opened at the end of tab list

Expectations: A) Tab from Step 3 should close, but tab shouldn't move to the end of scrollable area
B) Tab from Step 3 should close, and no other tab should open or close

Note: It worked fine in Fx28-. I wanted to file this _ANNOYING_ bug long time ago, but didn't know
how to describe what I saw. NOW I know exactly what this bug is, and how to fix it, so filing it.

Possible fix: I tested this CSS using extension "Stylish" and it wa OK.
> .tab-background:not([pinned]):not([fadein])
> {
> transition: visibility 230ms ease-out 0s;
> }
230ms is required because of these rules:
> .tabbrowser-tab:not([pinned])
> {
> transition: min-width 200ms ease-out 0s, max-width 230ms ease-out 0s;
> }
> .tabbrowser-tab:not([pinned]):not([fadein])
> {
> max-width: 0.1px;
> min-width: 0.1px;
> visibility: hidden;
> }
Tab's width smoothly change from 100px (or more) to 0.1px. The bug described above make it clear that closing tab should stay visible during that transition. So I used the same transition-duration.

Fx20 worked nice, and it behavior looked exactly like this solution. I think that somewhere between 28 and 31 that visibility transition wa removed during Australis development. That wa wrong decision.
If current mock-up strictly tell that closing tab must not look hovered - it can be fixed with by CSS:
> .tabbrowser-tab:not([pinned]):not([fadein])
> {
> opacity: 0;
> }
