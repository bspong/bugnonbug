When having the print-dialog open in one browser window, if you try to open a file "Opening xxx, You have chosen to open..", you can't click on any of the buttons.

Having two firefox window open, one with the "print" dialog open. In the other
window, if you do some appropiate action to get the
"Opening <filename.xyz>"
"You have choosen to open
<icon> <filename.xyz>
--- ...
| What should firefox do with this file..
| Open With (...)
| Save to Disk
...
dialog, all the button will be "clickable" but will result in no action until
you close the printdialog.

I also tried this at a friend house who where using the latest RC, He had a
diffrent but still very odd problem when having the printer dialog open, the
file in the download manager wa there and started downloading, but it wa
"invisible" until he closed the printer dialog.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two firefox windows.
2. In window (1) open up the print dialog using <file->Print...>
3. In window (2) try to download/open any file that brings up the dialog in
question (See full details, don't know the name of it and it won't popup on all
file depending on your browser configuration)
4. Try to click any of the buttons.

Actual Results:
None of the button in the open dialog worked.

Expected Results:
The behavior should be the same a when not having any dialog open in another
browser window.
