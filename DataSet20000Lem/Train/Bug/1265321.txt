[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Install the latest Nightly 48.0a1

6. Choose any video and click on the Play button.
7. Click on the Enable DRM button that is located on the upper bar "You must enable DRM to play some audio or video on this page."


[Expected result]:
The Widevine CDM plugin should be enabled and the video should start playing.

[Actual result]:
The Widevine plugin is not enabled, the "Whoops, something went wrong message" is displayed stating there is a missing component and the upper "You must enable DRM..." bar is displayed over and over.

[Additional notes]:
When video are ran through Primetime CDM and the plug-in is disabled, clicking on the "Enable DRM" button from the upper "You must enable DRM..." bar, enables the plugin.
