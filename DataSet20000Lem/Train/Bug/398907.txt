Firefox save wrong window restore size while closing a maximized window.
Firefox save wrong window restore size and window position while closing a maximized window.

Current logic is making restore window button useless. Which is too irritating.

This wa tested on windows.

Steps:-
1. Exit Firefox, to close all Firefox instance.
2. Re-Start Firefox, to get a single Firefox window.
3. Re-Size window to 60% size of screen display.
4. Reposition window 10% away from top and left.
6. Exit Firefox, then Re-Start Firefox.
7. You can see Firefox remember window state,
size and position correctly.
(ie, restore state, size 60%, 10% from top/left)
6. Now Maximize window, by clicking window maximize button.
(remember not to change position/size
when it is still in restore state)
7. Exit Firefox, then Re-Start Firefox.
8. You can see Firefox in Maximized window state,
ie, Firefox remember window state correctly.
9. Now click Restore Button.

Result:-
--------
You can see
* size is almost 100% of screen size
* position almost left, top of screen size

Expected:-
---------
* size 60% of screen size
* position at 10% from top/left of screen.



What to be done:-
---------------
We should use following common logic.

function onExitApplication(){
switch(window.state){

'maxmized' :
save_window_state('maxmized');
break;

'normal' : /*ie, restored state*/
save_window_state('normal');
save_window_size(window.width, window.height);
save_window_position(window.left, window.top);
break;

'minimized' :
'systray' :
default :
/*save nothing*/
}
}
