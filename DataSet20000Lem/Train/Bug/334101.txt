After the automatic update last night I started experiencing delay of around 20-30 second before page start to load after clicking links. Just before each page start loading I get a message from Trend Micro PC-Cillin Internet security 2006 that "The web site you accessing cannot be rated. A server or connection error occurred. Check you Internet connection and try again." Then teh page load correctly. Pages with Ads will bring this up more than once.
I'm using Windows XP Media Centre Edition Version 2002 Servic Pack 2 76487-OEM-0080686-12401.
Just before posting this it seemed to resolve itself after doing it consistently for several hours. }:-|

I have a 512kbs ADSL connection.
This is so frustrating I've switched back to Opera, which is not affected for the time being. Fire fox is basically unuseable while it doing this. I'll reboot and see if it recurrs. I haven't worked out yet if I can easily post an update but if I can I will. In about 20 hour I will be away for a week.
