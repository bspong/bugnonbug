I click on Tools->Downloads and the dialog doe not appear. I've tried to close Firefox and restart, but it still doesn't show up.

I started to download Mandriva Linux before i upgraded, i upgraded and when it reopened, i tried to resume my download. As stated earlier, the dialog doe not appear, but i'm downloading at capacity, so the download functionality is there.

I just tried to download another file and i get the following error:
C:\Users\Charles\AppData\Local\Temp\wkDm8GdO.exe.part could not be saved, because the source file could not be read.

Try again later, or contact the server administrator.
