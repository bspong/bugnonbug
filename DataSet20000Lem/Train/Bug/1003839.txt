Reproducible on:
* Windows 7 64-bit [1],
* Mac OS X 10.8 [2],
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 32-bit [3],
using Firefox 30 Beta 1 (Build ID: 20140428174145), Aurora 31.0a2 (2014-04-30) and Nightly 32.0a1 (2014-04-30)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Enable the bookmark toolbar.
3. Access the following URL: https://blog.mozilla.org/feed/
4. Press the "Subscribe" button then choose "Cancel".

Expected result:
The subscription to that specific website is cancelled.

Actual result:
The subscription is made despite being cancelled and a live bookmark is added to the bookmark toolbar.

This is a far a I got without building locally.

I suspect it might have been caused by:
