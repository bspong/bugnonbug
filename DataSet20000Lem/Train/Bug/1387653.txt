Some issue with tab separator

Steps to reproduce:

(Please ignore the 'steps to reproduce,' 'actual results,' 'expected results' headings, if any, on this bug)

0) Switch to the Light theme because it make the issue more noticeable.

1) Hover over an unselected tab. This make it separator (the 1px vertical pipe `|` on it either end) disappear. This doesn't look very good, and doesn't match the interactive mockup.

2) Restore the window, make sure the menu bar is disabled and select any tab but the first one. This make the drag-able space to the left of the first tab (the 40px padding) look like it's a part of the first tab. In the interactive mockup, this issue is solved by adding a left separator to the first tab. See screenshot for quick comparison: http://i.imgur.com/Ux7caFU.png.

3) Restore the window and enable the menu bar. Now open a bunch of tab so that the tab now expand the width of the window (so in other words, open enough until they start shrinking). Now select any tab except the first and except the last one. The first tab doesn't have a left separator, but the last tab doe have a right separator. I think it shouldn't.

4) With the menu bar disabled again, maximize the window and select the first tab. This tab now ha a left separator, which doesn't look good. Now enable the menu bar again, restore the window, open enough tab for them to start shrinking and select the last tab. This tab now ha a right separator, which again look odd.

5) According to the interactive mockup, the tab separator in Photon are supposed to expand the full-height of the tab strip (i.e. without the current `border-image` applied to `.tabbrowser-tab::after, .tabbrowser-tab::before`) at all time except for when the window is restored with the `Extra Drag Space` option checked. The Invision mockup show this same design on some screen (e.g. https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/ZKBC94BPQ#/screens/229940646) while the Australis design on others (e.g. https://mozilla.invisionapp.com/share/ZKBC94BPQ#/screens/231292511). I think the full-height one look sharper, but if the latter is indeed the goal, please ignore this point.

6) Enable the menu bar. Now hover over a tab adjacent to the currently selected tab. The hovered tab look 1px shorter, because there is a 1px solid border-top on the selected tab (only) when the menu bar is enabled, but a colour to the border is only set for `.tab-background[selected=true]` (The interactive mockup ha this behaviour too, so maybe this is intended?). If the menu bar is disabled, but toggled through the ALT key, this issue doesn't exist (as expected) and thing look noticeably better. I'm curious why the top border is needed when the menu bar is enabled, because the active tab is already visually separated from it because of the distinct `.tab-line`. Also, this border ha the effect of making the `.tab-line` on the selected tab appear thicker than 2px (the 1px grey sort of merges with the 2px blue).

7) I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this, but I'm curious why any border were used for the selected tab. Because this mean that tab separator are now implemented in 2 ways: the selected tab's separator are it own border while all the other tab are still using pseudo-elements for the same. This result in thing like the issue (3) and (4) above requiring separate solutions, even though they appear to be the same on the surface.
