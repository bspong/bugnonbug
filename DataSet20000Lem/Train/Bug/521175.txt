Consumes lot of RAM (memory) when idle, return RAM when title bar clicked, with Yahoo mail

I noticed this morning that Firefox wa uising 2.4G of RAM this morning, according to top. I have 4G of RAM installed.

When I clicked on the title bar the wa Disk I/O for over 30 second and the RAM used dropped to le than 500 M.

I think this kind of behaviour ha happened before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave Firefox running overnight
2. (Look at top)
3. Click on title bar
4. (when disk I/O stops, check top again)
Actual Results:
Too much memory used, slows down system responsiveness, RAM recovered on clicking on titlebar (provably anything that give it focus)

Expected Results:
RAM consumption should not be excessive whem Firefox is essentially idle from the user perspective

I think (not sure) that the only tab open tab wa for Yahoo mail, and that I had fired up Firefox from a trminal logged in a another user. These fact 'should' not be relevent... (famous last words)
