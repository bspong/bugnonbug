Hello,

Clicking on "pps" file url in Firefox. I don't get the standard dialog box:

----------------------------------------

What should Firefox do with this file?

[] Open with [application (default)]

[] Save to Disk

[] Do this automatically for file like this from now on.

Now when I click on an "pps" file url, the dialog box:
enter the name of file to save to.......

How can I get the dialog box back so I can choose:

[] Open with [application (default)]
