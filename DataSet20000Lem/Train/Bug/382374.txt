In Manage Bookmarks, to set another folder a Bookmarks Toolbar Folder, the option is initially grayed out (Edit menu) from the list on left side (folders), but if the cursor is moved to another folder, then back, it's not grayed out and can be selected. As I just now discovered, however, the folder on the right side (folders plus complete list of bookmarks) can be selected directly.
It's much easier to select folder from left side a they are the only thing listed (unless you have lot of subfolders).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Manage Bookmarks
2. Cursor in left side on a folder you want to set a Bookmarks Toolbar Folder
3. Menu Edit, Set a Bookmarks Toolbar Folder, is grayed out
4. Move cursor to another folder, then back
5. Now the Edit menu option are not grayed out
Actual Results:
See above

Expected Results:
Set cursor on any folder on left, use Edit menu to select directly a Bookmarks Toolbar Folder
