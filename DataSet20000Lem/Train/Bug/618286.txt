The Minefield window control (Minimize, Maximize, and Close) are not redrawn when waking up from computer sleep mode. I CAN see and activate the orange Minefield menu. Also, Minefield take a while to restore the window preview when restoring from sleep mode. I had eight tab open and it took about 25 second for Minefield to redraw the window previews.

A screenshot is provided for the window controls.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate the World Wide Web.
2. Put your computer to sleep and read a book, do a crossword puzzle, or have a cup of coffee.
3. When you restore the computer from sleep mode, Minefield take a long time to regenerate window preview with very few tab open (about 30 second for 8 tabs) AND I cannot use the Minefield window control (Min, Max, Close).
Actual Results:
Window control are not redrawn.

Expected Results:
I should still be able to view and click on the Min, Max, and Close buttons.
