I use the onfocus event in javascript to successfully set the background colour of a select (combo) object in a form to yellow, so that tab navigation will highlight the select (combo) in firefox form a the user arrives at the select object. I use the onblur event to reset the background colour a they tab away from this object to a new component.

This work perfectly for input object (edits) but not for select (combo) objects. Althought the select object background colour is set OK, the dropdown arrow vanishes, even though clicking in the select area text will cause a dropdown action, and re-select any item ok. Also, if a NEW selection is made, suddenly the dropdown arrow re-appears, but loses any bolding originally applied, and the arrow appears small and weak.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create onfocus event for a select (combo) object or other object such a input (edit), to set background colour to yellow. This is stored in .js file and loaded in form onload event.

This function correctly us <object>.style.backgroundColor = <colour>.

2. Create onblur event for a select (combo) or input (edit) object to clear it background colour to white. This is also stored in same .js file and loaded in form onload event.

3. Create form and form objects, and attach onfocus and onblur event to each select (combo) or input (edit) object a needed. Set text attribute of select (combo) object to bold, for easier reading of text options.

4. Run form and focus on initial component in form onload event.

5. Tab between select (combo) and other object such a Input (edit) objects.

6. Note that all object now display yellow in background, but select (combo) object lose the dropdown arrow - but when changing the dropdown contents, the arrow returns, but any bold attribute is lost, and the arrow is smaller and weak to see.

Actual Results:
The select (combo) object correctly gain and lose the background colour specified (yellow) a the user tab to and from the select object, but the dropdown arrow are lost from all select object that we arrive at (tab in to), but if change with the mouse to a new option value, the dropdown arrow returns, but loses the original bold text attribute.


Expected Results:
1. Tabbbing into or mousing into a select (combo) object should have:

(1) Set the background colour to yellow and highlighted selected text with yellow background.

(2) Positioned to first text option.

(3) Shown the dropdown arrow to the right of the highlighted text.



The bug occurs with the default Firefox theme - no other theme were tried, in order to keep the form generic.
