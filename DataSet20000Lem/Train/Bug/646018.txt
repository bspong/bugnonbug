In some rare occasion the mouse click stop working in firefox 4.0 rc on mac osx. I could not reproduce nor have any idea what could trigger it. It happened twice in the 3 day since I installed firefox

The symptoms:
- muse click stop working in firefox. I mean the whole firefox not just the webpages, clicking on the tab dont change tabs, clicking on the menu do not open the menu, etc... nothing at all.
- the keyboard shortcut are still working properly, ctrl+tab switch tab, etc... so the firefox is not frozen
- the mouse work on the other running program or in the desktop at the same time, switching between programs, firefox no clicks, others fine
- only click affected, the movement of the mouse pointer is fine.

First time happened directly after the 4.0 RC install, when I updated the extension to 4.0 and restarted the firefox with the restart link on the extension manager, after the restart no mouse clicks. Quit firefox and start again solved it.

Second time happened when I opened the lid of the laptop waking it up (ff wa running when it went sleep) and started checking my email in google apps, few click wa fine and then suddenly from one click to another the click stopped working.
