runaway memory usage in both 3.0.7 and beta 3.1 beta 3

Looking at task manager this is just a bad a 3.0.7. All I see is more memory being eaten away in chunks. I think if this keep up I will switch to IE8. This problem seemed to have started with 3.0.7. The only way I can stop Firefox from crashing is to constantly restart it which is also a problem. It's a shame that Mozilla ha no real customer support. I did try all of the suggestion in high memory usage but nothing seemed to work. I have a 64 bit PC with 6 gig of ram and need to stop this problem once and for all. Until this problem started I could keep Firefox on 24/7 with no issues. Firefox will eventually crash if not attended to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just keep Firefox running
2. Minimize tag and problem continues
3. Task manager in Vista Ultimate start with around 66k and build quickly to 1,600k in a short time regardless of what is running. Removed most add on apps a well.
Actual Results:
Memory usage on task manager dropped back to 66k. In the past 20 minute memory ha increased to 113K and climbing. Runaway memory usage.

Expected Results:
Software on both beta 3.1 e and previously 3.0.7 should have stopped eating memory up. I do not recall this issue in 3.0.6.

I followed the direction in your FAQs on high memory usage doing an about:config and that did not work either. I cleared all cache and that did not help. I thought that the beta might cure the issue but it ha not. Is there a way of downloading 3.0.6 again if there is no other fix? I am also going to try this on my test notebook with Windows 7 to see if the problem persists. The test notebook ha 2 gig with 32 bit Intel. As I said before this bug seems to happen regardless of tab open. I wa using the Cape Kennedy theme with the space ship at night. I will try this with the default theme to see if that helps.
