Patch

The observer from UITour.jsm is very visible in profiles: https://perfht.ml/2noCrEC

This iterates over all the existing windows, and that loop seems to be O(n2) (this landed in bug 1126756).

This slow code run when receiving the message-manager-close notification, which is fired several time a a result of the tabbrowser updateBrowserRemoteness call.

This UITour code run because for each new browser window there are 3 UITour:onPageEvent notification with getConfiguration call for "sync", "appinfo" and "selectedSearchEngine".

I'm not sure what's causing these calls, I suspect it's self-support but haven't found the actual code yet.

It's very easy to make the performance impact disappear here by not initializing UITour when the page event is only a getConfiguration one (initialization doesn't matter in that case because we don't display anything in the browser, so nothing need to be uninitialized later). This is what the attached patch does.

But I think this deserves a bit more analysis.
