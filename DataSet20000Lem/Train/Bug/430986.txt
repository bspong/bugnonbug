The slider bar in the browser game Ikariam ha one too many slots, and the slider will not go all the way to the right. So if the slider should have 1 option, it "could" be slided to the point 2, but it won't go a far a that. Same thing whatever number you try, for example slider which should mark 300 slot ha a little space on the far right, because it ha 301 slot of which the biggest can't be used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open any slider in the game and try to move it a far a it can go.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
As I described, the slider will not go all the way and there's a small gap on the right side of the slider.

Expected Results:
Have had the exact number of slot in the slider, so it would've gone all the way to the right.

Theme is pitchdark, and on the older version (the latest FF2) this worked just fine.
