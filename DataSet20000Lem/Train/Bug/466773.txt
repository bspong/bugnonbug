I find it strange that a user ha the ability to uninstall existing addons in private browsing mode, and then finding them missing after restarting in normal mode. Shouldnt we disallow this to happen? It also work vice versa where you can install addons in PB mode, and they appear in normal mode.

I dont see anything mentioned about how install/uninstall/enable/disable should work from the spec in the url.

Is this the way it supposed to work?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch nightly build, new profile
2. go to addons manager, and install any compatible addon (eg. adblock plus)
3. now restart and switch to PB mode
4. open addons manager, and uninstall the addon
5. restart back into normal mode
6. Verify the addon ha been uninstalled in normal mode
Actual Results:
addon is uninstalled after switching back to normal mode

Expected Results:
tampering with the addon in PB mode, shouldn't affect normal mode.
