Sometimes, when an existing content is edited/changed in the search-bar and when the ENTER key is pressed or GOOGLE SEARCH button is clicked - IT IS NOT ACTIVATED. I have to refresh the screen (reload Google) to search for it with the new contents.
Ex - 1st typed - ABC COMPANY, New York = it work
- next - in the same bar I edit it a ABC COMPANY, xxxxx(whatever) = it doe not work... So, I need to copy the contents, refresh Google & then paste it on to the new search-bar; and then only it work
This doe not happen all the time, but, every 10-15 searchings....
Please rectify...

Expected Results:
Since I do INTERNET RESEARCH work, I require a trouble-free browser to work with. So far Firefox ha been the best for me... I expect to continue using it with your help... A bug free product.
Thank you!

I use a registered version of Windows XP and been using Firefox with it since August 2007, without any problem.
Above mentioned problem started about a week back only. Still the same (as at 02nd June, 2008 - 18:30 Sri Lanka Time)
