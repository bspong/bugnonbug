Since installing 3.0.6 FF crash every time it is opened. Extreme memory usage is shown in Task Manager after the crash, before FF actually closes. Over 1Gb in use. Before the crash FF slows down in it response time, taking longer to open DL windows, and the tab show very jerky and spasmodic indication of loading data. The more tab you open to download, and close on completion of download, the quicker the crash happens. I allwed crash reporter to report one instance of the crash, but my resource are scant so I can't report every instance.

It seems that the crash are happening more rapidly now, but I have no reliable measure of that.

Had no stability issue before this time and have not installed any plug-in or extra to FF since latest update except for update to Flash Video Resources Downloader which happened after this behaviour commenced. It is so bad that I am considering returning to the hated IE7, because I keep losing downloads and I am on a very limited Broadband link.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF
2. Open several tab
3. DL anything.
4. Sooner or later CRASH
Actual Results:
All open window and tab closed with no warning and crash reporter opened.

Expected Results:
Previous version have had no problem with many open window and tab and multiple downloads. That is what I expected of this update a well.

I have made no change to the computer except the adding of a 1Tb External HDD.
