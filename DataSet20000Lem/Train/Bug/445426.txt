I have only experienced this _ever_ on Linux. The only Linux distribution I have ever tried out is Fedora, so I cannot at this time verify if it is an issue solely with Fedora's package or not. I hope this is the right place for this.

When scrolling long page that very may well have quite large image in them for instance Planet Planet installation like Planet Mozilla (planet.mozilla.org) and Fedora People(planet.fedoraproject.org) - it's almost like Firefox get stuck. Some of the web page's content will be in the right place in relation to the scroll bar, but a piece of a previously seen image will be stuck in the centre making it impossible to read and giving the impression that it's stuck on a certain section.

There are graphical glitch and striping of the image and the page. I enclose a freshly reproduced image of the problem at hand from the test URL.

It doesn't happen with every image though. Just some, especially the larger ones.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to planet.fedoraproject.org
2. Attempt to scroll the page from top to bottom using continuous scrolling.
