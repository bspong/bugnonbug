Is identical to bug #383474. However that one is Mac, mine is PC/W.Vista.
Until yesterday, everything worked fine, download mgr OK, then Vista did an
unsolicited "Update" (whatever, I dont know). Thereafter, no more saving
possible.

Error Window always ha two messages:
1.
Fehler: nicht wohlgeformt [Error: not well-formed]
Quelldatei: [source file] file:///C:/Users/root/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/ahpj361c.default/downloads.rdf
Zeile: 1, Spalte: 1
Quelltext:
^

and 2.
Fehler: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED) [nsITransfer.init]" nsresult: "0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/contentAreaUtils.js :: internalSave :: line 346" data: no]

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Mozilla and load any webpage, e.g. google.com
2.Try File/save as, enter location (or have desktop a default)

Actual Results:
3.NO file appears, error log ha two new entry

Expected Results:
File should have been saved to disk (I guess ;-)

Since Bug #383474 report the same on a Mac, maybe the Vista Update wa innocent.
My computer is an Acer Aspire 9304WSMi, Mozilla worked just fine until yesterday!!

I would like to return to 2.0.0.8 or even before to check for the same error.
Where can I obtain such an outdated version?
