Scrolling up and down at a moderate or fast rate in your Gmail Inbox lag very badly. I get up to 55% CPU Usage on my Pentium4 3.2Ghz with HyperThreading, which mean that most older, single-core / single-CPU system would hit 100% usage easily from this scenario.

***This occurs on my PC and another PC of mine using the latest FireFox 3.x build***

This issue is encountered regardless of 'scroll' setting in FireFox -- disabling AutoScrolling and Smooth Scrolling help the visual lag caused by the extremely high CPU utilization, however the CPU utilization itself doe not decrease whatsoever.

This problem can be duplicated quickly and easily by logging into your Gmail account using FireFox Safe Mode and scrolling through the Inbox.

Per the above paragraph, symptom persist and do not change while using Safe Mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to a Gmail account from www.gmail.com or www.google.com/mail
2. Scroll up and down at a moderate-to-fast rate using your mouse's scroll-wheel.
3. Watch the Task Manager CPU Usage bar / stat.
Actual Results:
Pentium4 3.2Ghz w/HyperThreading experienced up to 55% CPU Usage/utilization from the above.

Expected Results:
No performance hit, or a very slight performance hit should be experienced. This CPU is not new (it's from about 2004-2005), however it's MORE than adequate for simply scrolling through a browser-based Java application. I would expect this action to take no more than 5-10% CPU utilization max, and to not have a visual performance hit at all (lag and stuttering is currently experienced)
