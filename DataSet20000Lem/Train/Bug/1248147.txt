Screen shot of problem file report by Cyberscrub

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/7.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Steps to reproduce:

Yesterday, after running Cyberscrub privacy suite, it reported one file that could not be erased even after restarting, and it appears to be associated with Mozilla Firefox. This ha never occurred before the most recent Firefox update, so I want to know hat's going on here. The file is: C:\users\[my account name]\appdata\local\Mozilla\firefox\profiles\lds4ggw.default\adxksj . I am assuming this is associated with the recent update to v 44.02 . Potentially, it could be an security issue for many users, so I'm checking the box below.


Actual results:

The only other time this happened with Cyberscrub, the file wa associated with a virus. In that case, Webroot also reported a virus. I have not yet seen it report a virus, but it could be something new.


Expected results:

The file probably should have been deleted - unless Cyberscrub ha targeted it for clean-up by mistake. It ha never done that before. Is this a tracking file or a virus?
