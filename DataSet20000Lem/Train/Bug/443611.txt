I believe that it is some hole from firefox which yadro.ru exploited. After firefox being infected, firefox's and the internet's speed slow down dramatically. The only way i wa able to notice it wa going to this website http://crackzplanet.com/get_267576_DownloadStudio.v4.00.040-ELYSiUM_crack.html which wa unable to load and the status bar say that i am connecting to yadro.ru which obviously should not be the case. So any page i visit, yadro.ru act a an proxy and probably saving a copy of my submitted form and visited web site for malicious purposes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get infected (no idea how i got infected)
2.Go to the site i mentioned (http://crackzplanet.com/get_267576_DownloadStudio.v4.00.040-ELYSiUM_crack.html)
3.Look at the bottom left in the status bar saying that i am being connected to yadro.ru
Actual Results:
-Internet slowdown
-Unable to connect to some page

Expected Results:
-Unable to connect to the specified page
-Redirecting to yadro.ru is shown
