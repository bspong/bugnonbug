When a popup is blocked in Firefox 1.0PR, a yellow bar with the message "Firefox
prevented this site from opening a popup window. Click here for options..." is
displayed at the top of the content area of the window.

This cause the window content to "shake" when you click a link to navigate to a
new website. The yellow bar disappears, and the content of the window scroll
up in response. Then the new website is displayed.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear cookies, then go to www.cnn.com (or any other site with popups)
2. Type a new website in the address bar which doesn't create popups
3. Observe and be slightly annoyed


Actual Results:
Content of the window briefly scroll upward before the new page is displayed


Expected Results:
A couple of possibilities: (a) Display this yellow message bar at the bottom of
the screen so the information is conveyed in the same way but no "shake" occurs.
(b) Don't make the yellow message bar go away until the new website's content
is being rendered (i.e. don't bother to scroll the present content up when it
go away).
