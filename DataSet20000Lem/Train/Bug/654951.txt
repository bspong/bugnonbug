When you set firefox to reopen window and tab from last time it doe not work if you have multiple window open.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox and browse to a site, do view source on that site so that 2 window are open, (have reopen window and tab from last time set in preferences)
2. quit firefox
3. restart firefox, it show a single window with the default start page

Actual Results:
I did not get my last open tab from the previous session (nor the view source window)

Expected Results:
I expect the open tab from the previous session or firefox to advise me to shut all but one window before quitting.

In the actual case I had two window each with a set of tab in them and also a view source window. It look like the last closed window is restored and that this is the view source window.

This is IMHO the least useful thing to do, either restore all open tab or close window in a correct sequence or refuse to quit and get the user to decide which single window should be restored.

I did lose a lot of work hence the critical rating.
