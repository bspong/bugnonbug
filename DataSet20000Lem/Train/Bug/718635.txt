Pasting rich text from MS Office loses formatting after upgrading to FF 9.0.1
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

1. opened a (formatted) document in MS Word containing different styles, table etc.
2. opened a webpage with WYSG editor (http://www.ckeditor.com/demo)
3. copied formatted text from MS Word with highligting & Ctrl-c
4. pasted the formatted text into rich text editor with ctrl-v

Also tried the 4th step with the editor's "paste from word" function. (if available)

Browsers used: FF 9.0.1, and Aurora 11.
OS used: Windows XP SP3
Other webpage I did the test: Webpages tried: http://www.ckeditor.com/demo, http://www.gmail.com (new message), Google Documents, http://www-archive.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/



Actual results:

only plain text appeared in the WYSG editor box.
I tried to change clipboard preference manually, also tried AllowClipboard Helper 1.0.1. Results are the same. Formatting should be only removed if user select something in preference to remove rich text attributes.


Expected results:

the text should have appeared with all formatting (which is controlled by the editor's own HTML processing algorythm, for cleaning up Word's improper styles).

Text paste properly with older version of Firefox (tried 3.6.xx), Internet Explorer or Google Chrome's latest version.
