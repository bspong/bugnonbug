TRUNK: bookmarks.html file exists (full size) but bookmark are not shown, REGRESSION

Installed Trunk Nightly 1/28 Linux via tar file (NOT installer). No bookmark are shown in the "Bookmarks" menu. And unlike another bug report, they don't show up via "manage bookmarks" either.

I looked in my profile, the "bookmarks.html" file is present, full-sized (370K!) and properly formatted- it actually wasn't changed by 1/28, still showed a date/time from several hour earlier. I DIDN'T have to restore bookmarks.html from another copy.

I removed my Firefox 1/28 installation and backed off to the 1/21 nightly using the 1/21 'installer' tarfile. Bookmarks functionality seems 100% OK using 1/21.

I'm using the default theme, so that isn't a possible cause. There's only one profile, <salt>.default. I've got lot of extensions, and a built-from-CVS-with-additional-changes-by me GTK+, but the only change between "no-bookmarks-visible" and bookmark working perfectly is the downgrade from Trunk Nightly 1/28 to Nightly 1/21.

One other possibility-- if I simply unpack a non-installer tarfile, rather than extracting and using firefox-installer, MUST I extract it into /usr/local/firefox? I always install Firefox within my $HOME.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 1/28 Nightly Trunk Build for Linux.
2. Click "Bookmarks" menu. No bookmark are shown!

Actual Results:
No bookmark shown!

Expected Results:
All bookmark (folders subfolders, etc.) shown a present in "bookmarks.html" of the Profile.

Appears to be REGRESSION, sometime between nightly 1-21 and nightly 1-28. I'm calling it 'critical' because the bookmark data can't be seen or used... even though it is not actually destroyed, the bookmark file is still present and OK. (Kinda a Major+ /Critical- bug.)
