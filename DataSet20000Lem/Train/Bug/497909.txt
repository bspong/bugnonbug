First click a HTML file input field to select a local file, e.g. for upload. Now, if a javascript alert - window.alert("some error message") - pop up in the same browser window a the file-input I clicked, Firefox will stop responding. I cannot click "Cancel" in the file-input dialogue, and I cannot dismiss the JS alert-box.
I am not able to test for this error on the most recent release of FF, but I have not been able to find this bug in any bug reports.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click file-input field to open the file manager dialogue
2. Make sure a JS alert-box will popup while you are in the file-manager (e.g. set a timeout for 10 seconds, and then let JS run a window.alert function)
3. Move the mouse to try and dismiss the JS alert-box.
Actual Results:
Firefox ha stopped responding.

Expected Results:
Let me either dismiss the alert or complete my action in the filemanager
