User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140830211128

Steps to reproduce:

In Firefox version 35, on Windows XP SP3, download the nvd3 library and run the example program named "line chart with viewfinder". Same a the one on this page: http://nvd3.org/examples/lineWithFocus.html
OR
Try the last path transition problem in this page: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/path/ by copying the code into an html file on your local PC and running it with a black background to be able to see the blotches.

This problem doesn't seem to happen with Ubuntu's Firefox version 32.


Actual results:

When dragging the "viewfinder" of the line chart that's below the chart (provides the zoom functionality), there are blotch formed on the screen a shown in the attached file firefoxRefreshProblemWithSVG.PNG. This problem happens when I click the "holders" of the viewfinder and move them. On releasing the holders, there are no blotch on the screen. The blotch seem to appear only when there's some animation happening on the screen. Like in the path transition graph I mentioned above, the x axis keep moving leftward, and the blotch appear on the moving part of the x axis.


Expected results:

The animation should have happened without any of those blotch appearing on the screen.
