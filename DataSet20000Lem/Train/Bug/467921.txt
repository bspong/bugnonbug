I am not able to open youtube webpage, nor am i able to open any video of youtube. I get a 'page load error' when trying to open youtube.com and a message of 'This video ha been removed', when i try to open any link. These open with google chrome perfectly. I have also tried unistalling and reinstalling the latest version of mozilla firefox.
