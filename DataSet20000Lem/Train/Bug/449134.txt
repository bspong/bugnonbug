When trying to load Cisco meetingplace session using Firefox 3 I receive this error in the error console "version.length is not a function". The below code is the complete function that cause the error. IE7 and Firefox 2.0.0.16 do not have a problem. using the browser test feature of the site, all test pas fine. it only show this problem when actually trying to attend a meeting. I am using Vista 32 bit with SP1. This problem also exists using Firefox3.0.1 on Windows 2003 server.

function chkJavaVer(version)
{
var strLength = 0;

if (navigator.family == 'ie4')
strLength = version.length;
else
strLength = version.length();

if ( strLength > 3 )
version = version.substring(0, 3);

for ( var i = 0; i < badVersions.length; i++ )
{
if ( version == badVersions[i] )
{
return false;
}
}

return true;
}

This is a well known Javascript function and should not cause an error. Older version of Firefox work fine.
Many company use Cisco meetingplace, but cannot attend meeting after upgrading to Firefox3.
