EZboard's ezcodes do not detect selected text when using Firefox.

When I enter text on any ezboard [I have tried this on several], then highlight
the text and press one of the button to make the text bold or italic or to
alter the font, normally it should automatically make these change to the text,
and doe this correctly in IE6 and Netscape.

However, in Firefox it doe not automatically do so, but instead display a
dialogue box asking which text I want to alter. This is what it normally doe
when you just press the button without selecting any text, which is why I
believe it is related to it being unable to detect selected text.

I downloaded Firefox just last night [10-24] so it is very up to date. I had a
friend who us Firefox on Windows XP try this a well on another board, and
they experience the same difficulty, so it isn't just me or the operating
system. This is actually a huge problem for me.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit an ezboard, open a new topic or open a reply to a post.
2. Type text into the box, then highlight it.
3. Click one of the button which applies ezcode - such a [B] for Bold, [I] for
Italics.

Dialogue box display rather than the effect being applied to the text.
Actual Results:
It displayed the dialogue box asking me to enter the text I would like to alter.

Expected Results:
It should have automatically applied the effect, a it doe on IE6 or Netscape.

I am using the default theme, I have made no configuration change since
downloading Firefox le than 24 hour ago.
