Starting today, FF us a lot of CPU even when idle
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150630154324

Steps to reproduce:

I'm using FF on a Win7 64-bit Lenovo T410 portable with 8Gb RAM and 4-core i5. AV is F-Secure. Win7 update from MS are up to date.

I just start FF (v.39) and watch the CPU utilisation in Task Manager with no other application running.


Actual results:

About 30 second after starting FF, the CPU utilisation rise from a few percent to 30%+ and stay there for several minutes. On TaskMan's Processes tab, 27+% of this is attributed to "firefox.exe *32". Then it go through alternating cycle of short period of 1-2% utilisation before rising again to 27%+. This behaviour occurs regardless of how many tab are open in FF and of what site are open on the tabs.

I've scanned the PC with F-Secure AV, SpyBot Search and Destroy and MalwareBytes premium, all of which are up to date. None of them find anything of consequence, just the usual tracking cookie stuff which I allow them to tidy up. None of this ha made any difference to FF's behaviour. I have rebooted the PC several times, but the behaviour continues.

As noted in the summary, this ha only started happening today. I am running the same FF version on another PC on my LAN and on that, FF ha continued to behave normally.

As noted


Expected results:

After starting up FF should settle down to a few % CPU like it usually does.
