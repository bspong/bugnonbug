Issue appears when there are two or more advertising placement on the page. After looking over this with some developer it seems that this is most likely related to an ongoing bug in Firefox where it doe not render the content of 2 IFRAMEs placed on the same page correctly at times. What basically happens is that Firefox take old cached content from a previous page refresh and put it in the IFRAME instead of the actual call itself. This would also support why we never see this on the first page load after removing cooky and cache from the browser.

All Ads have been set up correctly and you can replicate it only in Firefox, all other browser render the content of the new response. Tested with Fiddler. All adserves return correctly sized ad at every page refresh. None of the adserving network cache the calls.

This happens to ad traficked through the 3rd party, add call examples:
