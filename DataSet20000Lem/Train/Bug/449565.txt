First, web page rendering work ok.

The problem is the text on the toolbar or any button is missing.
Also some text in a popup describing plug-in compatibility wa weird, I guess
it is a font problem.

(This problem is also reported to Debian BTS #493076.)

Here are some snapshot that show the problem:

This happens only on one machine. The other installation work ok.
I've tried to remove ~/.mozilla completely, no difference.

So I guess it ha something to do with fonts, but I
would like some clue on where to search.
