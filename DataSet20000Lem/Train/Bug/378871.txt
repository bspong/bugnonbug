Dragging bookmark toolbar item while customizing toolbars will silently crash latest minefield and output a x window system error message in the terminal:

------------------------
The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadAlloc (insufficient resource for operation)'.
(Details: serial 7286 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X error are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
