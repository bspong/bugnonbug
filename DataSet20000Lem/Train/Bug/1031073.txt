Steps to reproduce:

I set the org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor with unity-control-center from (int)1 to (int)2: (see: http://askubuntu.com/questions/471425/scale-title-bars-and-menu-in-ubuntu-14-04-with-gnome/486611#486611 )

(Using Ubuntu 14.04 32bit)



Actual results:

org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor wa set from (int)1 to (int)2
and com.ubuntu.user-interface scale-factor from {'HDMI1': 8, 'eDP1': 8} to {'HDMI1': 8, 'eDP1': 16}

so the system-wide scaling is set to (int)2, this seems to affect all form element in firefox, but not the normal text. So the formelements become double the size a the text (only if a website ha not defined the css-value for font-size) see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23783899/why-are-all-html-form-elements-huge-with-a-system-wide-font-scale-factor-2-0


Expected results:

Firefox should notice, that the scale-factor wa changed by Ubuntu and use this scale factor for layout.css.devPixelsPerPx also (default is (int)-1, which should ere this value, but it doesn't)

If you set layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to the same value a org.gnome.desktop.interface scaling-factor (int)2 then everything look perfect.

(There is exactly the same problem in Thunderbird also)
