Cannot connect with any https/secure Web page (Error establishing an encrypted connection to ... Error code: -8075)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

My Firefox 1.5, downloaded and installed on 12/02/05, will not connect with an "https" page. This is on a a Win98/SE system with plenty of memory and disk capacity. There is a particular HUD-related site I must use that is all secure page after login. I had no problem with this or other such "https" site or page using IE6, Mozilla 1.7.8 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511), or Firefox 1.0.3 and it updates.

Since the problem occurs in Firefox 1.5, I went back to check access of these secure sites/pages with IE6 and Mozilla 1.7.8 and had no problem with access, a before. The same good result wa obtained at Mozilla.org in accessing secure page with Mozilla 1.7.8.

When trying to access "https" page in Firefox 1.5 the response is "Error establishing an encrypted connection to _______.com. Error code:-8075"

Similar result occur within Mozilla.org attempting to connect to secure pages--as in trying to report this bug (I had to use Mozilla 1.7.8 to make this filing). The response obtained with Firefox 1.5 in trying to enter a secure page within Mozilla.org is:

"The connection wa interrupted

The connection to addons.mozilla.org wa interrupted while the page wa loading.

* The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.
* If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
connection.
* If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web."

I tried all of the available "Protocol" option under Tools\Advanced\Security, separately and all selected simultaneously. None of these choice helped.

This is a major issue (unless no one else is experiencing this problem). Since I never had a problem with http page with IE6, Mozilla 1.7.8, or Firefox 1.0.3, the issue would appear to be in Firefox 1.5--no matter that the underlying software is basically the same a in Mozilla and earlier Firefox.

Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using Firefox 1.5 on any system, find a Web site that ha "https" pages.
2. Attempt to connect to the secure pages.
3. If that work properly, try the same on a Win\98 system in particular.

Actual Results:
What happens is a described in "Details" above.

Expected Results:
Based upon my trial with three older browser which successfully handle secure page and my version of Firefox 1.5 obtained on 12/02/05, I expect a rejection at the secure page.
