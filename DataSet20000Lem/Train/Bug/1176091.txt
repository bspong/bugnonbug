"Download Status Bar" add-on doe not work with e10s (or is it the built-in PDF viewer?)

The problem can be reproduced on the latest Nightly (build ID 20150618030206) on a new profile:
1. Install Download Status Bar 12.3.0.1-signed (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-status-bar/?src=userprofile)
! Mind you: the hyperlink on http://arewee10syet.com/ is wrongly pointing at https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/download-statusbar/
2. Go to Add-ons > Extensions > Download Status Bar > Options and change the setting in the tab "Appearance" a shown in the attachment. No change made in the tab "Options".
3. Search for a large PDF to download (e.g. Google for "test.pdf")
4. Click the PDF link - file is opened in Firefox's built-in PDF viewer.
5. Click the download button (and choose a location)

Expected result (as seen in Firefox 38.0.5 - build ID 20150525141253)
- Download Panel's arrow blinks, show progress and file name.
- Download Status Bar show progress (in orange) and file name, turn green when finished.
- PDF is downloaded.

Actual result: (as seen in Nightly)
- Download Panel's arrow blink but show NO progress and NO file name.
- Download Status Bar doe not appear.
- PDF is still downloaded.

So both the built-in Download Panel AND Download Status Bar do not register downloads triggered from the built-in PDF viewer?
When downloading other file (e.g. Nightly build = EXE) this problem doesn't occur.
