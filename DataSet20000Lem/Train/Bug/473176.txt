This site extends (and enlargens) the browser about three screen lengths.

I have visted the site with Safari, and with window and it work fine.

There is something about Firefox that isn't working correctly with this site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.simple use the current 3.05 firefox and enter http://www.state.nj.us/opra/
2.it's that simple....you'll see for yourself what the problem is
3.
Actual Results:
the page is enlarged and extended to the point of being useless and requiring that firefox be closed and restarted

Expected Results:
it should have simply shown the page a the page is shown in other browsers.

I'm no techie. I suspect that there is some simple compatability issue here that can be easily fixed by someone who actually understands this stuff.

I just know that something is wrong with Firefox re this site (and on some other NJ state sites, but it's the same exact symptom)

PS I reported a bug on the NY time site re Firefox a while back that evidently wa subsequently fixed......thanks!!!
