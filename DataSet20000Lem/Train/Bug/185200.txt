Freezes Phoenix: Toolbar folded away, I try the shortcut <ctrl>-L to open the "open location" requestor

The problem with this severe bug is that it showed up twice but I dont know
how to reproduce it yet (I will update on this when got confident).
Listen: the browser freezes!! Now way to click it back into being, you have
to send it a kill signal from another application, thats awkward.
My 2 cent on the reason so far:
when the toolbar is unfolded, <ctrl>-L (or: <ctrl-l) mark the location field
entry and set focus to it. Sometimes, phoenix seems to forget that the toolbar
is folded, and try to do the actions: mark field entry, set focus, and that
may lead to some unhandled exception when it cant be done.
Aside:
The "open location" entry is missing in the "file" menu - but please dont
drop the feature at whole!! Since people want to gain more browser display
space, they may want to fold the toolbar and thus need the "open location
requester" instead of unfolding the toolbar each time they want to enter some
URL.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
When the problem occured, it can be reproduced. But when some time
ha passed shuffling around with phoenix, the bug is no more
reproducable.
