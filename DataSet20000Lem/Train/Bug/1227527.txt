Initial implementation of Firefox Accounts device registration
There are a lot of different bug open for FxA device registration and tracking them individually is a pain in the bum. So I'm creating this to cover the initial feature set that I plan to implement / get reviewed. I'll shortly close out those it obsoletes a duplicate of this issue (and leave those it doesn't obsolete alone).

The scope of this issue is to:

* implement a device API client object
* via call to the aforementioned object, make the following API requests:
* POST /account/device
* after a signed-in user open the browser
* after a user sign up for Sync
* after a user sign in to Sync
* after editing the device name
* POST /account/device/destroy
* after the user disconnect Sync
* send a WebChannel message after the user disconnect Sync
* subscribe to a `fxaccounts:deleteDevice` WebChannel message
and delete the locally-stored device id in the message handler
* accept a device id parameter in `fxaccounts:login` message

Things that this issue will not cover:

* #1221111, sending WebChannel event for device name change
(the content server UI will have a refresh button)
* #1221125, subscribing to WebChannel event for device name change
(the content server UI will not support renaming)
* #1221105, fetching updated device detail from the auth server on startup
(the content server UI will not support renaming)
* push notification from the auth server
