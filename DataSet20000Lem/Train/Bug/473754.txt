The EA press site is opened using Javascript from the main page, so there's not toolbars and menu any anything (see attached picture). By default it's maximized, so it us full screen.

When someone click on "Click here to download the ticked assets..." the link point to a Javascript function that basically doe "document.myform.submit()".

Server doe some processing and the "Opening file" appears, but the OK button is grayed out and remains grayed out. Note that opening file window is with the focus on it. The OK button is usable only if I click on the Start button or the taskbar below, so that it loses focus. When I click on it again, the OK button becomes usable.

This happened every time, for several downloads.

When I made a screenshot of the main page, I resized it to make the picture smaller. With the page not maximized I clicked on the download link and the OK button worked right away, so the bug appears every time if the page is maximized from the start.

Note1: the "Click here to download assets" only work if one is registered. Registration is free and a soon a you register you can download file for about 20 minutes, after that you'll be able to download only after they confirm your press account. I can do tests.

Note2: The press page wa opened by going to www.ea.com , going to the footer of the page, clicking on "Corporate Info" (this is where javascript pop up the page), and then on the press button.
