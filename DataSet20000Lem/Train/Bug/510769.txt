False return code when URL is clicked in Outlook and a NoScript add-on update is initiated
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I am using NoScript a I am sure many people do. Frequent update are issued for this add-on, which ha a feature built-in to auto-load the URL http://noscript.net/ after an update.

Now, when I click on any URL in Outlook and Firefox is started and NoScript is updated, Firefox load two URLs, the one clicked on in Outlook *and* http://noscript.net/ which become the focus.

Firefox then signal that the URL clicked in Outlook could not be opened, at least Outlook issue this error message, but this is plain wrong.

Firefox should signal success in loading the URL to Outlook and not forget about the URL to open while it load another URL related to the update of the add-on.

This happens frequently to me since NoScript is updated quite often.

What I am not sure about is, whether this is because NoScript open a second page or just because the add-on update dialog of Firefox come up and Outlook time out waiting for it URL to be opened.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have an add-on update available, which get auto-loaded when Firefox start up
2. Click on an URL in Outlook.

Actual Results:
The URL load correctly into Firefox, but Outlook say it doesn't.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have signaled sucess in loading the URL to Outlook, even if the process is shortly interrupted by updating the add-on.
