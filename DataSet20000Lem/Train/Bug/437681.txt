My company allows access to the internal web site thru a secure link on the internet. A couple of week ago I accessed a specific page on the internal web site. Today, I went back and get a blank page and the word "done" on the bottom of the page. I finally traced an error report page and found this message:

Warning: Unknown property 'text-autospace'. Declaration dropped.

Line: 0

Warning: Expected end of value for property but found 'FONT-FAMILY'. Error in parsing value for property 'font-size'. Declaration dropped.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Closed browser and logged back into my company web site using Mac version of Firefox. Specfic page would not load. Blank screen with "done" in lower corner.
2. Logged out and started Sony Vaio laptop with Vista. Loaded Firefox and accessed company web site using PC version of Firefox. Located same page and received same results. Logged out of company web site
3. Loaded Internet Explorer on Vaio. Accessed same company web site and located the same page. It loaded with no problems.
