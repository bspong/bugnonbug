<col> tag cs background formatting when using style or class attribute is ignored

here's some html to illustrate the problem:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
<style type="text/css">
#tab {border-collapse:collapse;width:100%;}
#tab td {border:1px dotted black;}
.number {text-align:right;background:red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<table id="tab" cellspacing="0">
<col><col style="text-align:center;"><col class="number">
<tbody>
<tr><td>a1</td><td>b1</td><td>c1</td></tr>
<tr><td>a2</td><td>b2</td><td>c2</td></tr>
<tr><td class="number">a3</td><td style="text-align: right;">b3</td><td
style="text-align: center;">c3</td></tr>
<tr><td>a4</td><td>b4</td><td>c4</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</body>
</html>

this table should be rendered with the second column text centered and the thrid
column text right aligned and red. The third row is rendered correctly a the
cs is applied at the cell level (except that the third cell - c3 - should be
red, a it should inherit the cs from the col tag).

Note that i've reported this bug incorrectly before (#262159), a i wa made
aware, text-align and color are not supported for the col tag according to the
cs 2.1 spec (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#q4).

However according to the spec 'background' IS valid in col tags...
from the above w3.org link (17.3 Columns)...
----------------
The following property apply to column and column-group elements:
...
'background'
The background property set the background for cell in the column, but
only if both the cell and row have transparent backgrounds. See "Table layer
and transparency."
-----------------

also, interestingly enough i've noticed that when changing the doctype to strict
(<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Strict//EN">) everything work
exactly like IE, even the text-align and color in the col tag - effectively
extending the css2.1 spec - VERY COOL.

anyway, please let me know if i'm missing something or if the cs background not
working in col tag is infact a bug.

Thanks

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.paste the html code above into a texteditor (ie. notepad)
2.save a test.htm onto your computer (ie. desktop)
3.open the test.htm file in Firefox/Mozilla and observe the incorrect behaviour.
4.open in IE or any other recent, non mozilla based browser and see how it
should be interpreted.

Actual Results:
render incorrectly - the col tag background cs is completely ignored when the
table is rendered.

Expected Results:
it should use the cs specified inside the col tag to render the table correctly.
