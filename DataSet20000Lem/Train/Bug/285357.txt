This is occuring with the saferfox theme. I have not tested with other themes. I
will select severity a Major although I consider it to be a Critical issue when
trying to convince new user about security. Loading a url not specified in the
property dialog could be serious risk. Therefore I will send a security email
also to reference this bug.
