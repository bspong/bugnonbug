Unable to Copy and Paste Text from Word or Clipboard to and inside Mozilla FireFox, logged into Yahoo, or other Web Based e-mail, and Message Boards.
Tested problem on several different Sites, Problem is repeatable. Most often occurs in Yahoo e-mail. Can not Copy and Paste ANYTHING.

Using IE have no problem Copying and pasting anything in the same E-mail sites, and message boards.
Thought it might be a Bug loaded into Cookies, but I cleared everything a couple times, and problem still exist.
But only with Firefox, no other Browser. Re-installed Firefox, problem still exist. Also Firefox ha problem using Adobe ANYTHING. Flash, or otherwise. It just lock up and won't work. Can use some Adobe stuff, but none of it seems to work right using Firefox.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use Firefox browser
2.Log in to Yahoo e-mail
3.Try to Copy and Paste Text- It won't work. Paste option is not available.

Actual Results:
Shit doesn't work right, THAT's the results.

Expected Results:
I expect your shit to WORK! In ALL Situations. You spend thousand of Dollars going to College, act like you're so smart, then you make shit that doesn't Work?
Is your soul purpose in life just to cause everyone Problems?
I like how you make everyone read through an Entire encyclopedia of FAQs of all of the Screw ups you guy created before anyone can even Contact you about something. Shows how much you actually give a shit about solving problems.
Nice Work.

I used Firefox a lot before giving you any feed back on it. I actually liked it for a while, because it didn't crash a much a IE. But then I found out that I couldn't copy and paste. At first I thought it wa a problem with Yahoo. Then I found out the Problem wa my selection of Browsers. I wasn't too happy when I realized I wa choosing to use an inferior product.
Another fine example of what can be produced by our College Graduate Geniuses, and all the problem they create for all of us.
Thanks Guys.
