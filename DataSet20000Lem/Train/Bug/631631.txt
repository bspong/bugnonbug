Since I upgraded to Windows 7, When I close Firefox it stay in memory. This wa initially discovered when I tried restarting it (and therefore may have a relationship to Bug 587917).

I later discovered that not only did it stay in memory but wa using large amount of processor time (about 50% of my Centrino T5450 dual) and continued to gobble memory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Do anything.
3. Close Firefox.
4. Open Windows Task Manager: Firefox doe not show in the "Applications" window but is present under "Processes" a firefox.exe is still running and never seems to stop.
Actual Results:
Temporarily solution: In Windows Task Manager highlight "firefox.exe" and with right mouse button select "End Process Tree". This result in a potential data loss warning but I have never lost data. Firefox can now be restarted normally.

Expected Results:
Firefox should close in an orderly fashion and vacate memory.
