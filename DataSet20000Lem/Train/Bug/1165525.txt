From #developers:

4:30 PM <avih> gavin: iirc one of those page suggested that the way to bail out of collecting info the user should use blank page. but i don't know how to bring the tour again and i don't recall the exact wording
4:31 PM <•gavin> that would surprise me because it's not correct
4:31 PM <avih> right, i wa surprised a well. so it could be poor wording of that page
4:32 PM <•gavin> I see what you mean: https://cloudup.com/clTLSM7A-H4
4:32 PM <avih> gavin: browser.newtabpage.introShown=false and you'll get this tour
4:33 PM <avih> gavin: yes, exactly. so it is poor wording, right?
4:33 PM <•gavin> Mardak: seems like that should change to be "uncheck 'Include suggested sites'" intead of "selecting Show Blank Page"
4:33 PM <•gavin> avih: yes

attached is the image gavin linked of the onboarding page with text for turning thing off by selecting blank.

I believe the string used came from bug 1147476 comment 3:
