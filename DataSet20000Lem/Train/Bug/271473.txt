decouple service on update.mozilla.org
The app update service (AUS), plugin finder service (PFS), and extension/theme
directory (ETD) all live on the update.mozilla.org domain name. They should
each live on their own domain name so we can allocate hardware resource to
them independently and isolate them from each other.

We need to do this in the most minimally disruptive way to existing Firefox
client while still meeting the goal of putting each service on it own domain
name and making update.mozilla.org only redirect to each service.

AUS and PFS can both handle arbitrary HTTP redirects without breaking.
Extension/theme installation whitelists update.mozilla.org explicitly, but the
whitelisting may be subdomain-recursive, in which case we could relocate the
site to foo.update.mozilla.org without breaking the whitelisting.

foo.update.mozilla.org is clumsy for long-term use, however, so we should pick a
better long-term name, whitelist both, redirect user to foo.update.mozilla.org
in the short-term, and then switch to the long-term name once we're satisfied
that the vast majority of user have upgraded to version that whitelist the
long-term name.

We should get this into not only the next major version of Firefox but also the
next maintenance release, if any, to propagate this change a quickly a possible.

Possible name for these services:

AUS: aus.mozilla.org
PFS: pfs.mozilla.org
ETD: addons|extras.(update.)mozilla.org

Note that AUS and PFS domain name should be invisible to the end user, so it's
not critical for their name to make sense to someone unfamiliar with the
services. ETD's domain name, on the other hand, should make sense to regular
end users.
