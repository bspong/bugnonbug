Firefox hang when JavaScript engine process website
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100423 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.3

My firefox hang on any website which run any type of JavaScript. I'm running Firefox 3.6.3 on Kubuntu 10.04 LTS.

Disabled all my add-on and plugins.
Using the default theme.
Set browser.cache.disk.enable = false
Set network.http.pipelining = false
Disabled loading images.
Disabled JavaScript (the problem wa resolved after disabling the JavaScript engine for all websites)

I even vacuumed all of my database using sqlite3 (which is what the newer firefox version are using in their databases).
[CODE]for x in `find . -type f -name *.sqlite* | grep firefox`;do echo "$x";sqlite3 $x VACUUM;done[/CODE]

None of that seems to work. I can't just run my browser with JavaScript disabled permanently on all websites. I downloaded Firefox 3.6.4 beta and installed it into /opt/ and still running into the same problem (starting it via terminal using /opt/firefox/firefox.

Any idea anybody? Here's some more sysinfo about my distro...
[CODE]$ cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 10.04 LTS \n \l

$ uname -a
Linux megaman 2.6.32-22-generic #36-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 3 19:31:57 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux[/CODE]

Hardware:
Intel Core i7-920 2.66GHz
6GB DDR3 1066 (PC3 8500) Triple Channel
nVidia GeForce GT 240 1GB 128bit GDDR3 (using proprietary nVidia driver in Kubuntu)

Running firefox from the terminal doe not output any exception or errors.
I can reproduce the problem when loading the following website every time.
[url]http://www.newegg.com/[/url] (Firefox hang ~40s each time I load the main page)
[url]http://www.yahoo.com/[/url] (Firefox hang ~45s each time I load the main page)

I press Ctrl+T when it start hanging and when it finish it hang it open a new tab (that's how I timed it).

I'm sure there are many others but I've just been using those two a test site for the issue. There's no good reason Firefox should be freezing on my system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all Firefox process
2. Open Firefox with about:blank
3. Visit http://www.newegg.com/
4. During hang press Ctrl+T.
5. Open a new tab.
6. Visit http://www.yahoo.com/
7. During hang press Ctrl+T
Actual Results:
Firefox hang when loading NewEgg website for about 40s. You know when the hang is done after Firefox open a new tab (from the Ctrl+T action).

Firefox hang when loading Yahoo website for about 45s. You know when the hang is done after Firefox open a new tab (from the Ctrl+T action).

Expected Results:
Firefox should load the page in under 5-10s like in all other browser tested.

Tested Firefox 3.6.4 beta and still had the same issues. Testing done with all extension and all plugins disabled with the default theme selected.
