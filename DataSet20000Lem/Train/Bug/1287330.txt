Insert tabs' linkedBrowser lazily into the document
Support bug for bug 906076.

As we begin to actually implement lazy-browser strategy, we will need to modify the code which is presently accustomed to dealing with tab.linkedBrowser, to work with lazy-browser tabs.

However we need a fallback so if any consumer out there try to access linkedBrowser property on a lazy-browser tab, thing won't break. This would be especially true for addons which have not yet adjusted to the lazy-browser strategy.

This bug creates a proxy for linkedBrowser which, if the tab is still in it lazy-browser state, will instantiate the browser if linkedBrowser property are accessed.

Note that we use a proxy rather than a simple getter for linkedBrowser, because in some case we can return some property based on prior knowledge of the tab, and avoid linking the browser before we want to.

Note that in this bug, we are only setting up the proxy implementation, and in practice we still will not be experiencing the optimization of lazy-browser linking, a the proxy will nearly immediately force the browser to be linked by code accessing linkedBrowser in SessionRestore. In later incarnation of lazy-browser tabs, we will be training SessionRestore to deal with lazy-browser tabs.
