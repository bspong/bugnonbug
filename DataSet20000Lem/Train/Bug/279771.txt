Favicon request is causing a Domain Mismatch Error
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b) Gecko/20050124 Firefox/1.0+

In the URL listed, "https://sannas.ca/2005/ffbug.html/" this page load
correctly, however a second after it does, for some reason it attempt to
connect to some page at "https://www.sannas.ca". The certificate that this
domain is using only cover the domain "sannas.ca" and not "www.sannas.ca" which
result in an error.

Note that this page ha absolutely no external references. I tried forcing a
favicon fetch on the "sannas.ca" domain and this error still occured. This
error occured on the Nightly build of both Firefox and Mozilla.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://sannas.ca/2005/ffbug.html
2. If you say cancel, you can view the page fine, until you attempt to grab
another page off of the site.

More generic reproduction steps:
1. Create a web page at "domain.com"
2. Setup a domain specific certificate for "domain.com", such a SSL123 through
Thawte
3. Point firefox or mozilla at "https://domain.com"
4. Get an error about "https://www.domain.com" not being secured properly.
3.

Actual Results:
I get this message, even though I never attempted to access "www.sannas.ca",
just "sannas.ca".

You have attempted to establish a connection with "www.sannas.ca". However, the
security certificate presented belongs to "sannas.ca". It is possible, though
unlikely, that someone may be trying to intercept your communication with this
web site.

If you suspect the certificate shown doe not belong to "www.sannas.ca", please
cancel the connection and notify the site administrator.

Expected Results:
Should have loaded the certificate correctly, and not attempted to contact
"www.sannas.ca" after resolving, connecting and fetching entire page from
"sannas.ca"

I've been in contact with Thawte, and they claim that the certificate is
installed correctly. These page all work a expected on Internet Explorer 6.0.

The workaround is to essentially have a certificate that cover both domains. I
havn't attempted it, but assumingly moving the certificate to cover the "www"
version of the domain might fix it a well.
