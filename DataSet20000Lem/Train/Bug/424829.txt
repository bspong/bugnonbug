Larry's IdentityHandler can hold window alive for too long
Not really sure of STR, but I wa trying to get to nytimes.com when our network went down (yay!). The load error page came up and the cycle collector began spewing lot of debug info that seems to implicate Larry. Here's the output:

nsCycleCollector: nsGlobalWindow 0x1bc864ec wa not collected due to 2
