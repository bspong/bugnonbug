Table "x" is set to width 100% in cs using ID=
parentNode.clientWidth is 600 for example.
Initially, x.clientWidth is 530
following x.style.display='none' to hide it, then show it again
the table ha collapsed left-ward to the minimum width, x.clientWidth now 315

I have placed a 1px high Div inside x and now explicitly set the width to 530px using JS. This ha fixed the problem.

If this sound like a bug (DOM re-render ignores table width? display: none collapse element size to zero but ignores width: 100% when display: block is specified?) I'll provide the saved page, it's quite complex unfortunately, 27k of j I'm afraid. but I'll comment all the spot where I've experimented.

work fine in IE/PC

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
100% width becomes minimum width following display: none then display: block

Expected Results:
Table 100% of parent container regardless of display and/or visibility

The problem occurs in Safari/Mac FF/Mac FF/PC but not IE/PC which suggests something to do with display: block on a table I think.

reporting this anyway.
