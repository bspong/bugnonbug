Firefox crash when attempting to delete a posted "tweet" on Twitter; additionally, this occurs with deleting database entry on other sites, such a Nutridiary.com.

The session is restored properly upon restart, but the item is not deleted. All attempt to delete the database item result in the same segfault.

This can be reproduced with Twitter, by attempting to delete a posted "tweet" - the post is never deleted but the browser consistently bail on attempt with the following (in GDB):
