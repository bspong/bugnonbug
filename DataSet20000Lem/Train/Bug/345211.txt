Print to File Confusing to Use
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060614 Fedora/1.5.0.4-1.2.fc5 Firefox/1.5.0.4 pango-text
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5 ??? (Sorry, I'm no a different system right now)

If you print, and check the "print to file" box, what happens next is very confusing. I think of the problem a having three parts, so I'll list them.

1) The "print to file" dialoge doesn't ask you where you want to save the file.
In my case it saved it to c:/program files/mozilla firefox/, which wa really confusing. It should give a dialoge which let me choose a destination folder, and the default should be something nomal, like My Documents.

2) The file produced by "print to file" ha no extension. Apparently it should be a .prn file if it's in a propriatary printer format, or .ps if it's in postscript.

3) Prn file are difficult to use. I know, this is Windows fault, but I figure I might a well list it too. On one side you could offer a little documentation on how to use a .prn file, on a more useful side, you could offer to "print to file" to a .pdf instead. That would make "print to file" a lot more useful to people who don't have printers.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get on Firefox on Windows
2. Open a web page
3. Go to File -> Print
4. Check the "print to file" box
5. Print
6. Try to find & use the resulting file

Actual Results:
File is difficult to find, difficult to figure out what format it is, and difficult to actually use even if the format is known.

Expected Results:
File should be easy to use, even if you don't have a printer.

You guy rule! Thanks for taking the time to make this thing!
