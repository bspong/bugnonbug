Basically when you specify a type of cursor in your control and when you move to the control area from a non-control area you don't see the type of cursor you expect. I've found a few other issue relating to cursor not changing correctly so this could be a dupe but any help on this would be appreciated.

- Verify if the cursor is the expected one (as specified in the cell).

Expected Results:
- Cursor is the expected one (as specified in the cell).
