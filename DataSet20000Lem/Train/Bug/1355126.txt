User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0
Build ID: 20170410100144

Steps to reproduce:

Tab of source code in dev tool remains blank after opening for source file of GWT application debugged using Super Dev Mode. (I met this problem in context of GWT, I guess it's related to the fact that Super Dev Mode locates source map to different server than the webpage themselves.

1. Run a gwt app
2. Run GWT Development Mode (~ start debugging user super dev mode)
3. Load app in Firefox
4. Run "Dev mode On" GWT bookmarklet, click Compile button, wait for compilation of the compilation
5. Open DevTools, Debugger tab
6. Open file http://127.0.0.1:9876/sourcemaps/webadmin/http:/127.0.0.1:9876/sourcemaps/webadmin/com/google/gwt/core/client/GWT.java (select it in left sidepanel tree) in dev tool

Gwt debugger console log following problem:
"[INFO] GET /sourcemaps/webadmin/http:/127.0.0.1:9876/sourcemaps/webadmin/com/google/gwt/core/client/GWT.java
[INFO] [WARN] ignored get request: /sourcemaps/webadmin/http:/127.0.0.1:9876/sourcemaps/webadmin/com/google/gwt/core/client/GWT.java"

55.0a1 (2017-04-10) (64-bit), Linux
Built from https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/731639fccc709a4dd95fed7e9dda88efb2227906


Actual results:

"GWT.java" source tab opens, however it's empty. Also when tab is right clicked and "Copy link address" is selected, the clipboard is filled by "http://127.0.0.1:9876/sourcemaps/webadmin/http:/127.0.0.1:9876/sourcemaps/webadmin/com/google/gwt/core/client/GWT.java"

I found suspicious that part of the URL, "/127.0.0.1:9876/sourcemaps" is repeated twice


Expected results:

Original source is shown
