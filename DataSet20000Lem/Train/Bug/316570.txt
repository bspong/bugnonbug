firefox should be startable from a shell (command line)

The installer installs firefox in some system directory, but when typing "firefox" in a shell, it is not found (because not in $PATH by default). Starting firefox from a shell is useful to start the profile manager or start a second instance with a different profile (useful for testing, in particular). I can see two possibilities:

1. The installer installs the firefox script (or a symbolic link to this script) in some standard location such a /usr/local/bin, possibly asking the user for several locations.

2. Some information is given after firefox ha been installed, telling the user what to do. For instance, add /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS to his $PATH (but I don't think this is a good solution since there are other executables the user would probably not want in $PATH). Or add a symbolic link, in which case the installer should give the path to the firefox script (e.g. /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox).
