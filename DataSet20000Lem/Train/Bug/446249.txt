Extremely slow DNS lookup and/or page loading

Sometimes Firefox load new page quickly, but often -- perhaps about half the time -- page load extremely slowly, with the status bar saying "Looking up whatever.com" or "Connecting to whatever.com". When this happens, it's for every site I try to visit, not one particular site. The lookup take anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds.

When this problem isn't happening, page load in just a second or two over my Comcast cable connection.

It's especially bad on maps.google.com; I'll go there and it'll load, but then trying to zoom in result in some or all of the visual block failing to load, or loading really slowly. It's so bad that, while it's trying to load, I can open Opera on the same system, go to maps.google.com, and bring up the same thing; then do the same thing on my iPhone over the EDGE network; then go back to Firefox and it still hasn't loaded.

I've tried creating a new Firefox profile, but that made no difference.

I think the only thing I do with Firefox that are somewhat abnormal are 1) having lot of tab open, generally 30-50, and 2) having lot of groupmarks of those tabs, generally about 1 per day from the past ~3 years, which is a habit I got into due to the fact that Firefox crash all the time unless you disable all the plugins, which wa hard to do before Firefox 3. My bookmark file is about 8 MB. But again, this slowness problem isn't there all the time, so it seems like the many tab & groupmarks must not be a problem in general.

Also, this is probably a separate bug, but when Firefox is being all slow like this, if I attempt to switch to another tab, it often cause the whole browser to lock up until that lookup finishes.


Reproducible: Sometimes
