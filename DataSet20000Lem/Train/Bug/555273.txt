This seems to be a problem regarding Firefox 3.6.2 on Windows XP while it is also running Internet Explorer 8, and also standalone Firefox 3.6.2 on Windows XP. Firefox 3.6.2 seems to be having trouble processing the animation effectively, and it's choking just to load the page, let alone manipulate the page.

After attempting this in every other browser, plus researching the issue, my verdict is that this ha to do with the PC version of Firefox 3.6.2, which wa released and pushed by Mozilla earlier this week.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to the site with Firefox 3.6.2
2. Click "My Coach"
3. Drag the slider bar around
Actual Results:
CPU usage go up immediately upon loading the page.
Firefox becomes le responsive when I try to click on another tab (noticeable 1-2 second delay between any other click or actions)

Expected Results:
CPU usage should stay stable and slider should update immediately.
