Windows CE ux/perf regression between Alpha 2 and Beta 1
On the newest (10/16) OS build, the preinstalled Firefox (Alpha 2) is fast and snappy, but Beta 1 is not. Specifically, it seems fast for brief spurts, and otherwise bog down and is almost completely frozen for up to a minute at a time. I tested with downloading the A1/B2 .zip build and running them from the SD card, so it seems to be related to something that changed in our code.

STR:
1) Ensure Firefox faststart process is not running. [You may want to just install Firefox from the OS, so that a reboot ensures it's always gone. File->Exit from the browser will also ensure it's gone -- just closing the browser window with [x] doe not]

2) Run a Firefox build.

3) Browse a couple of sites, wiggle the mouse pointer around with the trackpad.
Good: site load quickly, mouse pointer generally move smoothly
Bad: browser seems frozed (loading, or typing in URL bar, or opening menus),
mouse pointer move in jerky steps.

A few interesting quirk I've noticed:

* When thing freeze up, moving the pointer with the trackpad exhibit jerky motion, but moving it with a USB mouse is fine.

* After a page is loaded and thing seem fine, I can generally wiggle the pointer in an empty area of the page, but touching a link or UI button will often trigger the freezing / slow cursor.

* On the 10/16 OS build, the difference between A2 and B1 is night-and-day. On earlier build and the last Oban build, I have a hard time telling them apart -- they're both really slow.
