1. Open Inspector at a non-empty page (Ctrl+Shift+C will do).
* The pointer should be on the page, and move between block of it (if you stop moving, the shaking will probably stop after a few seconds).
* Shaking will stop when the pointer is over the bar itself or the adjacent path bar. It can still move when the pointer move between the tabs, and the pointer can blink in some place supposed to be between tabs.
* It is more likely to happen when DevTools are in the default horizontal mode, not vertical, and especially not separate.


Actual results:
The devtools tab bar to the right of the path (like "Headers|Cookies|…" in attachment 8525353) is shifting left and right, at first rapidly shaking, then slower and slower, until it stops. It can happen for at least 2 seconds.
