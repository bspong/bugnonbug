When a website open a "modular window" using javascript (e.g. window.alert() or window.prompt()) the alert window gain focus and you cannot use your mouse to interact with the main window until you close the alert window.

However you can focus the main window and then use your keyboard to e.g. open a second alert window, open the menu, ...

When using icewm a window manager, there's another problem: I can minimize the alert window, it disappears and I found no way to close it. Then Firefox becomes unusable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a modular window, e.g. using javascript window.alert() (or click the link on http://wulf.eu.org/foo.html)
2. change focus away from the alert window to the main window by clicking it, alt-tab, mouseover or whatever your window manager need you to do
3. try pressing return (open another alert window) or alt-f (open menu)
Actual Results:
Another alert window appears or the File menu open

Expected Results:
I expected to get no result at all.

Affected systems:
debian/sid, icewm or kwm, firefox 1.5, firefox 2.0.3, iceweasel 2.0.3
fedora, unknown wm, unknown firefox version
SunOS 5.10, cde or fvwm or sun java desktop, firefox 2.0.3

MS Windows is not affected, you cannot put focus on main window.
