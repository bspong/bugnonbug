If you decide to run Internet Explorer before or after Firebird is open and you
go into the customization screen, the toolbar ha a tendancy to scramble. By
this I mean that the button spontaneously move randomly in the main-part of the
toolbar. An example is the browsing button (back, forward, stop, etc.) move to
the opposite side.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Arrange the button of the navigation toolbar in this order: Back, Forward,
Stop, Reload, Home, seperator, URL entry, Go, seperator, Print.
2. Open the Customize screen.
3. Open Internet Explorer.
4. Go back to Firebird.
5. Close the customize screen and the button should have moved.
(optional fix)
6. Reopen the customize screen and close Firebird from the Close button in the
upper-right corner.
7. Close Internet Explorer.
8. Reopen Firebird and the button should now be back to their original positions.

Actual Results:
The button moved and then were put back after reopening Firebird and closing IE.

Expected Results:
Not affected the button at all.
