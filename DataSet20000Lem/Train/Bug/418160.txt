After clicking on an image to display it larger size, a new window will be displayed with the smaller image. Once the image is clicked again to enlarge together with enlarging the window size, the position of the image is incorrect, that is it top-left position is not (0,0) of the current windows. Therefore, the whole image cannot be seen after zooming in. The workaround is to zoom-out and then zoom-in again.
