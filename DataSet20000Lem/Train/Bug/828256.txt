Integrated PDF Viewer doesn't sometimes display some letter (at least Icelandic þ and ð)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:19.0) Gecko/20130107 Firefox/19.0
Build ID: 20130107082023

Steps to reproduce:

Opened attached PDF file (by clicking on a http link).


Actual results:

On page 2:

"Inngangsorð" display a "Inngangsor "
while the letter is ok in:
"Fréttakorn frá Vefverksmiðju"


"Forsíðan" display a "Forsí an"

"Sæþór" display a "Sæ ór"


"Ábyrgðarmaður" display a "Ábyrg arma ur"

there are more case there and probably on other pages.

[And display of the document is a little slow]



Expected results:

These letter should display right a they do with the non-integrated readers.

Note that the letter þ and ð do in some case display right in the same document and the capital version Þ and Ð are do always seem to display right. That could be a coincidence if this is font related. While some of the example are in italic or bold or possibly another font, that seems not to be the case a under EFNISYFIRLIT ("contents").

Note that copy-paste from the document work and search for the letters.

Not sure if there is a relation to:

I'm not using this extension (was this integrated into Firefox?), hope I'm reporting to the right place:

This is my first bug-report so I hope that while I think it is complete and correct you'll be lenient if not..
