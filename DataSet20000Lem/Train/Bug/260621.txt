Mouse wheel button will not scroll frame if top of frame is not visible
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040914 Firefox/0.10

If the top of a frame is not visible in the current page, the mouse scroll wheel
will not scroll the page. Worse, when scrolling down through a frame, and the
end of the frame is reached, Firefox will scroll the entire page, pushing the
top of the frame out of view, and you cannot then scroll back UP the frame
without scrolling the main window to bring the top of the frame back into view.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load above example bugzilla page
2. place mouse cursor over the frame listing the bug
3. use mouse scroll wheel and scroll to the bottom of the frame, and keep scrolling
4. The entire page will then scroll, and the top of the frame will scroll off
the screen

Actual Results:
5. The mouse scroll button no longer will scroll the frame even when it is
placed over the frame. The only way to get the frame to respond to mouse scroll
event is to scroll the main page itself until the top of the frame is again
visible.

Expected Results:
Anytime the mouse cursor is over a frame, the frame itself should accept the
event and scroll itself. (i.e. Mozilla 1.7.3 doe this properly)

This make using the mouse scroll button almost unusable.
