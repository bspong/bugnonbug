Class Not Found When URL contains GET parameter ( file://applet.html?name=joe )

Firefox throw a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException
whenever I load a java applet from the local file system
and the URL contains GET parameters.

This happens every time with every applet I've tested.
It doe not matter if I've loaded a JAR or simple classes,
APPLET or OBJECT tag nor the parameter I use.
Note that these applet load perfectly fine when there are no
GET parameters.

For example:

This works:
file:///Users/alex/applet.html

These do not:
file:///Users/alex/applet.html?
file:///Users/alex/applet.html?yes
file:///Users/alex/applet.html?yes=no
file:///Users/alex/applet.html?yes=no&a=b

Also note that this is not a problem for Firefox on Windows XP.

Lastly, this error occured in Firefox 0.9. I upgraded hoping I might magically
get a fix. So it's not a new bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open any applet
2. show that it work
3. alter the URL (by FORM or manually adding ?whatever=something to the URL)
4. observe java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.mozilla.myjava.class

Actual Results:
I tested it thouroughly on multiple machine and concluded that it is consistent
problem only on the Mac.

Expected Results:
It should work.

The objective is to pas parameter via the URL to javascript which will create
the applet/object tag, passing parameter to the Java Applet. Why? Because Mac's
don't support scripting nor LiveConnect. And Firefox doesn't even allow this
simply work-around.
