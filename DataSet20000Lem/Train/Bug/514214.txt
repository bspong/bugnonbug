I have noticed this problem on Gmail's inbox page (https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox).

The problem is that when you go to a gmail inbox using normal browsing, and so that the URL is saved in the history. If you start private browsing, and go to a different gmail inbox (different email address), then when you exit private browsing -- the private browsing's email address will show up in the history next to the URL above. Since the URL is the same and exists in the history from normal browsing session, it display the page title of the page loaded in the private browsing session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to gmail inbox of email address A
2.Sign out. Start Private Browsing Session.
3. GO to a different gmail inbox (secretemail@gmail.com).
4. Sign out, exit private browsing mode.
5. Look in the history, it will still show the page title of the private browsing session.
Actual Results:
You can still see the private browsing page title.

Expected Results:
No page title from private browsing be shown.

This is a huge problem that need to be fixed!
