In the page http://www.seidenweich.de/sw_streetshops.php?id=4, a two-column
table ha a total width of 96%, the first column 30%, the second 70%. Depending
on the selection made in a select element inside the left column, a particular
div out of several one is displayed inside the second column (display:block;)
while rendering of the others is suppressed (display:none;). Each time a
selection is done, the left column shrink a little bit until this is stopped by
the length of a single text word contained in the first column to avoid breaking
up the word into two part - the line consisting of several word start being
wrapped at some point. Correct behaviour would leave the column proportion
invariant a is the case with IE 6.0.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Obvious from details.

Actual Results:
column proportion changed

Expected Results:
leave the column proportion invariant

There appears to be a relationship to bug 210657, incorrect scroll behaviour of
div area when the cs width is given a percentage value. After all that time -
more than a year - I consider this a serious bug since such thing steal very
much time from web page designer and developpers. I appreciate all the work end
effort spent for the community. However, bug surviving such a long time and so
many version of gecko have some impact on the credibility of the idea of open
source software. It is really time for a set of correct, stable, and consistent
algorithm making the effect of recalculating position and size of page
element reliable and predictible.
