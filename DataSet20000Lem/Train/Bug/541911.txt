I used Latest Headlines to view a BBC article.

Then after I finished reading, I cleared all history and closed Firefox.

After I re-open it and go to Latest Headlines again, I can see BBC icon (black
color) on the article I read.

Thus a person is able to see what article I read, a they will have a BBC icon in the Latest Headlines.

I also believe that clear recent history ==> everything, doesn't work properly, and that it still probably leaf some history even though we tell it to delete all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From Latest Headlines select any article to read. Wait till it finish loading.
2. Close Tab/return to home.
3. Clear Recent History == > Everything ==> detail ==> check all
4. Restart Firefox.
5. Go to Latest Headlines and you will see BBC icon on the article you read earlier.
