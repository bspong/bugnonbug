New window (with Java applet inside), opened by JavaScript, lost Drag-n-drop area
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

I've made an html page (simple) with one link only, that open a new window with a Java applet inside.

Something like that:
test.htm open test_applet.htm by calling 'window.open();'

After this new window appeared - the applet worked fine (the applet accepts files, dropped in it, and show them).
Then, when I moved this window to another position - the applet stopped to accept the file at all. But, if I move the window for just some pixel (for example, move it on a half selfsize) - DnD work partially. It look like the DnD area is static and stay at first positon where the opened window appeared!

It happens everytime in FF 2.0.0.14 under Mac OS. in FF 3.0 everything work alright.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make simple html file with the link that open another html file by window.open() method.

2. another html file, that would be opened, should have Java applet. you can use the next page for testing:

3. start it all under Mac, in FF 2.0.0.14.

4. DnD some picture into Applet. (Do not move this applet-window!). that should work.

5. Move this applet-window to another position on screen and try to drop some picture into applet. this shouldn't work.
Actual Results:
The applet stopped to get dropped picture from a user.

Expected Results:
The applet should get dropped picture and show them.

You can use the next link for the opening window:
