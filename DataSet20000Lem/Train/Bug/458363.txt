I've tested the site with SWFAddress implementation removed and it work a it should without any artifects.

according to other developer research (http://www.blog.lessrain.com/possible-bug-in-firefox-301-mac/) it seems related to the implementation of Flash's ExternalInterface class on MAC OSX.
This a major feature of flash and is used to communicate with Javascript.
