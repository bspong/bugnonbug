IcedTea-Web Plugin(suse-.0.4.2-i386) Java applet invoke offload failure .

Screen shot of clearing Private-Data

Very trivial error. If enable or disabled Add-on creates a error popup from time-to-time; inconsistent.
The error state to run a debug on Firefox... The error only say that it wa caused from Icedtea java applet handler.

It happens during shutdown of browser / when clearing private data cache .

Operating System: OpenSuse 11.4 up-to-date
Firefox version: 5.0

I believe it is conflicting with Firefox's Java handlers(?).
I have the error le when the addon is disabled... However, sometimes the error will pop-up even if the Icedtea add-on is disabled -- This happens when I have browsed to many site that have constant flash or java applet refreshing.

Possible intrusion attempt--attacker attempting to parse inactive handlers(?) Too inconsistent to have any `real evidence of that.

Debugging only try to initiate file that are non-existent. As the Icedtea seems to roam the drive looking to activate/initiate files. Those file are also resource file -- So it is hard to tell.
IcedTea created a BIN folder in my $home folder for my user.


It is possible that it is a shell problem -- Icedtea is also a java policy handler and it could be conflicting with Firefoxs runtimes for java applet but Icedtea enabling itself by refreshing/mixed content is questionable.
