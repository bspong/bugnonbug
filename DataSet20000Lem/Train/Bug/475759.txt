Firefox becomes non-responsive when browsing to common and popular web site (i.e., Google, Yahoo, Facebook, etc.). Sometimes the program freeze after the first attempt to browse to a web page (eg, I open the browser, either type a URL into the location box or select one of my bookmarks, and the program freezes). Other time I can navigate to 2 or 3 page before the program freezes. In both, the program need to be "force quit" via the Task Manager. Also, the freeze doesn't generate a crash report or an entry in the Error Console. Oddly, the ONLY web site I can fully access (with out Firefox freezing) is Mozilla.com. This problem just started today (1/28/09), the program ha been working fine up to now.

1. Open Firefox
2. Navigate to any web site (other than mozilla.com)
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox either freeze before it load the pages, or freeze 2-3 page later.

Firefox should full browsing to requested web pages.
