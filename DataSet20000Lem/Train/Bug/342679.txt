Tab drag-drop indicator arrow almost hidden when at extreme left
Surprised I can't find a bug for this already, since I think it's existed a long a tab dragging has...

When at the left-most possible position (to the left of the first tab), the tab drag-and-drop indicator arrow is all but entirely missing, due to it being positioned outside the window.

1. Open a browser window with two tabs.
2. Drag the second one over the top of the first.
3. Observe that the drop indicator arrow is 100% visible when positioned to the right of the first tab, but almost gone when positioned to the left

This doesn't seem to be such an issue at the extreme right of the tab bar, a the right-most tab (even when backgrounded) is created with a border between it and the end of the tab bar (i.e. there's enough tab bar background "buffer" to accommodate the drawing of the right half of the indicator).

The first/extreme left tab, however, seems to be created with a border that reach all the way to the edge of the tab bar (even though the image of the tab when it's foregrounded suggests one), and that seems to be the problem. Maybe a more restrictive border could be set?

Another symptom of the border problem is that the tab focus ring for the first tab (when active/foregrounded) stretch all the way off the edge of the window, rather than being a close fit like other tabs.
