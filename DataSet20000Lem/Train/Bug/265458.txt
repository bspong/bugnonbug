Any missing plug-in/helper app cause a 100% CPU spike that hang the process
and requires me to kill the process via task manager in XP or the command line
in Linux. There are several ticket already with regard to this problem but
they are very specific and only relate to a given page or given plug-in or given
platform. I've duplicated the problem with Acrobat, Flash and QuickTime on both
Linux and Win XP. Once the plug-in is installed the problem vanishes so it's
likely a problem with the way in which FireFox handle plug-in that aren't
installed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a fresh FireFox install with no plug-in
2. Visit a Flash site or try to open a PDF in the browser
3. Watch it hang

Actual Results:
100% CPU utilization hang requiring a kill from the OS

Expected Results:
The browser should have either marked the plugin a unavailable, given a message
with a link to a way to install the plug-in, or auto-installed the plug-in after
getting user approval but it is unacceptable that it simply breaks.

There is no acutal crash so I don't get any debug info. I have to kill the
process to get out of the 100% utilization cycle.
