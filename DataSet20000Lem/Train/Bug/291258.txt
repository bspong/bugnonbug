Hello.

I have read & heard of several FF-users having problem after installing a new
FF-version. Those problem often are caused by plug-ins. But newbie-users don't
detect this, blame FF, turn away from FF and spread bad info to potential others.

I can understand the FF-team can't be responsible for plug-ins. But maybe there
is a simple solution to solve potential problems. Like displaying a big warning
message every time a new version boot for the 1st time. Or by default boot
without plug-in for the 1ste time after every (minor and major) FF-update.

My sole intention is preventing people to turn away from FF while actually the
problem those user experience are not caused by FF...

I started a question in Mozillazine, but wa pointed to bugzilla. My original
question: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=1403726#1403726 .

Kindest regards,

Raoul.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Depends on plug-in being installed and whether they conflict with a new FF-version.
Actual Results:
I had people report FF going blank etc

Expected Results:
Exclude all plug-in on 1st boot?
