PRE block doesn't render properly with firefox. Bad CSS?
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

The above mentioned URL is not rendered properly on Firefox, while with IE it
work fine.

I thought it might be a Firefox related issue, then I noticed that in the CSS
file (http://www.bugzilla.org/css/screen.css) the style of the PRE tag ha a
"background" statement that point to a transparent.png image.

I think that path is wrong (you use relative path for these things, so for this
page it might need to be one level deeper when browsing page at a lower levels,
but that will break all other pages... oh well!)

I dumped the page with HtTrack and change the path in the CSS file, and it
seems to work fine.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse the URL with Firefox (mine is v.0.9.1).

Actual Results:
The central part, where there's the text tagged with <pre>, ha a funky
background. It reproduces the left dark-gray bar and, sometimes, the top banner.
It also slows down the browser.


Expected Results:
Just a clean page, with a transparent bg where the main text appears.


Maybe this page show a problem with Firefox too, but I believe there's a
problem with the CSS anyway, that's why I filed it here.

I haven't filed anything for Firefox. I leave it to whoever fix this.

Same problem happens to the other "Release notes" page, at
http://www.bugzilla.org/releases/2.18rc1/release-notes.html
