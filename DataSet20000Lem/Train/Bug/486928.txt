When I log in to the live timing the top of the applet window is initially cut off. I can regain the top row if I scroll down, however, when I open the timing applet in a separate window, I can not get the top row back.
Also, the timing information doe not update timely. It appears that the old information doe not get updated and cleared correctly. The screen update when I hit the 'resize' corner. The applet work correctly in Safari and on the latest stable and beta version of Firefox in Windows. I updated the OS X browser to the beta version, just to see if it would cure the problem.
