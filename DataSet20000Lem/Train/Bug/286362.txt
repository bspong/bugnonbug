After using ctrl-tab to switch browser tabs, focus is on wrong page until clicking with mouse

I have several (13 actually) browser-tabs open to different sites. I press
ctrl-tab quickly to switch to a browser-tab several down the row. Now I use the
tab-key to select a link, and the url of the selected link appears on the status
bar, but the url are for the browser-tab to the left of the page I'm looking
at. When pressing ctrl-tab it changed the browser-tab on the display X times,
but changed the keyboard focus X-1 times. Clicking with mouse brings the focus
back to the displayed browser-tab. It may be a race condition only on slower
hardware (P233 here) or with background tasks, but race condition are bugs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open several tab in 1 window on a slower PC
2. press ctrl-tab several time fast
3. press tab to select a link

Actual Results:
More than half the time, the keyboard focus is on the wrong browser-tab.

Expected Results:
The tab-key should select a link on the page that is in the visible browser-tab.
