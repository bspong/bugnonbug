Firefox randomly stop responding after attempting to open a link. Firefox will attempt to access a link, and after about 10 second the status bar stop showing any progress and then blank out and/or say "Stopped". Afterwards CPU usage skyrocket to 100% and when it get near impossible to close Firefox. If I do manage to close it manually, Windows XP will say the process is not responding. If I click End Task and check the Task Manager, there is a zombie firefox.exe process taking up load of RAM. This happened after I updated to 2.0.0.5, AND DOES NOT RESOLVE ITSELF EVEN IF I DOWNGRADE TO 2.0.0.3 or 2.0.0.4.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a webpage.
2. Open a random link, but try to open the link a quickly a possible.
3. Firefox will hang and/or any new attempt at visiting other site fail until Firefox is restarted.



It doesn't appear to be site specific, and ha been happening to a number of my friend with different configurations. If there is something I can do on my end to assist with the tracking, it would be very much appreciated.
