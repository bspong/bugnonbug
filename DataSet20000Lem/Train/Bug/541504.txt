When setting a max-height in a parent element, it's child don't get this value of height, for example when setting a percentage value for max-height on this element children. See the test case for an example.

Looking at the W3 (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visudet.html), it says:
"If the height of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is not absolutely positioned, the percentage value is treated a '0' (for 'min-height') or 'none' (for 'max-height')."

The issue I see here is how the term "explicitly" is defined, I would say that when a max-height rule ha been set and is in effect, then the height of the containing block is explicitly set, a it no longer depends on the height of the content, though just with this, I can see that it can be argued that explicitly mean setting the height attribute.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the test case a in my next post
Actual Results:
Image displayed with it full height of 595px.

Expected Results:
The image to have been scaled so that it had a height of 270px (90% of 300px)
