Hang while displaying History menu after Sync import / Testpilot issue
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:7.0a2) Gecko/20110804 Firefox/7.0a2

Steps to reproduce:

1) Loss of all history data (possibly related to the Testpilot New Tab study, since the timestamp on places.sqlite.corrupt match activity in TestPilotErrorLog.log)

2) Created a clean profile and added it a a device to the existing sync account to retrieve history data from sync account

3) After completed sync, in this clean profile, trying to access the history menu fails. Clicking "History" in the menu, FF hang for half a minute and never actually display the menu. Accessing history via sidebar works. This persists after restart.

Some speculation from IRC #sync:
05:09:28 PM - rnewman: Possibly a bad record in the DB
05:09:45 PM - rnewman: and Places is not expecting it, and is dying on some operation that touch the DB during draw of the history menu

4) In the *original profile*, even after turning off testpilot study via the toolbar button, and removing the testpilot add-on via the add-on manager, the new tab study is not completely removed. In particular, the new tab page remains modified, message like "info: start jump prediction tracking" get written to the console, and the extension subdir contains blanktab_multivaritate_test_testpilot@jetpack.
