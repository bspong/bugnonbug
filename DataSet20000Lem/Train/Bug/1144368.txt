User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
Build ID: 20150312193711

Steps to reproduce:

Using Firefox with fairly light browsing habit (standard web pages, light amount of videos). I leave the browser open at work and don't close it unless I need to.

As a little history briefing, I started using the 64-bit build a little under a year ago when they were available for Nightly. While it ran fine, I noticed that my memory usage would easily eclipse 4 GB after being open for a few days. After many month of disabling add-ons, making a new profile, etc, I discovered that switching back to the 32-bit build fixed my issue. Clearly either there wa either a major problem with the 64-bit build (hence Nightly), or I had some weird add-on memory leak.

Now that the 64-bit build have graduated to beta I decided to try them out again, and to my dismay I still seem to be having memory spike issue (although they don't seem to be a bad).


Actual results:

The amount of time varies, but over the course of a day, my memory usage creep up. When I start the browser fresh, I sit at around 500-700 MB depending on the amount of page I have open. Right now it's been open for a couple of day and I'm sitting at ~1.2 GB with only 3 tab open, none of which are medium intensive webpage (or any more intensive than I normally use)


Expected results:

When I run the same profile on the 32-bit beta, I start at around 450-650 MB, and usually don't go over 700-800 MB after being open for a week.

I have attached my Firefox troubleshooting info to this bug.
