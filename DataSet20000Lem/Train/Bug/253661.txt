nine step to better menu in Firefox
This may be partially covered by Firefox bug 243078 and browser bug 37694 but
this bug is to track Firefox improving the usability of menu by making style
and positioning adjustments. If we can do that by moving to nsITheme native
menus, great. If not, we'll need to see how much of this we can do in the
winstripe theme and minor XUL hacks.

1. Sub-menus should be moved three pixel to the left and raised 4 pixel
vertically.
2. Main menu toolbar menu item need to have a blue highlight hover and click
style rather than the raised and depressed bevel button on highlight and click.
3. Menu border need to be reduced to 1 pixel from the beveled 2 pixels.
4. Menu checkmark need to be moved two pixel down and one pixel to the right.
5. Blue selection highlight for menu item need to be moved down one pixel in
relation to the menu item label (or the label moved up within the highlight,
whichever you like.)
6. Topmost menu item in the menu need to be raised 2 pixel vertically.
7. Padding below a menu item label and above a separator need to be increased
by 2 pixel and the padding above a menu item label and a separator need to be
increased 1 pixel.
8. The entire set of menu item label need to be moved three pixel to the left.
9. Separators need to be at least two pixel wider, reducing the padding between
the end of the separator and the right and left border of the menu to 3 pixels.
