Add better handling for HTTP downloading for the stub installer
Currently the buffer we use in the NSIS plugin InetBgDL is too small (512), so it lead to slower download speeds.
Also we only do a single big request/response. Some proxy may buffer a resource completely.
The problem with that is we use the default WinINet timeout of 1 min.
So the stub will hang on downloading.

Fiddler is one example that produce this behavior (unless you change the setting)
It buffer the response until the whole response is there and then it release it.
Which lead to a timeout loop. A good proxy stream the content a it receives it.
But I'm sure not all proxy are good.

This may (or may not) be hurting stub installer conversions, so is worth fixing.
We should split the request into multiple part and use a larger buffer size.

When a timeout happens for this reason the user would see an indeterminate progress bar forever.
It keep looping between these states:
1. HTTP GET with response of 302 for http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-nightly-latest&os=win&lang=en-US
2. No response for: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central/firefox-19.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe
3. Wait a minute or so
