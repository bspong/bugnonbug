Whenever I click on the little news button for the extended player news in Firefox, FF start to completely hog one of my two CPU's (overall 50% since on a duo-core) for at least 15+ second (if I don't close the window).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the URL supplied above.
2. Click on ANY of the little yellow button beside the player's position. (This little thing: http://l.yimg.com/a/i/us/sp/fn/default/full/p_note.gif)
3. Let the extended player info show up on your screen and read it.
Actual Results:
FF load the player info and right away start hammering the CPU with FF using 50% of my CPU (which would be 100% on just the one core).

Expected Results:
FF should load the player info and then go idle, or use only 2-5% of my CPU max instead of making it go crazy after loading this window.

I also tested this in Safe Mode to prove it's not any of my plugins or addons, and it still happened.

Also, in IE8, it load it just find and doesn't go crazy on my CPU. At max, it us 25% and after it load the window, it go back to idling unlike FF here.
