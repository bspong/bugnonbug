After modifying the toolbar and deleting all links, the webpage (html) would
start to move up and down rapidly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. I customized the toolbar by relocating the "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" up
beside the menu (immediately to the right of 'help').
2. Then I deleted all item in the bookarms toolbar (the three default link
after a fresh install).
3. I then went to a new website and the entire page (not the browser interface,
just the html) began to move 10 or so pixel up and down in half-second intervals.
4. Sometimes going to a new page would resolve the 'bouncing', but by minimizing
and maximizing the browser, the problem reoccured.

Actual Results:
The website would start moving up and down several pixel in half-second intervals.

Expected Results:
Displayed the webpage without the content moving.

This happened on a fresh install of Firefox, not 10 minute after completing the
installation.
