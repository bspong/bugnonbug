Printed text is not black

When I use firefox to print (through various version of CUPS, currently 1.4.2), the printed text come out in a very weak "black". Most job come out with the text nice and black, but firefox's job do not. My personal page or file:/// link come out this way, so it's not a problem with the web page.

Stranger: if I print to a PDF and then print the PDF through acroread (a workaround for the lack of duplex (bug 358393?), I observe the same non-black black.

Speculation: Firefox is printing with a tri-colour black. My printer is a HP DeskJet 6980, and ha a separate black cartridge, but somehow Firefox's output specifies non-black. If so, this bug can be expensive--printing text in full RGB colour??

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a web page with black text.
2. Print it.
3. Observe weak black.

OR

1. Load web page
2. Print to PDF, then print the PDF through acroread.
3. Note that while the page look normal under acroread, it come out funny when printed.
Actual Results:
Your black is weak!

Expected Results:
Print black with black.

FWIW, the paper http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~labrob/people/cherubini/assets/files/Humanoid_learning_RAS09.pdf (and others) ha an algorithm at Fig. 5. Most of the text come out black-black, but the algorithm (rendered a black by acroread) print in the same weak-black that Firefox us for all text.
