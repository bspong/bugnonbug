Console logging is slow
Created attachment 593077
Simple test to show the speed difference

Along the way, a couple of people had told me that "logging to the web console is slow", so I thought I'd see if that's true/quantifiable. This might be related to bug 597461, or those may be two different problems.

See the attached file for a simple, stupid benchmark but I think it highlight an issue. How the result are computed:

1. With console not visible: 1000 iteration of console.log called with a string
2. With console not visible: 1000 iteration of console.log with a single %s replacement
3. With console visible: 1000 iteration of console.log called with a string
4. With console visible: 1000 iteration of console.log with a single %s replacement

With Nightly (2012-01-30) on my Mac, I get the following result (times in ms):

Closed Console

Simple string: 335
Interpolation: 259

(the last 200 result were saved and displayed on open)

Open Console

Simple string: 3797
Interpolation: 3820


Contrast with Chrome 18.0.1017.2 dev

Closed Console

Simple string: 42
Interpolation: 39

(the last 900 result were saved and displayed on open)

Open Console

Simple string: 186
Interpolation: 198


I noticed that Chrome's display of console output when the console wa open wa asynchronous.
