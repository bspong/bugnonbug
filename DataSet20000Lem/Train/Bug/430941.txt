Firefox get into weird, semi-CSS-less, unclosable state on Mac

This is a horrible, horrible bug report, but I don't quite know what detail are relevant or how to find them.

I use Firefox every day on Windows without a problem. When I started switching to the Mac, I found that several time a day, visiting the exact same site would eventually wedge Firefox in a rather strange way:

1. A page would occasionally display with some or all of it content unstyled by CSS. This wa usually my clue that Firefox had become semi-wedged. Reloading the page would usually display the fully-styled page.

2. Sometimes, after #1, menu item would cease responding. The menu bar itself would appear to work, but selecting menu item (e.g. Tools -> Add-ons) would have no effect.

3. Once #1 or #2 happened, Firefox would be unable to quit. It would respond to Command-Q, and close the browser window, but the app would never quit; it would require force-quitting.

I've never seen any message in system.log that seemed relevant. I switched to Firefox 3.0b5 a few week ago, and the problem didn't recur, so I assumed that the rewrite of Gecko had fixed the problem. However, on 4/25, I switched to 4/24's nightly build, and ran into the problem within a few hours! I'm now using the 4/25 build, and haven't recreated it yet.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I've spent many hour trying to find a fail case with no luck. I can report that visiting the same page that caused the "wedge" doe NOT reproduce the problem by itself.

I'm happy to turn on logging, build Firefox myself with something enabled, whatever; I just don't know where to start looking. It's a very vague problem, but I know it when I see it... I haven't found any dupe in bugzilla, but everyone I know with a Mac seems to run into it once in a while.



This happens on two machines:

1. MacBook Pro, 2.4GHz, 4GB RAM, Leopard 10.5.1 (now 10.5.2)
2. Mac Pro, 8-core 3.2GHz, 16GB RAM, Leopard 10.5.2

It happened repeatedly with Firefox 2 (2.0.0.11 or 12 at the time, I believe) on the MacBook. It happened once with Firefox 3, nightly 2008-04-24.
