It is possible to modify Firefox color outside of the standard palette using Windows Advanced Appearance setting which demonstrates that Firefox doe not forbid such modification. The add on purport to add that flexibility but disables the basic Options functionality instead demonstrating it is defective. If the add on is not compatible with Windows that should be stated clearly in the add ons page.
