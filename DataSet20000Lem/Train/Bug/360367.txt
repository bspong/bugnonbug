To ease the searching of some terms, I added a bookmark-based keyword search through the use of the right-click "Add a Keyword for this Search..." facility. I found that search performed this way would not work for text containing accented characters.

Since the wrong search result show a page with interrogation mark instead of some characters, I assume that there is some character encoding problem about. Given that the search fails, it is probably related to the POST method that is used to perform the search.

Since keyword search for POST method are not a straightforward to edit a GET ones, I don't know of a workaround for this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL <http://atilf.atilf.fr/dendien/scripts/generic/form.exe?12;s=2690634540;> which should show a an ISO-8859-1 encoded page.
2. Right click on the first text box ("Vedette (se lisant comme un mot donné)") and "Add a Keyword for this Search..."
3. Search for "journée" using the keyword just created.

Actual Results:
No word wa found. The resulting page is interpreted a a UTF-8 one, and it would seem that the encoding used for the submission wa also UTF-8.

Expected Results:
The word's definition should appear, a when submitting the search directly through the web page. The page show a an ISO-8859-1.

I wonder whether this ha to do with the referring page not having any encoding information available (neither through HTTP header nor through the HTML HEAD). Whether this is the case or not, the page properly default to ISO-8859-1. Since the keyword is added using that instance of the page, the proper character encoding should be embedded in the search.
