When navigating a site i'm working on (works only in mozilla/firefox right now),
the scroll bar do not properly adjust to the content being displayed on the
screen. Sometimes it think there is no more content when there is, other time
it's add a bunch of blank space at the bottom of the page when there's nothing
there.

Site is Heavily JavaScripted, however FireFox doe not report any JavaScript
errors, a well i have scanned my site's HTML and for the most part it is
compliant by W3's standards..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto: http://www.happyrave.com
2. click on "General" category
3. click on random thread and scroll to the bottom of the screen

Actual Results:
The page will either be too long or too short. Sometimes not allowing the user
to view the rest of the page's contents.

Expected Results:
to be able to view the entire page's content at it's appropriate length.

I have tested this in Firefox and Mozilla on XP, 2000 and OSX.

All of them have the same errors.

NOTE: i've noticed that the html get's corrected if i resize the window.
