component
vertical scroll bar for browser window - not the java box

opsys - window xp sp2(at least on this sys)

summary
init java box within browser window.
the javabox height is ha about 8px margin top/bottom and right (basically fill the window)

once the java window is established in the browser (window) a mouse-over in the browser window (outside the java box) near the vertical scroll causes...
1. the java box to white out (depaint)
2. the javabox to flutter
3. the vertical scroll of the browser window disappears

upon removing the mouse(over) from that vertical area outside the javabox, fluttering stops, box repaints, and the vertical may or may no reappear.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. using webmin, server logon
2. filemanager menuitem (java)
3. mouseover to right outside javabox at right vertical scrollbar
4. this happened in prev ver of firefox but i recall did not in 2.x
5. doe not happen using 'the other guy'
Actual Results:
once the java window is established in the browser (window) a mouse-over in the browser window (outside the java box) near the vertical scroll causes...
1. the java box to white out (depaint)
2. the javabox to flutter
3. the vertical scroll of the browser window disappears

upon removing the mouse(over) from that vertical area outside the javabox, fluttering stops, box repaints, and the vertical may or may no reappear.


Expected Results:
no flutter. and no matter what, the vertical scroll should remain


upon close inspection (and being a programmer myself) it appears that the browser cannot decide if the vertical scroll is needed or not a the margin is tight.

if you need more help, let me know.
