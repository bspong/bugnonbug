Hey,

When using the built in CTRL + F (find on page) feature, you can click highlight all to highlight all match of what you are looking for.

However, if you were to change the search criteria, and click find next again, the highlighting still stay on the old criteria. To get it to highlight the new criteria, you have to un-click highlight, and then re-click it again.

I know this seems like a petty bug, but it is quite annoying for one of the legacy system we use, where the CTRL + F highlight feature is the only way of searching for information on the large result page easily.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to google.com and look for the word sexy
2. Press Ctrl + F, look for 'sexy' then click highlight all
3. Change the keyword to 'hot', then click find next
Actual Results:
You'll see 'sexy' is still highlighted, and hot isn't.

Expected Results:
It should have either highlighted element on the fly, or if we want to save CPU cycles, then it could do it when you next fit 'search'.
