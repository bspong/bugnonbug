Infinite while on XMLHttpRequest() make the UI freeze or the whole browser crash after filling up the ram (Vista x64 only?).

The browser is frozen forever, doesn't tell you "The script is using too much resource".


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://arnaud.fr.nf/killme.html
2. Activate JavaScript (if not already)
3. Press the button
Actual Results:
Hangs on most platforms.
Crashes on Windows Vista x64.


Expected Results:
"This script is taking too much time, would you like to stop it ?"


It doesn't look impressive like that, but it's really a big problem because your browser is completely unusable after encountering this little piece of JS.

Looking at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444457 wasn't that supposed to be adressed in Firefox 3?

It's really an unexpected behaviour.
The browser are supposed to block these type of script after some time (like with other JS scripts). Safari do.

This exploit could be used to freeze / crash a user browser on a big social website or via XSS (or on a forum using <img src="javascript:..." thingy).
