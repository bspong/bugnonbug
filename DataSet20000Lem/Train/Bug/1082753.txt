Bookmark "Open all in tabs" deletes current tab
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

1. Have couple of tab open in the current Firefox Window (Firefox for Desktop).
2. Click on 'Bookmarks' menu and select an existing Bookmark folder or it sub-folder and right click and select 'Open All in Tabs'

Found in Firefox 32.

PS: This bug is a historical one and I don't think if it ever got fixed so thought of creating in 2014. Hopefully some dev should give a serious consideration to it.


Actual results:

The newly opened tab overwrite the existing tab and any previously opened tab are deleted forever.


Expected results:

If this not a bug or "as is feature" or 'Will Not be fixed' then it should atleast warn the user that opening all the tab will overwrite existing tab and delete any extra tabs.

If this considered a bug "Will or probably be fixed" then it should open the bookmark in additional tab in the same browser window and should not overwrite or delete existing tab of the window.

Devs: Please consider it a a serious one a it is very annoying and user is of the impression that open in all tab will open the bookmark in "additional" tab for the same firefox window. I am seeing this bug being reported in different ticket since 2008.
