When Firefox is installed the installed-chrome.txt file is created if it doe
not exist and all the default chrome entry are added.

If the installed-chrome.txt file doe exist, all the default chrome entry are
appended to the bottom of the file even though they already exist in the file.
The end result is duplicate entry in this file.

The installer should only add line that aren't already there.

This ha been around since at least 0.9.
