Need short delay after dropping (D&D) a bookmark URL into a folder (Bookmark Menu or Personal Bookmarks Toolbar)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Make sure you have a sub-folder in your bookmark
1. go to a site
2. Drag & drop the grippy (URL) into a bookmark folder to create a new bookmark
Actual Results:
After dropping, the folder immediately closes.

Expected Results:
The folder should stay open for x millisecond (e.g., 2000 m = 2 secs) so the user can verify that (a) the bookmark wa really placed there (good feedback practice, and a natural human distrust of computers), and (b) the dropped bookmark wa placed in the correct location (this is exacerbated by there not being an indicator for the drop-target).

It would also be nice if, while the folder is still open, the user could perform action on the open folder (e.g., go-to/edit/delete/move a(nother) bookmark).
