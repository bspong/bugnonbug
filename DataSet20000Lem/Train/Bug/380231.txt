Hi,
Every time I download an attachment from any email on Gmail, the chat get disconnected.
On this same machine (Windows XP), I can download attachment in IE 6.0.29 without being disconnected, whereas I consistently get disconnected from chat on Firefox 2.0.0.3.
I run Ubuntu Feisty on my usual PC with Firefox 2.0.0.3 and I have the same issue there.
My boyfriend run Windows XP and Firefox 2.0.0.3 (not sure which version) and ha the same issue. When he tried under IE 6.0.28, he did not have the issue.
My friend run Windows XP and Firefox 1.5 and doe not have the issue.
I don't remember having the issue until recently so I think it may have to do with the newer version of Firefox...
