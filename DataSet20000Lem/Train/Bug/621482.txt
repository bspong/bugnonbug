Before submitting the test data "A week in the life of a browser", I attempted to export the data to csv. This function caused Firefox to freeze on 4.0b7 and 4.0b8.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Test pilot open and say it's time to submit test data.
2.I open the test form and click the export button (csv) so I can have a look before sending. Firefox freeze everytime.
3.Can't wait more than 5 minutes, so I kill the process.
Actual Results:
Nothing out of the ordinary. Just following prompt on Test Pilot dialog.

Expected Results:
Expected to get to look at the data before deciding to send out.

Should have not frozen. Should have exported and then sent data after I told it to. But I didn't tell it to because I couldn't see the data.

I don't mind helping with the study, but I won't send anything I can't look at first. Just sayin'.

I chose major below because I figured it wa important for you to fix if you are relying on this data from folk to decide how to develop your program. Doesn't seem to be dangerous or anything like that. I would suggest adding an "Important" option in the Severity list.
