After using forebord for about 2 weeks, I can no longer launch the app under KDE
3.1.2. Launching the app result in several hung process which look normal
but there is no user interface displayed.

Launching the app a root still works. I have deleted all .phoenix directory
and also re-installed under gentoo linux by re-emerging the package.

I created a new user on the system and attempted to launch firebird under the
new account, but had the same result.

Again, firebird worls fine when run a "root".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch "MozillaFireBird &"
2. Screen Never Displays
3. su - root
4. Launch "MozillaFireBird &"
5. Everything is normal

Actual Results:
The process show a running:

21920 pts/2 S 0:00 | \_
/usr/lib/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin
21922 pts/2 S 0:00 | \_
/usr/lib/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin
21923 pts/2 S 0:00 | \_
/usr/lib/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin
21924 pts/2 S 0:00 | \_
/usr/lib/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin
21925 pts/2 S 0:00 | \_
/usr/lib/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin

but no user interface is displayed.

Expected Results:
The user interface should display normally.

I had been using Phoenicity theme - which still work when launched a "root".
