When FF is set to start up with window and tab from the last session, new subsequent window are not properly dealt with.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
One of two thing could happen:

1.If the Home Page URL setting is blank, then it will default to Google/FF search page and write that URL into the field. Writing data in that field without user knowledge is not acceptable.

2.If the Home Page URL is populated then it us that. But FF wa told not to start with Home Page URL, it wa told to start with window and tab of last time.

Expected Results:
An option of what URLs to use when a new window (crtl-n) is activated after start up

The way around it is to use "about:blank" in the Homepage. But then the Homepage button is now rendered useless.

Startup URL and new window URL should have different behaviours. I do not need 3 of the same page for three new window opened, some might.
