Firefox break Windows shell handler for URLs, htm. html files, and Internet shortcut
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.10.1/Firefox%20Setup%201.0PR.exe

After installing Firefox 1.0PR on my Windows Server 2003 machine, I chose the
option to use Firefox a my default browser. Immediately all .htm and .html
files, embedded URLs in program Internet shortcut caused Firefox to launch,
which is the expected behaviour. However I cannot restore these handler sto what
they were before installing Firefox. If I choose to revert to IE a my default
browser, the handler are still set to use Firefox. IE never prompt me with the
dialog asking if I want to set it a the default browser. If I uninstall
Firefox, all the handler are broken. I lose the ability to launch .htm or
Internet shortcuts. The icon for .htm file and Internet shortcut are
displayed a the "unknown program" icon.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 1.0PR using the Windows installer.
2. In Firefox Options -> check Firefox a the default browser.
3. Unnstall Firefox,

Actual Results:
All .htm,.html files, URL and Internet shortcut are broken. Clicking on any one
of them brings up a dialog asking you "what program shuold you use to run this
file"

Expected Results:
Firefox should aloow handler for these object to be changed to other browsers.
When it is uninstalled, these handler should revert back to what they were
before installing Firefox

This problem appears to be the way Firefox is registering handler for Windows
shell objects. It is doing it in a manner that other program cannot change the
handlers. When firefox is uninstalled, other program cannot take over the
handler for these objects, possibly because firfox ha deleted the original
handler and created new one with new CLSIDS. The only way to solve this is to
do a reinstall of IE.
