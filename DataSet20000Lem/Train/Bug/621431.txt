I am trying to move a folder so I select the sub-folder and select Cut from within the Bookmarks menu.

When selecting a folder first, before selecting Paste the folder previously cut, the folder is pasted to it parent folder, whilst it would have been expected that it would be pasted within the sub-folder that wa selected.
When shutting down the browser after selecting Cut, a bookmark simply disappears, rather than being restored to the original location.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Bookmarks (a bookmark hierarchy with a lot of folder and sub-folders)
2. Browse to a sub-folder, and, Cut from the context menu.
3. Browse to another sub-folder, select the sub-folder, and, select Paste from the context menu.
Actual Results:
The sub-folder is pasted to the parent folder of the selected folder.

Expected Results:
The sub-folder should be pasted within the selected folder, and, ideally the folder are automatically sorted in a pre-defined order (e.g. alphabetic/numerical).

When shutting down the browser after selecting Cut, a bookmark simply disappears, rather than being restored to the original location.
