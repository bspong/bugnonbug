When you stream medium (such a in Windows Media Player), the request sends out two packet with the same GET request. The second packet includes a header packet-pair-experiment=1 and pipeline-experiment=1. This is all normal. The bug is that the second request doe NOT retain the original session of the first request, thus the request sent to the server is recognized seperately. This is not a problem in most cases, but in case where the server need to know the session (such a protected video files), the bug will not let the video plugin retain the session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Embed a video player such a Windows Media Player
2. Request a video on a server that us session
3. Notice that the session IDs are different between packets, not a problem in other browser

Actual Results:
The session is NOT retained between requests.

Expected Results:
The session IDs in the request packet should be identical.
