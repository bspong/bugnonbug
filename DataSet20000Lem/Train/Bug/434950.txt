I have fresh install of FC 9 that come preloaded with firefox3.0.beta5. I had a machine crash due to shutdown of the NIS server with firefox opened. On restarting firefox it gave the usual message "Another firefox is running". I cleared up the profile file and started my FF. It start up but with the entire upper region with the exception of home button is inactive. The address bar and google bar doe not respond anymore while all other icon are greyed out.

I tried reinstalling FF but the same error recurs. This doe happens when I work a the root user. I have no clue on why this happens.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.It happened due to a hard boot of the machine with firefox opened.
Actual Results:
1.address bar ha become inactive
2.google bar is inactive
3.All button in the toolbar with exception of home and tab have greyed out.


As a root user i do not have the above said problems. It work normally.
I feel there is some configuration file located outside .mozilla that brings about this problem. I tried moving all user config file and restarting FF but the same problem repeated.
