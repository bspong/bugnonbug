Add telemetry probe for activeTicks
Vladan asked me to add a telemetry probe for activeTicks (currently probed for FHR).

I experimented a bit with activeTicks and noticed the following:

1. It's considered active a long a the mouse pointer hovers the browser (even if the user is away from the computer).

2. It's considered inactive a long a the mouse pointer is not over the Firefox window.

The combination of the above could result in highly biased and misleading value IMO.

As for what value should be probed, I'm also not sure. Could be:

1. Identical number to activeTicks which FHR collects.
2. Percentage of activity at shutdown (probably 100 * 5 * activeTicks / totalTime)
3. More than one value, possibly including 1 or 2 above, or other values.

As for the magic constant 5 at #2, I think it's defined at http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/events/EventStateManager.cpp#101 , and I'm pretty sure it's not accessible from outside this file and isn't meant to be exposed.

We could either try to expose it (lots of hassle), or duplicate it at session.jsm and add appropriate comment on both places, or accumulate the [in]activity duration independently at onActivity (observer for active and inactive notifications) at session.jsm. I implemented the last approach locally and it seems to collect the value well.

Vladan, thought on how you want to proceed here?
