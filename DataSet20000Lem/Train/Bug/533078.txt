upnpapicli.dll & avmcsock.dll are both version 4.0.103.2001 and belong to an extension (see url) provided by AVM GmbH (http://www.avm.de/en/company/profile.html & http://www.avm.de/en/company/adresses.html).
the extension give a user access via UPnP to the AVM router ("FRITZ!Box").

by http://crash-stats.mozilla.com/query/query?product=Firefox&version=ALL%3AALL&date=&range_value=1&range_unit=weeks&query_search=signature&query_type=contains&query=upnpapicli.dll&do_query=1 you can see that 3.0.0.x, 3.5.x, 3.6.x and Trunk are affected by the crashes. the comment (german only, since the main target audience of AVM product is germany) indicate crash during Fx shutdown.

in the install.rdf you can see:
em:id="{ec8030f7-c20a-464f-9b0e-13a3a9e97384}"
em:minVersion="1.5"
em:maxVersion="4.0"

Since the Addon wa last updated 21.07.2009 i presume a checkin (landed on all three branch after that date) made this addon crashing Fx now.
