User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)

When I Load a web Page (i.g. Yahoo! Mail: http://mail.yahoo.com) most of the picture do not load. When I open the Yahoo! Mail page to sign in the Sing in Seal Backround color won't show. When I attempt to change the Seal color the "color selecion" color won't show. I've noticed that a lot of the pager won't load correctly also. Yahoo! is the most noticable. Also, the icon and some of the text won't show.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto Mail.yahoo.com
2. Click on the Sign in Seal to change the color
3. Click on the TEXT seal
4. Type anything into the text
5. Click on the fatue to change the color
Actual Results:
When the Page load, it will look poorer quality, the color selection should not show.

Expected Results:
I should be able to see the diffrent colors. THe page also should have a better qulity look. Same with the other sites.

I wa using the Default theme, and the default add-on (i.g. The Dictionary, the TalkBack feature, and the google toolbar). I also recently Downloaded and installd the User Agent Switcher, it did not help. I use Windows XP, and meet all the system requirements.
