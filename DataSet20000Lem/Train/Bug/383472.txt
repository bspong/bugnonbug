If you have an iframe displayed inside a wrapper div (with overflow:hidden) and use javascript to reduce the height of the wrapper, then change one of the margin of the iframe so that part of it is outside the previous bound of the wrapper, any part of the iframe's document that is not now within the previous bound of the wrapper div will be left on the display even though it is outside the current bound of the wrapper div.

If you refresh the display by resizing the window or moving another window over the residue, it will disappear.

It doesn't matter if you change the wrapper height of the iframe's margin first.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit the URL noted, or construct a similar page
2.Move mouse over "Products" to display the iframe
3.Move mouse out to hide the iframe a described.
Actual Results:
100px of the iframe's document body (the amount by which the top margin wa changed) is left above the previous bound of the wrapper div.

Expected Results:
The iframe should disappear completely since the wrapper div now ha a height of 0px and overflow:hidden.

The process described is how the mooTools Fx.Slide effect work - or, more specifically, doesn't work :)
