installing mozilla from source give wrong result for pkg-config mozilla-nss

[Sorry if I chose the wrong component for this]

After mozilla is installed from source (using "make install", a mozilla-nss.pc
file is installed. For example, on my system, pkg-config --cflags mozilla-nss give

-I/usr/local/mozilla/include/mozilla-1.6a/nss
-I/usr/local/mozilla/include/mozilla-1.6a/nspr

However, the /usr/local/mozilla/include/mozilla-1.6a/nss directory doe not
actually exist. This ha been observed with a couple of recent source tarballs
(e.g., 20030921, 20030923) on the mozilla web site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a source tarball
2. Build and install mozilla
3. Run pkgconfig --cflags mozilla-nss and verify whether the reported directory
exists

Actual Results:
pkgconfig report non-existent directories. This confuses third-party software
(e.g., gaim) whose build process would believe pkgconfig, that mozilla-nss is
installed properly.

Expected Results:
Either the mozilla-nss.pc file not be installed, or that the n include file
be installed. Manually creating the directory and copying the .h file over
seems to work, so perhaps the latter is the correct behaviour.

install --version report fileutils 4.1
