When trying to upgrade Firefox manually (i.e. not by apt-get for my distro) from 3.5.1 to 3.5.3, I tried help -> check for updates.

As per Bug-318855, this won't work unless you run firefox a root. This trash the ownership of some of the file in my normal user profile, and to get firefox to work correctly again, you have to change the ownership

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login a a normal user
2. Run "sudo firefox"
3. Run "check for updates" and let it upgrade
4. Quit firefox
5. Run a normal user
6. Watch the error message appear
Actual Results:
Firefox put a big red banner across the top of the screen and tell me that my profile is damaged in some way.

It doe give helpful links, although the actual solution is at least 3 click away.

Expected Results:
Firefox should work a before (with upgrades). In the background, this mean that when using sudo firefox and running the upgrade (and I would guess anything else while run this way), firefox should put the ownership of the file within the profile in use back to the original owner.

I suspect a proper fix for Bug-318855 will handle this automatically.

Also, the documentation could be improved - a someone who understands Unix, it's mildly annoying that I am referred to a web-page that list my problem, but then tell me to go somewhere else (referring to "find my profile"). If there's a known issue, the fix should be detailed in one place. This is worse for a normal user - there's no "go ask your root guy to fix it" or guide to how to fix the ownership of the profile files.
