Browsing from one website to another, or even clicking link will bring both the tab label, favicon on the tab and in the location bar and even the location URL out of sync. All of these can be incorrect from one site to another, or even when switching tabs. Feature broke in beta 2 and is still present in beta 3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a website address to any site
2. Click on a link to another html page
3. Enter an address to another site
4. Switch tab
Actual Results:
Step 2 show the same address.
Step 3 may show the same favicon from step 1 in the tab bar
step 4 may show the wrong title and doe not correspond with the title at the top of the page

Expected Results:
The correct address, icon and title should be shown at all relevant location at all time

Attaching a screenshot. Notice that (a) show the favicon a (d) (Purple Row, www.purplerow.com) which is incorrect. (b) is sometimes showing the incorrect title and doesn't match (e) (not present in this screenshot). (c) is showing the incorrect address. The address that should be shown is http://www.lakewood.org/index.cfm?&include=/PW/traffic_eng/index.cfm
Also note that (a) and the icon in (c) doe not match.
