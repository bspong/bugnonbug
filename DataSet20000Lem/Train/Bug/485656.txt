If you have a misspelled word, and paste over part of it, still leaving at least the first letter, but still going over the end of the word, the pasted part will never be marked a misspelled, but the un-changed letter will always be marked a misspelled. A period must also be at the end of the paste for this to occur. The only way to clear it is to remove the period

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy any random text to the clipboard with a period at the end
2. Paste it over any misspelled text, not pasting over the beginning of the word and you must paste over the end of the word
Actual Results:
The letter not affected by the paste will be marked a misspelled, but the letter affected by the paste will be marked a correctly spelled, even if they aren't. This will not be corrected unless the period at the end is removed and put back in.

Expected Results:
The spell-check should check the entire word, and either flag it a entirely correct or incorrect
