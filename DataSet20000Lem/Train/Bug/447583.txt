When two applet run in a single html page and applet try to open a frame(JFrame) or non-model dialog(JDialog), the frame and non-model dialog go behind the browser window. Initially it should pop-up in front of browser window. Frame and non-model dialog get open but a it is going behind browser window, it look like it ha not opened.
