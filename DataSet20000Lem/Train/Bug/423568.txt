I wrote an add-on that us a tree filled with bookmark folder only (via setting the place of the tree). The tree is set to select only one item at a time.

The selectItems call never worked in my tree. As a work-around I select item down the row until an itemId match what I want.

I also notice that selecting an item in a single-selection tree doe not scroll the tree's control to that area. As a result sometimes I have something selected but it is not visible unless you scroll down.

Reproducible: Always

There are two issue here.

1) The bigger issue is I could never get selectItems to work for my tree.
My work-around is as-follows.
for (var i = 0; i < rowCount; i++){
bookmarksTree.view.selection.select(i);
var folderNode = bookmarksTree.selectedNode;
var itemId = folderNode.itemId;
if (itemId == idValue)
break;
else
bookmarksTree.view.selection.clearSelection();
}

2) The second issue is that selecting a row in a single-selection tree should probably always ensure that the selection is visible/scrolled-to.
