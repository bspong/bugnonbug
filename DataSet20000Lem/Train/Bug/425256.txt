Folks,

I just upgraded to: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13

I am operating an iMac G3 266 mhz with 512 mb Ram and OS 10.3.9.

Tabs don't work. Open a new tab, type in the URL, and you get a blank page with a little bit of the page you think you were opening on the left margin of the screen.

I know this bug ha been reported before, but what the hell is the purpose of reporting bug if you don't do anything about them? If I could figure out how to send a screen shot I would. Maybe that might spur you open source guy to action. Maybe I should just stick with Safari.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open New Tab
2.
3.
Actual Results:
You see the URL in the box and a little bit of what should be the opened tab in the left margin.



Expected Results:
Seeing a regular window with a tab up above it
