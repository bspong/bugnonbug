Whenever the Bookmarks menu contains more bookmark than fit on the screen so
that there appear up and down arrow for scrolling, the following strange
behavior occurs:
One can drag a bookmark in a bookmark folder if and only if one ha completely
scrolled to the top of the Bookmarks menu. If one ha scrolled down a little
bit, one can only drag bookmark around within the top level menu, but one
cannot move them into deeper level (by moving them onto folders).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill up the Bookmark menu with more bookmark that fit on the screen so that
up and down arrow appear in the Bookmarks menu.
2. Scroll down a little bit so that one is not at the top of the Bookmarks list
anymore.
3. Try to move one of the bookmark into one of the folders.

Actual Results:
It is impossible to drag it into one of the folders.

Expected Results:
It should always be possible to not only drag bookmark around but also drag
them into folder in the Bookmarks menu.
