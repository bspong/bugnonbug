Firefox freeze on launch, even after total reinstall or launch in safe mode
User-Agent: Opera/9.63 (Macintosh; PPC Mac OS X; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0.6

I downloaded (ie upgraded to) Firefox 3.0.6 a few day ago, more or le concurrently (I can't say which wa first) with getting the latest Mac patch for OSX 10.4.11. All worked fine until the day before yesterday (16 Feb) when, for no reason I can think of, Firefox (which wa running at the time though my Mac wa not in use) lost all it log-in information. I simply went to the machine, woke it from sleep, and all of my logins were unrecognised, though the password were still there in Firefox prefs. Last night, Firefox crashed and would not restart. It ha refused to restart since (hangs on restart every time, sometimes getting a step or two further than other times). Have tried accessing profile manager - Firefox freeze a soon a I invoke the program. Have uninstalled FF and every file with a FF/Mozilla connection, then reinstalled - same result. Have reinstalled every trace, I hope, of the only program I downloaded yesterday, which wa a trial version of Intego anti-virus. And I repaired permission and, well, just about everything, really. Maybe this is not a bug, but my system. However, I have run Disk First Aid, Norton and Disk Warrior, and ho problem are reported.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Double-click on Firefox app icon (in dock or apps folder)
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Program sometimes launch opening window without accessing home page, sometimes doe nothing at all except to freeze. Difficult to regain access to finder and other programs.

Expected Results:
Launched, I would have hoped. I've been a relatively untroubled Firefox user for quite a few years, and I'm desperate to solve this

Here are crash report for the time in question
