The Bookmark function doe not allow you to select the destination Folder.

I liked the old bookmark functionality. Please reinstate it. The new bookmark function in Firefox 3.5.5 doe not give you the option to select the folder where you want the bookmark to reside. It asks you where you want it to reside, but then the program doe not allow you to select the destination folder. This is very frustrating and cumbersome. The only awkward fix is to let FireFox put it where it want to, and then later, drag the bookmark to the correct destination folder. Very awkward considering older version of Firefox worked just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select bookmark this page from Bookmarks on toolbar
2.Select Bookmarks menu, then the Choose folder icon doe not work
3.Select Bookmarks Menu in desperation and it put it in the Recently bookmarked folder. That's when I drag the new bookmark to the destination folder I originally wanted. Very time consuming and awkward.
Actual Results:
I get the bookmarked page in multiple location so it clutter up my bookmark menu.

Expected Results:
I could put the bookmarked page in the folder of my choice to keep them organized.

It just seems a if the entire bookmark area doesn't really work. After upgrading to FireFox 3.5.5. I lost all my old bookmarks. I am very disappointed.
