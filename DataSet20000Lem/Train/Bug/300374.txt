render mode depends on the number of leading (irregular) character

On the link written above I made two file available. Both of them are
irregular, i.e. they do not compliant to the standards.

Both of them ha a lot of "a" letter before the DOCTYPE definition, so this
DOCTYPE definition should be ignored by the browser. The difference between them
is only the number of "a" character before the DOCTYPE definition.

In the main part of the html file there is a table with an empty and a
non-empty cell.

My problem is that the two file are rendered differently, the first one (
http://www.webcenter.hu/~halmai/illustration/empty_cells/with_border.html )in
"Standards compliance mode" and the other one (
http://www.webcenter.hu/~halmai/illustration/empty_cells/without_border.html )
in "Quirks mode".

Thanks to the different rendering mode the empty cell is rendered deiiferently:
with border in the first and without border in the second case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit the
http://www.webcenter.hu/~halmai/illustration/empty_cells/with_border.html page
2. visit the
http://www.webcenter.hu/~halmai/illustration/empty_cells/without_border.html page
3. compare them visually.



Expected Results:
I think the number of "a" character should not influent the rendering mode. If
there is at least one "a" character then it should ignore my DOCTYPE, otherwise
it should not.
