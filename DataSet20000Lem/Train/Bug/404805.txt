Launching Thunderbird while FireFox3 is running cause big problem
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: FireFox 3 Beta 1

I downloaded the new beta 1 and launched it. All looked good. I launched Thunderbird (latest version) and about 15-30 second later, my hardrive began to run contantly. I checked the task manager, and the PF count wa around 1.4GB, which is triple the norm for me. It wa FireFox.exe, though, that wa running wild. It wa pulling six figure on my process list and climbing rapidly. It sapped the RAM pretty bad and everything slowed to a crawl. It would not shut down on it own, so I had to reboot. I then tried to open FireFox 3B1 in safe mode. Everything wa fine until I started Thunderbird. Then the same thing happened. I had to reboot again to stop the process. I'm going to run FireFox or Thunderbird separately to see if it doe it again. I'm sending you this from the dreaded IE7. By the way, the latest stable build of FireFox 2 run fine with my Thunderbird, or at least it did before I installed 3B1. I'll be checking that out, too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch FireFox 3B1
2. Launch latest version of Thunderbird
3. Monitor drive activity
Actual Results:
Just do the above and watch the fun.

Expected Results:
Drive ran constantly, memory wa drained.

I didn't see a place for it above, so...I'm running a Dell Inspiron 9300, latest build of Win XP, 1GB RAM.
