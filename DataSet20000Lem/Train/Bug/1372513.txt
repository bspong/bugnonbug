V54 doe not load Google notification
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0
Build ID: 20170608105825

Steps to reproduce:

I got a problem with the v54, somewhat similar to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1264251 This problem did not occur with the last V54 beta I used (maybe 13, updated last week).

Go to www.google.de or www.google.com.

Being logged on, I see a red circle with a white number with Google notification in the upper right corner, next to my profile image.

Click on the red circle.

Remarks:
-I do not see error in the JavaScript console.
-Could be a network condition, but it worked with beta and directly after updated to v54 it stopped working. In the network trace I see one cryptic request, resulting in a 204, i.e. empty response, and occasionally a request to notifications.google.com not succeeding, i.e. going on for minutes. Update: Found a rarely notebook with V54b7 and it succeeds to load the notification from within the same network.



Actual results:

Popup opens, but doe not show content.

After some timeout popup suggests a page reload. This doe not help.


Expected results:

Popup shall show my notifications.
