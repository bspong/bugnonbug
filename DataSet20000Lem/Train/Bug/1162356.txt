Favicon of first and/or last bookmark in folder doe not initially appear in Bookmarks Library
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
Build ID: 20150415140819

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open Bookmarks Library
2. Left-click on any folder in the tree


Actual results:

Bookmarks in the folder appear, but the favicon of the first and/or last bookmark in the folder do not appear. The space for the favicon is completely empty (not the dashed box that is used for site without favicons). Sometimes it is the first bookmark, sometimes the last, sometimes both. Almost never happens to bookmark except the first or last in a folder. On rare occasions, it happens to the second bookmark in a folder.

This happens about 5-10% of the time, and appears random.

Simply selecting another folder, and then re-selecting the folder with the missing favicons will make them reappear. Also, hovering the cursor over a bookmark missing it's favicon will cause the favicon to appear.

Note 1: As indicated by the workaround above, the bookmark certainly have favicons assigned.
Note 2: The folder and timing of when this happens seems to be random. It will happen on different folder at different times. IOW, it doe not seem to be specific to certain folder or bookmarks.


Expected results:

Favicons of all bookmark (that have favicons) should always be displayed within the Bookmarks Library.
