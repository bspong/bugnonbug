User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.71 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Tried to apply a CCK2 auto configuration collection of file to the Firefox.app bundle in the location that have worked for previous Firefox version ie
Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/browser
Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/defaults
Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/distribution



Actual results:

These file location no longer exist in 34.0.5.
The location of these folder ha been moved from the MacOS folder to the Resources folder.
As a result, the package used to deploy CCK2 autoconfig profile to previous version of Firefox, doe not work on v34.0.5



Expected results:

Change of internal file/folder structure noted on release note would have been handy to know in advance.

As shown in the screen shot attached, the previous version of firefox is on the left, the new 34.0.5 is on the right. The structure of the folder ha changed. This affect tool such a the CCK2. If this change is expected behaviour, then could note be provided alerting administrator of this change
