Browser try to open PHP Files from the cache (that were never cached) when restarted.

Screenshot of Popups showing inability to open cached ".php.part" file (that wa never cached).

When restarting Aurora (and I use TM+) the Tabs will reload but sometimes the Browser will try to open PHP Files, both without the Browser's Popup asking if you want to save them AND at other time it doe offer to let you save them.


THIS Bug Report is about the reloading of Temporary Files (from the User's Hard Drive, not a remote Server) that are ".php.part" type Files. It would seem from the Popup that the File wa never cached in the first place, and so it could not be reopened (if that were desired); because it is a ".php.part" File it can not be opened in any event (and so there is no "Browser Popup" offering to "Save the File", only a Popup saying the (uncached File) can not be read (from the cache?)).

It seems (based on the File Name, in this example) to have something to do with a "Like Button" on the Web Page. I have also seen it occur with other file (not derived from a "Like Button").


A similar (but not identical Bug, since that involves someone else's Server, and this BR involves Files cached on the User's Hard Drive) is Bug 336419 (which wa resolved invalid).


The Browser's action cause multiple Popups on the User's Screen.

Enclosed is a Screenshot showing two Popups.
