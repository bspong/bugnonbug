Firefox allocating 30MB or more memory to a random plugin

When browsing with Mozilla Firefox, Firefox allocates about 40MB to
libjavaplugin_oji.so. This without having to use the java plugin actually (for
instance on www.google.com). Sometimes this amount is even larger.
Last time this wa the same, but with libasound.so



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Browse to google.com (and perhaps around between www.tweakers.net and
google.com, a in my case. Both site do not use Java, tweakers.net might use
Shockwave Flash)
3. Start gnome-system-monitor
4. Rightclick on the 'firefox-bin' entry and choose memory "division"? (using
Dutch Gnome, it's "geheugenverdeling")

Actual Results:
libjavaplugin_oji.so (or any other random plugin, for instance libasound.so) ha
about 40MB of memory assigned, in 4 part (4x10240KB), without this plugin being
used.

Expected Results:
Not assign these amount of memory to unused plugins.

I make use of the Tabbrowser extension, MFF 1.0PR1, and Fedora Core 2 on Gnome.
