[e10s] Firefox hang or crash when opening and closing 50 tab
Hi,

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/xnotifier/

130k user so might be a problem with it being an option on the newest nightlies...

This addon wa working perfectly with 0 crash before the beginning of August with e10's enabled. I had reported it a a working addon when arewee10syet.com first started, yet somethings recently changed.

Now it work like it should, however I can easily reproduce a crash with this addon under certain conditions. Again, this ha only happened since around the 12th of August or so (I can't pinpoint the exact changeset).

1. Install this addon and set it up with a gmail account etc
2. Open a new e10's window and either A. Open a ton of bookmark or B. run the Membench benchmark.
3. After many tab have been opened, right click on one of the opened tab and click "close other tabs".
4. The plugin-container.exe go to 0% CPU and firefox stop responding. The RAM use drop on the child process, which is interesting a something must still be happening. Firefox's main process CPU, at least on my system, sits at 2% like it normally would. If you don't get a crash, repeat step 2 and 3 until it happens. Sometimes it take more than a few attempts.
5. Kill the plugin-container and Firefox start responding and give an "oops the tab ha crashed" error.

I'm not sure why this only started happpening recently or how this addon even is effected by unrelated tab closing but who knows?

Chris, I had emailed you about this problem. This is the problem addon I wa trying to diagnose.

I can reproduce this easily so if you'd like screenshots etc please let me know.

Thanks
