I use Comcast web mail to access my mail. I often save my email by going to print, which open an new window. I cancel the print, and then do a 'Save As'.

If I do this multiple time in a session (somewhere over 40 email saved), Mozilla tell me that it cannot open the separate window. I cannot tell Mozilla at this point to allow a pop-up to this window, since it ha told me it is allowed to open windows.

If I log off and log back in, everything work properly, until you try to save another 40 or so email

It look like an overflow of a parameter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Comcast web mail
2.Go to print an email, cancel the print and do a 'save as' to save the email
3.Do this multiple time until the failure happens (over 40 times).
4. Log off and log back in; the problem go away until the next 40 or so email are attempted to be saved.
Actual Results:
The error still occurs

Expected Results:
I should be allowed to save a many email a I want, without having to log off.
