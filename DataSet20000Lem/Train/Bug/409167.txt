The version string in The About Window should be darker than it is currently.

I wa trying to solve a problem my friend is facing with Firefox. To ensure that he is using latest version of Firefox, I asked him what version of Firefox he us and instructed him to open "About Mozilla Firefox" from "Help" menu. He said he wa using "5.0"! I surprised and asked him where did he see that. What he wa looking is this: "Mozilla/5.0 ..." in the UA string. And, later he figured out the version number correctly.

Then I myself opened the About window to see why he failed to see the version number in the first place. It's dull in light grey. It's not a conspicuous a it need to be, despite the text 'version'. If you didn't know where the Firefox version number will be on that dialog, it's not the first thing you are going to look at.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Help menu
2. Then click on "About Mozilla Firefox"
Actual Results:
The version string in the About dialog is light and not conspicuous.

Expected Results:
The version string should have been darker, so that it will be conspicuous.
