On OS X, with the mighty mouse, I can click on the "middle button" on a link in most browsers, and it will open that link in a new tab. In fact, I can do that in firefox, EXCEPT if my finger slips, and I miss the link, then this virtual scrolling thing come up, and act like a 2d scroll wheel.

This is quite annoying. I don't want that virtual scroll wheel. For one, my mighty mouse ha an actual 2d scroll device on it (the middle button is actually a tiny trackball). For two, this function make small mistake into bigger frustration (finger slips, miss the link, and now moving my mouse make my browser scroll all over the page).

I understand that for some people this is a GREAT feature. I don't want it removed entirely. I just want it to easily optional. And, if there's an advanced preference for it, please let me know what it is and how to disable it.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a link
2. Click on the middle button, and slightly slip so that the middle button miss the link
3. Watch your browser window fly around because the virtual 2d scroll wheel is in effect.
Actual Results:
Annoying virtual 2d scroll wheel cause frustration.

Expected Results:
No 2d virtual scroll wheel should activate, because I don't need that feature.
