The AnimationPlayerActor sometimes doesn't retrieve the right duration/delay/iterationCount from the computed-styles
Because the WebAnimations API doesn't yet give u access to an animation delay, duration or iterationCount, the AnimationPlayerActor currently figure this out by looking at the current node's computed style

It get more complex when mutliple animation or transition are defined on the node because then the computed delay may be a string like "1s, 5s, 2s" for instance, and so we have to split it by "," and figure out at which index of the split string array the right value is.

For now, what we've been doing is:
- when we retrieve the list of animation from the WebAnimations API, we get an array of AnimationPlayer objects,
- we just remember the index of each of these object and use this index to parse the style string

But, imagine a node with 3 animations, and one of them ha ended.
Now you get the list of AnimationPlayers using WebAnimations API. It will give you an array with 2 entry only, since it doe not return animation that have ended (note that this may change in the future).
So using the index of this array to parse the style string won't work anymore.

So the proposal here is to use the AnimationPlayer's name, then parse the computedStyle.animationName property, to find the name there, and get the index from this instead.

Of course this won't work with cs transition because they have no name, and the WebAnimations API doesn't give u the name of the transitionProperty (which we could have used instead in a similar way). But for transitions, we can continue on using the current solution.

This mean that we partly have to live with this problem in some situations, but not all.

Having said this, I believe it's not a huge deal to live with this for now. The panel is in it alpha state for now, and so is the WebAnimations API implementation anyway. Things will get better in time.
