Window already open, even if I open it first time?

I have a problem regarding the site matrixmails.com . Its a GPT (get paid to) site and it ha a PTC (paid to click) section, where you can open one ad at a time and a 30 sec timer run down until 0. Then you can confirm it, receive some small cash and click the next one.

So when I log in into the site and open my FIRST PTC window, it tell me that opening only one window is allowed, although I open one window ONLY.

I kept an eye on that issue, but it still not resolved. So can you analyze that problem and solve it please?

Thanks in advance!

PS: Same problem with referral-exchange.com, Neobux.com, BuxWiz.com and other PTC / GPT sites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Register at Matrixmails.com
2. Go to Paid-to-Click
3. Open a PTC advertisement and look at the timer
4. Repeat same step with Buxwiz.com and Neobux.com
Actual Results:
See details.

Expected Results:
Just count the timer down from 30 to 0, no error should appear when opening a new window.
