In the page http://www.cityofangel.com/episodes/summaries/ep3_06.html at the
start of the second paragraph in the "Teaser:" section, the first line is not
visible. If I select the text, I can get part of it to appear depending on
which part I select. Viewing the source, some of the text is also not appearing
there.

I've noticed this problem with several site but this is the most consistant
one. Observed with Firefox 0.9.1 but not Mozilla 1.7.2 on Linux.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.cityofangel.com/episodes/summaries/ep3_06.html
2. observe missing text
3. try selecting portion of the missing text

Actual Results:
Text did not appear initially, portion appeared when certain part were selected.

Expected Results:
Display the text initially

I have screen shot of the missing text, the missing text in the source viewer,
and the portion that are made visible in three different selection of the text
that I'll post after filing this bug.
