i enter my Yahoo webmail.

On top of my inbox, two failure notices:
from MAILER-DAEMON@yahoo.com, dated Thursday 2/4, 11:14PM; and
from MAILER-DAEMON@n66.bullet.mail.sp1.yahoo.com, dated Fri 2/5, 6:38PM
- both relate to the failure of delivering a high-volume mail (17MB attached file) to XXX@neuf.fr

No problem with the latter one; but when i open the former one (in the Inbox list, i click on it), i get a separate tab titled "failure notice", with a normal header except that the displayed "To:" field is void, and in the body area appears only this:
<< We're sorry, but there appears to be a problem loading the message "failure notice". Click here to try again >>


i click "Sign Out", the whole Windows system becomes unresponsive for a while: the browser doesn't show any action, i even can't switch to another window (pressing ALT+TAB).
After, say, half a minute, the following error message window pop up:

<<
A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: http://mail.yimg.com/d/combo?/gx/tr4/js/yui_loader/7ada72c543e372c24d155a1e1f194ca8_1.js&/gx/tr4/js/combo/init/us/799f6eb3597816876e74a0001027fa67_1.js&/pim/r/dclient/cg272_7/js/us/strings.js&/pim/r/dclient/cg272_7/js/main/main.js&/bc/bc_2.0.4.js&/pim/r/dclient/cg272_7/js/openmail_init/openmail_init.js&/pim/r/dclient/cg272_7/js/openmail_idle/openmail_idle.js:659
>>
|Stop script| |Continue|

and after still quite a moment the system get responsive again (i can switch to another window - without clicking either button of the popup; the browser display the Yahoo home page). During all these latency i can see with the Task Manager in the taskbar's tray that the CPU is near 100% loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. within a Yahoo webmail account send a mail with an 17-MB MP3 file attached to <somebody>@neuf.fr
2. 48 hour later, check your Yahoo webmail: in the Inbox, you should see two failure notice
3. click on the former failure notice
Actual Results:
<< We're sorry, but there appears to be a problem loading the message "failure notice". Click here to try again >>

Clicking 'Sign out', the whole system hangs.

Expected Results:
show the failure notice message content

Normal function continued

on same Windows 7 platform, tried with IE8 and though it hanged a lot, the failure notice message finally wa displayed fully.

*** failure notice content is: ***
*** << Sorry, couldn't deliver blah-blah >>, ***
*** followed by the whole mail at stake ***
*** - including the 17-MB attached data, a ASCII-7 text ***
