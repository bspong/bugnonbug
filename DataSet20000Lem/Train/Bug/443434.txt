slow launch

When I first launch Firefox, it is extremely slow to load a Web page. If I click to open a site and leave it alone for 5 or so minutes, it work speedily. If I try to do anything with Firefox in the interim, such a opening a new tab, the app typically freeze and I have to force it to close.

What happened to me happened this morning to a co-worker. Both of u applied the same solution: We downgraded to version 2.x, and the speed we had lost returned.

Also, this sound very much like what happened to the Linux user who entered report 417998.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click to launch FF 3.
2.Click on a URL.
3.Watch FF not work, or try to do anything else and watch the delayed response.
Actual Results:
Firefox worked very slowly.

Expected Results:
Like version 2.x, it should load speedily.

Before I gave up and went back to 2.x, I also stripped out all the extension I had put in (Searchbar Autosizer, Abduction, and the print to PDF extension which I can't remember the name of. Also I didn't have any theme running.), but this helped only minimally. At one point I also applied an ad blocker and Flash animation blocker, and that helped a one would expect, but it didn't solve the whole problem.
