Endless redirect loop when loading Gmail

This started with the 2/14/09 build of Firefox 3.1b3pre. Any time I try to visit http://www.gmail.com or https://www.gmail.com, I get an error that says:

Redirect Loop
Firefox ha detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.
The browser ha stopped trying to retrieve the requested item. The site is redirecting the request in a way that will never complete.

The only way I found to fix this is to remove all of the google cookies. However, after a few minute when Gmail refreshes the page, the error come back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.1b3pre
2. Visit www.gmail.com
3. Watch the browser try to load the page and then error out when the redirect limit is reached.
Actual Results:
Endless Redirect Loop.

Expected Results:
My email inbox should appear with no errors.

I have been using this profile with no error for a long time, updating my b3pre build on a daily basis with no problem until yesterday. No theme installed other then the default. The only add-on installed are: AdBlock Plus, Download Statusbar, Gmail Manager, Nightly Tester Tools, SearchStatus, SSL Blacklist, Stumbleupon.
