Address bar doesn't take focus fully (trouble with typing URL)

Sometimes, when I try to type the URL in Firefox, I have a problem :
- the first issue is that althoug I click into the box that is intended to contain URL, the URL I type is not written. It is a if I didn't type anything.
- the second issue is that when I've typed the URL and I press enter key, it doesn't make anything. So, I have to click on the green button to make Firefox go to the page I've typed the URL.

These trouble generally stop when I launch a new firefox windows.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the firefox version I have
2. Try to type a URL
3. If the URL you typed appears, try to go to the page by pressing enter key
Actual Results:
Three case :
1. Typing URL ha no effect
2. After typing the URL, striking enter ha no effect
3. All work well

Expected Results:
All work well, that is to say Firefox go to the page I typed the URL after I stroke enter key. This implies that the URL I type is shown.

I'm sorry for the English mistake I made but I'm French)
