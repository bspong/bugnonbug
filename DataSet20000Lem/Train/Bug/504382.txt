Adding a custom word to the dictionary via the "Add to Dictionary" context menu option is not saved across session

If I add a word that is flagged a mis-spelt to the dictionary via the "Add to Dictionary" context menu option, the custom word is remembered for the duration of my session. However, if I close and reopen Firefox the word is flagged a mis-spelt again.
Possibly connected is the fact that the file persdict.dat is not edited/created when a word is added.
I have confirmed this bug on multiple profile and two PCs running Ubuntu 9.04 in both "normal mode" and Safe Mode. I haven't tested a Windows installation though.

Thanks.
