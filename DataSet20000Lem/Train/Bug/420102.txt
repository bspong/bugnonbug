Firefox exhibit strange delay while and immediately after loading a page.

Hi,

I'm having a very strange problem with Firefox trunk build here. While Firefox is loading a page, it seems to get "stuck" at regular intervals: suddenly it becomes unresponsive for 1-2 seconds, during which nothing on the window is updated, the mouse pointer doesn't change shape, and it doesn't respond to click (though it will respond to them once it unfreezes). This behaviour also manifest a few second after the page ha finished loading. After that, Firefox will "stabilize", and be super responsive again up until the point where a new page is loaded, when this start over again. This behaviour also appears when creating/destroying tabs.

When this happens, CPU usage doesn't go up. I.e. Firefox appears to be blocking for something, rather than doing some CPU-intensive work.

A few word about my environment: I'm running Firefox trunk build of my own, at the moment 1-2 day old straight from CVS (but I've also built the released beta and they've exhibited the same problem). This is Linux x86-64, so I'm building Firefox myself because there are no official build for this platform. Here is my current mozconfig:

----------------------------------------
# enable an objdir
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-@CONFIG_GUESS@

# pull the greek language
mk_add_options MOZ_CO_LOCALES=el

# build firefox
. $topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig

# make this a proper firefox build
ac_add_options --enable-official-branding

# optimization
ac_add_options --enable-optimize="-Os -fno-strict-aliasing"
ac_add_options --disable-debug

# graphic toolkit
ac_add_options --enable-default-toolkit=cairo-gtk2
ac_add_options --enable-pango

# static build
ac_add_options --enable-static
ac_add_options --disable-shared
ac_add_options --disable-libxul

# use jemalloc
ac_add_options --enable-jemalloc

# test
ac_add_options --disable-tests

# default language
ac_add_options --enable-ui-locale=el

# use system library when possible
ac_add_options --with-system-jpeg
ac_add_options --with-system-zlib
----------------------------------------

The computer is running Debian unstable, with a fairly recent X server and X driver, on an Intel 945G integrated graphic chipset. My home directory is on AFS. I've tried removing all extension and plugins and it didn't make any difference.

On the same computer, Firefox/Iceweasel 2.0 doe not exhibit the problem. On my home computer (32-bit userland, nVidia binary drivers, no AFS) no version of Firefox exhibit the problem.

Any ideas? Anything I could try? This really make the browser extremely frustrating to use.

Thanks,
Vasilis
