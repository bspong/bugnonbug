Above is the source.
When I open my address book in my yahoo, it appears and then
shift to the left when an ad on the right side appears. No
slider pop up to shift it back so that I cannot access my
address book. It work just fine when I use IE. But I do not
want to have to open IE, ever :)
Thanks for your help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open my yahoo.
2.open my yahoo mail.
3.open address book.
Actual Results:
The address book column shift to the left so that it
cannot be viewed.

Expected Results:
It could not be viewed.

Either have a slider pop up so that the content can be shifted
back into view, or reconfigure the ad so the it appears some place
else, or have the content of the address book not shift when the
ad appears.
