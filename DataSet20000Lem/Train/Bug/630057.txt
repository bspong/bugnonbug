I've found that some page constantly take much CPU time, even in background tabs. This make Firefox very slow to react (e.g. it can take several second to switch a tab).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://strangestone.livejournal.com/110451.html in several tab (in case something change with this page, the problem can also be seen with YouTube, but this is le visible: one probably need more tabs).
Actual Results:
Firefox take more and more CPU time and is more and more slow to react when one open more and more tabs.

Expected Results:
Firefox should always be fast to react. It can possibly take CPU time if need be, but the priority should be such a way that this should not affect the UI responsiveness and/or what happens in the active (foreground) tab.

I wa initially wondering what wa happening, because according to the htop utility, the execution time is almost constant, even when it say that Firefox take 100% CPU time. But it seems to be a bug in htop (perhaps something wrong with threads). The top utility is more reliable; it show that Firefox take CPU time, both in % and in execution time.
