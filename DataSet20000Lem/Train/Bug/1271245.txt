[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 45.0 and up
- Activity Stream 1.0.15

[Affected Platforms]:
- All Windows
- All Mac OS
- All Linux

Prerequisites]:
- Latest Activity Stream add-on version (1.0.15) wa previously installed on a clean profile.

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open the browser with the profile from prerequisites.
2. Visit some website that would appear in "Highlights" section. (eg. 9gag.com)
3. Click the Activity Stream button from the browser toolbar.
4. Observe the "Highlights" tile from the Timeline page.
5. Revisit the website from step #2 after 25 minutes.

[Expected result]:
- If the visited website meet all the requirement for "Highlights", then it should be added to "Highlights" after 30 minutes.

[Actual result]:
- If you revisit the website at every 25 minute then "Highlights" tile will never be populated with the content from the visited website.

[Notes]:
- The issue is reproducible on the New Tab page a well.
- In the current behavior, if 30 minute have passed since last visit, the website is not displayed in "Highlights". It will be displayed only if you visit another website.
- In my opinion, for a better user experience the "Highlights" tile should be updated instantly because the content displayed is related to History.
