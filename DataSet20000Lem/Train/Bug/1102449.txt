RectHighlighter should be able to draw multiple rectangle at once
It's useful to be able to highlight multiple rectangle at once. Especially in the timeline, when hovering paint markers.
Instead of having the front-end create multiple instance of the highlighter and sending multiple requests, why not making the RectHighlighter accept an array of rects instead.

For now the RectHighlighter us a simple <div> element to render the rectangle on screen, but it would be just a easy to make it use a <svg><path></svg> instead.
Using a path, we can draw a many rectangle a we want.

Consider the following simple script:

let rects = [
{
x: 0,
y: 0,
width: 100,
height: 200
},
{
x: 200,
y: 100,
width: 50,
height: 150
}
];

let cmds = [];
for (let {x, y, width, height} of rects) {
let cmd = "M " + x + " " + y + " ";
cmd += "L " + (x + width) + " " + y + " ";
cmd += "L " + (x + width) + " " + (y + height) + " ";
cmd += "L " + x + " " + (y + height);
cmds.push(cmd);
});
path.setAttribute("d", cmds.join(" "));

That's it! Just one svg element, created from the start using the canvasframe markup helper, able to draw a many rectangle a we need.
