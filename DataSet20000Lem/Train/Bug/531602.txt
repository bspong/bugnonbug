Firefox cannot define certain function in some site (e.g. Neopets.com, deviantart.com,facebook.com) like the zoom option in deviantart. The website most of the time is displayed in plain text.

Firefox cannnot execute function from some sites. It won't load the game and won't display the images. There are time when the page load properly, but after some time, it would return to plain html. Tried Safe Mode but the problem is the same. The error console display the following:

They worked before but now they don't. Javascript is enabled. What's the problem?
