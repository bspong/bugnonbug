PDF.js display of file is missing most text

lot of text on bill missing

When I view a statement (bill) from Suddenlink.net, it open in a PDF.js tab. I see the image and ruled line in the bill, but most of the text is missing. However I do see the text for my billing address and the account number. The Linux PDF viewer okular ha no trouble rendering (and selecting, and copying & pasting) the missing text; the Linux utility pdftotext show all the text that pdf.js doe not.

In the Firebug console, I see the output:
PDF 76ee15335036c64c3885045265e40 [1.3 [ClibPDF Library 2.02-r1-2] 301q AIX 4.3 / InfoPrint Solutions Company Afp2Pdf Version: 301q] (PDF.js: 0.7.236)

In Firebug's HTML view I see a div class="textLayer" that contains <divs> containing the few bit of text that I see. But it is also full of dozen of empty divs such a
<div data-canvas-width="0" data-font-name="undefined" style="font-size: 9.11601px; font-family: undefined; left: 75.142px; top: 691.775px;"></div>

I don't want to attach my bill, but I will gladly run any command or analysis on this PDF file that will help.
