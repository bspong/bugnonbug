After installing Firefox 1.0, my computer became very slow everytime I opened
Firefox, then after a few minute I experienced several crash even after
unistalling and reinstalling Firefox. I am really disappointed a Firefox 0.8
worked very well even with XP SP2

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox
2.Click on one of my bookmark
3.Crash

Actual Results:
Firefox stopped responding and I had to press ctrl alt sup to open the task
window and close Firefox manually

Expected Results:
Browse the web a Firefox 0.8 used to do beautifully; so I tried to reinstall
Firefox but it wouldn't work either.

No theme, it wa the virgin Firefox 1.0 version I had just downloaded.
