In 3.0.8 on some window XP boxes, rendering is broken
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

As soon a FF updated to 3.0.8 on on Windows XP SP3 box, the page reached by clicking on www.rephunter.net, and then clicking on Login in the upper right led to a corrupted layout. In checking on 3.0.7 on other XP SP3 box that had not yet been updated showed that the layout is not corrupted.

If there wa a way to upload a screen shot, I could show you the difference. On OS X, the problem doe not occur in either 3.0.7 or 3.0.8, nor in IE6, IE7, or Safari.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run from XP SP3 with FF 3.0.8.
2. Go to www.rephunter.net.
3. Click "Login" in upper right corner of page
Actual Results:
On some window boxes, the layout of the "login block" is corrupted. The proper appearance is to have all the field and text within the border. On the corrupted layout, the text appears wider, especially the "or Email Address", which cause the field to wrap to the next line, and push the content our of the border.

Please note: we have not been able to reproduce this issue on some Windows platforms.

Expected Results:
The appearance of the "login block" should be a it is in any browser other than 3.0.8.

I will attempt to upload a screen shot after submitting.
