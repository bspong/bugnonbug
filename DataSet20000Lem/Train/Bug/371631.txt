Plugins (e.g. Yoono) can read content of secure (https) page and send them to unsecure server

I recently installed Yoono plugin and found to my supprise that I received suggested site even when navigating secure http site -- this suggest that the plugin is able to gain access to the information on the encypted page (undoubtly because it is un-encypted when in the DOM) -- however worse it that since Yoono work base on coorelating page content it suggest that Yoono is able to gain access to some or all of the content, which subsequently is sent (un-unencrypted?) to the Yoono site and store potentially private data which were for my-eyes-only.

Where Yoono doe implement proper security or not is besides the point -- the issue here is that someone can write a less-than-secure plugin which effectively work a spyware in disguise of some useful functionality.

Suggest that user should be forced to speciffically set permission for a plugin to read data obtained a encrypted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Yoono
2. Goto a relative popular http site
3. observe suggestion
Actual Results:
See suggestion in Yoono panel

Expected Results:
Yoono should not be able to see the content of the http site and should not be able to provide any meaningfull suggestion unless provided explicit permission to see the content of http sites.
