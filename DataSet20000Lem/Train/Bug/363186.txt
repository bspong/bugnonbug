Clicking both the left and right mouse button at the same time leaf the right-click menu open (stranded). Additionally, if you go back to the bookmark page, the menu will stay under the bookmark menu even after right-clicking on a new bookmark. The menu will go away when you right-click on a bookmark and then left-click anywhere.

1. left-click the bookmark menu.
2. move the mouse over a bookmark.
3. click both the left and right mouse button at the same time.

The bookmark right-click menu would disappear.

I'm using Gnome 2.14.2 on Gentoo Linux running a binary installation of Firefox 2.0. This is a very low priority bug.
