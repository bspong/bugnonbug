Use an icon and display some text in location bar for about:blocked
The awesome bar should indicate whenever you are on a browser special page (all "about:", error page / warning e. g. "Not Found" and "Phishing attempt").

Right now, it's trivial to fake a browser special page rendered in-content (at least error pages). This allows for phishing / social engineering. When e. g. in-content preference land, the implication will be far greater. This risk is reduced when the change to site identy land in Fx 15. However, the current indication for special page (i. e. on error page the warning sign a "favicon") is not obvious enough for non-trained users.

I've sketched out a proposal, adding a new element in the location bar whenever you are on a special page:

Another possibility (probably better and le intrusive but still remarkable) is reusing the EV site-identy (https://msujaws.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/tumblr_m2xymz9bfz1r47294.png) and have an e. g. orange background + text + warning sign for error ("Not Found"), red background + text + warning sign for warning ("Phishing attempt", "Certificate Error"), and blue background + text + gear icon(?) for in-content preference + _any_ "about:" page (text is "about:" for any "about:" page except "Addon preferences" for "about:addons", "Preferences" for "about:preferences" etc.).
