I changed the favicon.ico graphic on my website, and Fox will not use the new icon.

The icon -does- populate with the new icon if I look at the site content, a mirrored locally, using Fox. My local home page [a separate html page] also us the new, locally stored favicon.ico file, and that works.

The new one also show up in MS IE, locally and on the website.

In an effort to isolate what is going on with FOX, I tried these steps:

1. Deleted the ico file outright, on the web site. Fox still report the old icon. [odd, that!, especially since the new icon is seen by IE, so the site and my ISP aren't caching something, somewhere, I suppose...]
2. Deleted all history reference to the site's page in Fox, hoping this would force use of the new icon.
3. Removed the site's reference from the "Most Visited" Tab
4. Used the "forget about this site" and the delete, inside bookmark where I found any reference to the site. [What is the difference between "Forgetting" and "Deleting", anyway? They both seem to delete a single bookmark, anyway...]
5. Closed/restarted Fox after the above items...

Site and Icon: WWW.ComplianceOfficer.Com/favicon.ico

Where doe Fox store the reference to the old icon?

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
I should see the new icon.
