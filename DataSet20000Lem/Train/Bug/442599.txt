After each 'crash' your message window would appear requesting information a to the cause. I completed this section several times, but due to the number of crash and their duplicity I begin to simply send the notice with blank spaces.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load the FireFox Browser and begin using it.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
There is no way for me to report any actual fact a there is no warning prior to the crash. Varies in term of time before crash or nature of operation during crash.

Expected Results:
What? Starting the browser for general use? I begin using, such a now, and after a period of use program would crash.

What should the software have done instead (of crashing)?? Operated a promised and in same manner a previous version - without indiscriminate crashes. Best of luck in locating the problem a I really favor Fire Fox for browsing. For now I will just keep 'firing it up' after each crash and continue using, but...
