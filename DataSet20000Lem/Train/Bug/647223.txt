Intermittent problem with Firefox not accepting keyboard input. Sometimes accepts 2 or 3 characters, then cursor disappears, and it is a if the keyboard isn't working or isn't linking up, despite keyboard input being accepted by other software. Happens both when trying to type in URL field, and in search form in webpage (various). The time it ha happened have been when I've logged off another user, and logged into my own settings, but my other half ha encountered the same problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I can't suggest a way to reproduce the problem, a it just happens unexpectedly, often having logged off someone else's setting and into mine.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Unable to type anything into URL field and field on webpages.

Expected Results:
I didn't specifically perform 'steps', I simply logged off another user's setting and into mine. I expected to be able to type text into the URL field and field on webpage a usual.

I don't have a theme in my Firefox browser at the moment. For some reason it disappeared!
