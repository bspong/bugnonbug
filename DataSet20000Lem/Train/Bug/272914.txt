Sometimes when you open the top right '>>' for your further Bookmarks and Folder
(that will not fit in the Bookmarks Toolbar) you can only see the icons. All
other info (i.e. Folder Names and Folder with one entry) will be cropped or
fold out to the right side (where i can't see it). Other Folder-Content with
more Bookmarks will fold out to the left, where i can see everthing. But the
Folder Names are allways hidden/cropped. Playing arround with
maximizing/resizing/minimizing the window will not help. I will have an
Screenshot of this behavior

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Produce so much Folder and Bookmarks, that there will shown an the top right
'>>'-Sign
2. Maximize Browser Window
3. Try to 'use' your Folder and Bookmarks

Actual Results:
Folder Icons are shown , but Folder Names an some Bookmarks in this Folder
cannot be reached, since there are fold out to the right (out of my Desktop /
Monitor Solution)

Expected Results:
Normaly i would expect, that the whole 'Block' will be shown a little bit more
to the left, so you can see the whole info icon AND folder names. Further
Navigation in your Bookmarks should fold out to the left.
