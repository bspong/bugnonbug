Impossibility to move search engine bar below address bar
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7

When I try to move Googlebar below the address bar and click "done" the Google bar disappears. I tried to create a new bar named "Googlebar" and place Google search on it but it didn't work again.
You can read the step to reproduce but still - I uploaded a video of the problem taken by HyperCam2. Here's the link:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on the toolbar, select "settings" or "preferences" - I'm not sure what's the English word because my FF is in Bulgarian.
2. Drag Googlebar and drop it just under the addressbar. Now you should see two long bar - the first one is the addressbar and the second one (the longer one) should be Googlebar.
3. On the pop-up window (the one which show all the button one could use) click "done" and watch carefully - Googlebar disappears and there's only the address bar.
The only place I can put Googlebar is on the taskbar but I can't really do it because there's another bug with Googlebar settings.
Actual Results:
"What happened after you performed the step above?" - every time happens exactly the same thing I described above.

Expected Results:
When you place Googlebar or any other bar below the address bar it should remain visible on firefox window.

This bug occurs with all theme (and personas) including the default one.
