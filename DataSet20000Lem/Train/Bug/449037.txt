Display a two-dimensional graph regarding security status when accessing SSL Encrypted site
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008071616 CentOS/3.0.1-1.el5.centos Firefox/3.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008071616 CentOS/3.0.1-1.el5.centos Firefox/3.0.1

I would propose using a two-dimensional grid (image or ASCII equivalent) to describe the security state of an SSL encrypted web-site a a way to communicate to end-users that nature of requiring an SSL over-ride action. (I.E. sec_error_unknown_issuer page) The current Firefox 3 behavior requiring several (although customizable) step to override a certificate from an unverified CA, doe not clearly differentiate the risk of accessing an SSL encrypted page from an unknown issuer a compared to a page with broken or no encryption. An example might look like this:

----------------
Data Encrypted, | | | Data Encrypted,
Identity not Verified | | | Identity Verified by
by trusted CA | | | Trusted Certificate Authority
|----------------|
| | |
Data not Encrypted, | | | Data not Encrypted,
Identity not Verified | | | Identity Verified
---------------- by matching Name Server Record

I believe that this may help communicate the two part nature of valid certificates.
