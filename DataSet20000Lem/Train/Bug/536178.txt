slow image update after hard refresh

I'm developing a browser game and I have a problem after I do a full
refresh (CTRL+F5).

After the user ha pressed Ctrl+F5 once, the window show the "image unavailable" icon initially every time the screen is repainted and *not* just the first time. When the user press f5, the problem go away.

The problem is demonstrated in the following video:

I have already discussed the problem here:

You can try the problem for yourself here:

But you'll have to register first:

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Windows Vista.
2. Press CTRL + F5
3. Open the barrack or any other window that need to repaint image every second.
4. See how the image flicker. If they don't, repeat step (3). (The problem occurs mostly, not always)
Actual Results:
*Every* time the image are repainted, the "image unavailable" icon is shown initially. This is quire annoying because these image are repainted periodically.

Expected Results:
The same behavior you get after doing a normal refresh.

It seems that the problem only occurs when using Firefox under Windows Vista (I user 64bit, but I do not know if it matters).
