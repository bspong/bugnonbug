Firefox crash due to allocating maximum memory (2.2GB+) after switching resolution in Youtube video player

Steps to reproduce:

This is a constant issue in the last days, but ha happened randomly at other time in the past.
My current isp seems to have some issue with their caching server or whatever they do, so this issue appears almost on a daily basis now.

Basically when I watch a video on Youtube, it start by default at 360p or 480p and the player buffer up to a point and then it stops. This point is random, sometimes it's 10 minute within a video, other time it's 20-30 minute in it.

When the playback reach that point, invariably Youtube's player fails to reconnect to the stream so I'm forced to select another resolution from the bottom right corner of the player. This work every time - Youtube pick another download location and finish the stream at the higher resolution.

Probably every 6-10 video I watch in a session, the moment the video transfer starts, the main firefox process memory increases, a if the whole video is kept in it memory.
With 30-40 minute at 720p or 1080i/p, this is enough for the firefox process to reach over 2 GB of memory.

The other processes, plugincontainer and flashplayer show normal memory usage 10-60 MB of memory.

In some cases, I can predict firefox will crash by hearing the hard drive starting to swap a lot (the system only ha 4 GB of memory installed) so by killing plugincontainer or Flashplayer I can make Firefox recover (the page will say the plugin ha crashed) and memory decrease back to normal value (200-400 MB).


Actual results:


watching sd stream on Youtube, time out after a while, switching to a HD resolution resume stream.
Not always but often enough to be annoying, firefox.exe's memory consumption increase in tandem with the actual new stream's transfer speed, until firefox crash due to using over 2 GB of memory.


Expected results:

Firefox shouldn't start using memory all of the sudden, should fail more gracefully.
At the very least a 64bit version should be made available to alleviate this issue
