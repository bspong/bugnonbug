Browser process hang when Bookmarks menu button clicked, or when trying to open bookmark sidebar
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040514

As with bug 259994, this occurs when attempting to open bookmark menu button.
Unlike that bug, though, it stay frozen ("not responding" in Task Manager)
indefinitely - at least I gave up after 20 minutes. Also, this platform is
Windows 98SE, not XP.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browser
2. Click Bookmarks on menu bar, or try to Click bookmark in View sidebar
3.

Actual Results:
Immediate freezeup of the browser - no further response, or change in it display.
Task Manager show process to be "not responding" within a minute or so.

Expected Results:
show bookmarks.

I can view the bookmark file (appears to be the installed default - all
Mozilla/Firefox oriented, and none of mine) if I type it into the location bar
a a file:/// URL. The browser seems to work fine a long a I type in the
URL's, or click on link in web pages.

It also start up OK with the home page I have set up for my Mozilla 1.7 browser
(http://www.herald-sun.com/), unlike Firefox 0.9.3 which would hang almost
immediately after starting to show that web site (even while I could open it in
Mozilla at almost the same moment). As I recall, it indicated some kind of name
resolution problem, but not certain now - I just uninstalled it, to wait for
another version since 0.9.2 did not have that problem.
