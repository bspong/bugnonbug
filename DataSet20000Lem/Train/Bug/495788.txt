While I wa looking at the menu of my popular website folder, I noticed that, moving, slowly, the cursor from the bottom back up to the top, the blue rectangle skip some of the website (going far up) and then it go back down to the one I had the cursor on. It doesn't happen on the other way (from the top to the bottom) and I also noticed it doesn't happen all the times.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Popular folder (which ha been transferred from my Safari browser)
2.Moce the cursor of the mouse, without clicking, from the top to the bottom
3.Once you went down (like after 20-25 voice of that menu) move the cursor back up to the bottom, slowly

Actual Results:
The blue selection (correspondent to the voice of the menu you have the cursor on) skipped some line of the menu up and then it went back down to the correct one

Expected Results:
The blue rectangle should follow the movement of the cursor of the mouse
