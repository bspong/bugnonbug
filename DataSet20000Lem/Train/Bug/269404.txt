This site us Javascript and insists on opening in Bookmarks pane (if bookmark
pane is not open and URL is entered the bookmark pane opens) The site run fine
but you cannot exit except by closing Firefox completely. Also on reboot the URL
open in bookmark pane again. The only way to stop this seems to be delete
bookmarks.html and then copy (saved file) across. Although a couple of time I
had to delete application data and start over.

to start (because on exit, closing Firefos, the crash message appears, but the
reporter doesn't initiate)

using JRE1.4.2 with patch 04-b05. I also not that many site running Jave seem to
clog the Browser to a crawl (try www.telegraph.co.uk/ but you will need to log on )
