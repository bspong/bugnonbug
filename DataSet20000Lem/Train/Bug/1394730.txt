Should clean up UITour highlight while navigating to another tour
STR:
1. Open the Onboarding tour overlay
2. Go to the Customize tour by mouse click
3. Click the Customize tour action button to highlight the Customize button
4. Go to another tour by mouse click
p.s in the step 2 and 3, we could go to other tour which would highlight UI button such a the Library tour

Expected:
The the Customize button highlight disappears

Actual:
The the Customize button highlight doesn't disappear

Root Cause:
The .onboarding-tour-item element have been set with the rule of `pointer-events: none;`[1] so that it won't get focus style during mouse navigation[2]. However, the .onboarding-tour-item element won't react to the mouse event any more with `pointer-events: none;`[3]. As a result, we won't hide the previous UITour highlight while navigating to another tour.
