Display page title normally in popup window title bar if popup's host match parent window's host, even if popup's address bar is hidden

While creating a mini-web app for myself, I noticed that since I hide the
address bar in the popup window I use FF decides that I'm probably phishing and
display the host and port of my server before the page title in the popup's
title bar. While this is a good idea 90-some percent of the time, when the host
of the popup match the host of the window that opened it (as is the case for
what I'm doing) I think the page title should display normally. As it is now,
the host name prevents the page title from displaying in my taskbar; if the
window isn't up front I tend to mistake it taskbar entry for a view-source window.
