I am currently developing a Java applet that allows a user to view/modify an image and then optionally save the original/edited image on their own machines. This applet ha been self-signed to allow the applet to access file outside of the Java sandbox.

The same applet work a expected with IE (edited file are saved), but on Firefox everything seem to work fine, but no file are created. A dialog box appears that request the user to input a name and file type for the image, but clicking on the save button doe nothing. There are no error message (Exceptions) in the Java Console.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a signed applet that allows a user to save an image from the applet locally onto their machine.
2. Try to save the image.

Actual Results:
No file are created. No error message from Firefox nor Java Console.

Expected Results:
The saved image should appear in the location that wa specified.

The same applet work fine in IE. Both Firefox and IE are using JRE 1.5.0_05 on the same machine.
