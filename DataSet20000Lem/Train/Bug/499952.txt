Had a Digital Certificate in Internet Explorer 6.0. Exported it to a PFX file which would have my Public and Private Key (RSA 1024 Bits). This PFX file will import fine into IE on other workstations. However, it will not import into Firefox 3.0.11. Receive error dialog box:

Alert
The PKCS #12 operation failed for unknown reasons.
OK

Was getting this error right after the dialog box that asks for the password for the PFX file. Thought this might be related so went back to IE and exported the same way but this time put a password on the file. Tried the import again and this time it wa successful.

Reproducible: Always

1d. On the Welcome screen click Next
1e. Select "Yes, export the private key" » Next

It appears a if the digital certificate import process is expecting all PFX file to be password protected and if they are not then the import will fail.
