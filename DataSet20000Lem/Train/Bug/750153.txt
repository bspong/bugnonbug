Steps to reproduce:

I'm using Aurora (20120429 Firefox/14.0a2) on a Vista based PC. I have no problem watching flash video on YouTube, Hulu , http://www.sfgate.com/video/ or http://www.cbs.com/primetime/60_minutes/video/?vs=Full%20Episodes but when I try to watch

it show the initial screen image of the recorded TV show but it will never play no matter what I do. The time remaining is stuck at 43:05.

Using the same profile, I have no problem watching that using Firefox 12.0. I have several add-on but only one plugin. I'm using the default theme.

File: C:\Windows\system32\Macromed\Flash\NPSWF32_11_2_202_228.dll
Version: 11.2.202.228
Shockwave Flash 11.2 r202

I've tried several other video on that web site and they all have the same problem. If I right click on the image it ha "About Adobe Flash ..." on the bottom and "Moogalover Player v1.1.17" near the middle of that context menu. That appears to be a Flash video downloader. I tried searching for that string in bugzilla and got nothing.
