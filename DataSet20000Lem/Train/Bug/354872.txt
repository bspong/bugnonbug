I use firefox to test my web page, and the web server is tomcat at local machine. Whenever I refresh (or post) my url to my server, I found the servlet on the server is actually called twice for each post. Basically the servlet run twice before send back response. This is not the problem in the code of the servlet because using the same url on IE, it ha no such problem.

I believe this behavior doe related to the browser. Please let me if your finding is different. I am using firefox downloaded this morning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.build any servlet class with overwitten method for either service or doGet
2.put some print out in the begining and end of the method (service or doGet)
3.call the url for the servelt, and monitor the print out on the server side

Actual Results:
you will see the print-outs will do twice every time you refresh the page. There is no significant demage. It may actually make page load twice slower, right?

Expected Results:
should only do once

I found this while I wa developing servlet. But I think this problem may actually happens at general post process
