User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20130629 Firefox/24.0 (Nightly/Aurora)
Build ID: 20130629004016

Steps to reproduce:

With Aurora (Firefox 24.0 a2) and with Firefox beta(23.0), I accessed to the following pdfs.
http://www.broadband-xp.com/test/pdfjs/annotation-tx2.pdf
http://www.broadband-xp.com/test/pdfjs/annotation-tx3.pdf



Actual results:

While Firefox beta(23.0) (PDF.js: 0.8.47) handle form properly, Aurora(Firefox 24.0 a2) with PDF.js: 0.8.229 can not handle it properly.
With Aurora Form annotation background color and border color are not reflected, and it doe not handle multiple-lines annotation properly.


Expected results:

If you open it with Firefox beta or with Adobe Reader, you will see blue background and green borders. But if you open it with pdf.js of Firefox 24.0 a2(PDF.js: 0.8.229), you just see white background and no border.

If you open annotation-tx3.pdf (multi-lines annotation example) with Adobe Reader or with Firefox beta, 4 line comment are shown.
On the other hand if you open it with pdf.js of Firefox 24.0 a2(PDF.js: 0.8.229), there is just one line and annotation is positioned in the middle of the form elements. It should be positioned in the top of the form element a Adobe Reader.
