Whenever I need to select an application to open a file with, the file open dialog
present an opportunity to enter a path directly, without clicking throught the file system, by pressing Ctrl+L and entering the path here. When a path that corresponds to a directory with large number of file is entered, this cause the file open dialog to hang for a long time.

I tried to reproduce this behaviour on other GTK application but I couldn't; other applications' File/Open dialog containg the address bar, and don't react to Ctrl+L.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click File/Open File
2. Press Ctrl+L, enter /usr/local/bin, press Enter
3. enjoy a coffee pause
Actual Results:
file/open dialog hang for 30 second or so, then displayed the content of /usr/local/bin in the file panel .

Expected Results:
display content of /usr/local/bin ASAP. After all, on my system 'time l -l /usr/local/bin > /dev/null' is 0,01s user 0,01s system 90% cpu 0,024 total ( there are ~2300 file ).
