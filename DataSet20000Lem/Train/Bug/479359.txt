Browser fails to open.

Build Identifier: Love to but Firefox won't even come up to check.

My computer wouldn't open FireFox browser. So I closed down the computer. Rebooted, and tried again. FireFox failed to open. So I opened IE and went to the FF website to download the newest version. Tried to run the application but he installation software kept giving me an error stating that I have to shut down FF Browser (which isn't open). So, I download the installation to disk and logoff and back on. I run the installation without opening any browser connections. The installation completes successfully. I try to open the FF browser - same problem. I check out the task manager and a 'drgtodisc' is running. I check the fails to open. So, I check the system performance and it is pegged at 100 percent. I try to end the 'drgtodisc' without success (loop type scenario). So I killed the 'drgtodisc.exe' (2 of them) and the performce drop to almost zero. Bottom line - FF won't even come up - Using IE to make contact. My email is stnance@gmail.com - Thanks! Scott Nance
