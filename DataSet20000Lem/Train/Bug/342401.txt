I recently checked my cookie list and I wa horrified to see that I had hundred of them, from many web site I had never ever allowed. After deleting all of them and deleting all my cookie site list, I wa still amazed to see that any web site that wa not in the "block" list wa allowed, and that Firefox wa not anymore asking me if I wanted to allow/block the web site from setting a cookie.

After an hour of ggogling, I found that what is broken is the setting "network.cookie.lifetimePolicy" and the corresponding interface menu "Keep cookies". According to the knoledge base:
http://kb.mozillazine.org/About:config_entries#Network..2A
this is the description of the setting:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Determines how browser set cookie lifetimes.
0 (default): Use supplied lifetime
1: Ask before accepting
2: Accept for session only
3: Cookies last for the number of day specified in network.cookie.lifetime.days
Note: In Firefox, this can be changed via "Tools &#8594; Options &#8594; Privacy &#8594; Cookies &#8594; Keep Cookies"
------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two huge obvious bug in this:
1- The "lifetime" policy should not decide of the policy to set cookies. They are two orthogonal choices. How can I decide if I want a cookie to be set or not and at the same time if I want it lifetime to be limited or not ?

2- The default of Firefox should not disable all possibility to allow or block cookies. There is a really nice framework in Firefox to choose cooky based on the website, it is one of the main feature and the new default is to disable the feature and allow all cooky ? This is insane !

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1- set the lifetime of cooky to "until they expire"
2- go to a website that is not already in the block/allow list and register cooky
Actual Results:
no window pop up for asking the user if he want to allow/block cookies. It look like the web site doe not have any cookie. But a cookie is silently written.

Expected Results:
setting the lifetime should not invalidate the possibility to allow/block cooky based on the website. The window allow/block should always popup like it used to be.
