Trackpad scrolling hang on disk access

When data is downloaded in recent Minefield builds, it appears to be written to disk immediately (or possibly read from cache). (I can hear the disk activity.) When this happens, scrolling hang until the read (or write) completes. This is very different from the standard Firefox behavior.

Note: I'm experiencing this on an 8 core Mac Pro with 12 GB of RAM, almost 5 GB free, and no swap used. This is not a paging issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://www.facebook.com/?sk=lf
2. Scroll down towards the bottom. When you get close, Javascript will load additional page content, which get added to the bottom of the page.
3. The browser either read from or writes to the disk. While this happens, the browser stop scrolling smoothly, pausing until the read or write is complete. Essentially, it appears to be blocking on completion of the disk access rather than doing it asynchronously.
Actual Results:
Browser doesn't scroll smoothly. Scrolling jumps, and is audibly in sync with disk accesses.

Expected Results:
Browser scroll smoothly. Any disk access are non-blocking.
