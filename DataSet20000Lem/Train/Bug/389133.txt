When browsing the web site " http://games.internode.on.net/ " there are a series of flash advertisement that appear throughout.

Whenever certain flash advertisement are displayed (usually a Ghost Recon advert) the entire document is cleared and replaced by the flash advertisement.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the above link

2. One of two thing will happen
a) the page will load showing all normal content (information about a game trailer)
OR
b) the page will display ONLY a flash advertisement

3. If the correct HTML content displays, either refresh the page or browse the site
Actual Results:
A Ghost Recon advertisement is displayed with no additional content.

Expected Results:
Information about a game trailer download should display, along with the advertisement.

I used Opera to view the page and save it's content which I have uploaded a a ZIP file.

Upon looking at it's source code it appears that a javascript function "doAd()" is called (found in file "files/adpimp00.js").

It appears that advertisement are loaded by creating a "XMLHttpRequest" using it to load a file called "adpimp.php" and then "document.write" the responseText from the XMLHttpRequest object into the document.

When viewing the source code of the file "adpimp.php" you will see that the advertisement print an IFRAME onto the page.

This bug could be related to the XMLHttpRequest object OR something to do with Javascript writing an IFRAME onto the page rather than being something do do with the Adobe Flash plugin.
