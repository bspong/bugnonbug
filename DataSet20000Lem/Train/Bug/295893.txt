Suggestion for Security Patch Level version be mainained in Firefox, to avoid problem like the 1.0.4 update on Ubuntu Linux
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050526 Firefox/1.0.4 (Ubuntu package 1.0.4)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050526 Firefox/1.0.4 (Ubuntu package 1.0.4)

As you may know, when Ubuntu applied the security update from 1.0.4 to their
production release of Firefox 1.0.2, there were problem accessing the firefox
extension pages. This wa done a a kludge to prevent non-upgraded version of
Firefox from getting in.

Simplest way to avoid issue with user would have been to put a button at the
end of the warning that would allow user to continue on anyway. But a
suggested in Ubuntu's Bugzilla #10681
(https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10681), maybe Firefox could start
keeping an internal security patchlevel version number that could be used for
such cases.

Ubuntu ha good reason for doing security-only update to the released software
package on Hoary (Ubuntu 5.0.4). Having a separate security patch level
version string could make this all make more sense. It would be more manageable
all around. I am still a little confused perhaps, but I believe that Ubuntu's
Firefox "1.0.4" is actually 1.0.2 with security update backported from Mozilla
Firefox 1.0.3 and 1.0.4. With a patch level, the "About" page could say
something like "Ubuntu build Firefox version 1.0.2, Security Patch Level 1.0.4".
