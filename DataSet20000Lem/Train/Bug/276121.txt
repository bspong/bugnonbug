FF Hangs on loading inbox for Yahoo Mail

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto http://mail.yahoo.com
2. login click enter
3. upon loading inbox firefox hang and computer requires hard restart
(Ctrl-Alt-Del doe NOT work) and while mouse (w/ hour glass) is still movable
nothing is clickable

Actual Results:
I had to restart my computer

Expected Results:
Shown me my inbox

I found a work-around: using adblock I blocked all image "*" and noticed I
could now view my mail. Working backwards (with several restarts) I found that
the only thing required to block for a working site is the key:
http://*yimg.com/i/us/pim/r/medici/*
which block 3 image and a javascript (but I always block the javascript and
still hangs). I wa able to view the individual image without problem. There is
a .css file included in the wildcard and it is unblocked but cause several
error in the JS Console. Problem occurs in Win98 and Win98SE.

My system is currently: Gateway G6-450; 450MHz P2; 320MB RAM; Win98SE; Hangs on
Firefox 1.0, Firefix Nightly Dec26, and Mozilla 1.7.5

I am trying to setup the computer for gf's folk and they need yahoo mail
otherwise they'll use IE.

Thanks for looking; I hope this isn't a dupe, but I don't have that much
debugging info, because it cause me to restart.
