Shortcut icon appear in the bookmark bar if you have icon displaying in the toolbar. Since the shortcut icon appear, you can have fewer shortcut in the toolbar without it creating a submenu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View -> Toolbars -> Bookmarks Toolbar
2. Drag at least one bookmark to the bar
3. Note that the shortcut icon appears (or a blank document if the site ha no shortcut icon)
4. Right click on tool bar to bring up context menu and select "Customize..."
5. Select "text only" from the "Show:" menu at the bottom of the dialog
6. Note the shortcut icon disappear, but the back and forward button now say "back" and "forward".
Actual Results:
The shortcut icon disappear, but so do the toolbar icon

Expected Results:
This is what I expected, but a preference to keep the shortcut icon from appearing would be appreciated since this is a change from FF3.X

This may be configurable through about:config, but, like, my parent aren't going to be able to figure that out. They're just saying "hey, some of my bookmark are missing" since they dont' know how to open up the menu from the bookmark toolbar.
