Bookmarks menu completely disappeared.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.9.1

On Saturday, July 31, I installed Windows Critical Update KB867801 for IE6. It
wa after that when I opened Firefox browser that I noticed the bookmark menu
had disappeared. I tried the import function to see if I could retrieve
favorite from IE and Firefox gave me an error that required the browser to
close. I uninstalled firefox and all file relating to firefox and then
reinstalled firefox 0.9.2. It did not try to inport favorites, cooky or
password from IE. I wa able to manually copy favorite into bookmark but
then another issue appeared. I opened a game, Text Twist, that us Java. After
ending the game, the Java icon stay in the system tray until closing the
browser. When I closed Firefox browser, my monitor went totally blank and did
not return. I had to hard shut down my computer and reboot to use my computer.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have Firefox already installed.
2.Download and install IE6 critical update KB867801
3.Close IE,open Firefox, lose bookmarks.

Actual Results:
I am unable to use Firefox on my computer because I can't and the browser doe
not import my favorites; when I try the browser closes. If I manually add
bookmark it's okay. But, if I run anything that us Java, when I close the
browser my computer crash and ha to be hard shut down.

Expected Results:
Installing a fresh version of Firefox would import my favorite from IE and the
browser would not crash my system after using Java.

Prior to July 31 and prior to installation of the IE critical update, Firefox
worked perfectly on my computer running WinXP Home edition with a P4 2.53GHz
processor and 512Mb of RAM.
