network.http.sendRefererHeader set to 0 a default in 2.0 RC1

What a nasty little bugger! I updated my Firefox browser to v2.0 RC1 today and noticed I could not publish to my blog anymore. After a little bit of digging, I found this posted on the Wordpress site:

“Once Wordpress ha identified you a an authorized user with permission to make changes, you can access any of the protected admin options. All the page within the admin area remain secure, without the nuisance of your having to log in to each page individually. Any additional admin page you choose can verify your status by checking to see which page you just came from. It doe this by checking the referrer that the browser pass to it.”

OK, so I finally found a post on how to fix this. I’ve noticed that in Firefox 2.0 RC1, network.http.sendRefererHeader is set to 0 a default. In previous versions, it is set to 2 a default. These are the settings:

0 - Never send the Referer header.
1 - Send the Referer header when clicking on a link.
2 - Send the Referer header when clicking on a link or loading an image.

You set this option by typing about:config in the address bar of the Firefox browser and scrolling down to network.http.sendRefererHeader. Check the setting and modify (I set mine to 1 and it work fine). Those concerned with privacy can set this to 0, realizing that this may adversely affect some sites. Those wanting to ensure compatibility should leave it at 1 or 2. Closest I could find wa http://codex.wordpress.org/Enable_Sending_Referrers.
