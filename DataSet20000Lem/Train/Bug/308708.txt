when copied code is placed into the login box to submit comments, page responds
with error message. I tried five time with different code and each time same
error issue, but no problem using IE.
this info is from rabbi Menken who owns site and welcome technical assistance
in correcting the glitch.

"I've used Firefox successfully myself to post comments. Do you have cooky
enabled? I would *love* to work with someone who know tech and ha the
problem (since I know tech but don't), so that we can kill the beast. :)We're
