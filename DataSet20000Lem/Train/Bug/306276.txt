When the user wish to drag a window to a new location on the screen, most of
the time the window immediately return to it original position.

This bug is very difficult to diagnose. It cannot be reproduced reliably. There
seems to be some automatic detection mechanism that try to keep people from
"accidentally" moving their window around.

Some people hate to move any windows, anyway. I move my window all the time.

When there are two or three window open on my screen, it is absolutely
essential for my efficient use of the computer that I can move them instantly
anywhere, without an automatic response mechanism that restores them to their
original location.

I tried to find out if this is a feature which exists in the preferences, but I
found nothing mentioned. It may be an anomaly the cause of which doe not exist
in the Firefox/Mozilla source code.

But it is very real, and it is happening to me all of the time.

As I write, I tried to reproduce it again by dragging this window itself. The
problem now doe not manifest itself in this window only. This is one of the
most infuriating things.

Any user action which the user belief will have occurred may result in the
next moment an action being taken which depends on the result of the previous
action. If the user's software denies the user from obtaining the first result,
the second step may result in the user's click on their Desktop closing and
deleting the text of a one-page email which they just wrote, because the window
really didn't move, and their next click wa directly on the close box.

Therefore, any bug is extremely severe which result in throwing away user input.

Comments: This bug is one of the most irritating bug to someone who is affected
by it. I feel like saying something really horrible.
