CGI/dynamically-generated image are loaded twice when generating preview for URL bar favicon
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050813 Firefox/1.0+

Firefox appears to re-request a dynamically-generated image to render the
preview favicon in the URL bar if the tab bar is present. While the tab's
preview favicon match the content, an additional request is made to generate
the preview in the URL bar, the result of which will not necessarily match the
content being viewed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox with only one start page (no extra tabs, a in a fresh profile)
2. Visit http://unbuffered.info/count.php and reload a few times. Note that the
counter increment only once per reload and that the URL bar's icon match the
content.
3. Create a new tab to get the tab bar to appear.
4. Switch back to the first tab and reload a few times. Note that the URL bar no
longer match the content or the tab's preview icon, and that the counter is
now increment by 2 after each reload.

Actual Results:
Preview in URL bar is not of the same image a the one displayed, server
receives two requests.

Expected Results:
URL bar preview icon should match the tab's preview icon, without generating an
extra request.

The PHP script record a separate count per IP.
To reset to zero, use: http://unbuffered.info/count.php?reset
To get the current value without incrementing the counter, use:
http://unbuffered.info/count.php?noinc
