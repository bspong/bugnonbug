I installed the Mozilla Firefox browser on my laptop, operating Windows XP SP3 Home Premium Edition. After install, I went to open/start the program. I double click on the icon and the mouse doe the little hour-glass icon like it is going to do something, but it doesnt do anything... No program come up and no security is blocking it from opening. Why wont it work and how do I fix it? I have already reinstalled it at least ten different times, and even completely uninstalled it and downloaded a new install program and reinstalled it. Same thing happens. Please respond ASAP. Thanks and have a good day!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Mozilla Firefox
2. Finish installation and attempt to open
3. Nothing happens
Actual Results:
Nothing! That's the problem! I cant get firefox to open!


I have scanned the computer for any spyware or virus and removed any that were present and tried this again. I also shut down the security program and tried it again. Fruitless results.
