In that special case, after closing and reopening Firefox, those bookmark have been deleted.

The problem can occur at any time when you do massive and quick change on the bookmarks. In the case I presented, the bookmark are deleted after Firefox is restarted. In other cases, it can happen that bookmark are not deleted, but are impossible to modify. It can also happen that when you want to move them, they are moved, but not to the right place.
