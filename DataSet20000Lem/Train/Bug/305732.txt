I have a director sw movie that sends data to a server using the Lingo function,
stateID = postNetText(url, data). The state could be Connecting, Started,
InProgress, Complete, or "Error". We get this state by using the Lingo
function,getStreamStatus(stateID).state
For test purposes, we disconnect our network connection to ensure our
handshaking system works, everthing work ok until we reconnect to the network.
The data is successfully sent to the server URL or backup URL but the sw movie
hang a the state is still on 'Connecting' and not 'Complete'.
I thought this wa a issue with the lingo code but this work fine in IE (it
recognises the streamStatus is Complete) so i'm 80% certain the issue lie
within the firefox browser but i could be wrong.

Any help with this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the html file with the embedded sw movie
2. When the test is loaded, click on start to do the test.
3. Just before finishing the test, disconnect your network connection.
4. Click on Finish to send the test result to the URL.
5. After the correct message ouput by the handshaking system, reconnect your
network connection.

Actual Results:
The shockwave movie keep sending the test result to the URL, and doe not end
a the state from the streamStatus is 'Connecting' and not 'Complete'.
This only happens in the firefox browser.


Expected Results:
After the shockwave movie sucessfully sent the test result to the URL, the
movie should then end a the state from the streamStatus will be 'Complete'.
