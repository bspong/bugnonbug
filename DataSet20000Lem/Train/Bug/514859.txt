create an extension to help to give right value to more advanced parameter

Firefox give no easy way to set appropriate value to most advanced parameters.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
If I remember correctly, Firefox is using, for example, clever algorithm for improving web navigation, like prefetching the expected next web page while exploring the link of the already downloaded pages. While this may speed navigation, it's going to increase the Firefox memory consumption and decrease Firefox responsiveness. My Internet bandwidth is good enough so that I don't care about prefetching web page in background: I would rather prefer it to be more responsive.

Then, my first idea wa it could be a good idea if Firefox could propose, during the first start-up, to choose among different loading parameters: for example, Firefox might ask the user if he/she prefers performance (with loading optimization in background) with a high bandwith+CPU, or responsiveness (no page prefetch) but with a lower high bandwith+CPU.

Asking such a question could be seen a weird for most user during startup time, so my second idea is to propose to assign most advanced Firefox parameter according to a set of questions, but through the help of an extension. Then, only user who want to deal with such Firefox customisation, and who have downloaded such extension, would be involed.
