I am an ebay seller. when I send out invoice I use the back button to get to the list of invoice I need to send. Sometimes peole buy more than one item and when I combine them to send the invoice, I have to use the back button to get to the page with my invoice list to continue sending invoices. When I hit the back button I get the above message. This is annoying to me. Can there be a way to disable this action, so I do not have to repeatedly cancel the action out?
thanks
