I have a moderately large number of file in my home directory (3000) and photo archive (8000). This is not a problem in command line ("ls -lt|head" take about 15ms, "vi foob<tab complete>" is virtually instantaneous) and I don't use a desktop GUI, I find file by date or name.

In Firefox 2, in file upload dialogs, "save as" dialog etc., I could just type or paste in a filename and the operation would complete in about a second.

In Firefox 3, the browser attempt to autocomplete the filename, and display a graphical list of partial matches. This hang the browser for at least 30 second - long enough that I have to kill it and restart. I can move my file to a temporary directory to upload it, or paste in a directory name quickly enough that the autofill doesn't have time to parse partial matches, but it is a serious nuisance.

Reproducible: Always




I want to be able to just save or upload a file by typing the name.
Either speed up the autocomplete by a factor of 100, put some cap on the number of match or the time taken, or provide a workaround that doe not invoke the autocompleter.

While the bug doesn't itself lose data, if I have to kill the browser in order to recover, I may lose data that I am trying to enter along with an uploaded file.
