maybe I'm wrong but I have the strong feeling live bookmark us cache when it
come to refresh. Often I go to a website to find there are new article and the
r feed didn't refresh properly ...

I downloaded the Sage extension after to find out it wa correctly updating the
r feeds.

So my guess wa that the live bmark us the cache system and sage doesn't; it
might be another problem but the fact is : Sage properly detects updated r
while the internal r system doesn't.

Please have a look at that, I like the way it done with bookmark but it
useless if the update are not working well.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Sage extension and install
2.Put some r feed in sage and the same also a live bookmark
3.Use both on a regular basis (always starting with the live bookmark when you
update your rss)
Actual Results:
You will see sage show the updated r when the live bookmark didnt find any


Expected Results:
Shouldnt see any difference

I guessed it wa dealing with using the cache or not because once Sage get the
updated r feeds, the live bookmark will get them too.

I will now try to desactivate the network.http-usecache pref and see if it make
a difference (I'm sure it will)
