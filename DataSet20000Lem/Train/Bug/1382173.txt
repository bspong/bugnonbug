DevToolsShim should differentiate between installed and initialized state
With Bug 1359855, devtools can be installed without being initialized/started. The shim relied on devtools-browser.js being loaded in order to "detect" devtools. This need to change.

Additionally, :ochameau suggested the following strategy in order to detect the DevTools installation without having to rely on the AddonManager. We can check if the devtools resource path ha already been registered, which mean that devtools file are ready to be loaded (being addon or not doe not make a difference here).
