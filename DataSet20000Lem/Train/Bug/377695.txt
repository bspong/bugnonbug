Random frequent system freeze (possibly Gecko related)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.3 (Ubuntu-feisty)

I experience this bug since several weeks.
At one moment in time it wa quite rare, now it is consistently appearing, sometime even after few seconds.
Firefox -safe-mode doesn't change anything.
Other Gecko based browser (Epiphany, Galeon) are affected.
Non Gecko based (Dillo) work fine.

95% of the time the freeze is not "hard" (mouse cursor moving, alt-sys key recognised). The remaining 5% can only be recovered by hard power down.

The freeze seems to be site dependant (https://launchpad.net being one of the worst), but so far I wa unable to correlate it to any particular event. I have experienced freeze without any user interaction or network activity.

Any other network apps I tried did not show any similar problem.
