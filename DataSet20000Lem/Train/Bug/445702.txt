Whenever I click on an item that open a submenu with the pen of the tablet PC then menu open but the item is not highlighted. If I click it again it will be highlighted.

But that's not the problem.

If the item is not highlighted but the submenu is open and then I click on another item to open a submenu in the same level a the first the first submenu is NOT closed but the new one is opened.

Now when I click a bookmark to open the URL all submenu that were opened without a highlighted parent item none is closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a menu (bookmarks menu is good because it ha many levels)
2. click with pen (not mouse a this highlight menu item when rolling over them) an item to open a submenu
3. submenu opens, item is not highlighted
4. click another item to open a submenu in the same level a the first item
5. submenu open but first submenu is still open
Actual Results:
When I click a bookmark to open the URL all submenu that were opened without a highlighted parent item none is closed.

Expected Results:
Submenus close.

This cannot be tested with a mouse a this highlight menu item when rolling over them.
