In old Firefox versions, scrolling with the mouse wheel, without moving the
mouse at all, didn't fire onMouseOut event and the like.
This ha been corrected in the 1.5 beta. However, if no more tab are opened and
new tab is opened with a middle-button click (thus causing the "tab bar" to
appear), the webpage is scrolled down a little and the mouse position is wrong
for further events, up until the mouse is moved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Without tab opened, go to a webpage with onmouseover/onmouseout effects,
such a http://www.mudmagic.com/boards/promote/11
2. Middle-click over a link. Don't move the mouse at all after that.
3. Scroll with the mouse-wheel or the keyboard.

Actual Results:
The onmouseover/onmouseout will display a if the mouse were a few pixel below
than where it actually is.
Moving the mouse fix the problem.

Expected Results:
When the tab is created, trigger an onmouseout event, the an onmouseover event
on the new mouse position.
