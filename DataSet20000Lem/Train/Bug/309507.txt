Firefox crash while using Aurigma's ImageUploader under certain condition

Aurigma's ImageUploader (at http://aurigma.com/Products/ImageUploader/) ha a
Java version that deal with uploading multiple file at a time. The applet ha
various option that deal with upload completion. One of the option is to
display the response from the server once the uploaded file are processed by
the server. This display is in the form of a variable (StatusText) that contains
basically the entire response from the server (usually an HTML page.) The
JavaScript that is used to display this is of the form:
document.write(StatusText). After several such upload Firefox crashes. Then
whenever you try it, it crashes. To ensure that the variable StatusText wasn't
doing anything bad, I just substituted it like so: document.write('This'). It
still crashed. If you comment it out, everything is fine. I had the same problem
with Firefox 1.0.6. That is why I tried the 1.4 Beta. It initially worked with
the Beta, then started crashing in that a well.
