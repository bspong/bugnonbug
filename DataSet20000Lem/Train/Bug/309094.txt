With one Live Bookmark and one static bookmark, there is no "Open in Tabs" menu item

In a bookmark folder, if there is more than one item in the folder, then the
"Open in Tabs" menu item is appended to the end of the list of bookmarks.
However, if the two bookmark are Live Bookmarks, or there is one Live Bookmark
and one static bookmark, then currently the "Open in Tabs" item isn't added. It
only appears once there is more than one static bookmark.

Seems to me that the option should show up with more than two items, no matter
what type of bookmark they are.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bookmark folder. In my case I create one inside the Bookmarks
Toolbar Folder, to simulate a menu, but this is not necessary.
2. Add two bookmark to it, one a static bookmark and one a Live Bookmark.
3. Explore the bookmark folder, either from the Bookmark menu or from the
Bookmark toolbar.

Actual Results:
No "Open in Tabs" menu item appeared.

Expected Results:
A separator and an "Open in Tabs" menu item should have appeared at the bottom
of the bookmark listing.

A workaround is to create two static bookmarks, which make Firefox add the menu
item. Note that the functionality of the item is just fine: when clicked, all
bookmarks, Live or otherwise, load up in tab just like they are supposed to.

Also note that this applies to a folder with all Live Bookmarks in it, a well.
