There ha been considerable debate about how selection should work in the
address / location bar. I decided to try turning off 'click selects all' to see
if this suited me better.

When I did this, I noticed that I could no longer delete individual entry in
the address bar drop down list (for previously typed urls).

I changed the browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll back to 'true', then re-started
Firefox, and the ability to delete individual address bar entry started
working again.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change your browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll setting to 'false' (ensure that it
doe not get switched back to 'true' by a user.js entry)

2. Press the downward arrow button at the end of the address / location bar to
display a drop list of previously entered URLs.

3. Try to delete any of the entry by selecting it and using Shift + delete


Actual Results:
Nothing happens. The selected entry is NOT deleted.

Expected Results:
The selected entry should be deleted.
