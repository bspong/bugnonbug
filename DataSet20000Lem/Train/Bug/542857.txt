Adobe Acrobat pdf generates error msg, "There wa an error processing a page. Invalid Color Space." Does not occur in IE8.

On the above referenced website, go to bottom left, click on "Back Issues" (View entire Back Issues list in PDF format). Error message pop up, "There wa an error processing a page. Invalid Color Space." I contacted the Associate Publisher, Angela Winter (919)942-5282 in North Carolina who advised the same thing happens to her on her home system using Firefox (don't know her version). I am currently using full version of Adobe Acrobat 9.3.0.
This doe not occur in IE8 (Version 8.0.7600.16385 64-bit Edition). However, in IE8 an "Internet Explorer Security" box pop up stating "A website want to open web content using this program on your computer" "This program will open outside of Protected mode...." If choosing "Allow" all work fine.
