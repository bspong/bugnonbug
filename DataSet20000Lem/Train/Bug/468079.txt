DNS lookup when using proxy server in JavaScript engine
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b1) Gecko/20081007 Firefox/3.1b1

Firefox (3.0.1-4 and 3.1b1-4) all freeze on website which have their DNS server incorrectly setup which going through a proxy server.

Facebook doe not have it DNS record correctly set for AAAA and therefore return SERVFAIL but not instantly, but after 4-5 seconds. Firefox is trying to look up the domain's IPv6 address and hang while it is waiting.

The bug is two-fold:

1) The JavaScript engine should not be looking up the domain in the first place since it is using a proxy and therefore that will look it up itself.

2) Firefox should not hang while doing DNS query such that none of the other tab are available and the window cannot be rendered.

This doe not occur on the same network and version on Windows.

Utilising gdb I have found the issue seems to be in the library libxul when it call pthread_wait_cond. But strace showed the lagging to occur during a DNS query.

We have managed to stop the browser freezing by disabling IPv6 lookups, but it should not be looking the IP up anyway.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have IPv6 lookup turned on (network.dns.disableIPv6 = false)
2. Use a proxy server (preferably squid-based to resemble conditions)
3. Navigate to www.facebook.com (from uk)
4. Watch Firefox (3.0.1-3.0.4 and 3.1b1-4) freeze while it try to get the non-existent AAAA records.
Actual Results:
The browser freeze and the window doe not render. It also utilises 100% CPU.

Expected Results:
The browser should remain operable while the DNS query is executing.
