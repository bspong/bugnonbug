On several page with (fat?) flash-inclusions I could see firefox die whenever I
try to interact with this flash-element while it is not fully loaded (I assume).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a page with a big and interactive flash-inclusion
2. don't hesitate, try to interact in the moment it is displayed

Actual Results:
Firefox dies. Sometimes the crash reporter come up, sometimes not.

Expected Results:
Surely it should not crash. It should not let interact someone before the flash
is ready to act normal.

I'm not fully sure because the activity-bar doesn't tell, if Firefox is talking
to the net because of the flash element or sth. else. But I'm sure: if I wait
until the page is fully loaded, the page do work while Firefox crash if I
don't wait until that.
I've seen it in earlier version of Firefox and I saw it some minute ago (with
the actual, yesterday upgraded version).
Maybe this belongs to other report too? (For example I could imagine a relation
to bug #284179 – a patient tester or one with a fast machine and a fast
connection could be unable to see the problem?!
