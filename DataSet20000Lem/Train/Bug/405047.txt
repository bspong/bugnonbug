With bookmark nested three level deep where level one and two contain very long bookmark the third level will sometimes disappear when you try to hover over contents. I don't believe this is a duplicate of Bug 195031 since that seemed to deal with right clicking and wa fixed awhile ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox with a new profile
2.Open organize bookmark and restore attached bookmark file
3.Open dropdown folder "test" from bookmark bar. Navigate to "test 2". Navigate to test3 and try to hover over a bookmark contained in "test 3"
Actual Results:
Third level dropdown menu immediately disappears

Expected Results:
While hovering over third level dropdown menu it should remain open

My desktop resolution is set to 1024x768 which may matter since this bug seems to depend on bookmark name being very long. The bug doesn't occur on my bookmark folder that are nested three deep without long name nor doe it appear on every set of bookmark with 3 level with long names. In my experience I can always reproduce this with the bookmark set provided but it may not happen with other apparently similar organization of bookmarks.
