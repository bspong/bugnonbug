After installing 3.6.3 update, Firefox is now experiecing intermittment locking/freezing of navigational elements.

It appears that either the body of a webpage being viewed becomes unclickalbe OR the navigational toolbar area and URL location bar lock/freeze. It's either one or the other. If the toolbar area is frozen, then the body of the webpage is clickable a normal. If the webpage body link are frozen, then the navigational toolbar area is usable.

I've closed and reopened the Firefox application and the issue persists.

I've viewed several different website and experience the issue on each site.
