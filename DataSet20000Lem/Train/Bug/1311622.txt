[e10s] Extremely slow to open (large (> 30MB) PDF files). And other opened tab is unresponsive
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:49.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/49.0
Build ID: 20160922113459

Steps to reproduce:

I tried to open the following PDF documents:

http://fondation.cetim.fr/pages/projets/fondationCetim_RecuperationEnergieVibrationsAmbiantes.pdf

http://www.apur.org/sites/default/files/documents/incidences_evolution_loi_ALUR_bati_parisien.pdf


Actual results:

Firefox got stuck for several minutes, and this caused every opened tab to freeze too... Since the whole browser wa now useless, my patience ran out and I killed the Firefox process.

Ironically, the very same link, on the very same machine, at the very same moment wa handled perfectly by Google Chrome. Each time, I got my PDF file in le than 5 seconds.


Expected results:

Firefox should be designed with any kind of machine configuration (mine is "old": a 2011 Dell high-end laptop) and any kind of file (a 50 MB PDF file is not large by current standards) in mind...

My two cent (I apologize, they are not optimistic): since the switch to the new multi-threaded software architecture, I encounter a lot of usability problem like this. And each time Google Chrome delivers a far better result... This is sad: I need good tool to work with, and Firefox is le and le relevant to my work.

Thanks in advance for your help!
