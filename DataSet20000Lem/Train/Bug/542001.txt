I would use firefox anyday over Safari except for when composing a message in my gmail account I can't use the 'end' button (control + right arrow). Please could it be made so this works, so that I can use firefox for all my web browsing. It make a big difference. thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Write a sentence in a gmail 'compose email'
2.put the cursor in the middle of sentence or paragraph to edit something
3.then press (control + right arrow) to get to the end of the line and it doesn't work
Actual Results:
nothing, just adjusted my typing behaviour

Expected Results:
It should have let me use the shortcut to get to the end of my sentence:)

Thank you! I really like everything else about firefox, so would love it this could be fixed. I hope you're all having a lovely day.
