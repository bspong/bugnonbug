On restarting Firefox - bookmark are overwritten so only half remain. Seems to have occurred after latest FlashGot update.

Even if correct bookmark file is copied back into place - will overwrite & default back to half-file while Flashgot is enabled.

Disabling FlashGot prevents this from happening - and stop bookmark file being overwritten & allows correct bookmark to be loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.If FlashGot is enabled.
2.Close down Firefox
3.Start Firefox
On starting - Bookmark file is over written/changed to be same size each time & only half of previous Bookmarks are loaded.

Actual Results:
Only half of my bookmark are displayed.
Bookmark file content is changed & overwritten to be smaller file size - a Firefox start up.
Where there should be six subheadings/menus - the last three and their content are deleted from the bookmark file each time.
File size change to be the same each time.

Expected Results:
Contents of the bookmark file are not usually changed or deleted on Firefox starting up - and bookmark file usually load fine.

When FlashGot extension is disabled - Firefox bookmark file doe not change or overwrite.

When FlashGot is disabled - bookmark work fine.
------------------
NOTE - 1st bookmark backup in the backup area contains the half-deleted file - so anyone wanting to restore their bookmark will need to look back far enough to get the appropriate complete file.
