Hi. To give you the full history, FF 3.5 wa crashing repeatedly and it seemed a though it had more to do specifically with flash site at the time. So, I uninstalled FF3.5 completely through Synaptic, and installed FF2. Then I had the same problem with FF2, so I did a bit more research, and found a solution. I uninstalled FF2 completely via Synaptic again, re-installed FF3.5b, and followed the step a described here: http://wvarner.blogspot.com/2008/05/firefox-crashing-on-youtube-in-ubuntu.html.

For a while, meaning, a few hour of online activity, this did the trick or at least greatly reduced the number and frequency of crashes. But the crash do continue, and a of today, have gotten to be much too frequent. Sometimes, I don't beleive I even have a page open that is using flash in my browser, and it will still crash. Although I always have about 4 or more tabbed page open.

Help please.

Thanks,

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insall 3.5 in Synaptic, install Foxmarks plugin, flash plugin, completely uninstall 3.5 via Synaptic, install FF2, completely uninstall FF2, install 3.5b again.
2. if necessary (i don't remember) re-install Flash plugin.
3. follow step here: http://wvarner.blogspot.com/2008/05/firefox-crashing-on-youtube-in-ubuntu.html
4. reload FF3.5B and play around with sites. Open 4 tab in one window, and surf around, alternating between having some flash site in your browser tabbed window(s), and no flash enabled site in your browser tabbed window(s).
Actual Results:
Would crash silently, sometimes mutiple time in a row, (always asking me to reload the page I had open before the crash, of course, to which I would always say yes).

Expected Results:
It should be stable and not crash, from what I wa led to believe, esp. if I am not at any web page that use flash.
