bookmark folder icon in bookmark toolbar use two icons: stock folder and dropdown arrow

I'm using Firefox 3.0 beta with Gnome integration and the Tango theme, and I just switched to Beta 3.

Now the many bookmark folder I have in my toolbar use, what, 20% more space with this drop down icon.

Space in this toolbar is very expensive. Before the change, I could keep 2 or 3 more bookmark visible on the screen. Now, on the next bookmark I add, the toolbar is full.

I read bug #404825 and from what I understood, you should drop the folder icon, it will save more space.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. using Firefox 3 under Gnome
2. adding bookmark folder to the bookmark toolbar
3. counting how many bookmark fit on the screen with and without the folder icon.
Actual Results:
Less space for these shortcut I use everyday.

Expected Results:
I would like to store more bookmark on the same line.

This is vanilla Firefox downloaded from mozilla.org, I'm not using any Debian package.
