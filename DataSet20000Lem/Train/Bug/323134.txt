When I get into Google Toolbar's options, click on the More tab and (from the dropbox under "Button Text Labels") select the Icons settings, I've found that the size of GTB's search box shrink back to it default size when FF 1.5 is opened or restarted, no matter how many time I manually enlarge it. But when the Selective Text Only setting is chosen, the problem go away.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install Google Toolbar.

2. Click the Options button, select the More tab and (from the dropbox under "Button Text Labels" below) select the "Icons" setting. Then click "Okay" to close out.

3. Manually enlarge the width of GTB's search bar by dragging it to the right using your mouse cursor.

4. Close the browser, then restart it. You'll immediately notice the size of Google Toolbar's search box ha shrunk.

5. Resize GTB's search bar width, then repeat step 2, only select "Selective Text Only" in GTB's option menu before closing out before restarting FF 1.5.

6. Notice, after restart, how GTB's search bar hasn't shrunk.

Actual Results:
Google Toolbar's search bar shrink back to it default size after FF 1.5 is restarted when the "Icons" setting is selected, and doesn't using the "Selective Text Only" settng.

Expected Results:
The size of Google Toolbar's search bar shouldn't change size at all, no matter what setting you choose from it's opions menu.
