Can't view www.yahoo.com

When I try to access www.yahoo.com, all that happens is that the yahoo favicon
appears in the page's tab, but the page itself stay blank, or, when I'm reusing
a tab, it carry on being the page that I wa viewing before, no matter how
many time I press go, hit enter on the address bar or refresh (which only
refreshes the old page).

If I go to another tab and then back again, the address-bar will return to
showing the address of the original page, although the yahoo icon will remain. I
have had a similar problem with http://news.google.com, but I can generally
force the issue by hitting 'go' a few times.

I actually have managed to use firefox to view Yahoo! about four time in total,
but only after hundred of unsuccessful attempts, all on different sessions.
There doesn't seem to be any real sort of pattern to the successes, but one of
them wa immediately after I upgraded from Firefox 0.8 to Firefox 0.9. That wa
on the old profile - although I have tried using a fresh profile before - all
without success.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with either a blank tab or with another page
2. Type www.yahoo.com into the adress bar & hit enter / press go
Actual Results:
The favicon generally appears, and then the throbber stops, and nothing else
happens. Effectively the step 1 & 2 (to reproduce the bug) might a well have
never happened. This sucks.

Expected Results:
The usual Yahoo! page should appear.
