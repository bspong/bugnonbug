At the web site, user can create web-based flashcard to assist in studying.
The site make use of javascript pop-up with what seems to be standard html in
the pop-up itself. When you 'flip' the card, it brings a new page. For some
reason this will flash in the taskbar a if it is trying to display an error
message (as firefox typically does), however no amount of clicking it or poking
around yield an error message. When the pop-up is being viewed, it flash much
more rapidly than when it is minimized or out of view. For whatever reason, this
only became noticeable about halfway through the set.

Reproducible: Always

1. Register and create a set of flash cards.
2. View the flash card a if you are studying.
3. View epileptic goodness.

I am using a custom Windows theme with Star Skin, however I haven't had this
issue before, and I'm using the default firefox theme.
