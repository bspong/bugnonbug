Firefox freeze

After the latest update, firefox ha a tendency for freezing a lot. Especially on site like the one linked, but this issue seem to spread to every site I'm on, sporadically freezing and crashing.

Best example would be when using site such a OneManga, where you basically view "images". I don't know if it's the way such site are constructed, but when I use such sites, it often happens that firefox just stop responding. It'll freeze (you know, that pale fading of "not responding") for like 4 seconds, then work again, freeze, work, freeze...

Other than freezing a lot, Firefox ha now a higher tendency for taking insane amount of RAM. I can run several gaming application smoother now, than I can run Firefox to read a simple site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit OneManga.com
2. View image
Actual Results:
Firefox get sluggish, and end up freezing a lot. At times, it also take huge amount of RAM, requiring me to restart it.

Expected Results:
Not get sluggish, use insane amount of RAM and especially not freeze.

Just being on the site, or having a tab open seems to be enough, to cause similar effect on other sites.


Before the update, I used to have 20-30 tab up perfectly fine. Now I can barely have 5 tab up.
