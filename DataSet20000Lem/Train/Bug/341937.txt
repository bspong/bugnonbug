This only happens with certain sites, and I have only had a problem for a few weeks, that I think coincides with updating mozilla. It happens on MSNBC, where I have disabled flyouts, however, each time I return, they are no longer disabled. It is annoying having to reset it every time I visit. This wa never a problem before. On CNN, I had my page preference set to International, but have to reset it also each time I visit, from the U.S. page back to the International. Finally, my hotmail address and password have to be re-entered each time I open hotmail, even though I set it to save email and password. I am the sole user of this computer and it's frustrating having to reset everything all the time. If this problem is already on here, sorry, but I didnt find anything that referred to this type of thing. Note, on other site requiring my login name/password, while I'm no longer signed in automatically, it still ha my info saved. The hotmail requires me to retype everything.
