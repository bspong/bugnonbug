I'm a web developer, frequently use preference setting on the CMS.

I've try Firefox 4 beta 2 for a while (both on Windows & Ubuntu), this bug's appeared only on Ubuntu.

First, load CKEditor enabled page (usually on preference, content settings), I've load some page in the same tab, for several minute Firefox hangs.

I try some website that have textarea with javascript in page, on second page load even same page or not, it would hang when typing for a while (less than a minute).

Last try I create a page in local drive (file://).

It's contain below:
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<textarea></textarea>
</body>
</html>

Yeah, it hang again in second page load, without any javascript code.

Key to appear:
- Typing some text (usually 2-3k characters).
- In second page load in the same tab.
- Even no javascript, only one textarea in page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page contains least a textarea for least two time (try both same page or different pages).
2. Typeing some text (usually appeared on 2-3k character in textarea).
3. Try on page contains javascript code or not.
