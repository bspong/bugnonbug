Every time I go to the above URL the entire window visiting that URL freezes. Other window are unaffected but other tab on the same URL are unaccesable. If you click on other tab their title appear on the browser window and the bookmark toolbar still work but the page itself will not render, i.e., the part where you see the web page is completely frozen and will not render anything.

The page URL (in the primary toolbar on top) is also frozen and cannot be selected or otherwise allow text entry. The search box also doe not allow any entry but the menu allowing one to select other search engine still displays. Trying to go to another webpage via bookmark change the page title again but leaf the page itself frozen, i.e., it is still blank and white.
