Fix (most) remaining migration bug for Firefox 14
Combo-patch for remaining migration issue is in the pipe, not too big, not to small. Bugs which are already filed will be blocked by this bug.

Here's a list of user-facing bug I'm going to fix here:
* [Major] Bug 738263 - Default bookmarks.html import on migration is temporarily broken ("planned" regression)
* [Major] Bug 748047 - Reset profile feature is broken (regression)
* Migration wizard fails to recognize default browser on Windows vista and window 7. This is a long standing issue, but I don't think it's filed.
* On Mac and Linux we don't even bother detecting the default browser.
* Detection of default browser on Windows doesn't check for safari.
* The wizard lie (and doesn't tell all the truth) about the data that is about to be migrated:
"Import Options, Bookmarks, History, Passwords and other data from:"
...Chrome, Safari
* Internet Explorer becomes _Microsoft_ Internet Explorer in the homepage wizard-page.

Implementation detail to be fixed here:
* Simplify migration wizard modes.
* Remove the puzzling code for saving the homepage pref.
* Build the list of migrator in the wizard dynamically. As a result, quite a few duplicated string are noew removed from migration.dtd.
* nsIBrowserProfileMigrator: do away with the startup arguments.
* slow decom: getMigrator now return the wrappedJSObject of each migrator.
* Remove some leftover of "From File" mode.
* When the default browser is detected on windows, the reg-key wa never closed (my bad). The new code doe not rely on registry keys.

The following issue will _not_ be covered by this bug:
* Chrome migrator report that migration is done too early (not yet filed)
* Safari migrator doe not import cooky and top site (to be done in other bugs. We may or may land these for Firefox 14)
* about:home is still featured a "Firefox Start, a fast home page with built-in search"
* The migration wizard interaction is worse than Linux.
* It's rocket science to test the homepage page on build with non-official branding.
