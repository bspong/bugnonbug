Sometimes Navigation Toolbar is removed from the UI by user to increase visual
area. When the user later re-enables the Navigation Toolbar, the autocomplete
history in the location bar is forgotten. That is he can no longer see the
possible suggestion for the address he is typing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Assumption: You have using the browser for some time, so that you have some
navigation history recorded with the browser. You get autocomplete suggestion
from history when you type your address in the location bar.
1. Go to View -> Toolbars. Deselect the "Navigation Toolbar" to remove the
Navigation Toolbar from the browser UI.
2. Do some browsing without the Navigation Toolbar (e.g. using link etc.) OR
Close the Firefox application.
3. Go to View -> Toolbars. Select the "Navigation Toolbar" to make the
Navigation Toolbar visible in the browser UI.
4. Type web address in the location bar that you expect to be in history.


Actual Results:
No autocomplete suggestion from history available when typing the web address.

Expected Results:
The usual list of suggested web address (from usage history) should be shown
when typing address in the location bar.
