missing "Text Size" zoom feature, Full page zoom should be an option not replacement
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; ru; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8

As we can see in the latest trunk (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9a9pre) Gecko/2007102605 Minefield/3.0a9pre), text size zoom is replaced with full page zoom, and there is no way to return usual text size zoom.

But for many people (including yours faithfully) full page zoom is completely useless and moreover UNUSABLE. It's even often is one of reason for people to prefer Firefox to Opera -- they just want to increase text size -- not images, not layout at all, text only -- for more comfortable READING only, not for any another purposes.

Text size zoom is really advantageous distinction of Firefox from any other browser.

So, if full page zoom will be turned on by default then an option to return old behavior should exist. (Though, in my humble opinion, expediency of turning full page zoom by default is VERY questionable, and ZOOM should be an option [for some Opera switchers, etc.] -- and text size turned on by default a it wa in previous Firefox versions).

Subject options, for example, may look like two radiobuttons in "View" -> "Zoom" menu:
- Zoom text only
- Zoom full page

with former option checked by default.

This may be duplicated in hierarchy of main Firefox setting if needed (perhaps someplace in "Tools" -> "Options" -> "Content"). Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Just try to resize text only -- you will get full page zoom instead.
Then search for option to return old behavior -- there is nothing way to do it.
Actual Results:
Text size zoom is replaced with full page zoom.

Expected Results:
Full page zoom should be an option, not default and only way to zoom text.
