I try to open the website www.bluelandblog.com (which becomes http://trashers.portspaces.com/blueland) and it lock up Mozilla & say "not responding"

Is there a setting I need to change?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type in the URL http://www.bluelandblog.com or http://thrashers.portspaces.com/blueland
2. mozilla firefox (2.0.0.3) lock up & will not open the website
3.
Actual Results:
It begin to open the page. You either see the blue background on the website appear & then it lock up or it will open the page just a tiny bit further & you will see the word "Blueland Blog" at the top & the blog written in the white section in the middle & then it lock up.

Expected Results:
Should be able to open the website & view the pages. It open fine on my computer with Internet Explorer.

I wa running Mozilla Firefox on my old computer with Windows XP & the website worked fine. I just got a new computer running Windows Vista & downloaded Mozilla Firefoz 2.0.0.3 & it won't open the website.
