choosing a "monospaced" font in the Options dialog

When the list of available font is presented in the Firefox prefs dialog, the function GDIFontEntry::MatchesGenericFamily() is used to determine if font match the CSS generic such a "serif", "sans-serif", or "monospace". This is done using the "windows family" property of the fonts.

In the Prefs dialog, this is used to sort "matching" font into the first section of the font list, and the remaining family appear in a second section of the list.

However, many font do not provide the proper metadata for Windows to classify them in this way, but are simply marked a FF_DONTCARE. This is especially true for non-Latin fonts, but also for many third-party Latin fonts. The result is that these font appear in the first (preferred) section of the list even when this is not appropriate; moreover, they appear in the first section of the list for ALL the generic (serif, sans, and monospace).

The attached screenshot show the font list being used to select a "monospace" font; note that the list mix many non-monospaced font in with the valid monospaced ones, so that the user is given little help in making an appropriate choice.
