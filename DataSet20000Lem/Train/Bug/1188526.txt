Pageload much slower when Inspector is open in a specific case

Testcase

Loading the attached testcase (originally from <http://rcocks.github.io/>) is much slower when Inspector is open than when it's not open.

I profiled this a bit, and of the 7 of wall-clock time in the profile about 2.5s are Proxy::get which doe various proxy and Xray goop and then land in xpc::AddonWrapper<xpc::XrayWrapper<js::CrossCompartmentWrapper, xpc::DOMXrayTraits> >::get which very eventually call a DOM binding getter. Of those 2.5s, only about 270ms are under the binding getter.

The binding getters involved are the "type", "target", "attributeName", "attributeNamespace" getters on MutationRecord objects.

Another 1.7s wall-clock is under Proxy::callProp, whih mostly spends it time (1.4s) under Proxy::get doing Xray stuff. In fact, I can't even tell what we're calling because all the sample were under Proxy::get afaict.

Also, about 600ms doing JS_WrapValue whie calling MutationCallback::Call (presumably this is the chrome MutationCallback we're calling here, so have to Xray-wrap all the stuff). The vast majority of this is actual js::NewObjectWithGivenTaggedProto.

Apart from that, there's a lot of .value set on HTMLInputElements (about 1 wall-clock under here). That's done by the actual web page code.

So it look to me like having lot of value attribute change like this queue a ton of mutation observer and some combination of our Xray code and our devtools end up not that happy with that...
