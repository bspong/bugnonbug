Im considering this a major bug because the behaviour is just wrong.

Since around version 3 or so the 'view source' feature reloads the url. That is just not correct. Sometimes a single URL output different code depending on various factors, for example if there is post data or not. Or depending on what the post data is. Some backends are programmed to produce partially random code. Sometimes the delivered code depends on the time of the submission (for example interactive clock and calendars). Some database backends will intentionally cause a failure when trying to repost the identical information. Or the data in the db could change between the time when I initially loaded the page and when I click the 'view source' feature. Therefore forcing a reload just to get the page source is just a bad idea! These are only a few examples.

In other words, what I am saying is that a new request on the same url doe NOT show me the source for the currently viewed page in many circumstances!

The browser ha the code in memory, just show it to me! I cant see how forcing a resubmit in order to get my current page source would ever be a good idea.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
right click any page and select 'View Page Source' from the menu.
Actual Results:
I get *new* source, not the current source!

Expected Results:
I want to see the source for the page I am looking at!
