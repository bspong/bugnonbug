(Context menu) search, then tab switch, search in wrong tab. TILE PAGE search doe not work.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Select text [left mouse button] in TAB A. Search using the right mouse button dropdown menu [search google/yahoo for "abc]. FX open TAB B.

I quickly switch to TAB A, FX load the result in TAB A instead of TAB B, but TAB B is still open. I clock TAB B and FX load the search result in that tab a well [more like, it hasn't loaded the result yet and start loading when I click the tab].

2. TILE PAGE [PAGE where I see my frequently visited website] search bar is useless. It won't search no matter how many time I click enter. It search after 2 to 5 click or completely ignores enter key press. It is even effected witht he same problem a nos. 1, where I search for an item and switch to a different page and FX show result in that page [as described in problem 1]

[My pc is fast enough and I have an r7 240 Sapphire AMD] thus it isn't a pc performance issue.


Actual results:

It happens for me 100% of time and is bothersome. I search x item in TAB A and switch to TAB B and the search result is shown in TAB B while TAB A is still open and it show the google logo but it load the tab when I click on it. Tab B hasn't even loaded yet!


Expected results:

Tab result should have been in the tab I searched for, it is being shown in a different TAB and I have notced the "START PAGE" of FX being a terrible ordeal ever since australis and specially from version 33.

Please fix this. It's anoying and is a hinderance to my work.
