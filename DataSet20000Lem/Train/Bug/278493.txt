Cannot go directly to a secure page in FireFox. Both SSLs are selected in Options (default). Selecting TLS doesn't help.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new FireFox browser. (clear history and cooky if you've been to a
Verizon site)
2. Go to http://netservices.verizon.net/portal/site/verizon/index.jsp.
3. Click on the "My Account" link on the left side.
4. Log on to Verizon with username and password. (You will need a Verizon
account to do this.)

Results:
The URL change to "https://sso.verizon.net/portal/ProcessLoginServlet", the
page is blank, and it say "Done" in the status bar.

NOTES:
Clicking on the browser's Reload button doe not take user to the correct page.
It is still blank.
But, clicking on the Back button will take user to the "My Account" page.
From there, user can go to "Billing" --> "Online Usage" to find out how many
hour they have been online for the month. This is an HTTPS page.

On the "Online Usage" page, I bookmarked the URL, and can go directly to this
page in IE, but can't in FireFox.

As long a I keep the FireFox browser open, I can click on the Bookmarked page
and go back there (to the "Online Usage" page) without error once I've been there.
But if I close out of FireFox, re-open another FireFox browser window, and click
on this bookmark, it pop up with a blank page again. Even though no cache,
cookies, or history ha been deleted.

After getting a blank page, clicking on the bookmarked URL again will take user
to the correct page.

Clicking the Back button and then the Forward button doe not work.
Neither doe clicking on the Refresh button.

If the History and Cookies have been deleted, opening a new FireFox browser and
going directly to this bookmark will get a white page with the text "Not
Supported Method".
Clicking the Reload button under this condition WILL take user to the Login
page. But logging-in still take user to a blank page.

Another note:
Doing just the first couple of steps: opening FireFox, going to this bookmarked
URL, and getting a white page, if user open another tab in this window and
click on the bookmarked URL, page will open successfully.

Reproducible: Always
