flod, your feedback please.

The number of selected cooky is always two if the user selects a cookie from a host in the unfiltered view and then the folder, so
https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/2a193b7f395c/browser/components/preferences/cookies.js#l553
should set
> selectedCookieCount += item.cookies.length;
instead of
> selectedCookieCount += 2;

This code is from the new preference dialog in bug 274712 which seemed to support multiselect in the unfiltered view. This is not valid anymore, at least on Windows 8.1. Can anybody confirm this for all platforms? If this is a general issue, I can also fix that issue.
