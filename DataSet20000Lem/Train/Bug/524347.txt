Everytime I attempt to load a page on certain websited that includes an area/screen playing a video (such a the page on the example above), the screen go blank immediateliy after having loaded (but the sound/music still keep playing), however if you enhance the video area to full screen (before it ha loaded completely and started playing) it play fine. This happens everytime with some webpage like Yahoo Music, but not others like Youtube. I have attempted using Internet Explorer instead and the page play fine (like it is suppose to) a well a using Firefox on another computer, with the same problem occuring, so this is definitely a problem with Firefox rather than a hardware problem.
