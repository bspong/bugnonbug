On OS X 10.5.2 with a Fresh install of Firefox 3 Beta 5, only the Firefox menu is accessible if you don't uncheck the initial dialog which prompt you to decide if Firefox should be the default browser. The only way to get the Menus to appear is to go Firefox->Preference or Firefox->About Mozilla Firefox. This cause them to appear. This is only temporary a upon the next restart the menu will still be missing until you decide if Firefox should be the default browser or do the workaround a noted above. Note that this is not a graphical issue and you cannot just click in the blank space where File, Edit, View etc menu should be to get the Menus to appear.
Uninstalled and reinstalled and I'm still seeing this.

1.Install Firefox 3 Beta 5
2.Open Firefox but do NOT uncheck the dialog which asks you to decide if Firefox should be the default browser
3.

Menus don't appear
