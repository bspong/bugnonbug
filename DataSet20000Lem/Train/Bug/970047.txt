Steps to reproduce:

Feature request: add a full-page screenshot button to the Responsive Design View (aka Responsive Mode). Currently the screenshot button only allows user to take a screenshot of the visible content.

Rationale: full-page screenshots are a common need for web designer and developers, a exemplified by popular screenshot extension for Firefox, Chrome, etc. This feature is generally the core reason for those extension to exist, since operating system provide their own screenshot feature to capture visible content.

This feature is already available by combining the Responsive Design View (to get the viewport width you need for testing/demonstration) and the Developer Toolbar command line. I’d argue that a majority of user of the Responsive Design View are unlikely to ever use the nerdy Developer Toolbar, especially web designers, so exposing the "full page" screenshot feature in the Responsive Design View UI would make sense.

The bug for adding the current screenshot button was: #849236
