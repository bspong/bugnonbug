Bookmarks overwriting - too many bookmarks?

Sometimes when I bookmark a page it will display a different title and have a folder preselected - generally it a bookmark in that bookmark folder with that title. If I'm not careful to rename and select a different folder - the bookmark will overwrite the old one. Also some bookmark seem to be getting overwritten by other link I have clicked on. I have over 200 bookmark and wa wondering if that could be part of the issue. - I tried organizing the bookmark into separate folder to hopefully stop it from happening but it persists. Longer URLs may have an effect on this reoccurring also.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Pull down bookmark menu
2.Click bookmark this page
3.Check to see if the title and bookmark page match or not
Actual Results:
Sometimes Firefox will preselect a folder and a title of a bookmark already in that folder and will overwrite that bookmark.

Expected Results:
Most of the time Firefox enters the title of the webpage that I want a the bookmark title and default to the bookmark folder
