The setting for <textarea "cols="60" rows="10" wrap="PHYSICAL" ></textarea> are not recognised. When viewed with other browser the input text wrap a expected; with Firefox 3.0.7 the input is displayed on a single line with scroll bar showing text being added to right. It is reproducible on any text area box on the web page in question. The problem wa not recognised when using Firefox 2. Changing the wrap attribute ha no effect. Removing the wrap attribute completely permit correct behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. the wrap attribute ha been removed from www.clowd.org.uk/pages/clowdForm.htm now permitting the page to behave a expected
2.
3.
Actual Results:
No special set up required

Expected Results:
Previously text continues to be entered to right instead of wrapping, horizontal scroll bar are added instead of moving to next line

As with other browser after the specified number of character is entered on one line the cursor should move down a line. The sequence should be repeated until the specified number of line have been entered, when scrollbars should be displayed. Removing the wrap attribute from the code enables correct function
