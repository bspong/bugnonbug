Navigator toolbar button become corrupted when switching from remote desktop to local desktop
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.8

If Firefox is started during a remote desktop session (this is the cutdown
terminal service supplied with XP), and then the same session is accessed locally
(i.e. via the local monitor and keyboard) the navigation toolbar button are
corrupted. Note that the local display is configured for 32bit colour, but the
remote force 16bit (which is probably related). The same effect is seen when
going from local desktop to remote.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure display is set to 32bit colour depth, and enable remote desktop access.
2. Connect remotely and start firefox, then disconnect (do not logout).
3. Unlock the local display (i.e. same session). The nav button should be corrupt.

Actual Results:
Firefox nav button corrupted.

Expected Results:
Redisplayed nav button correctly.

This ha been happening since version 0.8. I'm currently using 0.9.3.

Superb browser BTW - I only use IE when Firefox doesn't work (about 2% of the
time).
