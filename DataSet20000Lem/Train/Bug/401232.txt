For the past three days, Firefox very frequently encounter an error and ha to shut down. I reinstalled the latest version of firefox, but this ha not made any difference. When launching Firefox again and choosing restore session, four out of five time the tab stay in reloading mode without actually reloading the sites. Once, this happened while I wa checking cooky in the cookie manager - when I restarted Firefox after that, some of the individual website cookie folder had vanished and the website in question appeared in the blocked cooky folder.

Reproducible: Always

This happens regardless of what site my tab are on, it doesn't occur a a result of any particular action or a a result of surfing any particular website. I wonder if it is connected to the fact that my latest Norton upgrade ha placed a toolbar in the browser.
