Steps to reproduce:

@ http://www.gsmd.ac.uk/about_the_school/about_us/job_vacancies.html clicked a link:
http://www.gsmd.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/files/Job_Vacancy_info/Information_Pack_-_GS100.pdf I chose Save to a location. This brought up a file browser, with the Save button highlighted a blue. I browsed to where I wanted it to go, and saved the file.

I then clicked the second link:
http://www.gsmd.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/files/Job_Vacancy_info/GS100_GSMD_Application_Form.doc


Actual results:

The first time the "Opening [filename]" appeared offering "Open with [application]" or "Save file". When Save file wa chosen, the Save button wa highlighted a blue.

The second link went straight to the Save file browser, however the Save button wa no longer highlighted a blue. If I pressed Enter, nothing happened, however I later found that after saving the file to the above location, the "Opening [filename]" dialog reappeared, even though I had already saved it.


Expected results:

The Save button should always highlight blue a default, so one can save a succession of downloads to the same location a previously. Its present behaviour mean that this ha to be done manually each and ever time. In earlier version of Firefox, this did not happen, one wa able to select a location the first time and then have the browser automatically return to the same browsed-to location thereafter unless changed, in whcih case it would subsequently return to the new browsed-to location, with Save button highlighted a blue and thus activatable by a simple press of Enter a previously.
