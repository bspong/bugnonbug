The new Skype 5 ha a major problem. It compromise the Internet Explorer and Firefox web browser on computer using Windows XP by aggressively attempting to install it add-ons—regardless of installation instruction to the contrary. So far, it seems to have no such effect on Chrome. I am running a machine with XP and a machine with Windows 7. Windows 7 seems not to be affected by Skype 5.

On the XP system, once Skype 5 is installed any attempt to access IE trigger the generation of hundreds, no...thousands, of tab addressing:

This tie up 100% of CPU usage and essentially lock up the machine. Accessing Firefox ha a different result: since Firefox process add-on first, it never loads. Instead, it generates the “We're sorry...” crash screen.

Please find a solution fast. I use all these program for different task and don't want to lose their functionality.
