Add a special bookmark folder for real time bookmark(not RSS) so that user can come to the that page easily

I used to add a folder named RILR(which mean read it later,actually there is a addon named like this),so that I can locate my recently reading page easily the next time(actually I am so lazy that I may read it a few week later,in this case,the "recently visited" is not that useful).But soon,I find out that I have to update the link manually,since I have finished reading the original page and have gone to another pager next to it.
So my suggestion is,adding another smart bookmark folder to keep the user bookmark live just like RSS does.The bookmark add to this bookmark folder by the user can 'see' whether the user have go to another pape(nearby),and save the link automatic.So next time the user come back,he or she can easily continue his or her last reading.This can be very useful especially when we are reading novel or article serialized in the Internet.I really don't want to update my link(which mean remove the old and bookmark the new) each time after I have finished reading chapter 1 of a serialized book and have gone to chapter 2.Can still I click this bookmark to read chapter 2 the next time?
Firefox is my favorite web browser,and I really wish it better.
