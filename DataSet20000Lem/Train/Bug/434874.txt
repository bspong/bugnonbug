random large gray/black filled area (or emptiness) when scrolling; possibly involving <div>s with overflow "auto" or "scroll"

Simply go to http://colinfahey.com/sat/sat_en_us.html and scroll up and down RAPIDLY using the scroll bar. You will probably see huge gray rectangles, OR large white empty rectangles, at random location on the page. Once you see such a rectangle, continue to hold down the mouse button and slowly scroll to one of the gray (or empty) rectangles. Once you see the affected area, release the mouse button, and the affected area MIGHT repaint with proper content. If not, pressing the browser refresh button, or resizing the browser window to force a repaint, will repaint the affected area. The page is XHTML strict and pass the W3C validator a such. The gray area appear at random vertical interval on the page, but the affected part are <div> and images; you can see that the horizontal extent of the affected area match the width of a <div> or an image. This is not limited to scrolling using the mouse; using page-up and page-down can also trigger this problem. Also, sometimes the scrolling fails indefinitely after scrolling to a gray region; only doing a page reload or a browser window resize will fix the painting glitch and allow scrolling to work again -- otherwise, all method of scrolling (page up/down; cursor up/down; mouse scroll wheel; mouse click and drag scroll bar) will remain locked up.

The basic structure of the page is a follows:

* A body that is centered in the browser window:

<body style="width:800px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">

* Images wrapped in <div>s, such as:

<div style="display:inline;">
<div style="margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width: 800px; max-width: 800px;">
<img src="sat_w_c_raw_to_scaled_graph.gif" id="sat_w_c_raw_to_scaled_graph.gif" alt="sat_w_c_raw_to_scaled_graph.gif" width="800" height="700" />
</div>
</div>

* Text wrapped in <div>, such as:

<div style="display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; border-style: solid; border-width: 0px; border-color: #000000; overflow: auto; width: 800px; max-width: 800px; ">
The following graph show the various way &quot;real numbers&quot; can be converted to integer numbers.
</div>

I think that forming a <body ...> a shown above, and putting many screen-heights worth of image and text block a shown above, would be sufficient to cause the problem.

This problem doe not happen with a page with identical text and image that is constructed with a <body ...> that is 100% of the browser width and center each image and text block using tables, etc. So, it's not a matter of the page having too many images, bogus images, or too much text. It's also not a matter of the computer involved, or memory. The alternative page show up fine. Meanwhile, the affected page (sat_en_us.html) appears fine in Internet Explorer 6.

As I said, I believe that this rendering bug ha to do with the general overall structure of the page (as described above). I have many XHTML page structured in the same way a the example XHTML document specified above, and all of my document show the same problem. I have never seen the problem appear on anything other than the batch of XHTML document that I've recently created. So, this bug come a a big shock, and while I very much want to keep the structure of my XHTML the way it is (due to it extreme simplicity), this visual bug is a total disaster! So, although it would be nice for Firefox to be fixed (only affecting future downloads and updates), I'm more interested in knowing the simplest way to restructure my page to work around the Firefox bug -- and I'm somewhat interested in the underlying cause of the current bug.

Firefox is an awesome browser! I'd be grateful for any help with this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Simply go to http://colinfahey.com/sat/sat_en_us.html and scroll up and down RAPIDLY using the scroll bar.
Actual Results:
You will probably see huge gray rectangles, OR large white empty rectangles, at random location on the page.

Expected Results:
One generally expects that there would not be random gray or blank region in a valid XHTML document.
