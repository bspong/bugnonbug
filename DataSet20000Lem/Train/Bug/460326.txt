I can login to my online banking fine and everything seems to work until I go
to pay bills. After logging in, I can select the "Bill Payment" option and it
go to the next page fine. However, the next step is to select "View and Pay
Bills". When I click that, instead of going to my screen to pay bills, it go
back to a login screen. If I enter my username and password again it state
that I am already logged in to the system. I have to switch to Internet
Explorer to pay bill now. This problem ha just started since I upgraded to
the newest version of Firefox....my previous version worked fine with all
aspect of my online banking.
