Firefox 3.0.9 Update Breaks Cmd-Click on Link to Open New Tab

Since the update to Firefox 3.0.9, Firefox will intermittently stop opening new tab when I Command-click on a link. Firefox will instead load the link in the current tab. Using the contextual menu to "Open Link In New Tab" still function properly even when the cmd-click function break

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a site with many inline link such a Google results, or other search/aggregation website
2. Start opening link in new tab by cmd-clicking on the link
3. Continue moving through site until cmd-click randomly stop working
Actual Results:
1. No new tab is created
2. Link is loaded in current tab (this mimic the behavior of a normal click)
3. Link can be forced into a new tab via the contextual menu item "Open Link in New Tab"

Expected Results:
1. New tab should be created in the background
2. Link should be loaded in the new tab

Even when the cmd-click behavior breaks, the ctrl-click for the contextual menu, then selecting "Open Link in New Tab" still function properly.

This is a regression with Firefox 3.0.9 a it never occurred in older versions.
