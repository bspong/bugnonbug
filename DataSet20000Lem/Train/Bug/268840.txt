DDE topic WWW_OpenURL implementation broken
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

The window ID specified in the DDE topic WWW_OpenURL is ignored in Firefox 1.0:
all URLs opened by another application are opened in accordance with the Tabbed
Browsing 'Open link from other application in' preference.

Previously (and in all other DDE-compliant browsers), the window ID could be
used to specify whether a URL is opened in a new window/tab (ID = 0) or the
frontmost or last used window/tab (ID = -1).

WWW_OpenURL also doe not activate the window in which the URL is opened.

The window ID is the 3rd parameter in the parameter string:
"http://myurl./",,windowID,0,,,



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Open a bookmark using a third party bookmark manager that us DDE to
communicate with the browser, e.g. Bookmark Buddy or URL Organizer 2
(urlorg.com/download.shtml).
Actual Results:
New URL is always opened in accordance with the Tabbed Browsing 'Open link from
other application in' preference, irrespective of the windowID used, and the
relevant window is not activated.

Expected Results:
The default behavior for WWW_OpenURL should be a follows:
- a windowID of 0 should open a URL in a new tab
- a windowID of -1 should open a URL in the most recent tab
- a windowID > 0 should open a URL in the corresponding tab*
Whichever window the URL is opened in should be activated.

The 'Open link from other applications' Tabbed Browsing option should be
changed to:
x Use new window instead of new tab
x Always open in: [a new tab] OR [a new window] OR [the most recent tab/window]
