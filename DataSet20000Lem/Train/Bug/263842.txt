If you try to use CTRL-M or CTRL-Z shortcut to gain access to pages, Mozilla
1.7.3 on Mac OS X set to Italian language (and Mozilla is in English, NO
Langpack added) the CTRL-M shortcut doe nothing, and the CTRL-Z act a CTRL-W.
In fact if this seems a Mozilla us the US QZERTY keyboard layout for
ACCESSKEYs, and this opinion is enforced by a fact: in the Italian Pro KB layout
on Apple Macs (QWERTY), the N and the M are contiguous, the M key sitting at the
right of the N key. In the US QZERTY layout, obviously the Z and the W key are
exchanged in place, AND the M key sits a row higher, at the right of the L key.
Using this key (is the ò or @ key in IT layout), in fact act a CTRL-M.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a webpage that us the M and the Z ACCSSKEY for WAI-A compliance
2. try to hit CTRL-M or CTRL-Z keyboard shortcut to access a link


Actual Results:
If the W ACCESSKEY is set on the page, the CTRL-Z follows this link, otherwise
nothing happens. The CTRL-M shortcut does'n't work at all, but CTRL-ò act a
CTRL-M

Expected Results:
CTRL-M ha to follow the ACCESSKEY="M" link.
CTRL-Z ha to follow the ACCESSKEY="Z" link.

Mozilla 1.7.3 for Mac OS X, non langpack, no (additional) theme installed
Mac OS X 10.3.5 fully patched, set to Italian Interface
Apple PowerBook G4 17" with Italian Pro keyboard layout
