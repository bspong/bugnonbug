"Firefox is already running..." FF had not previously been running for at least a few minute and should have had ample time to shut down. (crash bcb441a6-4c75-4af7-9e6b-678b62140610)

https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/bcb441a6-4c75-4af7-9e6b-678b62140610

Tried to start FF but received message "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system." FF had not previously been running for at least a few minute and should have had ample time to shut down.

This report is from Win8.1 with Firebug and Web Developer Toolbar addons, but I have also experienced the problem on Win7 Pro with no addons and a clean install. The problem happens frequently even after uninstalling and reinstalling FF.

I am very concerned about this because it could affect many user who will "solve the problem" by switching to Google Chrome instead of reporting it. I would hate to see FF lose further market share because they can't count on FF to start reliably! :(



Actual results:

Received message "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."


Expected results:

FF should have started normally.
