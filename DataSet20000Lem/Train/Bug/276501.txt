given example URL cannot be loaded - neither by writing it manually into address
line nor per mouse click. obviously firefox 1.0 doe not like url ending up
with 5468x - work fine with 5467x and 5469x though. all heise.de page work
fine with MSIE 6.0SP1, but every newsticker page today with 54680 up to 54689
doe not load in no way with firefox - it simply doe not TRY to load the page
at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit www.heise.de/newsticker
2. try to click at the news "SMS-Fahndung verläuft im Sand"
3. voila - page doe not load!

Actual Results:
page with URLs containing number between 54680 and 54689 do not load at all.

Expected Results:
load and display the URLs clicked at or written into address line.

stepped over this problem some time ago with firefox 0.9, but thought it wa an
heise.de error that time. a i reproduced this error today i tried out other
browsers, so i could find out it is really some firefox bug and not any kind of
loading/routing-problem.
