company private network secured by software like webwasher on one hand, and site re-configuring a different set of allowed certificate signer make it difficult to update firefox a it is not allowed to connect to ssl secured update sites.

it would be beneficial to show the update url so one can click on it and then add an exception for these certificate to make the later update run through without problem.

the same would apply for the firefox update itself.
