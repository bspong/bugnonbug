A user can create a null location bookmark without a warning message. After the
bookmark is created if it is attempted to be used no action result (page opens,
error message, etc.) except the Bookmarks menu drop down window loss focus. To
an inexperienced user this may appear a though there is something is wrong with
the browser or the requested site or path. By adding an warning message the
browser user friendliness could be enhanced. An example of this is a bookmark
that wa inadvertently created with a Null Entry by a more experienced user for
a le experienced user. I compared the above-described behavior to that of
Internet Explorer version 5.50.4807.2300CO. The design is slightly different,
but a similar function (bookmark Properties) within IE with a location input
field (URL: in IE) doe provide the user an error message if a Null Entry is
entered into the URL field.

Step to replicate Null Entry error message in Internet Explorer:
Favorites à Right Click on any website --> Select Properties --> Switch to the
Web Documents tab in the Properties Dialog Box --> Delete the entry in the URL
field --> Click OK.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmarks --> Manage Bookmarks --> New Bookmark
2. Click OK on the Properties of “New Bookmark” dialog box.


Actual Results:
A warning message wa not displayed that the user created a bookmark with a Null
Entry in the location field.

Expected Results:
A message box warning that a location wa not entered into the bookmark's
location field (info tab).
