After I input my username and password into http://mail.yahoo.com ,
then FireFox load URL: http://us.f524.mail.yahoo.com/ym/login?.rand=XXXXXXXXXXXXX
where XXXXXXXXXXXXX is random string that wa generated by yahoo, nothing show
up, only blank page, bottom status bar show "Done". In addition, when I tried
to reload the page, only the XXXXXXXXXXXXX changed, and blank page again. I have
tried to reload several times, same errors. Furthermore, if I enter
http://mail.yahoo.com, URL will change to
http://us.f524.mail.yahoo.com/ym/login?.rand=XXXXXXXXXXXXX , and blank page
appeared.

BTW: FireFox seems cannot load the Yahoo Music too, it popped up errors, I am
gonna put another bug report about this.

Compare to IE, I really like FireFox, but I guess there are many people're using
Yahoo Mail so hopefully FireFox can be improved by solving the Yahoo problems.
