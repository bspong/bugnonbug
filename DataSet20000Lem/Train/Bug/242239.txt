Autocomplete doe not autofill usernames and password when the username field
is pre-populated with either the full username (1) or a substring of the
username (2). For instance:

1) PayPal’s Login page (https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_login-run)
remembers my email address. When I revisit the page, my password is autofilled
by the Mozilla Suite but not by FireFox.

2) RBC Bank's Login page
(https://www1.royalbank.com/cgi-bin/rbaccess/rbunxcgi?F6=1&F7=IB&F21=IB&F22=IB&REQUEST=ClientSignin&LANGUAGE=ENGLISH)
prepopulates the client card field with 4519 since all RBC card begin with
those numbers. When I revisit the page, my full card number and my password are
autofilled by the Mozilla Suite but not by FireFox.

This is a problem on many sites. I can easily offer a dozen more example on
request. This is the single most painful reminder for me that I am not using
the suite. Instead of just clicking the sign-in/log-in button and going on my
merry way a I do with the suite, I must focus the username field, release the
mouse and delete a character from the end of whatever is in the username field,
press the down-arrow to activate the drop-down list, select the username, grab
the mouse again and click the sign-in/log-in button.

It's like a dripping faucet - a minor irritation that get more and more
annoying with each repeated instance.
