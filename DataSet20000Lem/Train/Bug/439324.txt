In the bookmark manager window, when adding tag to bookmarks, if I switch from a bookmark to another, the tag checkbox list reset it position. This could be no problem if I have little (<20) tags, but can become irritating if there are many, many more tag (think about 100+)and I have to check the same checkbox for an entire group of bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the bookmark manager (you should have already at least 10-20 tag for your bookmark to notice the checkbox list reset effect)
2.go to a folder with many bookmark
3.for the first of the bookmarks, scroll down the tag checkbox list, and check the last tag
4.then click on the second bookmark (the tag checkbox list resets)
5.for the second of the bookmarks, scroll down again the tag checkbox list, and check the last tag
6. and so on...

Actual Results:
every time you change bookmark in the bookmark manager window, the Tags checkbox list reset it position.

Expected Results:
the checkbox list should not reset it position. At least, it should be available a a configuration flag...

We are just starting now to use this wonderful feature of firefox 3.0; at the moment, many people will have only few tags, but their number is going to augment very soon, and this could become a more diffuse and important problem
