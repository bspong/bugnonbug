Steps to reproduce:

Nightly updated to v57 and now ha poorly thought through Dark Theme elements.


Actual results:

The Dark Theme no longer us a blue tab to indicate which tab ha focus. Because of this it is now near impossible to tell which tab ha focus. Apparently firefox is going to get a "blue line" across the focused tab? The mockups I've seen for this implementation are not impressive. More need to be done to differentiate which tab ha focus. It is important to always consider people with visual disability when making decision like ha been done here: removal of a clear focus-indicator to one that is near impossible to differentiate from other non-focused ones.

What is the argument for abandoning the blue tab for indicating focus? A "blue line" across the top of the focused tab is not a sufficient indication of focus.


Expected results:

The focused tab should be clearly differentiated from the other non-focused tabs. The entire focused tab should be a different color or a dramatically different shade. Nothing about the difference should be subtle.

The decision to switch the color of the focused tab wa clearly poorly thought through. The decision to have a blue line differentiating tab should be abandoned until a better design is put forward.
