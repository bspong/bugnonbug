This bug will consolidate a list of bug which deal with toolbar usability.

Here is an initial synopsis of some of the issues.

1. Toolbar name (as listed in the "View" menu) have no fixed relation to their content so, for example, the "Bookmarks toolbar" may have other item placed in it which can cause confusion if the user attempt to hide the bookmark toolbar item. (Bug 287686)
2. Custom toolbars are unintuitive. (Bug 212990)
3. Dragging toolbar item should provide better feedback than a slightly different cursor (a mostly transparent copy of the item for example). (Bug 318052)
4. The "Go" button should be somehow linked to the "Location" bar. (Bug 257561)
5. Only the "Bookmarks toolbar" item handle overflow. It would be nice if all toolbar item (including the menu) handled overflow.

These issue might seem only slightly related but there is a simple solution for most of them. All toolbar button could be placed into group (i.e., <toolbaritem>) and the "View > Toolbars > name" could be linked to the toolbar group instead of to the toolbar.

This is my first meta bug so forgive me if I've covered too much, or not enough.
