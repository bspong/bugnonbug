The intranet of my university us Hyperwave, which basically ha a small frame
showing the tree structure of the content and a big frame showing the actual
content. When I click on an item of the tree structure, the big frame load the
correct new content. However, the tree frame itself doesn't open the clicked
branch, it just make nothing. The operation itself involves a lot of scripting
(tested with IE6, all script had to ask for permission). This render the whole
intranet to useless, a the first page displayed in the tree frame is
'Loading...' and not updating correctly (correctly = not at all, thus giving no
further access). This can be bypassed, however, if I right-click on the frame
and then choose to reload it manually. Then it update to it correct (new)
state. As most of my friend (non CS students) migrate to Firefox now, this is
quite a proplem ('better future? right now it doe not even work').



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. get a login to intranet.fh-ingolstadt.de (University of Applied Science,
Ingolstadt, Germany)
2. log in
3. see that u can not access anything without manually reloading the 'table of
content' frame.
4. Manually reload it

Actual Results:
After that, it worked. But end-users might not have the knowledge to bypass it.

Expected Results:
Worked? (Loading the content frame correctly automatically)

Used a standard install of Firefox 1.0
