New MIME type set with "Do this automatically ..." fails to locate helper app

When FF see a new MIME type it prompt the user for what they want to do. If the user click "Browse..." and chooses a helper app, then check the "Do this automatically for file like this from now on" then the file is opened successfully with the chosen app, however next time the MIME type is seen Firefox fails with an error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Paste this URI into Firefox: "data:application/xyz,a,b,c,d,e"
2. The "Opening application/xyz" dialogue opens.
3. Click "Browse...". The "Choose Helper Application" dialogue appears.
4. Click "Browse..." again. Navigate to an application, e.g. wordpad, excel, powerpoint etc and select it.
5. The "Choose Helper Application" dialogue disappears and the user is returned to the "Opening application/xyz" dialogue with the chosen app in the select list.
6. Check the "Do this automatically for file like this from now on" check box and click OK.
7. The data "a,b,c,d,e" appears in the chosen app.
8. Repeat step 1, ie. paste "data:application/xyz,a,b,c,d,e" into FF again.
Actual Results:
In step 8, firefox fails to open the application and display this error message "C:\DOCUME~1\HP_ADM~1\LOCALS~1\Temp\2ekHJk_h-1.part could not be opened, because the associated helper application doe not exist. Change the association in your preferences.". Upon opening options->Applications there is no sign of the new association so there is no obvious way to remove the mapping or correct the problem.

Expected Results:
Two thing - the file should be opened successfully and the new mapping should appear in the application list.

Aside: The options->applications screen doesn't show mime type or extension any more.
