Organizing bookmark is very slow in the library with a large bookmark collection (many folders)

Some operation like "Paste", "New bookmark...", "New Folder..." and "New Separator" are very slow in the library under certain circumstances. I have circa 3500 bookmark in 250 folder and these operation take circa 10 with 100% CPU on the top level (Bookmarks Menu) in the library. (My system: Ubuntu 7.10, Windows XP, Athlon XP2500+, 1GB Ram)
These operation are almost instantly in the bookmark menu, or on the deepest folder level in the library.

The attached test file show a similar bad performance like my normal bookmarks. I tried some different configuration and the performance seems to mostly depend on the number of folder on the current level and below, the number of bookmark had a much lesser influence.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new profile and import the bookmarks.html test file
2.Open the library
3.Copy bookmark "bookmark_2580"
4.Paste it on the same level

Actual Results:
The browser hang for some second

Expected Results:
It should be fast like in the bookmark menu
