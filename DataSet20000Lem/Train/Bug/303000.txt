If you set an image height to 100% inside a column who's height depends on other
image then the height of the first image may be set to the height of the column
before the image are printed to the screen and therefor will be too short.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Create a table with two column of an unspecified height.
Allow the second column's height to be defined by it content and then set an
image in the first column to height="100%" .
Actual Results:
Most of the time that image's height is correctly set to fill the first column.
But if you have image in the second column that define the height of that
column then at time the image in the first column will get it's height before
the image in the second column are printed to the screen so that the first
image is shorter than it should be.

Expected Results:
the image in the first column should fill it's column

The problem occures more often when a "refresh" meta tag is in the header.

I believe that the error occures more often when the image is not from the
originating site because the image take longer to download.

I attempted to create an example of this at:
http://qj.mine.nu/test-for-firefox-bug/index.html

If that doesn't demonstrate the problem then the site where I see it often is:
http://qj.mine.nu/graffiti/index.html

I have to oppologize in advance in case there is inappropriate content at the
latter page. I allow for anonymous posting on it.

I realize that, in the past at least, vertical resizes of image and table
column to 100% have been excluded from standard html, so if this is simply an
unsupported function then that's ok...

If I can be of more help then let me know...
