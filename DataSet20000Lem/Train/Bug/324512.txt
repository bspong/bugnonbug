As stated on http://wiki.mozilla.org/Link_Targeting#Moving_Focus_after_Closing_Tabs, the new heuristic wa introduced because:
"users frequently open tab to accomplish some intermediate step in their task (ie: read a definition) and once the tab is closed they wish to be returned to the previously selected tab to continue with their main task."

When user open a bookmark, a history item, or type in a new address or search it's more likely that his intention wa not to accomplish some intermediate step but to abandon the current tab. It unintuitive and I find it confusing. Therefore, I think that the above rationale doesn't apply in this case and we should focus tab the old way.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a few tab opened.
2. Select any but the rightmost tab.
3. Middle-click a bookmark to open it in a new tab with focus.
4. Close the new tab.

Actual Results:
previously selected tab is focused.


Expected Results:
rightmost tab is focused (standard behavior).
