Telemetry data from Search bar is not properly collected when searching in new tab from context menu
[Affected versions]:
Nightly 51 Build ID 20160831030224

[Affected platforms]:
Ubuntu 15.04 x64, Windows 10 x64, Mac OS X 10.10

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open Firefox with a new profile.
2. Type something in Search bar.
3. Right click on a one-off search engine (e.g Yahoo) and choose "Search in new tab".
4. Open about:telemetry page, and under "Simple Measurements" inspect the UITelemetry property.

[Expected result]:
Telemetry data should show the name on the search engine used for the search.
For example: "search-oneoff":{"yahoo.oneoff-context-searchbar":{"unknown":{"tab-background":1}}

[Actual result]:
Telemetry data doe not show the name of the engine used for the search. It show "other" indeed.
Example: {"other.oneoff-context-searchbar":{"unknown":{"tab-background":1}}

[Notes]:
- Telemetry for searching in the current tab by mouse or key work a expected
- In Awesomebar the name of the engine is shown even for context menu search
- If I add a new search engine (e.g. Booking.com) it show the same {"other.oneoff-context-searchbar":{"unknown":{"tab-background":1}} while in Awesomebar it is "other-Booking.com".
