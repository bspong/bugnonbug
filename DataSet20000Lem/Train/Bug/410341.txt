Firefox will not stay default browser

Firefox is one of the only program I have on my computer next to VLC and Shrook. For some reason after a restart my default apps change from Firefox, Shrook, and VLC; to Safari, and Quicktime.

I wa wondering if this is a common occurrence? I have contact Apple many times, formatted and reinstalled Leopard since this problem and still cannot understand why.

Any help would be great.
