X need to also check the "Buffer" - needed so that pasting work better.

I've been developing Clipboard.pm (http://search.cpan.org/~king), and in doing
so, I've gotten to the root of a bug that ha pestered me for years:

Sometimes you can't paste into Firefox (middle click doe nothing), but you can
paste into other X program (e.g., xterm).

As anyone familiar with xlib/nsClipboard.cpp will know, X ha a funky
"clipboard" concept. There are primary, secondary, and clipboard selections.
Then there's this other thing, the Buffer. I don't know why it's a separate
concept, but it is. Any one of those selection could be the one the user
wish to paste from.*

I whittled down xclip's source to a ~25 line program that dump the content of
the Buffer. It just boil down to a call to XFetchBuffer(), which doesn't need
much more than a Display.

As for where to add the call, I'm not quite sure. Through experimentation, my
opinion is that the canonical order of importance is: primary, buffer,
clipboard, secondary. Really, this is up to implementor's preference - a long
a the Buffer get checked at some point, I'll be thrilled. Maybe play with the
xclip loop* and see if you can figure out your preference.

* If you're interested in observing these behaviors, try installing xclip and
running the following while you play around:
watch -n1 'for n in primary secondary clipboard buffer; do echo == $n ==; xclip
-o -selection $n; echo; done'

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an xterm
2. Highlight something
3. Paste into Firefox.

Ha! It works. I tricked you.

Now try:
4. Doing something in the xterm that cause the selection to go away - move the
cursor, single click somewhere, etc.
5. Paste to Firefox.

A practical example: from mutt, highlight a URL, delete the message, and then
don't expect to paste it into Firefox. (Current workaround: paste into xterm,
re-highlight, come back to Firefox)
