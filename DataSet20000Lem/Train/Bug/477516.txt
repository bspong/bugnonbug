Problem discussed in the following Google Support Forum thread:

http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Docs/thread?tid=3ce814c149fbb05c&hl=en&fid=3ce814c149fbb05c0004626e76cafe66

Although I referenced the URL of a test page set up by another user in the thread, I also reproduced the problem with my own embedded Google Gadgets:

http://www.stanford.edu/~mcmurdie/Car.html


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to either of the URL mentioned in Details using Firefox
2. Embedded Google Gadgets on these site will not load, though box will appear.
3. Try a non-Firefox browser at same URL (e.g. Camino, Opera, Safari). They do load fine.
Actual Results:
The Gadget box with Firefox is the appropriate size, but no gadget is displayed at all, just an infinitely spinning "loading" wheel.

Expected Results:
Load the embedded Gadget. It should look pretty much the same a the gadget usually do, and how they do in other browsers.
