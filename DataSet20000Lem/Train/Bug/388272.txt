Using mapquest.com to produce direction between two point resulted in the text for the directions. On scrolling down, there wa no map IMAGE only the red line between the two point like a snake. The scroll bar for zooming in and out showed text of the word "scroll" multiple time superimposed on itself but no bar. In the directions, clicking on the word "map" to the right of the text produced a white empty box with a little icon image.
Google map work, and Mapquest work fine in Sarari, just not on my Firefox version 2.0.0.4.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.http://www.mapquest.com for starting and ending direction
2.Case Western University, Cleveland, OH to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI
3.
Actual Results:
It took a long time to process, i.e. longer than usual using other browsers.
Resulted in text and a large white box where the map image should have been. Clicking on the "map" to the right of any portion of the text step resulted in the same white box. Zoom bar for scrolling in and out produced multiple text representation superimposed on each other but not image of a zoom bar.

Expected Results:
Mapquest should produce image of maps!
