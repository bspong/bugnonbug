Tabs in Inspector's sidebar should not deform when I close DevTools.webm

STR: (Win7, Nightly 43.0a1 (2015-08-15))
1. Open new tab
2. Open devtools, open successively all devtools tabs, record a profile (~5% buffer) in Performance tab (so that devtools were "heavy". That's necessary to see the result. Also, it's good if you run Nightly in not-multiprocess mode)
3. Switch to Inspector tab, make sure that sidebar is opened
4. Click close button in devtools

Result: For ~0.5 second I see that tab in sidebar gain greater height, then devtools collapse
Expectations: Tabs should remain their height.

I think that this line is responsible for this.

While I don't know why we need to "move back the tab a a first child of the tabbox" (because it's already 1st child of the tabbox), I still think that line should be corrected
>- this._tabbox.insertBefore(tabs, this._tabbox.tabpanels);
>+ this._tabbox.insertBefore(this._tabbox.tabpanels, tabs);
