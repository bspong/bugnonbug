After deleting the Smart Bookmarks folder which contains a list of item such a Most visited places, etc, there doe not seem to be a way to recreate that folder of lists.

I would suggest that by choosing "New Bookmark" would allow you to choose a type of list that you want to create (i.e., most visited places, etc., and then further define that list with # of item you want it to maintain in that list).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to organize bookmark
2. Open the bookmark toolbar folder
3. Delete the folder called Smart Bookmarks that come with Firefox 3.0b5.
4. Look around for about 3 minute to find out how to recreate them since you decided you want them back!
Actual Results:
I couldn't find a way to recreate them after they were deleted.

Expected Results:
I should have been able to easily find a way to recreate them and customize them within a few minute of trying.

I would suggest that by choosing "New Bookmark" would allow you to choose a type of list that you want to create (i.e., most visited places, etc., and then further define that list with # of item you want it to maintain in that list).
