Multilanguage handling problem (incl. location bar, application title, search etc.)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: firefox version 1.02

1) usually, when you type the first several character of a site you visited
before, the autocomplete list show up and you can press "DOWN" button to
select. However, if the first url in autocomplete list ha a non-english title
(in my case, the title start with a Chinese character), the "DOWN" button no
longer works.

2) When you have several tab opened, and some have english title and some have
nonenglish titles, when you try to make switch between them by clicking the tab,
the APPLICATION's title may not change to the title of activiated tab. This may
not happen everytime but 90% chance i think.

3) Search function totally screw up when mutli tab are opened. I find it may
relates to the 2nd bugs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tab with differnet language (in my case, English/Chinese, make
sure the webtitle is start with English/Chinese)
2. Switch tab by clicking tab
3. Application title bug/Search among DIFFERENT page REPEATLY/autocomplete failed

Actual Results:
Application title bug/
Search among DIFFERENT page REPEATLY/totally screw up
autocomplete failed/down button doesnt work
