EUDC.TTE (End User Defined Character) cannot display correctly in FireFox 3.0/ 3.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

FireFox 3.0 or 3.0.1 cannot display "eudc.tte" (End User Defined Character) which is Big5 character, but I.E 6/7, FireFox 1.5 and 2.X can display it correctly.

Even I have tried to set different locale BIG-5, BIG-5-HKSCS, EUC-TW, Firefox 3 still cannot display correct character. It should not be Windows XP locale setting problem since I have used the same setting for I.E6/7, Firefox 1.5 and 2.X, and these browser can display the character correctly under BIG-5/BIG-5-HKSCS.

Reproducible: Always
