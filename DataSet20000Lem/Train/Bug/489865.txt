Submitting form with many, many field hang for a long time before completing

When clicking on the SUBMIT button of a form that contains a couple thousand INPUT fields, the entire browser "hangs" for a long time while uploading the data. This make for an ugly user experience, and ought to be better threaded.

Specifically, at MyDomain.com I manage several Internet domains, including hundred of Email accounts/aliases. In this particular case, I currently have 646 item in the FORM, and each row contains 4 INPUT field (2584 fields), plus a number of additional field outside the table, for a total of 2875 fields.

(for your examination, a copy of the exact form is stored in www.tgi.org/p/firefox_submit_bug.zip)

I saw Bug #345250, but that's not the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with a FORM that ha multiple hundred of INPUT field containing smallish amount of data.
2. Click the SUBMIT button for the FORM.
Actual Results:
The browser "hangs" for the entire duration of the data upload to complete the SUBMIT operation. When the upload completes, the browser resume normal behavior.

Expected Results:
This ought to be politely threaded. The original Mozilla/Netscape browser did not experience this symptom. This is new behavior since I switched from Netscape to Firefox.

The affected tab/window ought to still be responsive (and not cause Windows Vista to pop up the "this program is not receiving input" dialog box, asking if you want to kill it), and the user ought to be able to continue to use the other tabs/windows of the browser.
