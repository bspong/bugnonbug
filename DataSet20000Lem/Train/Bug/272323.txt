If someone can find a way to create a bookmark on someone computer with a
certain keyword, for example, http://www.fakebankingsite.com with the keyword
'https://easyweb.tdcanada.com', they could potentially trick the user into
thinking they are logging into their online banking, when they're in face
entering their info into a spoofed banking site, in this example.

Granted it's not the easiest feat, but still very possible on college computers,
for example.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark a website.
2. Make the keyword for that bookmark something like 'https://easyweb.tdcanada.com'.
3. Type the url from step 2 into the address bar.
Actual Results:
When trying to access the easyweb online banking site, you'll instead be sent to
the bookmarked page website. Which, if the website is cloned correctly, could
be used to trick people into providing all sort of information, in my example,
online banking details.

Expected Results:
I'd expect kaywords to be limited to a word or simple phrase, and not allow
thing like a secure URL or any other URL to be entered (eg. http://, https://,
ftp://...)

It should only allow keywords like 'banking' or the like.
