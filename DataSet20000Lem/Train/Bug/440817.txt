After unchecking all checkboxes under 'Advanced Javascript Settings' on first using the browser, they are now 'stuck' unchecked. On checking any or all box and clicking OK to return to the Options dialog, if 'Advanced' is clicked again, then the box will still be checked. However, if you check the box then click OK on the Settings dialog then OK on the Options dialog, to go back to the browser, then the Advanced Javascript function will continue to be disabled (will not work) and when Options is reopened the box will all be unchecked again. It is not just the checkboxes being unchecked, all the function are actually disabled and cannot be re-enabled.
