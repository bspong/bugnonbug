Framed page point to wrong "relative" URL; the frame point to the relative URL of Frameset, not of the framed page

[Parent] The frame set is: http://www.safroford.com/BuildCarFord.html
[Child] The top frame is: http://www.safroford.com/BuildCarHeader.html
[Child] The bottom frame is:
http://www.autobuybids.com/BYCNYP_Flash.asp?de_id=258&make=Ford

[Child] The bottom frame contains a link in a Flash movie with a relative URL
to: ABM_BuildIt.asp?AD=1577680&de_id=258&make=Ford

It should take you to:
http://www.autobuybids.com/ABM_BuildIt.asp?AD=1577680&de_id=258&make=Ford

But it take you to:
http://www.safroford.com/ABM_BuildIt.asp?AD=1577680&de_id=258&make=Ford

Which is a broken URL, because the link loses the correct relative path
(http://www.autobuybids.com) for the [Parent] FrameSet's path
(http://www.safroford.com).

I've seen others have reported this bug; however, there detail wa not very
good. This is reproducable, and should be a great example for resolving this
frameset issue.


Reproducible: Always

Go to IE and repeat step for correct outcome.

I've rated this major a this effect people accessing email and other
application that rely on frame in order to perform daily activities.
