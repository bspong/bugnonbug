I have Firefox configured to "ask me every time" for site cookies, but I also have the checkbox on the cookie popup checked (I checked it once way back when and when it come up now it's already checked).

However, sometimes I get ton of cookie accept popups (one at a time) for a site. I originally thought it might be a problem with lot of cooky from the same site, however, looking at the detail for the URL above, it's actually asking me multiple time about the same cookie. For instance, after answering "Allow for session" 38 time in a row for this url, I only end up with 5 saved cookies. All of the one I got a popup for seemed to be for the RMID cookie (and with the same content).

I've tried other option (Allow a well a Deny) and it seam to have no effect. I've also tried manually unchecking and then rechecking the 'remember' box, all to no avail.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure Firefox to "ask every time" for cookies.
2. Go to a URL, such a that referenced above. (Make sure you clear out any existing exception and cooky from the site first, a it won't repro otherwise.)
3. Despair.
Actual Results:
38 popups asking me to accept the same cookie.

Expected Results:
1 popup asking me to accept 1 cookie
