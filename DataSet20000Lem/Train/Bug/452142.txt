text overflow in preference window after changing menupopup font size

I edited my userChrome.css file to have these lines:

@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");
/* set default namespace to XUL */

menupopup {
font-size: 16pt; /* with or without !important */
}

When I restarted Firefox, I found that the main pane of the preference window had botched formatting. Specifically, some of the button label and textbox content were no longer visible.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit "chrome/userChrome.css" in a Firefox profile to include only

@namespace url("http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul");
/* set default namespace to XUL */

menupopup {
font-size: 16pt; /* with or without !important */
}

2. Restart Firefox.

3. Bring up the Preferences window, Main pane.


Actual Results:
The button label and textbox content do not fit inside the window; they are truncated on the right-hand side.

Expected Results:
I would expect that the window would expand a much a needed to include all components.

None.
