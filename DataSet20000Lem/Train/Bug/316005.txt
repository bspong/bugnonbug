Hi,

I have plenty RSS newsfeeds in my bookmarks, which cause some trouble:

- They are continuously updated even if unused. This waste bandwidth and fill
logs. I sometimes use the Internet over mobile/GPRS, and then it cause real
costs.

- Even when I am in a foreign network (visiting a customer with my notebook),
the RSS feed are fetched and can trigger intrusion detection alerts.

- Firefox pretty often hang with full CPU load for some seconds. I suspect that
this is somehow related with RSS fetches.

- RSS can break SSL certificate selection (see Bug 315589)


So my proposal is:

Allow to turn off automatic RSS fetching. E.g. give a configuration option which allows to choose a mode where no RSS feed is ever fetched before the bookmark is accessed for the first time after firefox startup. Another method would be to never automatically update a RSS bookmark, only if it is accessed and outdated.
