Apologies if this is a dup, I thought I reported this once but it's not in my
list of reported bugs, and in any case, it's becoming a more serious problem: I
typically have several Firefox window open, switching back and forth,
minimizing the one I'm not actively using. One is usually a wiki page I use a
a mini-blog to log what I'm doing. Frequently, I'll switch to a window, and the
text field are completely inactive (attempting to type in them doe nothing),
including the location bar. I only have to close the window and open a new one,
rather than restarting the entire browser, but it's happening frequently enough
to getting really annoying, to the point where I'm about to stop using Firefox.
This is not the same a 259814, a I don't use find that much, and not in the
affected window in any case. It's also not the same a 268359, a while I
often use a bookmark, I don't use desktop shortcuts, and even when started from
a bookmark, the text field work for a while.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page
2. Minimize it
3. Come back to it later and try to enter a new url to go to, or if the page ha
a form on it, try to enter data in the form fields.

Actual Results:
Nothing: the location bar and the form field ignore the typing

Expected Results:
Entered the data I typed into the form field
