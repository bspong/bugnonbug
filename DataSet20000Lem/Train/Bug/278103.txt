When layered above an iframe using CSS positioning, a flash movie is rendered
below the iframe when the page loads.

The example page is organized into four quadrants:

In the upper left quadrant, a flash movie is layered above an iframe.
The lower left quadrant is the same, except that the iframe load no content.
In the upper right quadrant, the flash movie is layered above a div.
In the lower right quadrant, a div is layered above an iframe.

The two right-side quadrant render correctly and are provided for reference.
The simple flash movie in the example inverts it color in response to
mouseover event to provide a bit of behavior.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load (or reload) the example page.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The flash movie is rendered below the iframe in both the left quadrants.

Expected Results:
The flash movie should be rendered above the iframe in both the left quadrants.

Observations (using the upper left quadrant in the example):

1. The flash movie recieves mouse event a though it were on top. It then
render to the top.

2. When a link is selected in the iframe the flash movie is again rendered to
the bottom.

3. Resizing the browser window restores the flash movie to the top.

4. Mousing over the Mozilla icon in the iframe content cause part of the flash
movie to be improperly redrawn.

To help eliminate the Flash player a the culprit, I used Mac OS X, where Safari
and Firefox share the same player. Safari render the example correctly (as
doe Internet Explorer on Win2K and WinXP) and Firefox Mac exhibit nearly the
same rendering behavior a for the Windows platforms. However, the difference
between Firefox Mac and Firefox Windows are noteworthy:

1. The lower left quadrant (no content loaded into iframe) render correctly on
Firefox Mac.

2. In the upper right quadrant (flash movie layered above div) Firefox Mac
seemingly render the flash movie below the div.
