On OS X Firefox sometimes show multiple "pane" dialog which should attach to the top of the Firefox window.

This often result in

- the top dialog not responding because the dialog are modal and another dialog grab the focus
- one of the modal dialog hiding under the Firefox main window leading to Firefox not responding to keyboard event
- used dialog not closing but staying a blank window instead

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open multiple tab that open dialog (ie password prompt or "store cookie" prompt when cookie prompting is on in prefs)
2. set Firefox to "show window and tab from last time"
3. restart Firefox

Actual Results:
Firefox bomb you with "pane" dialog which sometimes lead to issue described above.

Expected Results:
Firefox show one pane, and delay any tab that would require opening another pane. This would have the added benefit that it would display the prompt for the same password or cookie only once and not a many time a there are tabs/iframes that require that password/cookie.
