In Firefox 3 beta 3 on the Mac, when listening for keyup/down/press event on a design-mode edit control, the control key are not firing the correct event sequence. For example, when pressing and releasing CTRL-G, the Mac get this sequence of events:

keyDown for CTRL key
keyUp for "G"
keyUp for CTRL

Notice that there is no keyDown for the G. With FF3 beta 3 on Windows, we get this sequence:

keyDown for CTRL
keyDown for "G"
keyPress
keyUp for "G"
keyUp for CTRL

FF2 on the Mac also produce a similar correct sequence.

I'll attach a page with script which can demonstrate the problem.

One consequence of this: when using gmail or Google Docs, CTRL-B doe not work to bold a word in FF Beta 3 on the Mac. I expect the same consequence for all web apps that want to process control keys.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run attached "key.html"
2. Click in top pane to get focus, and press CTRL-G
3. Look at event log sequence that is reported in lower pane.
Actual Results:
On Mac, with FF3 Beta 3, there is no key-down event for the "G".

Expected Results:
Expect to see a key-down event for the "G"
