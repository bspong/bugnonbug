I have updated to the latest version of Firefox (2.0.0.1) and now when filing through my Bookmarks, Tools, History, etc. I am met with a very slow response to anything I select. For example, when moving my cursor down my Bookmark list, the highlighting of whatever my cursor touch move at a jagged pace. Even by clicking 'Bookmarks' or accessing any of it subsidiary cause considerable lag. I downloaded a previous version of Firefox a a result, and wa not met with this problem (although I lacked all the feature the new version had, of course!). I decided to re-install the new version again after some time and had the same condition a before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update latest version of Firefox.
2. Let it install.
3. Boot up the browser.

I don't think there is any possible way to reproduce the problem a it seems peculiar to my browser or perhaps my install.
Actual Results:
Nothing out of the ordinary until I tried accessing my menus.

Expected Results:
It should have gone a smoothly a before.

I have installed browser theme before the (2.0.0.1) version of Firefox wa available. When this problem occurred, I did change the theme back to default and wa still afflicted. The azureFox theme (0.96) wa the one I had used, until the one I have recently iFox Smooth (2.4.2).
