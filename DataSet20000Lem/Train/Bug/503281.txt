I had only FF running. No other apps or window open.
I accidentaly switchet with ALT+TAB to desktop, back to FF, back to desktop and finally back to FF. But the FF window did not show up anymore.
It is there, with size 0,0 in the upper left corner of the screen.
It responds ok (press alt and then cursor down to see the menu for example).
But the window doe not show up. If you maximize it by right-clicking on the FF icon in the task bar it come up, but if you 'restore' it, it disappears again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all window and application
2. Launch just FF. Open any page. Do not maximize the window.
3. With ALT+TAB, switch to desktop.
4. Release ALT+TAB.
5. Re ALT+TAB to FF.

You have to repeat step 3..5 a few times, depending how fast you do it.
Mostly it take 2 switches, but sometimes 6.
Actual Results:
Hidden FF window.

Expected Results:
Nothing.
