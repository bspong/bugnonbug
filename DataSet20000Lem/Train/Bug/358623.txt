I have been using Firefox on my PC running on WinXP. I have no problem access the above Internet banking site. However, I have tried the previous Firefox 1.5 on my Mac, running on Mac OS 10.4.6 and it crash everything I tried to access the page. I have tried access my Citibank page (https://www.citibank.com.sg/SGGCB/JSO/signon/DisplayCinSignon.do) and the same thing happened. Thus, I would have to fall back to the Safari browser everytime I need to access the above Internet banking sites. I wa delighted when Firefox 2.0 wa launched. However, after installing, the same problem persists. I suspect is the Java applet that both website requires for user logons.
