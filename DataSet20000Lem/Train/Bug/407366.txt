STR:

1. visit www.google.com
2. Context click the search field
3. Select Add a Keyword for this Search...
4. In the resulting Add Bookmark dialog: Give it a unique name "Gookey"
5. Leave the Keyword: field empty
6. Click Add
7. In the location bar, type a search term

Tested results:
As expected, because of the blank keyword, we get a google search result.

Expected result:
Do not allow the keyword search bookmark to be added with an empty keyword field.

dietrich suggested a few thing in irc:
dietrich> tracy: yes. i think at the least we should require a keyword when opening the ui via that context menu item, if only to reduce confusion.
[11:16] <dietrich> we might even want keyword a the only text input in the UI for that also
[11:17] <dietrich> hm, i also think we need some contextual help - normal user probably don't even know wth that is, assuming they ever find that context menu option
[11:17] <tracy> dietrich, how would the keyword search bookmark get named then? by title?
[11:18] <dietrich> tracy: yeah, page title
[11:19] <tracy> dietrcih. so what if the user ha google bookmarked and then also keyworded search bookmark google...they'd both be the same name? I think the user should be able to uniquely name the search at it's creation.
[11:19] <dietrich> tracy: yeah good point. maybe keyword should just be first in the UI then
[11:20] <dietrich> the focus should be on the keyword creation
