Container Tabs 'Learn More' link should be on the same line a the 'Enable Container Tabs' checkbox
Today's Nightly had a severe regression in Preferences. It's very hard to find setting right now, and some setting appear in pane with a description that doesn't have anything to do with them.

1) Search setting are very important, yet lumped into the middle of "General", aside a small part, that ha got nothing to do with Privacy And Security, yet is in the middle of that pane (Location Bar), and ha to link back to the middle of General (which is an indication we don't actually expect people to manage to find the other setting by themselves...)

2) "Reports" is in "Updates" yet obviously ha nothing whatsoever to do with it.

3) Proxy (Connection) setting probably doesn't belong in "Privacy And Security", mainly because it's a setting some people will need to get on the internet at all.

4) "Cached Web Content" is in "Privacy and Security". The link here is weird at best.

5) "Site Data" appears to be entirely broken. Buttons display awkwardly on the right, clicking "Settings" ha no effect.

6) Some display aspect are totally inconsistent. Look at DRM Content v Container Tabs, and note the positioning of "Learn More".

In general lumping everything together in a few huge category also mean that one ha to do a lot of scrolling to find anything now, rather than clicking category and seeing everything at a glance.

I think we at least need a "Search" pane, probably a "Display and Language pane", and something like a "Stored Data" pane. Probably other sane ordering are possible, but anything is better than just lumping everything together.
