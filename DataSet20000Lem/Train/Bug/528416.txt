Download Directory Persists After "Clear Recent History"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox remembers where you last downloaded a file to. The next time you try to download a file, it automatically point to the same directory in windows. This is generally a very useful feature, but there doesn't seem to be a way to clear this data without downloading a file to a different directory.

It would improve browsing privacy if "Clear Recent History" had an option to reset download location to whatever the default directory is.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a file to a local folder.
2. Go to another web page, and download another file--verify that Firefox automatically open the last folder a the default location where the download will take place.
3. Go to Tools->Clear Recent History
4. Download another file, verify that Firefox still point to the same, last-selected directory.


Expected Results:
After Clear Recent History, Firefox should move the directory suggested a a download location to Desktop or a default downloads folder.
