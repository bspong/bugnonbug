My web page have a lot of photo on them, until recently this wa never a problem. I believe that after the last update, this problem ha developed. Almost all my page now have a black background instead of the background image.
Try this, the last page I created:
http://www.stam.org.il/shvil/034.html
I removed 8 image and the page is OK (7 image were not enough)
look at these two page
http://www.stam.org.il/shvil/b.html - here I randomly chose 8 consecutive image somewhere in the middle of the page and deleted them, no other change wa made and the bacground image appears, page ha no problem
http://www.stam.org.il/shvil/c.html - here I just randomly picked 8 image all over the original page and deleted them - again the page ha no problems.

I hope you can fix this
Good hunting!
