with two separate page open for scrolling, if i use the mac key shortcut to
get from one tab to the second (or vice versa), then use the two-finger
scrolling method available on my iBook G4 or my powerbook G4 aluminium, it doe
not scroll the frontmost page, and in fact scroll the page i wa previously on.

if i click in the tab i want, the problem doe not manifest.

if after using a key shortcut, i then click within the window for two finger
scrolling, the problem doe not manifest

(but of course, both of these defeat the purpose and acceleration offered by not
having to move the mouse to a tab or having to click focus in a page to cause it
to scroll.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the same or separate URLs that require scrolling in two separate tab
2. make the focus be in the first tab, and note the position of the scrollbar
3. use Cmd-2 to get to the second tab
4. attempt to 2-finger scroll in that tab

Actual Results:
a] in the frontmost tab, nothing happens
b] if you go back to the tab previously being visited, notice that the scroll
position ha changed

Expected Results:
a] the frontmost tab should scroll
b] the previously visited tab should remain where it wa

i will be glad to beta test patches, a i know that there are not that many
platform on which to test this problem, yet.
