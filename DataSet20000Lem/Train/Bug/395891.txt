When you have several profile and you use the profile manager to manage this profile and to select your start profile at Minefield startup, this prevents the minefield start when you click on link in external program (like Thunderbird) or when you type start -> run www.mozilla.com

A Firefox Process is started in the Windows Process Manager, but the profile manager doe not come up.

This also cause the Problem that when you click on the Minefield icon on your desktop or start menu nothing happens.

You need to end the Firefox Process first and then you can start Minefield again.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create some Firefox/Minefield Profiles
2. Choose on the Profile Manager and uncheck "don`t ask at startup", so that the profile manager come up at every start
3. Start Minefield, make sure it the default browser
4. Quit Minefield and ensure it completely closed
5. Click on www.link in a mail or from start -> run www.mozilla.com
6. nothing happen - minefield doe not come up
7. click on the minefield icon in the start menu or desktop -> nothing happen
8. check the process manager - there is a firefox.exe process running
