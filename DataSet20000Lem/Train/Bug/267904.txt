At the mentioned site (you must accept the cookie) you can click on an item to
see extra detail in a pop-up. Yesterday I clicked (when the pop-up wa open)
left and right very fast, and suddenly the pop-up wa stuck to the mouse
indicator. I tried everything to seperate them, but all of no avail. I could not
select the site at the background, I could not select the URL bar, and I could
not fool the app by moving my mouse over the Windows bar. At last, there wa
nothing to do then just shutdown FireFox and reboot it again. It could be a site
coding error, but I have tried various other browser (like IE) but I could not
remake this problem there.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the site
2. Open a pop-up window
3. Try various fast mouse-clicks (left or right, I can't remember it correctly)

Actual Results:
The pop-up stick to the mouse indicator

Expected Results:
Give a possibility to seperate the mouse indicator and the pop-up window.

I have tried to reproduce this error in IE, but it didn't happen there.

I don't know if this bug is somehow related to bug 252951, but they are not
talking about a pop-up screen.
