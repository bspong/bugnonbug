Firefox 30 causing BCCode 9c with reboot in Windows XP SP3?
User Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; Media Center PC 4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Steps to reproduce:

Started having problem with my Windows XP SP3 computer about 3 month ago. I don't remember if the problem initially started with Firefox browser 27,28,29 install or not. Anyway the problem got so bad with BSOD issue that I had to reformat my hard drive and do a system restore from my 2008 restore disc. After restore I still had issue with error messages. As of right now the system is fairly stable and operates with few problems; with the exception of Firefox 30. I have updated drivers, cleaned registry and startup files. Mostly, my problem are confined to trying to use Firefox 30 browser. Firefox will open but is very unstable and cause the BCCode 9c and reboots the computer. The reboot option is set for errors. Since the problem at this point seem to be confined to Firefox 30 I would like to know if there are issue with Firefox 30 running in Windows XP SP3? I've used Firefox for several year and don't want to give it or my XP machine up anytime soon.


Actual results:

Fire 30 very unstable and crash on my Windows XP SP3 machine.
output BCCode 9c and reboots computer.


Expected results:

No errors.
