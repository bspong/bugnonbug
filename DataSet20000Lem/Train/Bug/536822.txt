I've tried to track this down but it is very inconsistent. I'm hoping someone else will notice this behavior too. I use the bookmark tool bar drop down menu more than the regular Bookmarks menu. Occasionally, when I go to select it via the '>>' symbol, it close Firefox immediately. No prompt or warnings. This happens about four or five time per week. I open and close three to say about five tab in a session repeatedly. In the bookmark toolbar, I have about 100 link with another three folder and one of those folder ha about another 100 links. I'm not sure if that matter b/c it close when I try to open the menu with all the link beyond the six or seven that are already showing.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open/close several tab while surfing the web
2. Use the '>>' to open the drop menu to select your links/bookmarks
3. Occasionally it will close - no prompt or warnings.



Since I'm going from bookmarks, I'm not sure if Firefox remembers where I wa or not. I think it doe and I just restart the session from where it left off and continue.
