flash movie display differently on diffrent computer using same version of firefox and flash player
User-Agent: Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.2; U; en-GB) Presto/2.7.62 Version/11.00
Build Identifier:

The movie on some coputer display brighter then on other.
I thought it wa a color management problem so I included the stage.colorCorrection = ColorCorrection.ON; to my flash movies. (since default is off) The problem remains.
Firefox version: 3,6,19
flash player version: 10.1.102.64
Since the website under development I cant really provide a link for now.
Probably in a week. But here are some screenshoots for you and some other info.
The flash video's background image I set to png losless compression in order to avoid problem that might come from the jpeg compression. The website background is also png. The whole website is created in photoshop cs5. Color Management profile wa set to srgb and I checked it is saved into the png file.
