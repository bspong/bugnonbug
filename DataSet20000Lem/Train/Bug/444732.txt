I use freeware PINs 4.50 to save my username/password. This worked fine on FF2. It ha a system hotkey of CTRL+Y to run a per entry script which typically stuff the keyboard buffer with <username><tab><password><enter> to automate login to site (I know this is still weak for keyloggers).

First problem is that FF3 grab ctrl+Y and I can't change that. Hotkeys should be user configurable. Luckily in PINs they are so I can change that but it mean I have to relearn a key set I've used for age rather than lose redo which I've never used. BTW I tried keyconfig but ctrl+Y is one key set it can't change it would seem.

Second, and major problem, is that this still doesn't work right even with PINs on a different hotkey. My first theory wa that when using say crtl+L when I released the L and PINs stuffed the keyboard buffer then FF3 still saw the ctrl key a down so interpreted the <username><tab><password><enter> oddly. What happens is that the right data appears in the form. FF3 log into the site, but the tab is changed to another one or a closed tab is re-opened. Since ctrl+tab switch tab this looked a likely theory. Having the hotkey a alt+L say wa even worse a alt is the way to access the main menu and the result seem to confirm that.

My work around wa to use hotkey F9. That seems to work, but only some of the time. On a fresh browser the login go ok. But on a browser with multiple tab open FF3 change focus to another tab and reloads it

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get Pins 4.50 (freeware), set it superpaste hotkey to F9.
2. Enter login detail for a site into PINs
3. Open fresh FF3. Open the site in two tab
4. Close first tab and use PINs hotkey to login on second tab
Actual Results:
Login happens on second tab. FF3 reopens closed fist tab and switch focus to it.

Expected Results:
FF3 should not open closed tab nor switch focus.

I also have undo closed tab add-on but I can't find any hotkeys for that so it shouldn't be responding to F9. It may be that this is part of the problem, at least for this. But FF3 key handling is not well behaved. FF3 ha problem with keyboard stuffing program which FF2 didn't and this need to be looked at. Using F9 is a work around for the ctrl/alt problem but it is not ideal. Whatever ha changed on the keyboard handling from FF2 to FF3 ha made the keyboard handling non-standard to how window normally work and it is likely to break other automation programs.
