Filter Button should remain popped up when unchecking a suboption if any of the other suboptions remain checked

Only uncheck filter button if all of it's suboptions get unchecked

The behavior of the filter button when you uncheck a "Warning" or "Error" selection is confusing, the STR:

1. Open up http://harthur.github.com/test-pages/filters.html
2. Open the Web Console
3. Reload the page so you see the error and log message
4. Make sure the "JS" filter button is "On" (all option checked, button depressed)
5. Click the drop-down of the "JS" button
6. Select the "Warnings" option to filter out JS warning

Actual:
the "document.all" warning is no longer shown, and the "JS" button look "off" (popped-up)

Expected:
the "document.all" warning is no longer shown, but the "JS" button still look "on" (depressed).


I'm often turning off just warning in the web console and the filter UI ha confused the living daylight out of me, and I think this is why. When I'm seeing "JS stuff" in the web console, I want the button UI to reflect this.

There's bug 626018 about making a tri-state UI for the filter button (all on, some on, none on), but in the meantime I think we could do this. Here's a patch if you want to play around, let me know what you think of this idea.
