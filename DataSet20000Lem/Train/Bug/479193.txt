Firefox generates continuous Operating System page fault when only this page is loaded: http://www.deccanherald.com.
I could see within 20 minute of keeping this page open, the page fault which appear in the Windows Task manager against Firefox wa around 208,000.

Also the "IO Writes Bytes" for the above 20 minute wa at 138,700,000 bytes.
This seems too abnormal and high.

The Windows machine is a Windows XP on a IBM Lenovo Core2Duo system, 1 GB RAM, 60 GB HDD. Processes running at this time were 65, CPU USAGE wa 5%, commit charge wa 1024M/2441M.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up Windows Task manager, in View->Select Columns, select "Page Faults", "I/O Write Bytes" parameters.
2. Bring up Firefox 3.1a2 (installed on 18-Jan-2009)
3. Visit the URL http://www.deccanherald.com
4. Locate the Firefox.exe in Windows task manager and Observe the Page Fault and I/O Write byte parameters.

Actual Results:
The page fault and I/O write byte parameter keep increasing.
I could see within 20 minute of keeping this page open, the page fault which appear in the Windows Task manager against Firefox wa around 208,000.


Expected Results:
1. The page fault should not keep on increasing.
2. Page fault should be fairly small number for the time the Firefox is open
3. The I/O write byte should be fairly small number. The Outlook which ha been kept open for 3 hour ha only 11 MB I/O write, where a Firefox within 20 minute wa highest and registered 138 MB.
