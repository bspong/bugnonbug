Extension update prevents firefox from starting at a designated webpage
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

From email or pdf or some other external source, and without FF running, click a link. The expected behaviour is that FF will start and open at the desired webpage, instead of homepage or any Mozilla page. This usually happens.

But if startup find an update to an extension, then after updating, the restart of FF will fail to go to the desired page, instead loading two windows: the homepage and the Mozilla "successful update" page. FF should not open the homepage, but should open the intended link instead.

I believe FF should use the Restore Session memory to be able to get to this desired page; it doe not seem to do this at the present time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup FF to be forced to upgrade an etension by downgrading one (or some similar action.)
2. Quit FF
3. From an email or pdf, click a link to be taken to an external website that's not already your homepage or a Mozilla page.
4. When FF start and asks if you want to update the extension, say yes. When it asks to restart, say yes.
5. Result: the page you desired doe not appear
Actual Results:
Users webpage in one window and Mozilla successful update page in another window

Expected Results:
Mozilla successful update in one TAB and user's desired webpage in another TAB.
