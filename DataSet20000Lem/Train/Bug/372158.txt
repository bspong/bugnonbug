On this page, there's a left frame with link that should be clickable, but most of them just don't work (except for garbling the left side menu). I've seen similar problem on other web sites, and the common factor is that they have been created using Microsoft FrontPage 5.0.

I've checked this specific site with Firefox 1.5.0.10 and Firefox 2.0.0.2 on Linux and SeaMonkey 1.1.0 on Windows 2000 (different computers), with all the same results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the specified page
2. Try to click on the link in the left frame.
3.
Actual Results:
The left menu get garbled in a seemingly random fashion.

Expected Results:
The page linked to appears in the center-right frame.

Also, please look out for JavaScript-controlled <select> menu on page created by FrontPage 5.0. They don't work, either.

I'm unsure if it's a bug in Gecko, or if it's (only) a bug in FrontPage, but the page (of course) "work with IE (ONLY!!!)". At first sight, it look like M$ ha once again found a loophole to screw non-IE users...

Setting to "Major" because some pages, eg. the one listed above, are important to some people's daily work. =8-((
