If you make autoconfig script for locking preference and setting default setting default homepage doesn't work

defaultPref("browser.startup.homepage", "http://any.page.here/");

You instead end up with empty page. Not even about:blank, just empty page. Looking at about:config show that there is correct default homepage set, but in UI if you press button "Restore to Default" nothing happens. Also, that UI doe show blank space where you should see your homepage. Pressing homepage toolbar icon start up google firefox something page, and not that default page.

Any other default setting seems to work. I think. Locking prefs doe work for sure.

This is probably duplicate of bug Bug 272970, but this is for Firefox and for current version (this same happens in 3.5.X), and that bug ha status "RESOLVED INCOMPLETE" and I seem to be unable to reopen it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make up autoconfig script
2. set default homepage using defaultpref in that script
3. start new user with no homepage set yet
Actual Results:
blank page.

Expected Results:
set homepage should be what you have set in autoconfig script

This applies at least Firefox 3.0.X and 3.5.X series, and probably also 3.6 and 3.7 (based on the fact that there is no bug here about this with RESOLVED -status).
