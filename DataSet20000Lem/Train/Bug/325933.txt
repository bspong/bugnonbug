It doe it in the middle of composing emails. It doe it when loading tabbed pages, it decides to be slow to open unless I click 2x's on tab or links, I'm constantly getting the we're sorry for the inconveinence but we must close -then and this I'm sure isn't your fault (lol) but the proxy server? isn't right so the new send feature for problem doesn't work to report them to you. Can you help a I do love the system, I just can't have it closing up on me all the time.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open up link on web page
2.try composing an email-could be that it timed out but I don't think so it happens alot.
3.

Actual Results:
get a "I could report it from microsoft" but it stop and close the browser.

Expected Results:
not everytime but sometimes I have 4 tab open and sometimes I've got 10 tab open it just seems to let me know when it's going to close me down. I use Yahoo messenger and sometimes I can't open up the browser from the email icon at the bottom of messenger.

processed the link or opened the file or stayed connected...i suppose.
