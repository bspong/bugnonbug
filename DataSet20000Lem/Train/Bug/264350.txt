MacOSX.

Here's the IRC discussion about it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the url above
2.sign in with u: god p: password
3.see the page reload with no new data

Actual Results:
Basically the form isn't submitted from what I can tell..

Expected Results:
In all other browser you can just log in and administer the site.

It doesn't crash, but it doesn't work either.. Kinda hard to promote this
otherwise great browser if you can't get it to work in the main product that we
produce..

If there's anything we need to do to adjust the code on the CMS we can do that
easily.. Just don't have any sense on where to begin.

There are these two javascript errors.. But it work everwhere else..


Hmm.. Looks like it wa a the javascript bug then some other warning should be
produced.. or something..

I'll look into introducing
