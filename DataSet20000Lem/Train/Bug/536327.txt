Apple's doc say of NSHumanReadableCopyright

NSHumanReadableCopyright (String). This key contains a string with the copyright notice for the bundle; for example, © 2008, My Company. You can load this string and display it in an About dialog box. This key can be localized by including it in your InfoPlist.strings files. This key replaces the obsolete CFBundleGetInfoString key.

which may be true in the limited worldview of someone only looking at About dialogs, if in fact CFBundleGetInfoString wa at one time automatically added to default About dialogs, and if by "can load" they meant "will be loaded, or you can load it yourself if you have a custom Cocoa About dialog." NSHumanReadableCopyright is apparently automatically used in About dialogs, since Camino's string get used without them calling it, but it is not at all the case that it replaces CFBundleGetInfoString for Get Info.

We have an NSHumanReadableCopyright in three places: in Firefox, where the CFBundleGetInfoString is what's used by Get Info and where there's no Cocoa About dialog, so the NSHumanReadableCopyright is never seen; in crashreporter.app, which ha no About dialog at all, ha no CFBundleGetInfoString, and thus show nothing in the way of version or copyright info in Get Info; and in updater.app, which also ha no About dialog, no CFBundleGetInfoString, and no info in Get Info.

I've now changed those to - 2007, - 2008, - 2009, and - 2010, and I think I changed the Firefox on at least once when it wa UTF-16, before it moved to a UTF-8 .in, and through all those change absolutely nobody ever once saw the strings. Time to stop.
