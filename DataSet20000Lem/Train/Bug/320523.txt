There seems to be a reflow bug of some kind affecting the Yahoo UK site: sometimes, but not always, text is rendered a line or two too high in some part of the page. This is most noticeable in the news headline box on the RHS.

Resizing the page text with ctrl+ and/or ctrl- cause the problem to go away, which is why I think it's a reflow thing.

Strangely, reloading the page doesn't make the problem reappear - but when forcing a reload without reading from cache, the problem appears for a moment but fix itself by the time the page load is complete. I'll try to get a screen capture....

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load http://uk.yahoo.com. Observe the rendering error.

2. increase text size with keyboard shortcut to force reflow.
3. Undo step #2 by reducing font size again.

Actual Results:
Page render incorrectly, a described above, till reflow is triggered.

Expected Results:
render properly a page loads.
