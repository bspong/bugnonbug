Hi,

I used IE with no problem, but experience the following problem after switching my ATT&T Yahoo home page to Firefox.

Upon starting up my computer, it open the AIM page using Firefox. I X that page off, then click on my Firefox icon. About half the time, it give me a popup saying that Firefox is already open. (??) After I X that off, I click on the Firefox icon again, and the ATT&T Yahoo Home Page opens, but asks me to sign in for mail. I always choose the box to keep me signed in, but it always ha me sign in ea. and every time.

I contacted an online Firefox tech volunteer who spent a lot of time with me, and hoped she had fixed the problem, but it remains.

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I Turn on computer fresh.
2. I "X" off the AIM web site page, that us Firefox.
3. I click on the Firefox icon.
4. About 1/2 the time I get a popup saying that Firefox is already open. (??)
5. I "X" that off, and click on the Firefox icon again. (Once I had to remove the popup twice.)
6. I then get the ATT&T Yahoo Home Page, but to get MY page, I have to sign in.
7. I ALways have to sign in, despite always checking the box to keep me signed in.
Actual Results:
I always have to sign in, and about half the time have to X off the popup saying that Firefox is already open.

Expected Results:
No popup that indicates an untruth, and checking the box to keep me signed in should hopefully work.

Aside from using your online chat for this problem, I tried the ATT&T help desk, but they were no help, only saying that it wa designed to use IE, which doe not give me this problem.
