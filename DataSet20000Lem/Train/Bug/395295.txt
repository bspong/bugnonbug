Consider reworking Larry's warning dialog text.

For instance, I wa confused why having Identity Verified wa better than having Location Verified. (EV > SSL). And I am also confused a to why we use Identity Unknown rather than Location Unknown for a site with no credentials.

I've been using the web a fairly long time, but I never really understood SSL. I always thought the main reason for it wa to have an encrypted link between me and the website I wa using, but I have since been educated that it's more to do with ensuring the site you visited is the site you ended up on (which, i guess, is why Larry tell me "Location Verified" and then mention the encryption almost a an afterthought).

So a a self-centered benchmark, if this confuses me, I'm not sure how useful it will be to Joe Q Public. Unfortunately I can't think of any way to make this clearer without making it more wordy.

My initial thought are to have two line describing the site instead of one:
- Location: Verified / Not Verified
- Identity: Verified / Not Verified

For for a normal site, you'd just use Location: Not Verified (maybe also Identity: Not Verified)
For SSL, Location:Verified, Identity:Not Verified
and for EV, Location:Verified, Identity:Verified.

Maybe we should use more word to help people more:
- Location: Verified (We have verified this web address a the one you intended to visit (you have not been secretly redirected to a suspicious web address))
- Location: Unverified (We are unable to guarantee that the web address you wanted to visit is the one you have arrived at. (This is not normally a problem unless you are conducting a business transaction with this web address))

- Identity: Verified (We have verified that this website is owned and run by <company>, <address>, <etc>)
- Identity: Unverified (We are unable to verify the company who run this web address)

But also, 'Location' doesn't feel like something I can relate to in the web-o-sphere. So maybe instead of Location, perhaps we should use Web Server, or Web Address, or something? Maybe instead of Identity we should use Owner or Company or something?
