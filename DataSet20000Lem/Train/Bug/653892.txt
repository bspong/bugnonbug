It seems a if both the main firefox application, and the plugin-container - are memory and CPU hogging!

I think this started on 4.00 (I'm not sure) - but now it came to a point YouTube video (480) slack behind (freeze, followed be skipped frames).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.engadget.com/2011/04/28/samsung-galaxy-s-ii-review/
2. Play with the article for a while, like a normal user would .
That is, play the movie (some in HD, some not), view the pic gallery...
3. Leave the above tab open, because you want to mail it to a friend later.
4. Visit YouTube, view an hour video.
Specifically, I just played 3 ten-minutes video (480).
I then tried playing another episode (3x10 @ 480) - noticeable frame skip.
To the point, it becomes annoying and unusable

Actual Results:
Memory leak like water from a sieve.
Put together - with 6 open tab - firefox+plugin-container take up more than 2GB of RAM with an additional of 15-20% processing power (on an i5 quad-core machine).

Expected Results:
Released a gig or so of RAM from the plugin container + some half a gig from the main firefox application.
And most of all - stop hoggin CPU (no movie is actually playing now...)

I have a monster of a machine.
