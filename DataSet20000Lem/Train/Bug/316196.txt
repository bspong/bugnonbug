Firefox spontaneously uninstalls itself after working perfectly for 3 day or so. Version 1.0.7 on Mac OS 10.0.3 I wake up the machine, the Fox icon ha a question mark over it, will not launch. 24 hour later the icon is gone.
I've thrown it away and downloaded a fresh one three times- exact same problem every time. Big drag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Firefox, surf on it, be happy.
2.Wait three day or so.
3.Wake up machine to find question mark over icon in Dock and no Firefox. Spotlight find empty shell of folders, but the app is just GONE.

Actual Results:
No Firefox at all- big drag a I really like it

Expected Results:
It will disapear after a few day unless I get a fix. My brother's Mac still run OS 10.4.0 and he saya there's no problem so far.

It should be on my hard drive waiting for me to surf it. How can it just uninstall itself? This machine is a whole week old today.
My brother's machine ha 10.2 and ha no trouble.
No theme or gizmos; I hadn't gotten that far. I'm a Mozilla newbie.
