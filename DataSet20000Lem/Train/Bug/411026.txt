I'm in the UK, so when I enter http://www.youtube.com/ I get redirected to http://uk.youtube.com ; some time ago (possibly before youtube started doing the redirects?) I got a 500 Internal Server Error from http://www.youtube.com/

Unfortunately my location bar ha remembered this in the title it show you in the pick list of matching URLs. This doesn't get updated when I go to the page again.

After a discussion on #firefox it isn't clear what the right behaviour here should be; what title should you pick up after a redirect?

From my point of view holding the old error title is certainly wrong; and I think from the point of view of user who don't realise there is a redirect in there, they won't understand why the behaviour is any different.

Redirects seem especially common for international site for large company who use local servers.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a website that us a redirect, go to it when it is broken and give you an error from the top level site.
2. Go back when it is working
3. See error still in location bar
