The attached bookmarks.html (renamed) file cause Firefox to hang itself on startup, even in Safe Mode! It just us near 100% CPU, and won't stop until you kill the process.

I can't find anything wrong with the file, and the backup from the day before work fine. Is this a filesize issue?

I tried importing it, same result : Firefox just hang itself trying to import it. Opening it up in a tab work fine oddly enough.

I wanted to validate it, but it isn't XML or HTML, so I don't know how...suggestions? Otherwise, I could use my nearly-up-to-date version and redo the changes.

I've tried multiple Firefox installations, they all crash on it. If it really is invalid, Firefox should display an error message anyway.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use the attached bookmark file
2.start up Firefox
3.wait several hours, then give up and kill the process.

Actual Results:
Firefox window get stuck while loading the startup page, and becomes totally unresponsive. A full day later nothing ha changed :)

Expected Results:
Firefox load and works, displaying the bookmark and doing everything else it normally does.

Can't get it to use talkback, perhaps the window log file contain interesting data for you?
