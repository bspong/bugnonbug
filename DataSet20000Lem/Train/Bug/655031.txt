Firefox can be used a Keylogger to Steal your password by easily modifying omni.jar file!!
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

it is possible to force Firefox to always auto save password without showing the notification bar by extracting the omni.jar file & editing the nsLoginManagerPrompter.js. This can be abused especially in cybercafe because the user’s password will be auto saved without even asking the user in the first place. Seems to act like a keylogger isn’t it?
