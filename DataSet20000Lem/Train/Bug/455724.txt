Descriptive tooltips for browser UI
One of the most common issue we see in support are people who are unfamiliar with the UI of new feature like the unified back/forward button, the add bookmark dialog and the location bar.

One way we can address this simply is to have a second tooltip that explains how to use a feature on mouseover if you hold it there for a second longer.

Eg: hover over the location bar, you get the URL a you do now, wait an extra 2 seconds, get the following tooltip: Smart Location Bar, type URLs to webpage here or start typing to instantly search your browsing history and bookmarks.

The same extended description for other aspect of the UI: Eg: The "bookmark menu" folder in all dialog should tooltip to: "Holds bookmark and folder listed when you click Bookmarks in your menu bar", even thing like the [+] should tooltip to "expand this folder" (You'd be surprised how many people are confused by this since there's now an extra layer of folders). The favicon could have the following tooltip: "Favicon, drag to a bookmark folder or toolbar to bookmark this page, click to see security information for this page"

I'd even like it for menu item to explain thing like "add-ons".

A side benefit is that people will learn the name of the various aspect of the browser UI so if the DO search for help, they'll have something to search on.

(Of course, it'd be nice if this feature could be disabled but I think it's unobtrusive enough to not need it.)

Alternately, have a [help] button like they have in Microsoft office which turn your cursor to a questionmark cursor and you click on an aspect of the UI to get a help article. I don't like this option a much a it's not a discoverable but it may be easier on localizers since the string are all stored on the KB.
