Individual search engine are no longer remembered for multiple Search Bars

In Firefox 1.0.7 it used to be possible to add multiple search field to the toolbars just by adding several <searchbar/> element to the toolbars. Because the <searchbar/> element us XUL bindings, it wa not necessary to write any further plumbing code to get the search field to work.

Also, it wa able to remember the individual search engine for each search field because the engine information wa saved in a "currentEngine" attribute on the <searchbar/> element. This attribute wa then persisted in the XUL localstore.

In Firefox 1.5, the searchbar code wa changed and the "currentEngine" attribute no longer works.

From the change inside "chrome://browser/content/search.xml", I think the change were accidental.

LOCATION OF PROBLEM:
In Firefox 1.0.7, the initialize() method (inside "search.xml") first check to see if an existing "currentEngine" attribute is set, before resorting to the search engine specified in the user preferences.:

var engine = this.currentEngine;
if (!engine)
this.currentEngine = this.getDefaultEngine();

In Firefox 1.5, the _initialize() method get the search engine from the preferences, then assigns it a an attribute on the searchbar element:

var selectedEngineName =
this.prefService
.getComplexValue("browser.search.selectedEngine",
this.nsIPrefLocalizedString).data;

this.currentEngineName = selectedEngineName;

if (!this.currentEngine)
this.currentEngine = this.getDefaultEngine();


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Since Firefox only ship with one search bar, you will need to fake another search bar. Put the following in your "userChrome.css" file.:

#cut-button {
-moz-binding: url("chrome://browser/content/search.xml#searchbar");
list-style-image: inherit !important;
-moz-image-region: auto !important;
}

What it doe is it hijack the "Cut" button and convert it into a search bar.

2. Go into Firefox customize mode and add the second search bar to the toolbars.
3. Set both search bar to different search engine (e.g., 1 Yahoo!, 1 Google).
4. Restart Firefox.
5. Look at toolbar...
Actual Results:
In Firefox 1.0.7 the separate search engine are preserved.
In Firefox 1.5 both are set to the same search engine.

Expected Results:
The separate search engine should be preserved.
