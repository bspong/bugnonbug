When attempting to type in Google search, or URL bar, system freeze if firefox hasn't fully loaded (not fully sure about this one..)

Slow start up on launch in Linux, when attempting to start Firefox the "waiting" cursor doesn't go away until at least 30-50 second after Firefox started, this might be the cause of the system freeze / crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox in Linux (Ubuntu) watch the cursor.
2. Works better in KDE because you can look down at the system bar and you will see (Firefox Loading application)
3. As for the system freeze, when Firefox is done fully loading I haven't had any problems.
Actual Results:
If I waited for Firefox to load no problem a of yet.

Expected Results:
Stop loading after Firefox came up, not sure why it's taking 30 second for the "Waiting" cursor to go away, seems Firefox is doing something in the background.

Only happens in Firefox 3 Beta 3, No problem in beta 2, or Firefox 2. (at least to my knowledge).
Not sure how to reproduce the System crash, other then don't wait for Firefox to load and start browsing site and typing in the Search bar.
