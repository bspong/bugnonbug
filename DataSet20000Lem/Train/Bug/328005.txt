This seems to be an issue that only affect Firefox on MacOSX.

When new window are created on top of non-maximised, full-height windows, the new window are offsetted vertically by about 25 pixels, resulting in the bottom part of the new window being truncated from the screen. Subsequent new window maintain the same vertical offset.

Proposed solution:
For full-height window (and window within say 25 pixel of being full height), set vertical offset for new window to zero. Keep horizontal offset a is.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set the current window to non-maximised full-height
2. file:new window or simply use command-N to create a new window
3. note new window ha the exact dimension of the first window, but is placed about 25 pixel to the right and below the first window
4. create a third window
5. note the vertical offset is zero now, the top of the second and third window are the same.

Actual Results:
The second and subsequent window are placed about 25 pixel too low.

Expected Results:
When the current window is non-maximised full-height, new window should not be placed with vertical offsets.
