Firefox hang while editting page which contain the <embed> tag in googlepages
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

I mainly use firefox when I am creating/editting page via the googlepages editor provided by google. Some of my page are simple html, and others contain java and flash code and embedded sound files. Pages which contain embedded sound file contain this code:
<DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: right"><EMBED style="BORDER-RIGHT: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-TOP: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-BOTTOM: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double" src= "" width=200 height=25 type=audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin controls="ControlPanel" autostart="false"><SPAN lang=ar-kw><BR></SPAN></DIV>

Whenever I attempt to edit or publish such pages, the firefox browser becomes unresponsive. The main interface is responsive, that is, i can use the menus, minize firefox, maximize etc...However, the browser page get stuck and doe not perform the action asked of it. To solve the problem, I have to exit the browser. Then I have to manually end task the instance in memory, and open it anew.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to googlepages.com and create a page
2.In the main text box (center) enter the following html:
<DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: right"><EMBED style="BORDER-RIGHT: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-TOP: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-BOTTOM: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double" src= "" width=200 height=25 type=audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin controls="ControlPanel" autostart="false"><SPAN lang=ar-kw><BR></SPAN></DIV>

3.click on publish or save.

Note: sometimes, you need to enter more than one block of the embed tag. For instance, entering four embed tag normally crash firefox.

Actual Results:
Create an account with gmail. Then, go to googlepages.com and login with that account. Create a new page. Enter the following code in main text space:
<DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: right"><EMBED style="BORDER-RIGHT: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-TOP: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double; BORDER-BOTTOM: rgb(0,51,102) 1px double" src= http://quranlessons.googlepages.com/c1.wma width=200 height=25 type=audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin controls="ControlPanel" autostart="false"><SPAN lang=ar-kw><BR></SPAN></DIV>

You may have to enter more than one block of that code to crash the browse (with me, four block of the embed tag crash the browser) Then click on save. Click on Publish, and then click on "Go back to file manager".

Firefox should crash at this point. Also, if you ever visit that page using firefox, it will either load very slowly or crash.

Expected Results:
The firefox browser got stuck. The main interface still work (thanks to multithreading) but the page got stuck and did not progress any further. I had to exit the firefox browser, and close the instance in the memory (via ctrl-alt-del).

the software should have taken you back to file manager
