This is the first time i've had problem with firefox in the past 3 years. I donno how it all started but for the past 2 day whenever I try to open my browser(forefox), I get the famous (rather irritating)microsoft screen saying that a problem ha occured and the program will close. Technically, it didnt even start. I restarted the machine, uninstalled firefox, reinstalled it, then uninstalled it again and physically removed it folder from my disk and installed it again(clean installation), but it still persists. I downloaded firefox 2.0.0.13 just two minute back and seems like the problem continues. Finally, I started it in safe mode and disabled all the add-ins. It seems to be working fine so far(for the last 10 mins), but it still to be seen what's wrong. The plugins that I used were downthemall, foxytunes and stumbleupon. Not 100% sure but I guess the problem might be in one of these. Will update if see something new.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click firefox icon on desktop
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Microsoft dialog box open with the message "A problem ha occured, the program will close" please tell microsoft blah blah blah....

Expected Results:
Browser should start normally with google a my homepage

I think the problem might be in the plug-in (add-ins or whatever). I have 3 of them installed, stumble upon, foxy tunes, and downthemAll.
