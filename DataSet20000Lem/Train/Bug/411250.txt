There should be a way to get the bookmark ID of an existing bookmark using the Bookmarks service. Something like getBookmarkID(nsiURI uri) or getBookmarkIDs(nsiURI uri) depending on whether it is possible to bookmark the same URI.

The only method that return a bookmark ID is nsINavBookmarksService.insertBookmark, but a bookmark ID is needed by most of the Bookmarks service's methods.

An example of where a method like this would be used: if a developer wanted to display all bookmark with the tag "foxes", she would first need to use the Tagging Service's getURIsForTag which return an array of URIs. Then to get the title of each item she would need to use use the Query System and make a query for each URI to get the item's name.

This is cumbersome and the end result would lead to something like Bug 408345 where user who bookmark a page with a tag like "foxes", then use the Places Library to list all item tagged "foxes" will see that their bookmark name is ignored and instead something like "Search Results", "results.php", or nothing is displayed instead.
