I hate the lack of a 'x' icon to close the last tab (yes, I understand why, but sometimes muscle "think" better than the mind)

I cannot stand anymore the lack of an 'x' icon on the last tab (to close it).

I think I understand why it is not there, but still.

And yes, it doe make sense: if such icon were there, a user that pressed it would cause an empty white page to be displayed, and the cursor to be move at the start of the address bar, exactly a if Firefox had just been started, and there were no configured "home" page that are supposed to be loaded at startup.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. close all tab but one
2. now try to close the last tab, that currently loads, say, "http://www.yahoo.com/"
Actual Results:
I cannot close the last tab: I have to close the whole Firefox window, even though I don't want "http://www.yahoo.com/" anymore, and I now want to browse a single page inside the first tab.

Expected Results:
There should be an 'x' icon on the last open tab, whose semantics is the same a the other 'x' icon on the other tabs, i.e. to destroy the current content of the tab. That's different than pressing the 'x' window icon that close Firefox.

Notice that the new proposed behavior is consistent, because when I click on the 'x' window icon that completely shuts Firefox down, in case I have more than one tab open, it asks me whether I am sure and want to close them all. This show that the 'x' icon and each individual 'x' tab icon are already organized in an intuitive sort of hierarchy, where tab are independently contained inside the Firefox tab, and there is no attempt to make the last tab feel like it is the entire application.
