This site us Java for enhanced web experience. I am using J2SE runtime version 2 build 1.5.0_06-b05. Whenever I try to open this particular page Firefox hang and I can't use windows. Sometimes navigation can be done by keyboard (Ctrl+Tab) but mouse is totally disabled. I have no option but to restart and when I close firefox and try to restart it say "Firefox is already running" . I have to go to task manager and then kill the previous instance then only I can restart. I have tried older build of Java also but this problem persists. This URL is temporary and may not work for more than 5 days, but to reproduce to go www.cricinfo.com and open any link that say "live scoreboard" and problem is producible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.cricinfo.com
2. Find link that say "Live Scoreboard". It may not be there all the day depending upon the schedule of the games.
3. Click the link and firefox hang if Java is installed

Actual Results:
Firefox hang itself.

Expected Results:
Instead of hanging it should've run normally a it doe if Java wa not present
