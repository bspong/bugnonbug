After SBC Yahoo terminated it's browser service, I chose Firefox with the Yahoo setup. (So I still use AT&T Yahoo a my DSL service.) Problem: Under the description for Subject, if the description is long and hide (overflow?) under the next column (in my case, the Date), after seeing 1 or 2 extended subject a pop-up text, the next extended (overflow?) subject doe not show. As an example: "Exclusive Video Interview: Egypt & Beyond: What's Next?" Go to actual result below for continuing description...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Pass the cursor over the subject
2.Pass the cursor over the subject
3.Pass the cursor over the subject
Actual Results:
If I pas the cursor over the subject and it's the first or second time I am doing this, I can see the whole subject. If it is, say the third such subject, I will only see what is not hidden under the date column. I see "Exclusive Video Interview: Egypt & B," while I do not the remaining text "eyond: What's Next?" a a pop-up. In order to reset this, I have to click on open space and then bring the cursor back to the Subject line.

Expected Results:
Seeing the entire pop-up text "Exclusive Video Interview: Egypt & Beyond: What's Next?"

Seeing the entire pop-up text "Exclusive Video Interview: Egypt & Beyond: What's Next?"
