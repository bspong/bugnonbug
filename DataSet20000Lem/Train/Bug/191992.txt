modern.jar is packaged in zip build
There are a series of problem here, and it's all rather complicated:

1, primarily: package are being built (venkman, chatzilla and inspector in the
developer build + embed-sample in the release builds) that supply contents.rdf
file that have assertion referencing "modern" - this cause the Themes panel
to check the name arc on whichever of them it find first.

One (or more, or all) of these package is wrongly providing a "Name" arc when
it identifies itself a supporting the modern theme, a a rule extension should
not provide name of existing theme because when the extension contents.rdf
file is aggregated into the chrome registry datasource the order of assertion
retrieval is undefined in the interface of nsIRDFDataSource (it may not be in
implementation, but we can't rely on that). Only the 'global' package should
have the Name arc. If these package did not provide a displayName arc, the
content builder would never find a value to put in the tree cell and
theoretically a row would not be built. (If this doe not happen then the
preference theme panel should be modified to use the new template syntax to
make the presence of a "displayName" arc required via a condition).

2 - a a corollary, release build are getting embedding-sample built. This is
not something that mean anything to release builds, and it should be ifdef'ed
out somehow. ifndef MOZ_PHOENIX in mozilla/embedding/browser/Makefile.in seems
one option (although it doesn't fix it for Mozilla)

Issue (1) need to be fixed.
