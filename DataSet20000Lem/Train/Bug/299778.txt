adblock + flashblock + firefox 1.0.4 = firefox crash
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When loading http://www.messaging.sprintpcs.com , normally it load fine.
However, after adblock and flashblock extension are installed, visiting
http://www.messaging.sprintpcs.com crash firefox. Completely.

I looked at your "Mozilla Web Developer FAQ" but it doesn't address when firefox
itself crashes. No matter how bad the website code itself is, firefox shouldn't
crash (IMHO).

My setup:
Windows 2000 Professional with all the update a of today, july 5th, 2005.
Firefox 1.0.4 (I did an uninstall and reinstall today)
flashblock 1.2.9 extension
adblock 0.5.2.039 extension
thunderbird 1.0.2



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Steps to reproduce:
1. install firefox 1.0.4
2. install flashblock 1.2.9 (the latest version a of july 5th, 2005)
3. Restart firefox to install flashblock.
4. visit http://www.messaging.sprintpcs.com - the site work fine.
5. install adblock 0.5.2.039 (the latest version a of july 5th, 2005).
6. Restart firefox to intall adblock.
7. visit http://www.messaging.sprintpcs.com - the site now crashes.
8. uninstall flashblock. Restart firefox.
9. visit http://www.messaging.sprintpcs.com - the site now work fine again.

I have reproduced this error on two separate win2kpro computer with 100%
regularity.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashed. See "Steps to reproduce" for more details.

Expected Results:
It should not crash.

I know that most people probably aren't using flashblock and adblock and
visiting Sprint PCS's SMS gateway. I'm sure there's a way to achieve the
functionality I desire using other extension like greasemonkey. However, I AM
concerned that this error may have unmasked some kind of buffer overflow or
other potential security issue in the firefox code. Thanks for looking into it.
