Firefox doesn't always update it version number after doing an update
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

I wa trying to update FoxVox to the latest version and went to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/51166/ to do so.

It prompted me to download a newer version of Firefox. I had the latest--3.5.6.

In a discussion with the developer of FoxVox, he let me know that Firefox wa reporting that I had ver. 3.0.8. Apparently Firefox hadn't updated it version number in my about:config file since ver. 3.0.8.

So I manually went into about:config, searched for 3.0.8, updated it with 3.5.6, and wa then able to download FoxVox with no problem.

Looks like you need to ensure that each update update the ver. no. locally.

Thank you for a great product. I use it almost continually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Went to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/51166/.
It prompted me to update Firefox (I had 3.5.6, a shown in the About Firefox dialog box).
Actual Results:
It didn't recognize my version a 3.5.6 but apparently a 3.0.8.

Expected Results:
recognized my current version

I've seen that problem once before, when my version number wa reported a an earlier version. So I went in manually and changed the version number. the situation worked out OK after that.
