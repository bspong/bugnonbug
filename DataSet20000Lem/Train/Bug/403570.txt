New Hotmail ("Windows Live") doe not insert text properly with "Reply" or "Forward".
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 firefox Firefox/2.0.0.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 firefox Firefox/2.0.0.9

I have the Firefox above with the AdBlock add on. I disable AdBlock and the problem still occurs. It did not occur with the old version of Hotmail. It doe not occur with IE7 (which I hate using). There are bitch about it on blogs, so I don't think it is my hardware/software build.

Procedure:

1) read an email message.
2) click "Reply" or "Forward"
3) (screen changes/repaints)
4) the text of the original email is tossed into the editing box with no
line terminators. In addition, the header are damaged. The message
is unreadable and can scare away business clients.
5a) cutting/pasting doesn't fix the problem.
6a) tried making mod in the "about:config" area (suggested from the
web) - this fixed the problem the first time, but no subsequent times.
Bizarre, I know, but true.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (see the summary above)
2. use either "Reply" or "Forward" - anything that fill the edit window with
the previous message.
3.
Actual Results:
See summary.

Expected Results:
Properly tracked the original message with line terminator and
intact message "To:/From:" header information.

See summary. Lots of people know about this and are bitching about it - bitching about MSN, of course -- lol.

I saw a few "Hotmail" bugs, but they were more of the variety "Hotmail" doe not work - which isn't very helpful. If you get a Vista machine, with Firefox ... and you follow the step above ... it will happen every time.

Don't know if this is an "Evangilize Bug" - which is where I started - but
this is an ideal "kill Microsoft" forever test case.

I'm gonna file this a "Major", cuz lot of people use Hotmail, and compatibility with it seems to me to be a major feature.
