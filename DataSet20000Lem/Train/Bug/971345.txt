Firefox hang after resuming from Hibernation and cannot be unloaded from memory without ending the task.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140127194636

Steps to reproduce:

I have a Windows 7 Professional 64-bit laptop.

Instead of shutting down my laptop when not using it, I close the lid. If the lid is only closed for a short time, when I open the computer back up it will resume operation immediately. In this case, I believe the computer is sleeping. If I leave the lid closed for a while, the next time I open the computer I will get a screen stating "Resuming Windows" before a return to normal operation. I believe this second instance is because the computer went into hibernation.


Actual results:

After my computer resume from hibernation (the second state), Firefox (which I leave open) will not respond. I cannot open new web pages, I cannot reload current web pages. I can use the buttons, links, tabs, and menu of Firefox, but it appears to be unable to access the internet. When I select "Exit", the Firefox window close.

However, after this happens I cannot start Firefox again. I have to go into my Task Manager, where I can see that Firefox is still using several hundred megabyte of RAM. I then have to end the process. Once the process ha ended, I can then start Firefox again and it will work properly.

This happens every time that my computer hibernates.


Expected results:

Prior to Firefox build 26, I did not have this issue. But in build 26 and 27 this is a problem. Firefox should resume normal usage after hibernation and when I close Firefox, it should not remain in memory and need to be closed in the Task Manager.
