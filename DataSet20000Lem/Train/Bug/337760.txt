Live Bookmarks do not recognize Atom feed with namespace prefix

I had an atom feed which specified <atom:feed xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">... and so forth throughout (all atom element were prefixed with atom:, and feedvalidator.org confirmed the feed wa valid.

Firefox reported "Live Bookmark failed to load" when I'd create a live bookmark for this feed. I changed the header to <feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"> , removing the namespace prefix, and the Live Bookmarks load fine.

For what it's worth NetNewsWire and Bloglines were both okay with the prefixed feed. The namespace prefix is perfectly legal XML. This should have worked.

As it is, the workaround is to ensure that http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom is the default namespace for any atom feed you want to use a Live Bookmarks, but this doesn't seem like it the correct behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with any valid Atom feed.
2. Change the <feed> tag to be <atom:feed xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
3. Replace each subsequent tag with the atom: namespace prefix (e.g., <title> becomes <atom:title>, etc.)
4. Try to load this new file with the namespace prefix a a Live Bookmark.

Actual Results:
Live Bookmark failed to load.

Expected Results:
The feed should load a Live Bookmarks.
