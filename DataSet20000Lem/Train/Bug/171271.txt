Something I've found myself wishing for quite frequently with bookmark group is
the ability to overwrite a group bookmark with another one of the same name.

What I often do is visit several link that I want to read, and leave them up
until such time a it is convenient for me to do so. However, if for some
reason I need to reboot or shutdown Mozilla before I get a chance to read
everything, I want to store off the bookmark so I can resume where I left off.
But I often want to keep re-using the same bookmark group, overwriting it with
my current working set of pages. Unfortunately, that appears to require a
multi-step process right now:

1. Bookmark this group of tab - mouse, menu, navigate to location, and type in
a name
2. Bookmarks->ManageBookmarks, navigate to existing "working set" group and
delete it.

So if I could overwrite the existing bookmark, my work would be cut in half.
Then the next step would be if I could automate this process by designating one
such group bookmark a my official "working set" that could be stored and
retrieved with a single command or hotkey - i.e. without having to navigate the
bookmark hierarchy at all.
