Cannot search from address bar if internet connection drop
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140605174243

Steps to reproduce:

1. Set the address bar to automatically search on Google if the input is not a valid URL
2. Enter a search term in the address bar
3. Internet connection drop while the search is happening, 'while' being the keyword here. If the search had already completed when the connection dropped, this is not an issue.
4. Stare at a blank page and a spinning wheel for an infinite amount of time


Actual results:

When this happens once, I am not able to use the address bar for searching until Firefox is restarted. I should add that despite not being able to search from the bar directly, keyword search still work. I have the Google search bar accessible using the 'g' keyword, so 'g <search term>' still works. In addition, using the address bar to search from inside of a Private Browsing window work a well.

The fact that I can still use a Private Browsing window to search from the address bar tell me that it's probably something to do with a bad state being saved when the connection is lost, and that this state is ignored inside of Private Browsing


Expected results:

If Firefox could not recover from the connection loss, a simple 'No Internet Connection' page should be displayed.
