Write a browser-chrome test suite for the various "Save As" function in Toolkit's "contentAreaUtils.js"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The various "Save As" commands, available from the browser's context menu
and other places, use some JavaScript function that are defined in the
"contentAreaUtils.js" file. For Firefox, the file is located under the
"toolkit" folder.

These function need a test suite that exercise all the various save
scenarios. Such suite would ideally test all the possible code paths,
checking thing such a the name used by default for the target file,
the available save type (complete, HTML only, ...) based on the MIME
type of the content, possible error condition with the save operation,
and so on.

Reproducible: Always




SeaMonkey us a separate "contentAreaUtils.js" file, located under the "suite" folder. To be useful for SeaMonkey development too, the test case should be
written in a way that differentiates between the expected behavior for the two
products, if different.

Ideally, the common function should be moved to a shared place where they can
be tested in the same way for both products. This is covered by bug 484616.
