User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0
Build ID: 20130409194949

Steps to reproduce:

In one of our company's website we show a pdf file in the browser when the user click the link.


Actual results:

The PDF file show in the browser (PDF Viewer) but the bar-code is not rendered correctly. This only happens with the new version of Firefox 20.0. I think it ha to do with the new Firefox PDF viewer(container). In all other major browser it render correctly including Adobe Reader. Please check the link below:
