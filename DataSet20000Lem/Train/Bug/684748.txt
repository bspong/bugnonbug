(Mostly) 6.0.1 crash with IdVault
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 PhishLock/3.5.0.48
Build ID: 20110830092941

Steps to reproduce:

I upgraded to Firefox V6.01 about 4 day ago.


Actual results:

Ever since I upgraded, Firefox ha been crashing. It seems to crash whenever a new tab is opened (not always, but random) or when a hyperlink is clicked (the hyperlink doesn't necessarily open a new tab). The crash happens about 2 second after the new tab is opened or the hyperlink is clicked on. So the new site is displayed for about 2 seconds, then Firefox crashes. I tried ALL of the item on this link: https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Firefox%20crashes#w_the-crash-doesnt-happen-in-safe-mode . None in these suggestion on this link fixed the problem. The problem happens in safe mode also.
It ha crashed 4 time in 11 minute and another time 8 time in 60 minutes. It is very frequent (and irritating).
One time that it could be reproduced repeatedly wa logging onto facebook. I tried it 3 time and it crashed all 3 times. I just tried logging onto Facebook and Firefox crashed. However, Facebook is not the only site that Firefox crash on. The other appear to be random.
I have never had problem with Firefox before this. It ha been a stable product for me.
Pleeeese help. I would like to continue using Firefox.


Expected results:

I should be able to click on a new tab or a hyperlink without Firefox crashing.
