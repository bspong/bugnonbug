The "Do this automatically for file like this from now on" feature work for the next file that is downloaded, but the box to select this feature doe not remain check marked. What result is that you have to choose what to do with the third download, or you have to check mark the box to download the same way every time. The simple fix is to make sure that box stay check marked until you choose another option like in previous version of Firefox. I also have added DownTheAll and gotflash but it doesn't matter what option I choose, but the third downlad I have to choose it again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on a file to download.
2.The download manager pop up with choice of how to download Ex: Open with, DownThemAll, dTa one-click, GotFlash or Save File
3.Choose method and check mark the box "Do this automatically for file like this from now on"
4.Click on okay and download starts.
5.Click on another file to download of the same type.
Actual Results:
The Download Manager pop up with the same chosen method of download, but the box next to "Do this automatically for file like this from now on" is not check marked.

Expected Results:
The Download Manager should pop up with the same method of download and the box next to "Do this automatically for file like this from now on" should already be check marked when the Manager pop up so I can just click "okay" for every subsequent download of the same file type without having to check mark the box every time.

At first I thought it might have been a bug in DownThemAll but I realized that it doe matter what method of download you choose, the same thing always happens.
