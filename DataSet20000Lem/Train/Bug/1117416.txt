Steps to reproduce:

Attempting to visit any site that us Shockwave Flash on firefox.


Actual results:

Once Shockwave Flash is activated the page hang for a few second and the entire browser is unresponsive, followed by a message saying shockwave may be busy or is not responding, do you want to continue or close thr program. Continuing result in the browser staying frozen, while closing it crash the plugin. i have already uninstalled adobe flash from the entire computer and reinstalled it but that did not work. Disabling hardware acceleration and protected mode also did not work. I also read a suggestion of setting the plugin container to 'ask to activate' which worked fine until shockwave flash wa activated and...you guessed it. hang and crash. there were no previous update to any addons or program in the computer within 2 months. Problem began yesterday and i have yet found a way to fix it.


Expected results:

It should have played video and content without instantly hanging and crashing.
