misleading download URI listed when downloading a file from a nested URI (e.g. view-source:)
Created attachment 631187
mozFileDownloadSourceSpoof.html

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/536.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/19.0.1084.52 Safari/536.5

Steps to reproduce:

I am using the following technique to hide the source of an executable file which is downloaded:
1- "alert" box in "onbeforeunload" to create a delay
2- loading a legitimate page such a Mozilla download page in "onbeforeunload"
3- loading a fake executable file a the destination of the page
4- use "view-source:" protocol in front of the downloadable file to hide the download source ("view-source:http://0me.me/fake/calc.php")
5- "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" can be downloaded even via "view-source:" protocol.
6- user "Worker" to create "alert" box without having the "do not show again" option.
7- loading the destination page in an image tag to be cached; to reduce the loading time.

As a result it open the download panel in front of the legitimate website.

In the following PoC, I have used "cmd.exe" which ha renamed to "Firefox Setup.exe":

I will attach this file here a well.



Actual results:

a download panel will opened in front of the "Mozilla Firefox" download website. Its source ha been set to "view-source:".


Expected results:

1- download panel should not be opened in front of another page in another website
2- it source should be equal to the real source
3- "view-source" should not download the file
4- "alert" box via Worker, should also have the hide option.
