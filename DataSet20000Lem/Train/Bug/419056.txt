Viewing my blog & other blog hosted on the free blogging service wordpress.com after logging I found that we have a horizontal scrollbar (never saw it in FF 2.X) while nothing in these page require a horizontal scrollbar.

Scrolling with it (to the left side) I found some menu which should appear in the page top while moving the mouse over a wordpress related bar.

I made a video demonstrating it (and other problem but never mind about it now) it is about 11.5 MB compressed to 10.5 MB (ogg format) and for some reason the recording tool made my desktop look so dark, please change the brightness to be able to see it, you will find it here : http://www.4shared.com/file/38540912/b1139760/Firefox_hor_scrollbar.html

I only tested it with Linux (Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a wordpress.com account (you can have one without a blog) & log-in.
2.Visit the above URL you should see a blue bar @ the top of the page which contain some menu (additional menu appear only if you have MORE than one wordpress.com blog).
3.Use the horizontal scrollbar & you will find that problem.
Actual Results:
You will see the horizontal scrollbar & using it you will see the hidden menus.

Expected Results:
No horizontal scrollbar.

Firefox/3.0b3pre on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon.
