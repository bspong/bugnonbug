What look like two separate problem seem to be linked in that one show up iff the other does. Problem is with Firefox 3.0 and 3.0.1 not version 2. Installing latest version of Quicktime ha not fixed it. Problem doe not show up with Firefox 3.0.1 / Quicktime 6.5. Problem occurs on two different machines, different hardware and configurations, different add ons. Can send you copy of code that produce quicktime bug, but any embedded quicktime movie show up the probelem.
