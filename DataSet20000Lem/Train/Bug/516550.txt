every time I print, the print setting get reverted to the most ink-costly setting (full color, high quality). I would like to *save* my print setting a to not have to manually set them to the Save Ink setting *each and every time*.

even Microsoft Word let me save the print settings. I know HP and other manufacturer of cheap inkjets with expensive ink have paid you a lot of money to default to "ink waster" preference each time, but please, do the *right* thing, and allow thrifty folk to *preserve* their preferences, so they don't have to go in and edit the setting each time they print, or otherwise burn a great quantity of ink.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. hit print
2. change setting to something that us le ink
3. print
4. hit print again on a different page
5. ink setting are reverted to "massive fountain of ink everywhere, costing $26 a page"; congratulations!
Actual Results:
if I'm not careful, a new ink cartridge is the actual result!

Expected Results:
save my ink preference each time so that I don't have to manually set "save ink" each and every and each and every and each and every time by hand.

how much more additional information do you need?? tell the ink manufacturer where they can stick their scam!
