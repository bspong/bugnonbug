- This is my first bug report and am sorry if I do anything wrong

http://tvguide.ninemsn.com/guide/16012004_73.asp?channel=free&day=16/1/2004

or

http://tvguide.ninemsn.com -then select 'go' (to goto today tv guide)

When you click on a tv programme, a new page open in a new window (smaller) a
it should, but another window open at the same time (full size). This worked
fine in 0.7.

But if you close the larger window, then select another tv programme while
leaving the smaller window open, it only open the link in the smaller window
(refreshing it)... working a it should.

But if you close both the larger window and the smaller window, it again open
only the smaller window a it should.

So it only open the maximised window on the first tv programme you select, and
when you close it, it doe not come back.

Did not work in:

(not sure about the last build date)

Reproducible: Always

2 new window should appear with the same content, one the size it should be the
other maximised
