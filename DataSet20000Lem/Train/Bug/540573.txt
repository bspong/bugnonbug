Ever since I updraded to Win7, Firefox is daily (sometimes multiple time per day) locking up, greying out, and I have to go to Task Manager to close it. It doe on most occasion tell me that it is sending a feedback report, but I have no assurance that it is doing this. When I re-start Firefox, it doe try to go back to my previous page(s), but is not always successful. This only started to occur when I installed Win 7, and it wa happening in the previous version of Firefox before this last upgrade a week or so ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox and read mail on ATT mail page
2.begin to visit trusted web site from mail - CNN.com, ESPN.com, etc.
3.locks up and grey out
Actual Results:
have to open Task manager and force firefox to close - I do notice that sometimes the firefox application is using a lot of cpu capacity

Expected Results:
go from site to site without locking up
