The recently-added yellow background for the location bar when a secure site is
accessed doe not take into account the system's theme colours. WindowBlinds
theme Blackcomb Dark and Furcadia (in development) do not use black, or even
dark button or window text. The yellow background assumes this and thus cause
the URL to become unreadable.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a theme that includes light-coloured text
2. Load a site in Firefox that is secure
3. . . . there's no step 3

Actual Results:
The background wa applied without regard to the system (and previous)
background colours, and without considering the fact that text may not be dark.
This resulted in unreadable URL text.

Expected Results:
This should be handled in a way that work with all themes. In general, if you
are going to force a non-themed background colour, you should force a non-themed
foreground a well. Perhaps it could change the foreground text to be black, or
use the selected foreground and background colour when on a secure site and
switch back to non-selected colour when selecting text.

Using latest BlueFyre build from burning edge forums, latest version of
WindowBlinds available, with skin Blackcomb Dark and Furcadia (latter is in
development and currently us yellow text)
