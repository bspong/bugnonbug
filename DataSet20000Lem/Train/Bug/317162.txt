This is a minor but strange bug i've found and seems to indicate something very strange going on when using fixed positioning. When a div is set to position:fixed and you include a two child divs, one with a child input type=text and one with a negative margin-left setting and any child (text or otherwise) then the cursor in the input box is offset by the margin enter in the seperate unrelated div. The cursor is move left out of the input box whilst the text is enter correctly, the cursor will move a if it wa following text a it wa entered but just offset by however much the margin wa set to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put the following code into a xhtml doc,

<div style="position:fixed">
<div>
<div>
<input type="text" />
</div>
<div style="margin-left:-20px"> text </div>
</div>
</div>

2. View the page and click in the input box
3. Type in text and watch the cursor appear from off the page.
Actual Results:
As above, the cursor is offset by the margin setting.

Expected Results:
The cursor should be align to the input box, not the margin!!

Selecting the text work a expected.

BTW, this bug also affect the netscape browser and therefore probably the mozilla suite browser.
