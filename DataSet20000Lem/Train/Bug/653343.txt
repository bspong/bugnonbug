Namoroka doesn't release WinXP Cache or return Handles for over 15 minute after closing.

I am enclosing a Screenshot of "Windows Task Manager" which demonstrates the problem.

Namoroka, on WinXp, will start to freeze for a couple of minute and then return control for 30-60 second after a few hour of use with over 195 Tabs open (especially bad with over 220 Tabs); it doe depend on which URLs are used and the Tab History also.


Refer to the included Screenshot:


In the Screenshot you can see the freeze that prompted me to close the Browser (which when re-started will work fine, for a couple of hours).

You can see that "closing" Namoroka and the "closing" of Namoroka's Window are two different event widely spaced in time.

When Namoroka's Windows actually doe close it return a puny amount of WinXP's Cache for the OS to use, then Namoroka will 'pin' one Core of a Dual-Core CPU and hold the Cache (and MANY Handles for over 15 minutes).

Sometime later it wil start to 'dribble' the Cache back to the OS at a faster rate and then suddenly return it all promptly (as it should have done nearly 20 minute prior).

During this period of 'hogging' it will hang onto over 15,000 Handles.
