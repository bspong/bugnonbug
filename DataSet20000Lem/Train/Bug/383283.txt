This is a small bit of code from a registration page I'm writing which allows user to search for their addresses. addressArr is an array with 7 indexes, the first of which is the house name, and the second is the house number.

This code check to see if addressArr[0] contains any letter or number (incidentally, checking for empty values, null object or just general undefinedness doe not seem to work) and, if the result is not null, it should concatenate the number and name together separated by a space.

When this code is executed, I get the following alert (in order):
'Maryann Cottages'
'M'
'is not null'
'2 Maryann Cottages'

That last alert mean that the value of that field ha been set to 2 Maryann Cottages, since I'm alerting the value of the field itself. I have checked this later on by doing the same thing, and it return the same result.

The bug is in the fact that the field itself contains, and only ever contains, the number 2.

addressRegex = /[A-Za-z0-9]/;
alert(addressArr[0]);
alert(addressArr[0].match(addressRegex));
document.getElementById('manualAddress').style.display = '';
if (addressArr[0].match(addressRegex) == null)
{
alert('is null');
document.getElementById('housenumber').value = addressArr[1];
}
else
{
alert('is not null');
document.getElementById('housenumber').value = addressArr[1] + ' ' + addressArr[0];
alert(document.getElementById('housenumber').value);
}

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See description
Actual Results:
The field value becomes set to the house number with no trailing character whatsoever

Expected Results:
The field value should become the house number, followed by a space, followed by the house name

Works fine in Opera 9, IE6 and IE7.
