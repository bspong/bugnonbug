Steps to reproduce:

I found the bug when upgrading to the latest Firefox 18 Beta Candidate from the latest Firefox 17 release. At some point in the past, I had used 'Customise Toolbar' to remove the 'Stop' and 'Refresh' button from my Awesomebar Toolbar.



Actual results:

When entering text into the Awesomebar, it grew in height and caused the page to reflow due to the window chrome increasing in size. I believe this is due to the 'Go' arrow/icon not maintaining a fixed height when text is entered. See attached file for reference.

To reproduce:

1. Create Fresh Firefox Profile
2. about:config -> browser.tabs.onTop
3. Open Context Menu on Awesomebar Toolbar
4. Click 'Customise...'
5. Check 'Use Small Icons'
6. Drag 'Stop' and 'Refresh' button off Awesomebar Toolbar
7. Enter Text into Awesomebar - it should grow in height

Restoring the icon resolved the issue.


Expected results:

The Awesomebar Height should remain fixed, the chrome size should not increase and affect the size of the main pane. The 'Go' arrow in the Awesomebar should not grow.
