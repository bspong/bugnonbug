When opening a file, or saving a file, the window automatically scroll to the beginning or the end. Unless a folder is in the first or last column of the window, I can't choose it! As a result I must save file to the main directory or an incorrect folder at the beginning or end of the list.

The only way to open a file in a center folder is to view it with Windows Explorer, then right-click "open with" Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.File/Open
2.Try to select a file
3.Cannot access correct file unless it's in either the first or last column of the window.
Actual Results:
Let's say there are 5 column of folder in "My Documents." If file is not in the first column or the last column of folders, I cannot double-click the folder to Open the file. The window auto-scrolls to the end of the list, giving me the last column, or I can go back to the first column. Nothing in between. Same thing happens with Save File.

Expected Results:
I don't know how else to describe this. Cannot access correct file, or save to correct location, a I'm unable to get to center column of folder in the File/Open or File/Save As windows.

It should have allowed me to move to any column of my choice when opening or saving to a folder.
