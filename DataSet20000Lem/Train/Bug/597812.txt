(4.0b6) Flash video (youtube) frame display site/browser instead of black space.

(Firefox 4.0 b6) When watching flash video with black side bar (from uploading widescreen and "fitting" to YT frame) they do not "refresh" on screen from scrolling up and down the page. It seems to be that area on flash video that do not update new color will not go back to black automatically, and will instead show whatever wa in that spot on your screen earlier. most likely a hardware acceleration error with flash player. Seems to be MUCH worse when video is paused!! System detail below.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load youtube video to 5 seconds+
2. scroll down page till video is hidden by top part of browser.
3. quickly scroll up to top of webpage.
4. Sides of video frame should show other piece of webpage or browser.
Actual Results:
depending upon whether flash update black space, and speed of scrolling up, this happens to me about 75% of the time. This happens on some video more than others. Others, not at all.

Expected Results:
should have updated and turned black

tested on FireFox 4.0 beta 6, window 7 ultimate x64, 2 ATI 4890's in crossfire, latest drivers/flash player a of 9/18/2010.
