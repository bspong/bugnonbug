Repeatedly advised of version upgrade availability in one FF profile after multiple installs which are indicated to be compleet and successful. DOES NOT occur in second/different profile-still need to check two profile but since having same problem multiple time for certain profile, decided to report/inquire.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Repeated download of Firefox 3.5.3(4X)and repeated installations(4X)for same profile
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Still directed to upgrade installed Firefox version (which wa 3.5.3 already).
Have not had time to check all profile for reproducibility but ha repeated 4X in one profile and doe not occur in a second/different profile

Expected Results:
Uncertain-believed (same)newer version (3.5.3) would not be indicated a available.
