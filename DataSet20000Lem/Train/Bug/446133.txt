I don't like to see a bunch of url popping out every time I write an address in the address bar ..I prefer a clear private data every time and nothing in the address bar history ...

when I first installed the new firefox 3 ... I typed 8 address on the address bar and after awhile I went to the tools>clear private data .... and guess what?..
I can't get rid of those first 8 address .... Firefox doesn't add any more
but I am stuck with the first 8 address ... I CAN'T CLEAR THEM!...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.DO A FRESH INSTALL OF FIREFOX 3....
2.TYPE ANY NUMBER OF WEB ADDRESSES UP TO 10
3.GO TO >TOOLS > CLEAR PRIVATE DATA ...
4.- JUST TYPE ANY NEW ADDRESS AND YOU WILL SEE THAT IT DID NOT CLEAR THE PREVIOUS ONES ... THE OLD ADDRESSES START POPPING OUT ... IT IRRITATES ME!


Expected Results:
INSTALLED AND RE-INSTALLED WITH NO CHANGE IN RESULTS!

FIX IT!

JUST ANOTHER IRRITATING FACT .... THE NEW FIREFOX 3 CREATES A LOT OF POP-UPS ...
A LITTLE MORE AND i AM READY TO ABANDON SHIP AND GO BACK TO A PREVIOUS VERSION
2.009 OR SO...
DON'T KEEP UP WITH THE BAD WORK!...
