I have been experiencing problem with video on firefox on different website including youtube and the site I linked. The video and audio go all choppy and my CPU go to 100%. This ha been happening since this morning when my firefox automatically updated. In the beginning it wa just some minor error but it's gotten worse to the point that I can't watch any on firefox. Sometimes the video is still for over 1 minute while the audio is still on. I have tried the site with different browsers. I don't get this problem with any different browser with any video or site at all.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go onto a site with video such a youtube or http://www.narutowire.com/Bleach-Episode-236/watch/0f43e7595cd4750f3a51/

Actual Results:
My video and audio got all choppy and my CPU went to 100%.

Expected Results:
It should have played the video normal and without the CPU suddenly peaking to 100%
