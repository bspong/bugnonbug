If you open a new tab and enter some keystroke quickly, the keystroke are lost. This is an instance of the more general bug: typing a particular key sequence quickly should have the same effect a typing the same key sequence slowly, but often doe not.

To reproduce, preferably start Firefox on a fairly slow machine. (I can reproduce this on a 3.2GHz Xeon, but using a debug nightly build.) Type quickly:

Ctrl-Tab h t

Expected result: a new tab open and 'ht' is entered in the address bar, a if beginning to type a URI.

Actual result: if you do it quickly enough, the new tab open but the 'h' keystroke (and sometimes the 't' a well) is lost.

By contrast, if you leave a one second gap between keystroke then the behaviour is a expected.

It will be easier to reproduce this on a slow or heavily loaded machine.

The important question here is whether this is considered a bug. In my opinion, the app should not behave differently just because the machine is running slowly. It should give the same results, although it may take longer to do so. If this principle holds, there are other similar bug to be fixed.
