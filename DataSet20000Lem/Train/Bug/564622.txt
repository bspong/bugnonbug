What make Firefox on of the worst web browser is that this issue ha been around for along long long time and nothing ha been done to fix it...

If you start watching video on YouTube for example close your tab or window while this video is still streaming...you will notice that Firefox is still consuming bandwidth and keep streaming video or video even thought tab or window is closed... if you start watching multiply streaming video and close any of the tab or window you will run even in the bigger problem... watching video will become impossible because Firefox will be still streaming first video until they are fully loaded... Firefox will not stop video streaming until it fully loaded! Imagine the situation if you have to pay for every megabyte you have downloaded like I do because Im on mobile broadband then this becomes a big problem because you can end up with a ridiculous internet bill because of this streaming video problem that ha been around for a long time... Is there any plan of fixing this bug ?
