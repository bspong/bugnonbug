Intentionally malformed URL disables Firefox UI

I wa just experimenting with another app (which us ShellExecute to launch
Firefox, a Firefox is the default browser), giving it intentionally screwed up
URLs in an attempt to simulate someone trying to hack the app.

I tried several different URLs; the one listed above wa the last. I'm not
completely certain which one killed the UI.


Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
With Firefox running in the background (with several different page open in
tabs), call ShellExecute from another app, passing the following URLs (as
documents) in turn:

http://%08%08%08%08%08%08%08notepad
http://%08%08%08%08%08%08%08file://notepad
http://%08%08%08%08%08%08%08file:///notepad (twice)
Actual Results:
Interestingly, the first URL navigated to http://www.notepad.org/; the next two
navigated to http://www.fileplanet.com/. And after the series of four URLs I
noticed that the UI had gone dead. I'm not certain when it happened -- even
while "dead" the ShellExecute call will still bring up a new page a normal.

By "killing the UI" what I mean is that all the menu can still be dropped down,
but selecting ANY menu option doe nothing. You can switch between tab (and
see the different pages), but the Address Bar doe not update (the window
caption does, however). Right-clicking on a page doe nothing (no context
menu). Trying to navigate to "about:blank" works; trying "about:" just stall
endlessly. That's about all I tried before closing the window (and then having
to manually terminate the process, because it wa left dangling after the window
closed).

Expected Results:
I'm really not sure why fileplanet got opened (unless they've registered
www.file.com perhaps?) -- but that isn't the problem.

Clearly it shouldn't have broken the UI like that!
