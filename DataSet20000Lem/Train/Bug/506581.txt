After installing 3.5 I configured it to:

Open window and tab from last time
Use custom setting for history
Not automatically start in a private browsing session
Remember my browsing history for at least 5 day
and not clear browsing history when closing

I then immediately closed it, and upon reopening it my homepage wa returned.

I am concerned after seeing that many report like this were labeled a duplicate of drastically different reportsand a similar problem ignored in 1.0.8, I hope this will be read carefully.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Adjust setting a described
2.Open a tab or two
3.restart Firefox 3.5.
Actual Results:
Homepage

Expected Results:
Some tab

There is a very slight chance that my laptop's substandard construction is at fault, it ha also refused to ever compile anything.
