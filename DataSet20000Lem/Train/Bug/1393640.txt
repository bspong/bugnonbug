Default Flexible Space Reappears in Nightly after using release Firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0
Build ID: 20170824100243

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open 57 Branch Nightly. My Nightly is 64-bit. I have reproduced this bug using both my profile and the default profile.
2. Remove flexible space left of the address bar and right of the search bar using Customize menu. These flexible space are there by default. I have not moved either the address bar or the search bar.
3. Close Nightly.
4. Open 55/release Branch Firefox. This version of Firefox is 32-bit for me. Let the program startup to the home page - my homepage is about:home.
5. Close Firefox.
6. Open 57 Branch Nightly again.


Actual results:

a) When I open Firefox 55, the flexible space that I removed are still gone. (Expected)
b) When I reopen Nightly 57, the flexible space that I removed in Customize reappear to the left of the address bar and to the right of the search bar.


Expected results:

a) When I open Firefox 55, the flexible space should remain gone.
b) When I return to Nightly 57, the flexible space should still remain gone.


I am not an expert on how Firefox handle customizations, but this bug could be caused by having a 32-bit version of release Firefox and a 64-bit version of 57 Nightly. This issue ha also occurred after major update to Nightly. Nightly seems to recognize using 55 Firefox then 57 Nightly a an update even though both version are already on my computer.
