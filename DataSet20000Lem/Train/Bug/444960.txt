Ctrl keyboard shortcut override expected system key binding (chrome accesskeys v emacs-like bindings)

In Cocoa application (and carbon application in Leopard) text view use the control key for various emacs-inspired operations. Firefox seems to only inherit this behaviour sometimes.

A list of the binding can be found (on my Leopard system) at:
/System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict

Some example of the problem:
- The find feature remove the ability to move to the beginning of the line (see reproduction). Control-a activates highlight-all instead.
- In Preferences > Security > Saved Passwords: Control-a asks if you would like to remove all of your saved passwords.
- In edit bookmark Control-e toggle more/less.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Focus the address bar, placing the caret away from the beginning of the URL text
2. Press control-a to move the caret to the beginning of the line
3. Activate the find functionality
4. Focus the address bar, placing the caret away from the beginning of the URL text
5. Press control-a

Actual Results:
Highlight all feature is activated

Expected Results:
Caret should be moved to the beginning of the line
