This is a problem between Firefox and Invision Power Board version 2.1.7 (or maybe all 2.x versions). When you are posting a new topic or replying to a topic and press the enter key to go to a new line the text cursor doe not blink -- it either show a . or nothing at all. If you type though the text doe go on the correct line but there is just no blinking text cursor to show where you are.

If you press the enter key twice the text cursor is still not visible and it instead place a | symbol between the lines.

So for example you maybe typing a sentence and press enter twice ... it will look like this:

Example sentence ...

After pressing enter twice

I tried using Safari and it worked fine. The text cursor blink where it should even after pressing return to go to the next line. This issue only occurs when using Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website that is using an up to date version of Invision Power Board such a http://forums.pcpitstop.com or http://www.houstonsportstalk.com
2. Post a new topic or reply to existing topic.
3. Type something on the first line and press return/enter once to see that the cursor is not blinking on the next line -- press return twice to see that firefox place a | symbol in between the line and the cursor is still not visible.



Expected Results:
The text cursor should blink on the new line after pressing return.
