Double clicking on a simple label attached to a simple input element in a very small div, where the ondblclick event for the containing div cause the whole div to be hidden and to display a previously hidden div, cause Firefox 1.5 to crash, where the exact same HTML doe *not* cause Firefox 1.0.7 to crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Load this small page in Firefox 1.5 and double click the 'test' label. It'll crash, everytime:

<html>
<body>
<div id="div1"
ondblclick="this.style.display='none';
document.getElementById('div2').style.display='block';"
style="border: 1px black solid; display: none;">
</div>
<div id="div2"
ondblclick="document.getElementById('div1').style.display = 'block';
this.style.display = 'none';">
<div>
<label for="NewBilledAmt">test</label>
<input type="text" id="NewBilledAmt">
</div>
</div>
</body>
</html>
Actual Results:
crash

Expected Results:
No crash, the div should just flip to the first div (hide itself, and flip to the originally hidden one), which you actually see happen right before the crash.

I have verified this is *not* a problem in Firefox 1.0.7, multiple times, and every single time I've tried to duplicate, it happens in Firefox 1.5.

Strangely, it appears that if you change the id of the input (and the id in the corresponding label element), the problem go away in 1.5. No idea why that would be, but it must have something to do with the problem.
