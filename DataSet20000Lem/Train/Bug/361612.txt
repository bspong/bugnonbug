Using the some capability of the Web Developer extension on form with large hidden input (5K+) cause firefox to crash, and kill the X server a well.
Apparently Web Developer is just doing straight forward DOM manipulation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you've saved and shut down anything important.
2. Load up http://jobsearch.nz.hudson.com/jobsearch/search.aspx
3. Using webdeveloper do either:
3a. Forms -> Display Form Details
or
3b. Forms -> View Form Information
3c. Click on the tab for the orginal page after being shown the form info.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes.
The X server restarts.

Expected Results:
3a. the detail of the form should be added to the rendered page.

3c. the tab showing the original rendered page should show.

64bit 2.6.17 linux kernel running on an amd64
xorg-x11 version 7.1
Web Developer version 1.0.2

Saving the problematic page and changing the '__VIEWSTATE' input to something short give you a page that doesn't crash firefox.
