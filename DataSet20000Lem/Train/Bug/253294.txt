When trying to view video clip from Yahoo! news Audio/Video section, a new
window pop up, but the portion of the window where the video should be is
blank. When using this with IE, it seems to work fine. Also, in the IE version,
there's a link available to change the setting of the video, which is not there
with firefox. I have both Real Player and WMP9 installed. I tried to modify the
setting (Had to use IE to do it) to work with either player, but it doesn't work.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Windows Media Player 9 is installed
2. Go to news.yahoo.com
3. Select Audio/Video in the left hand column
4. Click on any story item - this should reproduce the problem
5. If not, In the pop-up window, if the "Change Settings" link is available, go
to it
6. Change the setting to use Windows Media Player 9

Actual Results:
The video pop-up come up, there are a number of link to different story on
the right, but the video portion is blank.

Expected Results:
The video portion should have played using the embedded medium player.
