With the more recent version of Firebird, I'm getting a "pure virtual function
call" error at the URL http://www.tulsaworld.com/classifiedssearch/webclass1.asp

Sometimes it occurs when the page loads, other time only when I select an
option from one of the drop down and yet others only when I click on one of the
"Go" button (I originally saw this by selecting one of the "Employment"
catagories and then clicking the "Go" button).

My wife reported this with the 8/16/03 (I think) build of Firebird, but I wasn't
having it here with a nightly from July. I updated my build here to 8/17/03 and
now I'm having the same problem - so it appears to be something that ha changed
in the last month or so that is causing the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL.
2. In the "Employment" section, choose the first option in the drop-down list.
3. Click the "Go!" button

Actual Results:
Firebird display an error reading "Runtime Error!" "R6025 - pure virtual
function call" and Firebird then exits.


Expected Results:
It shouldn't have crashed. ;) Minimally, not exiting the browser would be good.
Preferably, it shouldn't get the error at all...
