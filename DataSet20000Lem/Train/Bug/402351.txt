I'm using Oracle's dbconsole (a version of Enterprise Manager) to manage multiple database on same machine. DBCONSOLE is a web based application and for each database, the app assigns a different port to distinguish each app uniquely.

For instance:

http://my_host.com:1158/em
(to manage database ORCL1)

http://my_host.com:5502/em
(to manage database ORCL2)

I can log into each dbconsole instance with Firefox without a problem; however, when I have two dbconsole's logged in using different tabs, Firefox doe not "remember" the credential and invalidates my login information... thus make me have to log into the dbconsole every time I click on a link -- in either tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. in one tab, go to link for DBCONSOLE for database, and log in
2. open another tab (or another Firefox window), open DBCONSOLE for second database, and log in
3. go back to first database, click on link, force log in again

ONLY difference in the URL's is the PORT number.
Actual Results:
Application return to logon page

Expected Results:
Application should allow both instance of DBCONSOLE to function independently and link should not force log in again.
