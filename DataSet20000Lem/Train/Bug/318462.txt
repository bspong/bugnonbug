When http authentication is used (for example used by the Tomcat Manager Application) and a user/password combination ha been saved for this, then the password data is prefilled and only after the password prompt is closed, the security device asks for the master password.
If the master password prompt is canceled, the login still succeeds!

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log out of the software security device
2. Open a page that us http authentication that you have a password stored for
3. The http-password prompt appears prefilled with the stored username and password
4. Press OK
5. The prompt for the master password of the software security device appears
6. Press Cancel
7. The page protected by http authentication appears.

Actual Results:
The stored password ha been used without you needing to enter the master password

Expected Results:
The prefilled http authentication prompt is only shown after the master password ha been entered. If no master password is entered the authentication prompt should appear, but it should not be prefilled.
