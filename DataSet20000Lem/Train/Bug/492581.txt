It's not possible to drag ui (user–interface) item from and to all side of the chrome. It should be possible to drag e.g. the tab bar to the right of the content and the bookmark to the bottom.

Some keyboard shortcut seem not to work in all kind of text fields, for example pressing <Ctrl> + <K> in the location bar simply eareses my selection a <delete> wa pressed. <Ctrl> + <K> work fine when I'm my cursor is not in a text field. Weirdly though some keyboard shortcut seem to work normally, such a <ctrl>+<J> (focuses search bar) but most I tried don't work and simply delete the selection.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Tools —> Toolbars (might get "User Interace" if this get implemented) —> Custumoze
2.Drag some item(s) around. Try dragging the home button to the status bar, or something a–like.
Actual Results:
Firefox reject to move the button to place other than the toolbars at the top.

Expected Results:
Firefox freely move the button to the sidebar, statusbar (w/minimized icons) and the toolbars, of course.
