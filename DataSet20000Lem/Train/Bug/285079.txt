I have two style within a stylesheet that ha been put in use on a page via a
<link> attribute. The only different between the two style are border-style:
none; and border-style: solid. I have style .homedim assigned via HTML class
attribute to an <img> element. This is the style with border-style: none. In
an onmouseover event handler attribute, I call a JavaScript function that set
the className property of the image object to the .homelite style, which ha the
border-style: solid. The solid border doe not appear onmouseover.

Reproducible: Always

Details.
2. Roll mouse over image with assigned class and event handler a described in
Details.
3. Notice that style change doe not occur.
Actual Results:
The border defined a solid by the border-style property of the assigned class
doe not become visible on mouseover.

Expected Results:
That the border-style defined in the assigned class make the border visible
around the image on mouseover.
