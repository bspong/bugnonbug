crash recovery open new tab in the popup window

I have two ff window running, one is having multiple tab while the other is a pop-out window from hulu for viewing the video.
Upon crash (crash id wa not recorded somehow), the restored session open up both window with a 'bonus' of a new tab in the pop-out window. The new tab is the welcome to firefox or something, the same page that welcome you to firefox (if I'm not mistaken, feel free to verify which new tab content shown by using the step below)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open hulu.com and choose any video that you would like to see
2. Pop-out the video to have it open in a separate ff window
3. Crash/ kill firefox (accidentally with crash or intentionally by killing the firefox from task manager)
4. Try to restore the session and make sure the last open tab and window(ses) open
Actual Results:
There is a new tab opened in the pop-out window that play hulu's video.

Expected Results:
The last session should be restored a is, no new tab or new window should present (other than pop up, but I wa not running any website with pop-up enabled)

Note:
- I have not disable/ enable any extension yet, but I believe this is a basic behavior that need some fine tuning
- this bug is not reporting the crash, but more towards having new tab added in the restored session
