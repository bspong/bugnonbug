plugin-container problem prevent playing flash video in FF 15.0.1
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/21.0.1180.89 Safari/537.1

Steps to reproduce:

Following Firefox upgrade, attempted to play any video on the web. Examples include IMDb movie trailer and YouTube video.




Actual results:

1) Video frame render extremely slowly
2) Audio start late and is choppy
3) No video, but occasional still frame
4) FF 15.0.1 becomes unresponsive (multiple FF browser all become unresponsive)
5) Workstation becomes fairly unresponsive
6) Process plugin-container us very high CPU (~60 percent of Quad core 3 GHz AMD)
7) Occasionally, get message, 'Adobe Flash plugin ha crashed. Crash report sent. Reload the page to try again."
8) Once received the message, "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete."
9) If it doe not crash, it take about 60 second for FF to respond to browser close request. Once closed, workstation is responsive again.





Expected results:

Obviously the video should have played. Plays fine in Chrome and IE.

Started immediately after automatic upgrade of FF to version below 15.0.1. Upgrade to version 15.0.1 did not correct. Found similar bug report that blamed it on RealPlayer and recommended upgrading to latest version. Did not correct problem.

Very similar symptom to Bug 722221
