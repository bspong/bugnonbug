The option "Web Page Complete" in the "Save Page As..." dialog is unavailable,
if the document is served a application/xhtml+xml (the recommended MIME-type
for XHTML).

Since the current Accept-header favor application/xhtml+xml over text/html,
this break even page that are also available a text/html via content
negotiation. Fortunately (from this point of view) there are hardly any website
using this MIME-type at the moment, but they probably will become more in
future. Thus considering severity a major.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page which is served a application/xhtml+xml (e.g. the supplied link
above)
2. Try to save the page a "Web Page Complete"
Actual Results:
Only "XHTML" is available, the option "Web Page Complete" and "Text Only" are
missing.

Expected Results:
The same option a for document served a text/html ar available. It should be
saved a *.html for compatibility with older browsers. An additional option to
use *.xhtml would be nice, but might confuse the user. The advanced user could
also set the suffix manually so it might be the best to leave this out.
