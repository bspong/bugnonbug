After browsing for a while, Youtube and other site fail to render properly

After an indeterminate amount of time, Firefox will fail to correctly render page on Youtube and Facebook. This may also affect other pages, but I have seen this behavior on these sites. Graphics tend not to display well and text is in bizarre, often unreadable positions. Links do not always function properly. The page will usually be many time "longer" than it should be because of the poor formatting.

Switching web site doe not clear the problem (i.e., Facebook will tend to show the same problem once Youtube ha manifested it). The issue is temporarily resolved by restarting Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use browser for a significant time period (~hours)
2.Navigate to Youtube or Facebook page
3.Page style will be severely malformed on at least some page
Actual Results:
The page were malformed. Up to a certain point there wa no issue, but page loaded after that tend to have bad formatting.

Expected Results:
The page is expected to render normally.

This bug occurs in Firefox 3 RC1, but I have also seen it in several version of Firefox 2. I don't believe this is unique to Firefox 3.
