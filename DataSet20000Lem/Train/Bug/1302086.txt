[Affected platforms]:
- Windows 10 X64

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Launch Firefox

3. Click the "Show your bookmarks" button from the toolbar in order to open the bookmark menu
4. Go to "Bookmarks Toolbar" section and check the "View Bookmarks Toolbar" option in order to enable the Bookmarks Toolbar
5. Hover one of the bookmark saved on the Bookmarks Toolbar

- The chosen bookmark is properly highlighted when it is in hover state

[Actual result]:
- The chosen bookmark is highlighted twice:
* first time, in hover state
* the second time, right after the hover state
