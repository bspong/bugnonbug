The screen twitch and mess with my screen resolution when I open up Firefox.

Whenever I open up Mozilla Firefox my screen twitches, go blank, then come back up but with somewhat inverted colors. The only way to get it back is by closing Firefox. This ha been happening for a while, I don't know why it started either. And it doesn't happen on my other computer with the same version of Firefox.
One way I found to prevent this is by:
-Disabling, Enabling or uninstalling an add on
-Changing or uninstalling a theme.
-Or when there an update for some tool bar or firefox, it twitch back.
I would like to continue to enjoy firefox, without having this problem.
Thank You.
