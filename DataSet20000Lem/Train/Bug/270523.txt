NOTE: this is not for promotion reasons, I seriously believe to found a bug

on indextrack.com I repeatly replace iframe-contents by setting
getObj('blabla').src, getObj() is nothing else than 'return
document.getElementById()'
somehow the 'document'-Object becomes null, but I never reload the page
containing the iframes!

to reproduce the bug visually you have to look into one of the demo-accounts on
the site and logout, after that every and all iframes have lost the
'document'-object.
If you want javascript error-codes, I will replace the workarounds, that
produce only visual errors, on demand.

I checked it against Netscape 7.2 - there is no problem like this, everything is
fine; also before I got Firefox 1.0-final, I've used Firefox 1.0-preview without
problems.

If it's possible to erase the 'document'-object manually, I would prefer to
track down the problem with a Firefox with a locked 'document'-object, before I
get flame for bad or crude coding style.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. goto www.indextrack.com
2. look into one of the demo-accounts
3. logout

Actual Results:
every iframe ha lost it's document (maybe except the 'content'-frame')


Expected Results:
provide a 'document'-object, that isn't null
