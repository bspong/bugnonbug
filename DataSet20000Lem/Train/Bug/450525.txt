Invalid Request - this issue is present on Mac OSX & Wintel XP/Vista, and is related to improper header construction required to clear cache with sending POST form information (GET works, all others fail)

instance #1 MACOSX - POST action of a form cause "Invalid Request" in cache proxy (Squid)
instance #2 WINXP - POST action of a form cause "Invalid Request" response from internet server when using _xmlHttpRequest_ (localhost work fine)

NOTE: this issue is probably linked to the "Invalid verb" error arising from WINXP/VISTA "OneCare" family secuirty package recently attached to "enhancement" updates. They are NOT the same error, but that are both malformed header info related.

http://www.mnot.net/javascript/xmlhttprequest/cache.html - see the bottom of the page. If the browser ha either of the afore mentioned "invalid Request" responses, they WILL fail the "invalidations" similar a follows:
* Request-URI: fail (POST to Request URI did not invalidate the cache.)
* Content-Location: fail (POST to Content-Location did not invalidate the cache.)
* Location: fail (POST to Location did not invalidate the cache.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. MACOSX requires failure to POST through cache server intermediate (to isolate error)
2. WINXP requires failure to POST to an internet server when using _xmlHttpRequest_
3. WINXP/VISTA may require INSTALLING MS OneCare Family Securty to reproduce (will also reproduce "Invalid verb" response)
Actual Results:
see above.
It is possible that the situation itself may not be able to be replicated on a different MACOSX system.
Victoria State Library in Melbourne, Australia ha multiple machine should someone require visual confirmation or technical detail (like data capture by network administrators)

Expected Results:
MACOSX - cache info on POST data need to be correctly invalidated (ie. passed through the cache)
WINXP - should perform POST in IDENTICAL fashion when using _xmlHttpRequest_ object via JavaScript

This will need data capture to manually validate header construction, a there may just be a "false EOL" terminator present if header are valid, which is not likely, a invalidation of POST data is not supplying the correct header info to caches.

I have 3 machine (MACOSX) with Safari along with 100 or so WINXP machine with IE 6 & FF 2.0.0.1 running fine through a cache server (SQUID - squid/2.7.STABLE2)

FF 2.0.0.14 on WinXP fails to POST via _xmlHttpRequest_
