After force quitting a session (multiple windows,with multiple tab & apptabs,Library open a well) due the browser hanging (likely cause,a script slowing down Firefox), by killing plugincontainer.exe in the task manager and then hitting the close button at the top right of a window,Firefox ha shut down unexpectedly (only one window had to be closed),on subsequent restart no session restore option wa given:there wa no hyperlink on the home page,no active "restore previous session" entry in the history menu (it wa greyed out),therefore only the apptabs and the home page were actually restored,all previous window and tab were lost.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start a session with multiple window and tabs,and open the Library
2.Somehow cause the browser to display the "continue script\stop script" warning,or make the browser hang
3.Trying to close Firefox,since menu don't work anymore,kill plugincontainer in the task manager,then hit the close button to force quit
Actual Results:
The whole browser shuts down,then on restart the session is lost:no restore session option is visible in the home page,"restore previous session entry" in history menu is greyed out,only the home page (without hyperlink) and the apptabs are displayed.

Expected Results:
Only the window which wa forced to quit should have closed,not the whole browser:as the next step,session restore should have been available on restart,allowing to reopen all window and tabs.

Browser wa hanging,probably because of some script or flash plugin issue.
