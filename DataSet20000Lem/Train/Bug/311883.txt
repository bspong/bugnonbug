Copy and Paste - Bug in Firefox

(Different versions, different OS)

See also: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220900


Situation:

Copy and paste between different tab or window doe not work at all (100%).
This problem doe not affect other applications, just firefox. It seems that the
clipboard is deleted (for security reasons?!) when swiching from one tab/window
to another, but not when working with external programs...

System:

WinXP_Pro_SP1, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12)
Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (happened in the earlier version I had installed
2), Extensions: DOM Inspector, Wikipedia, Greasemonkey, CopyPlainText (tried is
a a solution for the copy and paste problem), RoboForm;

Unsuccessful tries:

1.Reinstalling after cleaning all data from previous installs
2.New User Profile
3.Open Clipboard
4.CopyPlainText (tried is a a solution for the copy and paste problem)
5.Work only with Firefox Windows, not with tab
6.Upgrade to Firefox 1.0.7
7.Playing around with security setting

----

Suggested workarounds thus far (comment #142):

1. Open the current page in a new window (I usually just open any page in a new
window and check copy/paste there).

2. Start -> Run -> clipbrd.exe (Clipboard Viewer)

3.Copy from one tab, paste in note/text/any-pad, swich to the new pad, copy from
anypad and paste it. This only work if I swich window before the second copy
and paste, otherwise the clipboard is blank again

4.Work with one instance of firefox and do all copy and paste operation from or
2 opera...

5.Drag and Drop sometimes work too...

6.Minimizing Windows and maximizing doe work sometimes...

7. Copying a large amount of text in the clipboard doe the trick too, sometimes...

----

Solution:


Best solution would be an extension, which work like the clipboard and is
integrated in the right click pull down, a this would give developer enough
time to solve the problem while keeping firefox attractive for users. Added
functionality could include an auto-archive function, a litte database - main
criterion should be fast and ressource friendly running...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox and create two tabs/windows
2.Copy and paste from one window
3.Change windows/tabs
4.Try to paste which doe not work, because the moment you swiched tab the
clipboard content is erased...

Actual Results:
Paste doe not work, because the moment you swich tab the clipboard content is
erased...

Expected Results:
Paste it baby, please...
