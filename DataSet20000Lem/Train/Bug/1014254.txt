Back button becomes disabled (and back/forward functionality breaks), after activating a share provider & customizing Share button away
Created attachment 8426556
My reduced prefs.js file that trigger this

I don't know exactly what got me into this state, but this afternoon I noticed that my "forward" button wa never showing up. Still happened with safe mode.

When I hacked away at my prefs.js file, I ended up in a state where back/forward functionality became completely broken.

I'm attaching the reduced prefs.js file, which just contains 3 entries:
browser.uiCustomization.state
social.activeProviders
social.manifest.getpocket-com
which I've left at their value from my normal browsing profile. (Unlike in bug 1014238, I haven't intentionally messed with any of these prefs.)

STR:
1. Run firefox (nightly) with a fresh profile, using the attached prefs.js file.
2. Visit mozilla.org, and click through some links, to establish some history.
3. Try to go back.
4. Try to enter Customize mode. (e.g. by right-clicking toolbar and picking "Customize")

ACTUAL RESULTS:
- Back button is non-functional (grayed out). If you right-click the page, the "Back"/"Forward" context-menu entry are also disabled.
- Customize mode render a a blank page.


NOTE: The symptom here are slightly different from those in bug 1014238. In particular, the hamburger menu work here, and the "customize" toolbar-contextmenu-option doe have an effect here, though it just end up opening a blank page.
