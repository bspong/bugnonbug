Intermittent loss of tabbar functionality with middle-clicking link
I've been seeing this for awhile now, but haven't had any good STR. Talking to Gijs on IRC, it sound like he's seen similar issue from time to time.

Every now and then (unpredictably), when I middle-click a link to open in a new tab, nothing happens on the tab bar and from then on, the tab bar is "frozen". I can click on and switch to different tabs, but the focus doesn't change. If I close a tab via Ctrl+W, the tab bar remains frozen and clicking on the remaining tab becomes unpredictable with respect to what it'll switch to.

It only affect the one active window (I'm often running two window on different screen and the other is unaffected). The only way to fix it is to restart the browser. I have 5 pinned tab in case it matters. I have new tab opened from link set to open in the background.

Gijs also had me get a little output from the console when it's in this state:

TypeError: this.selectedItem is null @ tabbrowser.xml:3386
TypeError: this.mCurrentBrowser is null @ tabbrowser.xml:2764

gBrowser.selectedTab
XULElement {owner: null, linkedBrowser: XULElement, _tPos: 7, _animStartTime: 0, _fullyOpen: true, tmp: Object, _selected: true, _endRemoveArgs: null, className: "tabbrowser-tab", align: ""}

gBrowser.selectedBrowser
null
