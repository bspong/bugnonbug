It is vital to be able to set your browser to delete history when closed or "save 0 day history for security reasons. It is very useful to have the visited link color change when doing a search of visiting several link on a page. Suggesting that if you want to be able to distinguish visited link with a color differential or a check mark you have to save history is NOT a fix.. it is a workaround without fixing the problem and present the obvious security risk. The solution would be to allow visited link color selection somewhere in option that would NOT compromise the security of auto deleting history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set history to 0
2.do a search and visit a site
3.return to search and visited site will not be distinguishable.
Actual Results:
the visited site show no change.

Expected Results:
allow me to select what color I want the visited site to show a or a check mark on a visited site without having to save history.

This requires an actual CHANGE not a work-around. hey if the evil empire can do it Mozilla should be able to.
I'm checking the security box below because it IS a compromise to a user security but not in the usual sense of a code exploit. Now that most people are in a 'always logged on' system rather than having to dial up and log on each time it is incumbent upon u to fix this security problem.
Now I know this ha been reported for a long time but the problem is that is ha never been FIXED.. it ha just been worked around. Perhaps that is because it is not recognized a the security issue it is thus not prioritized.
