See below:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the URL => Popup:
You have chosen to open <filename>.pdf
which is a: Portable Document Format from: <url>
What should Firefox do...?
(*) Open with firefox3
() Save File
2a. If you accept the "Open with firefox3" option, an error message appears.
A screenshot of the two popups is attached (error1.png).
Alternative:
2b. Instead of accepting "firefox3", select "Other" from the list. in the file
browser, immediately click "Cancel".
=> Now, the default is magically correct: /usr/bin/xpdf (default).
See attached screenshot error2.png.
Actual Results:
The first default "firefox3" is wrong and not functional at all.
After browsing for "Other" application --- without selecting any ---, the correct default pdf handler is shown.

Expected Results:
I expect to see the correct default application immediately (i.e. popup error2.png appearing immediately after step 1).
