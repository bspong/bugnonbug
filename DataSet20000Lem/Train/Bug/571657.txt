Reproducable situation: My ISP requires me to log in via VPN. If there's no VPN connection, all website request are redirected to a site that tell me to use the VPN client. However, when I then create the VPN connection and want to now load the page I wanted to see, the ISP's info-site is shown again, instead of now showing the "real" page. Other website of a different domain load just fine, and if I first connect to VPN and then start Firefox, or restart Firefox after connecting via VPN, the page I initially wanted to visit load just fine.

The same problem did not appear on Firefox 3.5 on a Linux platform, and doe not appear with Safari on this Mac.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use an ISP that redirects you to another page when you aren't logged in via ISP.
2. Start Firefox
3. Load a page
4. ISP redirects you to his info-site
5. Connect via VPN a told by the ISP
6. Hit refresh, or retype the URL, or open a new tab and retype the URL
Actual Results:
You'll still get the ISP's info site

Expected Results:
Want to see the "real" site, not the ISP's info site

My internet connection usually work a follows:
1) My ISP provides my with a wireless router to which I connect. It run some special Linux-based OS and ha NO WPA/WEP password: It's basically open access
2) However, just logging on to the wireless router doe not give you internet access. If you try to visit a website, it redirects you to a site where the ISP tell you what to do
3) Using a Cisco VPN client, you have to connect to the ISP's VPN server. Only then do you get access to the internet.

WORKAROUND: Restart Firefox once the VPN connection is established. Just hitting refresh, or retyping the URL, will NOT help.
