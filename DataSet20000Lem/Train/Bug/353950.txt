Attempts to go to this page cause a completely crashed browser. The window itself and all tab are accessible but you cannot move from tab to tab. If another window is open, you can go to that window and move from tab to tab a the second window still responds. However, the frozen window is very badly frozen. Attempts to close only the nonresponding also fail a the "Close open tabs?" window come up, asking if you if you want to close all tab in that window. However, the "close tabs?" dialog is frozen and locked. In general, it cannot be clicked, but even when rarely you can click it, it doe not respond to clicks. The only solution is to completely close out the broswer.

In addition, this page hard-locks both Opera 8.54 and Internet Explorer 6.0 - ie, the page crash all known browser on my system. There are a tremendous # of tag on that page, and I think the huge number of tag is just chocking all of the browsers. However, someone can access the page, since I got a referral to my blog from there. I believe this is similar to an old bug from 2004 about FF freezing on del.icio.us page with excessive tags: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=319828
