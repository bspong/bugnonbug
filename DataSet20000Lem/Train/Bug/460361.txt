Firefox crash everytime a file is downloaded.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3

Everytime I download a file, any file, with Firefox, it crash when it attempt to scan for viruses. The file itself is downloaded OK, but when the 'Downloads' window say "Scanning for viruses", it freezes, then Firefox completely crashes. I can't end Firefox session and close it down, even using Windows Task Manager, so I have to log off Windows, or turn off PC to close Firefox. I have Norton Internet Security 2009 installed on my PC, but I also have it installed with Firefox on another Vista PC, and do not experience this problem on that one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download any file with virus scanning enabled.
2.Have Norton Internet Security 2009 installed on Vista PC.
3.



I doubt many can reproduce this bug, because, like I said, I have more-or-less the exact same configuration of Firefox instaled on another Vista PC, with Norton Internet Security, and that doe not crash when scanning for viruses. I have no idea why this Firefox on this PC is crashing.
