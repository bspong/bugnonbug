Firefox 3.6 Mac OS X will not launch or exibits strange behavior on Open Directory based logins (home directory hosted on AFP server)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier:

I recently upgraded a couple test workstation for our office to Firefox 3.6. The workstation are in the following configuration:

*Mac OS X 10.4.11 PowerPC and Intel workstations. Latest 2009-003 Security updates.
*Workstations store their home directory on an AFP file server (Open Directory roaming login). The AFP Server and the Open Directory master server is running Mac OS X Server 10.62 with the newest security patch.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Firefox 3.57 worked perfectly fine on these systems. However when a non-administrator log into their workstation with their Open Directory Login and attempt to open Firefox 3.6 the following occurs. This is irregardless if they are running on an Intel or PowerPC Mac:

Actual Results:
*The Program will bounce on the dock and will refuse to open.
*The program will open but will show only the Firefox pull down menu. You can quit the program, but no other menu show. The web browser window will not open.
*The program will open for half a second or two and will then quit.


Expected Results:
The software should show the regular Firefox session a it did before in previous versions. 3.6 is totally broken and will not work on AFP hosted home directories.


This ha happened before with previous version of Firefox (I believe a security update to the 3.0 build, don't remember which version had the issue). This also might be causing issue with user who have their profile stored on NFS or SMB file server a well.
