RFE: Need a window with information about the connection, proxy used and other detail
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I don't even know if this is possible. With that reservation made:

It would be very useful if Firefox (and other apps in the Mozilla family) could
display information about the connection used. Example of such information would
be (external/public) ip used for this request, which proxy used for this page
and similar.

I currently debug a quite complex PAC-script, which us two SSH sock tunnel
and two regular http-proxies to access two intranet and the public internet.

When I get error message it would be very helpful if I could see that Firefox
used the sock proxy on port 1080 when it downloaded the html of a certain page
(and possibly another sock proxy for an object on the page if that applies) and
that the server see it a the client us IP 123.45.67.89.

Reproducible: Always




I think this information could be available through the Page info window,
something like:

Name Type Address Proxy Ext. IP
