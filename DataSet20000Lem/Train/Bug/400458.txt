java plugin (jre1.6.0_u03) is installed but not recognized, firefox say additional plugins are required.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.8) Gecko/20071008 Firefox/2.0.0.8

The example site above, and others that require java to display the page correctly
do not display correctly. The browser tool bar say "additional plugins are
required to display all the medium on this page." Various box on the page e.g.
the upper left corner, which should display moving menu or advertisement instead
say "click here to download plugin." Clicking here take you to the sun java site
and invite you to install the latest jre1.6.0_xx. The problem is that firefox
doe not understand that the plugin is installed and working. It doe not see
it and will not use it.
The plugin is installed correctly because the sun java site test say it is and
because the plugin work perfectly well with other browser e.g. opera and also
firefox 1.5.0.7 which I still have on the computer. I have never had a problem
with the plugin working with firefox 1.5 but have never had it work with
firefox 2.0.
Other details: I am using the kde3.5 desktop with slackware 11.0 (2.6.17 kernel.

2.go to the above referenced web site and observe.
3.
Actual Results:
web page is displayed but incorrectly. Several box are empty except for the
word "click here to download plugin.

Expected Results:
The empty box would normally have moving menu or other moving thing in
them. There should be no message about additional plugins.

I have updated java several time and updated the o several time but have not
had the problem occur with firefox 1.5. It wa only when I upgraded to firefox 2.0
that the problem occured.
I tend to do basic thing with the browser, no special theme and usually only
one window or tab open.
