When opening FF it fine, but a soon a I goto any page have it be google or myspace or hotmail, it either doe one of three things. It freeze completely to the point where I cant even press the "X" button. Nothing happens at all. Or if Im lucky It freeze and I receive the not responding message, or on a rare moment it just completely disappears and isint even in my task bar. I purposely leave my task bar open now so when it freeze I can close it down quick and get back to whatever I wa doing. I thank god for the "restore" session on FF2.0. I have to close down FF and reopen atleast 300 time per day. Its really aggrivating. Ive tried the support area, nothing seems to work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open
2. Type url in address bar or open bookmark.favorite
3. Says "loading" but never does.

Actual Results:
It say loading but obviously it not. The "icon" in the top left hand corner of the FF "bar" ha now turned into a white box instead of the usual icon. And when trying to press the "X" button, it say "program not responding. Heres the error signature, not sure if this will help:

szAppName : firefox.exe szAppVer : 1.8.20061.1023 szModName : hungapp
szModVer : 0.0.0.0 offset : 00000000



Expected Results:
Well I wa hoping it would actually not freeze and stop unresponding and load the page I typed in.

The bug still occur even after I changed to the default theme and it doesnt matter if i have Talkback enabled or disabled, it still doing it. I dont know what track trace is, sorry.
