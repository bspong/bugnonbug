In the website noted above there are many page with thumbnail that load image into a main DIV. This is done with an "id" on DIV or IMG. The image load correctly, however, when the back or forward button (either on the mouse or the browser) are clicked nothing happens. The address change in the address bar to show the page_name.htm#image_name, but the corresponding image doe not reappear. If one continues to click (forward or back) enough times, then the browser go to the previous or next page.

This problem wa posted in the general section of mozillazine forum in October 2008. Jefferson Scher put together a "quick and dirty" javascript that partially solved the problem but which cause other more distracting issues. I am posting this a a bug a I would like to resolve this problem; while that post ha been visited more than 400 time no one else ha offered any suggestion(s) or solutions.
