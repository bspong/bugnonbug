I have a problem since upgrading to Firefox 1.5. I have had my hotkey set on my LX700 to open a few webpages. Some are to a specific page, others to a normal .com address. Ever since upgrading to 1.5, if I use my hotkeys while Firefox is closed they open properly. If firefox is already opened and I use one of the hotkeys it cut off the last character in the URL. It act the same with each webpage I have tried for different hotkeys. I also downloaded the newest Set Point software with the same results. I do have the browser set to open these new page a tab not a seperate windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. If any hotkey is set and firefox 1.5 is already opened
2. Pages are set to open a new tab
3. The new link get the last character in the URL cut off.

Actual Results:
Page doe not load. I get the new Problem loading page.

Expected Results:
I would except the last character of the URL not be cut off and the page to load properly.

I have added another / on the end of my .com website for the time being to get them to load properly each time. Either .com or .com/ but with the one set to go to a certain page they will fail with a / on the end.
