If the bookmark file is not available when Firefox start (ie is deleted or if
on a disconnected network drive), the Firefox window bounce up or down, or
shimmy up and down. This occurs whether the bookmark sidebar is displayed or
not.

I can also confirm bug 251692. My bookmark are on a network drive. One of my
PCs had trouble connecting to that drive. I'd opened Firefox (it started to
shimmy), followed by Windows explorer. I then clicked on the missing drive,
which restored the connection. I then exited Firefox, which wrote a blank
bookmark file over top of my shared bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Delete bookmarks.html and bookmarks.bak
2.Start Firefox
3.

Actual Results:
Firefox showed a blank bookmark sidebar.
The firefox window shimmied, ie everything below the title bar bounced up and
down slightly. It wa like the menu bar height increased and decreased at half
second intervals.

Expected Results:
Firefox should show a blank bookmark sidebar.
The window should have been steady.
Firefox should not overwrite a bookmark file with a blank file if the blank file
wa created because a drive mapping did not exist when firefox started but wa
restored before Firefox exited.

My drive mapping problem wa due to an improper entry in my Hosts file. That's
fixed now so drive map properly on login. I restored my bookmark file from a
backup so nothing wa lost.
