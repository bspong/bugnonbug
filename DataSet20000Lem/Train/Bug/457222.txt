This is not in the batch operation, this is in single photo mode. Firefox doesn't remember the last group you added a photo to (in a current "send to group" session) but MSIE does. Each time you send a photo to a group and then click "send to group" again to send to another group, the drop down reappears, but display the beginning of the alphabetised list, it doe not go down to the last group you assigned the photo to like it doe in in MSIE.

Also, when in "send to group" drop down, FF won't let allow page up/down key to scroll through the drop down, it move the whole page. But in MSIE it move just the drop down.

Not sure if the two issue are related so I put them both here.

I started another report for the "page up/down key" issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open individual photo
2. Click "add to groups"
3. Add to any group, prefferably down a few page scroll
4. Click all confirmation button to return to photo
5. Click "add to groups"
6. Notice list start at the top, doe not at the group you last chose.
Actual Results:
The drop down doe not reappear showing the last group chosen, it just start at the top.

Expected Results:
In MSIE, when the drop down reappears, it scroll down to the last group you added the photo to.
