When clicking the Firefox icon on the QuickLaunch bar multiple time quickly, the first few window are 'broken' (i.e., not completely functional) while the second set are completely normal. For example, the homepage is not loaded on startup, the back, forward, reload, and stop option in the context menu always remain gray and the same option on the navigation bar remain non-functional.

Also, if add-on are installed that can optionally add to the context menu, all option that could be added are added despite contrary preferences.

If you do the same process but with at least one Firefox window already open,
the window all open correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure that Firefox is not open
2. Quickly, try opening Firefox multiple time
3. Try using some of the first window opened
Actual Results:
Some of the first window opened are 'broken'. Add-on preference are ignored for adding to the context menu.

Expected Results:
All window opened should be completely functional. Add-on preference should be loaded correctly for each window.

Tested with the same result in: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032620 Firefox/3.0b5
