Hi,
I use Windows Vista sp2 (up-to-date). A problem come back from time to time, there is no process to reproduce this for sure. somestimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't.
Downloads are treated in two step by firefox: the file download + a treatment (file scanning or whatever).
My problem is my downloads reach 100% without any problem. However, during the scanning process or whatever (don't know what it doe exactly) I get an error "source file cannot be read" and it fails.
That's particularly strange a 100% of the file ha been downloaded to my hard drive! In some way, it cause me to loose data.
Thank you for your help.
Bertrand

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Have tried to reproduce it but cannot find any real process to do it.
1/ Today, I started my computer, opened firefox, and the first download of the day (service pack here: http://www.softmaker.com/english/servofw10_en.htm) failed.
2/ usually, this come back when two or three have just made.
*SOLUTION*
The solution, which is not great, is to close and restart firefox. When I close firefox, everything is cleared automatically (history etc etc).
However, it is important to remind that the problem occured on the first download this mornig. so, I don't believe it ha something do with a full cache [browser cache], a the download wa the first and only of use of firefox. and it wa a 10 MB download. Not really a big file.
*WEBSITE*
Each time I have had this problem, I tried to download the same file from Internet Explorer and it worked perfectly.
Actual Results:
read above

Expected Results:
successful download a 100% of the file had been download

The last time I had the problem, it came everyday for a week. And, today, hadn't had the problem for three weeks.
