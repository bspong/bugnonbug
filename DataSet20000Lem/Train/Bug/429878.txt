After installing the 2.0.0.13 update, I noticed a problem in the streaming of flash contents.

It worked without bug for a few day than began to bug.

When trying to play video (like on www.youtube.com) or sound (as on www.deezer.com) in streaming, these play during two or three second (in "mute mode") than freeze while the buffer continues to load proprely.

It make these content unreadable.

Re-booting neither Firefox neither the computer fix the problem.

The problem is not systematic but happens really often.
Sometimes, in rebooting firefox, the first video I try to watch work correctly, but than the second bug again.

The update to 2.0.0.14 doesn't fix the problem.

It seems to be a compatibility issue between the last update of FF and the last update of Flash Player, a uninstalling both Firefox and Flash player to get back to older version fix the bug.

Please note that I don't have neither a firewall neither an antivirus resident protection that would disallow any content to be played. In addition, notice that this happened first a I had watched video all the day without any problem and without changing nothing to my config.

Hope you'll find the way to fix that bug : It's pretty annoying and force me to use IE7.0 to watch videos.
