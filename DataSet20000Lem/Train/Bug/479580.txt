Evironment variable $JAVA_HOME is correctly set to /local/java/jdk1.6.0/

which javaws

correctly return /local/java/jdk1.6.0/bin/javaws

Though everything is set up perfectly, firefox-3 is not able to suggest
/local/java/jdk1.6.0/bin/javaws a the program to open jnlp files.

That mean that the user ha to navigate through the file directory to
find javaws.

Immaging javaws would be in a large folder like /usr/bin/ or /bin/ ,
the file chooser would remain unresponsive for many seconds.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla_keep

2. Launch a Java Webstart application (extension .jnlp)


Actual Results:
The user is asked for the application to open the jnlp file
However, there is no suggestion generated by firefox

Expected Results:
When Firefox asks it should make an intelligent suggestion.
It should use
1. Shell variable
2. $(which javaws) shell command or $PATH
3. In case of MS-Windows typical installation site of MS-Windows
4. The user should have the possibility to type paths. This is important because executables often reside in directory with huge amount of file which cannot be accessed by graphical file selectors. This text field may have tab-completion.
