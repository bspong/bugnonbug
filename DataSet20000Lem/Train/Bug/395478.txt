I often have three browser window with several tab and Firefox/SessionManager usually fails to load the complete session. Two window are loaded correctly, but the window in the middle of the Windows task bar is completely empty (white). It
doe not even show the menu bar. I guess, there is some kind of deadlock
situation.

First, I thought it might be the session manager plug-in, then I discovered that session restore work sometimes if I disable the HTML validator plug-in. However, after further testing, this issue doe not seem to be related to the two plug-in at all a the deadlock(?) situation can be reproduced by even deactivating both plug-ins.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the start-up option to "Show my window and tab from last time"
2. Open three browser windows, go to the http://www.apache.org/ website and open the project from "HTTP server" to "Directory" in separate tab of the first window, from "Excalibur" to "Labs" in separate tab in the second window, and from "Lenya" to "Perl" in separate tab of the third window.
3. Close Firefox and restart
Actual Results:
After startup, one window is blank (interestingly, in my case it wa always the one with the project from "Excalibur" to "Labs") and doe not even show the menu bar.

If the session is restored correctly, repeat step 3 of above.

Expected Results:
After startup, all window should be restored correctly.
