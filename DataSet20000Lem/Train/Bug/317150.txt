While authoring an AJAX based ACL controller for a web-application I wa writing; I noticed that the form would not submit unless it wa interacted with first. For example, I would have to click the form submission button twice or interact with a selection box before Mozilla will complete the submission.

There are unforunately a lot of possibities for error and a lot of finger to point at when reporting an error such a this so I have attempted to be dilligent a possible.

1. I used Venkman to step through the code; it appears a though onsubmit isn't calling the appropriate handler in (the now infamous) prototype.js; the cause is uncertain but this is about a far a I could debug things.
2. I tested using IE 6.0, and Opera 8.5 (Build 7700), both did not exhibit the failure mode.
3. I downloaded the newest FireFox daily build (v1.7.12, downloaded 19-Nov-2005 15:17) and it too displayed the failure mode.
4. I reproduced the failure mode a well with Mozilla suite v1.7.12.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://www.husney.com:8081/admin/acl
2. Click "Delete Role", DOM will change slightly, form will NOT submit. This is the primary failure mode.
3. Click "Delete Role" again. Form WILL submit. All other form submission will likewise succeed after this point.
4. Press reload.
5. Click a submit button for any other form element; form will NOT submit.
6. Click the same or any other submit button and form will submit.

Actual Results:
1. Web page loads.
2. Form doe not submit, DOM add extra linebreak after form; Venkman show that callback registered to take place AFTER AJAX call is being called. Submission appears to be skipped.
3. Form submits correctly. All other page element update correctly.
4. Page reloads.
5. Identical result to #2, above.
6. Identical result to #3, above.

Expected Results:
All form element should have submitted, the first time, when a form submit button is clicked.

I have no additional information at this time.
