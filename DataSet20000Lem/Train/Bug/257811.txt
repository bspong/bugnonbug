This happens to certain "secure" site and doesnt happend to certain other
sites. Goto any random site like google. Then goto some page which ha SSL. The
location bar turn yellow. A lock appears in the location bar and status bar.
Now click on back button and then forward button. When you return back to SSL
enabled page, all the indication mentioned before of a secure site are gone.

I have observed this behaviour on site which are using 128 bit incription. On
site like updates.mozilla.org this behaviour is not seen

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://www.sf.net
2. Click on "Login Via SSL".
3. The login page is displayed. Protocol is https, the address bar is yellow,
with a lock symbol in address bar and status bar
4. Click the back button
5. Click the Forward button
6. Same login page is displayed. This time the protocol is correctly displayed
a "https" but the colour of address bar is white now a of any normal page. The
lock in address bar and status bar do not appear

Actual Results:
The Secure page is displayed a if it unsecure one. The Security tab on
Pageinfo say that the site is not encrypted

Expected Results:
All the SSL related visual clue should be displayed

Also visible on few more site eg
