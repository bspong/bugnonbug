On occasion after long system standby (only in Windows Vista), Firefox would no longer respond to any webpage request even if there is an Internet connection. (By this, I mean trying to load any web pages) The only way to get Firefox working again is to restart the browser. (Killing Firefox.exe and then restarting it will save the tab prior to crashing but this problem recurs continuously after some long system standbys.
This doe not happen however, if the system were to be left on overnight or while the system wa on without interruption.
