if I try to open my FIDO mobile phone bill at fido.ca the bill doe not open. Fido state that I have to use IExplorer with the Adobe Reader plugin but I find Firefox 3 Beta2 to be a much superior browser (multiple tabs, much faster opening sites, etc) that I cringe each time I have to use IExplorer. Also all the plugins will download but not install (compatability? they worked in Beta 1). It would be nice to be able to use the one I wa using in Beta 1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to www.fido.ca
2.login to "my account" with name & password
3.highlight "My Account" to view current month's bill w/details
Actual Results:
work quickly & flawlessly until it open the bill page. Then it display only the actual total in text mode with no other information.

Expected Results:
To see each page a if in print form

Perhaps if an adobe reader plugin wa available it would work. It used to work in earlier version of Firefox and work with other browser such a Opera and IExplorer, both have Adobe reader plugins
