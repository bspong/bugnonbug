FF 0,9x hang and consumes 100% of CPU time
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

When I enter the above web site, occasionally Mozilla hang and never returns.
In task manager I see it doe not respond and consumes all CPU cycles.
The probability that this occurs increase significantly with the number of
other web site I have visited. After let's say 4 or 5 other web sites, I nearly
get a 100% lock up.

There is also a safe way to get a hang on this site. After entering via the
above URL, visit the first thread with the link
http://www.wallstreet-online.de/si/community/board/threadpages.php?&woid=00019277&m=1.1.6.1.0&k=ADVANCED+MICRO+DEVICES+INC&cat=STK&tid=812310&fid=10&offset=0&woid=00019277&k=ADVANCED+MICRO+DEVICES+INC&page=-1
then (you need to be a registered user) click in "Antwort schreiben" (submit a
response) to create your own message in the thread. Out of 5 tries, I got 5
hang regardless of the number of web page visited before.

Note that the NT version I use is 4.0, 1381, Service Pack 6.
This ha first occurred with FF 0.9, and continues to do so. It never occured in
previous versions.
I also use FF 0.9x on Windows 98 and XP and NEVER have any Problems with this page.
After some research I found similar bug report but for other pages. I decided
to create a new bug since I am not sure if that this one is related.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF 0.9x
2. enter

CPU time. Only way to stop it is via task manager.

No hang, page displayes properly :-)
