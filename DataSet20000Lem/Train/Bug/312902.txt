This is a weird bug to explain, but it seems quite reproduceable.
Basically, if you enter a url without the file extension on a PHP file (I
haven't tried any other types), firefox still navigates to the page. I don't
know if this is supposed to be a feature, or if it a bug.
For example, http://aspa.swcconsulting.ca/calendar.php exists, and if I go to
http://aspa.swcconsulting.ca/calendar, I see calendar.php.

The weird part is if you add non-existant subdirectory after the filename, it
still find the PHP file, but display it without style or image (basically it
break all the client-side file references, although PHP includes are fine).
So, if you go to http://aspa.swcconsulting.ca/calendar/gibberish, you see
calendar.php without any image or styles.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://aspa.swcconsulting.ca/calendar.php
2. Go to http://aspa.swcconsulting.ca/calendar
3. Go to http://aspa.swcconsulting.ca/calendar/gibberish

Actual Results:
1. calendar.php display properly
2. calendar.php display properly
3. calendar.php display without style or image

Expected Results:
1. calendar.php display properly
2. calendar.php display properly (if it a feature), 404 error message (if this
is a bug)
3. 404 error message
