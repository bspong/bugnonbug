Implement de-duping/merging multiple link provider for Directory Tiles
This bug is the implementation followup of bug 988447. It should implement a few of the more basic de-duping strategy outlined in that bug.

Acceptance criteria:

1. Exact duplicate of directory tile and browsed-to tile should not exist. In other words, if a page that is a direct duplicate of a visible Directory Tile gain a high enough frecency score to be shown, it will not be shown, but the Directory Tile will suffice a that site's representation.

2. For non-exact matches, both of natural site with Directory Tile and natural site with each other, redirects and similar URLs will be identified and de-duped. For instance, ebay.com = www.ebay.com = http://wwww.ebay.com/loggedin=refererfirefox = etc. If the page navigated to is the same to users, they should not produce duplicate in new tab. This will be particularly important on site with logins, such a Gmail. Currently, we should the whole URL string instead of title for some logged out page ( http://cl.ly/image/211a3X143o1T and http://cl.ly/image/0r1j21070Y13 ), when what we should be showing is simply Gmail.

#2 will likely involve some discussion between eng and ux on how to recognize and how to de-dup given technical constraints. That discussion can happen in this bug.
