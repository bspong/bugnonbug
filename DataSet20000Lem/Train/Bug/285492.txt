Flash Plugin doe not display preloader

At http://www.flashplayer.com and many other site that display flash
animations, the Preloaders, which are the loading screen for animations, are
not displayed. However, when it is fully loaded, the document is then displayed.
I'm not sure whether this is a problem with the plug-in or the browser. This is
not the case with Internet Explorer, and you may refer to that to see what I'm
talking about. This isn't a huge matter, but quite annoying when you have no
idea how much time is left. This problem seems strange to me because the
preloader is part of the animation, and should normally be displayed the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225
Firefox/1.0.1)"
2.Type "http://www.flashplayer.com"
3.In the search box near the top right, type in "decline" and click "Search"
4.Click on the first link that pop up, "The Decline of Video Gaming 2-
Presented by Flash Player"
5.Click on the picture to the left of the "The Decline of Video Gaming 2" title.

Actual Results:
I arrived at the bottom of a webpage with a blank white square surrounded by
black. The white is where the preloader should be. The animation is shown when
done loading.

Expected Results:
Shown a colorful animated loading bar before the animation.

I have the latest version of the plugin installed.
