Firefox wa loading http://roelschroeven.net/search/ (I used that a my home page). It contains image from google.com, en.wikipedia.org, nl.wikipedia.org, dict.org, w3.org. The page itself and all of the image except for the one from w3c.org were already loaded; Firefox wa still working on the image from w3c.org (apparently W3C's web server wa down or very slow).

At that moment, the status bar read "Transferring data from www.dict.org" even though Firefox wa at that time clearly transferring data from w3.org, not from dict.org.

I've seen that behavior numerous time before (both in Linux and Windows), but never a clear and obvious a now, so that's why I only report the bug now.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find or make a page with images, where one of the image is hosted on a very slow webserver.
2. Load that page.
3. Watch how the status bar mention the domain of the previous domain, instead of the one Firefox is currently downloading (or trying to) from.
Actual Results:
The status bar mention the domain of the previous domain.

Expected Results:
The status bar should mention the domain Firefox is currently downloading (or trying to) from.
