I've noticed that when I type in type box on various website (myspace, blogger, even right now I'm screen shotting this box) the blinking type line display in the incorrect place in the lettering and the spacing is off. This only happens on my Macbook, not on my Macbook Pro or else I would list steps. I attached several screenshots of this happening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in text box
2. After 3-4 sentences, type line start backtracking. Even though you've typed in the letters, you can't see the last 3-4 letter you typed because the blinker hasn't caught up yet.
3.
Actual Results:
Type tool doe not catch up resulting in you misspelling word because you can't see what you've typed. Whatever bug is causing this also cause HTML text on different website to have spacing/weight issues. See attachments.

Expected Results:
Type tool should be up to date character to character.

I have ton of screenshots I can e-mail. I'm used to using Bugzilla at work where I can attach them, but here there is no space for it.
