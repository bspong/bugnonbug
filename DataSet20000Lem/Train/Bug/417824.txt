Just trying out the 3 beta 3 and discovered this new white-listing behavior for the 'allow script to move or resize existing windows' pref,which is fine, but it prevents one's own 'bookmarklets' that resize and reposition window to stop working.

These bookmarklets are indispensable for web development and just organizing one's own windows. Here's an example of one:

javascript:self.resizeTo(1064,1094);self.moveTo(459,0);

Though I don't disagree with the new white listing feature, it should probably be a user options, or there need to be some way of white-listing these local bookmarklets, or a check box to allow them to work.
