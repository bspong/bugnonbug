Pressing ESC abort open XMLHttpRequests in Firefox. This doesn't happen in other browser (except in WebKit, but only if the XHR wa initiated before the page finished loading).

Aborting XHRs on ESC is a bad idea for at least two reasons:

1. Most AJAX application don't retry requests; if a user hit ESC during an XHR, they might see broken behavior.

2. This make Comet-over-XHR more annoying to implement, requiring an event handler to capture all ESCs. (I know it's not absolutely necessary in a good implementation.)

I imagine there are a few application out there that like this behavior, but they probably have an "abort XHRs on ESC" handler installed for the other browsers. There's a good chance they might not even have to make any changes.

Reproducible: Always
