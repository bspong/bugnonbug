As you know there is an option in facebook to load more of news feed the more you scroll down by clicking the link "Older posts" on the left side of the end of the news feed page.
The more I scroll down (get older posts) the more firefox slows down. The text box of the "share boxes" - which are popping out by clicking the link "share" on the right bottom side of each post - are getting so slow that I can wait almost 30seconds after I finish writing a sentence to see the sentence in the textbox. Also the reaction and scrolling of ffirefox are getting slower.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to facebook and open news feed page
2.Get older post (after 5 time the lag occurs but after 7 time it's extremely lagging)
Actual Results:
Firefox slows down and lack on reaction speed.

Expected Results:
Should behave normally? As fast a ever..
