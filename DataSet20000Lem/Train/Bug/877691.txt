Firefox Nightly never restarts clean - must be reset everytime. proxy?
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20130525 Firefox/24.0 (Nightly/Aurora)
Build ID: 20130525062525

Steps to reproduce:

Retarted my PC or attempted to restart Firefox. Been happening for 3 day now.


Actual results:

Encounters an error restarting Firefox, can't send a report because it also change how Firefox detects my proxy settings. After failing to restart, have option to start in safe mode or reset. Safe mode doesn't fix the problem, I have to reset, and then instantly go to the Tools/Options/Advanced/Network/Settings and change from use system proxy setting to autodetect for this network in order to get out to the internet. That is why Firefox can't send a report itself. Then, I must go thru trying to add extensions, except I must be careful not to try to restart Firefox more than once or twice or everything must be reset again. Luckily it seems to be able to move my cookies, bookmarks, etc. - but not everytime. Having to set up Firefox everytime I restart it is a hassle.


Expected results:

Firefox should open, remembering all my setting from last time it wa open. It should also always default to detecting proxy setting for the network so it can send you a report of failures. I shouldn't have to live with readding extensions, and only one or two at that. Strongly considering ditching nightly 64bit use. Am on Windows 7 pro.
