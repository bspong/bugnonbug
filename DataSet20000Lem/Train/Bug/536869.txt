When I move the cursor in Firefox it display a small black bordered, white oblong shape below the foot of the cursor about half a second after the movement ends. This persists for four or five second and then disappears. If I move the cursor while the oblong is present the oblong doe not move and the cursor doe not get a new oblong when it stops. The size of the oblong is about half the width of the slider at the side and the height is about half the width. This doe not happen when using Thunderbird or any non-Mozilla application. It applies when the cursor is either arrow or text form.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move cursor

Actual Results:
Small oblong appeared after a pause and disappeared after a few seconds.

Expected Results:
No oblong

This seems to have appeared since I downloaded the latest version of Firefox. There have been occasional abort of Firefox, usually when the application is idle.
