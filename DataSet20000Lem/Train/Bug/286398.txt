tested with last nightly build of firefox:

this is a very old bug since month and can be reproduced on any version of
firefox / mozilla - but NOT on konqueror - konqueror ALWAYS show all below
link correctly.

the empty page bug is easily reproducable almost each time on fully w3c
validated page of my site's blog.

tested with Linux on SuSE Linux 9.2 full updated on regular basis without
positive effect on bug behavior - last update march 16th 2005

http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php

a well a ALL link on the CALENDER of the blog ( upper RIGHT o fabove page )
such a the URLs
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php/20050315
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php/20050314
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php/20050304
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php/20050302
and ALL other calender link with existing post

problem solving how to :

1. repeated reloading - up to dozen of time reloading MAY sometimes make the
text appear
2. resizing of firefox / mozilla ALWAYS make the text appear - even SMALLEST
move on resizing the browser window - just 1 milimeter or so let the text
being rendered by the browser!
3. then viewing the source of the EMPTY page - the page content ALWAYS is fully
present in the source window even if that page still is empty in browser window
4. it only concern the CENTER part of that page and all a.m. mentiond page
5. the page is composed by 3 template top + text body + bottom

furthermore

when using the URL
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php

and clicking on all link on top of page "Categories of previous posts:" EXCEPT
the chat link which is regular static HTML 4.01 page )
opening each link in a NEW TAB or new window
all tab are EMPTY ..
but
resizing the browser smallest amount - ALL TABS are displayed in FULL
when opening all a.m. link in new window - then each window need to be resized
seperately to make the text appear in browser


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load page http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php when post existing
2. or any of a.m. link in new tab or new window when today's post are missing
3.

Actual Results:
page BODY section empty each time
only top of page and sidebar displayed

Expected Results:
page to always be displayed

the page is displayed using MySQL / php and 3 template
one template for
- top of page and sidebar - always displayed
- actual text content - usually always missing when page loaded
- footer of page - always displayed

COULD it be that there is a MINOR ( microsecond or miliseconds ) delay of the 3
section composed by the 3 template and the browser engine ha a TIME frame
too narrow for all text / page component to *arrive* at the right time to be
rendered properly ??

just a NON-techie feeling ...


since i can NOT view my page - i hence can NOT test any feature of firefox on
my blog nor can my many firefox visitor see the blog section - unfortunately i
promote the firefox actively in newletters, post and the 5 forum with banner
display such a
http://www.kriyayoga.com/familyforum/gindex.html
or the firefox-button on page
http://www.kriyayoga.com/english/frames_index.html

i am actually punishing myself currently by telling surfer to use firefox or
mozilla
IE surfer appear to have no such problem
