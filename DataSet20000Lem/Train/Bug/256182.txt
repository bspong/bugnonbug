Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Access to property denied" code:

I think, the problem is, that the target of the form is a frame in a frameset,
which come from another server than the form. This may be correct in general,
but in this case the frame that should be altered ha the same originating
server. It contains some more frame all from that server, one of that
containing the sending form. I think, this is not a security law break.

The Form work in every other browser, even in the latest mozilla release, but
not in the 0.9.3 Version of firefox. I didn't test prior firefox versions.

I would be very glad, if you fix this but. For further questions, don't hesitate
to contact me by email.
