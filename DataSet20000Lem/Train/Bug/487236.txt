Occasionally Firefox 3.0.8 crash without warning when clicking a link that open in a new window

The last time I clicked a link from http://uk.freeads.net (see step to reproduce) which opened a photo in a new window in Firefox 3.0.8 it crashed Firefox without warning. Yet restoring Firefox to the original open tab and clicking the same link again then opened the window without problems. Even loading in Safe Mode did not create any other issues.
There is no crash report.
This problem ha only occurred in the last 2 version of Firefox and I have been using Firefox for many year now. I have become so frustrated with it that I have searched the Internet and Firefox for similar problem but nothing recently quite match my criteria.
All my AddOns load in the new version and are not creating any other issues.
Unfortunately it is not possible to narrow down the problem any further.
I have now changed the value of browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction in about:config from 2 to 0 so that opening the link now open it in a new tab.
I already have tool / option / tab set to open link that open a new window to open in a new tab but it seems that Firefox ignores this when the page author ha specified the window to open a specific size.
Links now open in a new tab. I shall monitor this and report back if the problem still arises.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://leisure.uk.freeads.net/health_+_fitness/therapy/8880/professional-californian-full-body-massage/view
2. Click on the large picture adjacent to text Professional Californian Full Body Massage.
3. When Javascript attempt to open the picture in a new smaller window in the top left of the screen Firefox crashes.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashed.

Expected Results:
On the second attempt after re-loading Firefox the window loaded without any problem and all a expected.

I could not find an event in Microsoft Administration Tools that wa relevant to the crash.
I have used the http://uk.freeads.net site for a good many year and have not experienced any problem in Firefox version 2 whatsoever.

I am using the following AddOns.
The one marked with a star are the more recent addition but they were certainly not added in Firefox 3.0.7 or 3.0.8 where the issue arises.

AdBlock Plus 1.0.1
AI Roboform Toolbar 6.9.93
British English Dictionary 1.19
Calling ID 1.1.0.80*
Change 0.0.0.10
Dafizilla Table2Clipboard 0.2.1
Finjan Secure Browsing 1.314*
FoxClocks 2.5.11
Google PageRankStatus 0.9.9
Handy Xtra Stuf 3.0.0
IE View 1.4.1
Java Quick Starter 1.0
McAfee Site Advisor 26.6
Norton IPS 1.0*
Norton Toolbar 3.5 (disabled)*
Speed Dial 0.9.0.
Tab Mix Plus 0.3.7.3
Word Count Plus 1.2.3

I did not report the crash in 3.0.7 because the new version wa imminent and I thought that I would wait to see if this resolved the issue.

I am not sure if it is relevant to this problem but I have Firefox set to notify me of new update but it doe not notify me.
