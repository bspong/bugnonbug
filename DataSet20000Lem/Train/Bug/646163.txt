I know this bug ha been reported before, but I wa unable to find a report for Firefox 4.0 specifically. When viewing ANY page with an invalid, untrusted, or self-signed certificate, the two button you are shown on the page do nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit any page with a certificate signed by an untrusted CA, or an invalid/self-signed certificate.
2. Try to click either button ("Add Exception" or "Get me out of here!")
3. No result.
Actual Results:
The button appears to respond to the click or enter button when selected, but doe not open the dialog.

Expected Results:
The usual dialog that allows you to view and accept the certificate should be shown when you click "Add Exception." Sorry, but I've never clicked the "Get me out of here!" button before now, so I'm not sure what should happen there.

Windows 7 x64 SP1. This bug wa first noticed in 4.0 beta 12 a few day ago. Got busy and forgot to report. Noticed 4.0 release wa out today and updated. Bug still persists.
