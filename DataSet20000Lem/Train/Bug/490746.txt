I am able to print copy of an individual email from earthlink webmail from Internet Explorer (I.E.) but NOT from Firefox Version 3.0.10. No specific error message appears, but the page is printed out in a type of computer format not legible a in English. No printer Icon is on the Firefox Browser like there is in I.E. Thus, I go to File, click on print, all look normal, and click okay. Have searched through tool and the browser to see if a setting exists to correct the problem without success.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. read email from ISP Earthlink Webmail
2. print individual email, click on file, click on print
3. all look normal, click okay for my selected printer
Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
expect to see a printed copy of one individual email but it come out in computer language illegible to read in English

merely printed out the individual email in English

I love Firefox, the entire Firefox Team, and Thank You for all you do to keep this product competitive. I love sharing it with others still using I.E.
