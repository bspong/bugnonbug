| Please file a bug on that? The live bookmark code is just broken -- it
| pass random data (ISO-88589-1) to a method that take UTF8. It used
| to "work" because the method wa broken and didn't treat the data a
| UTF8, but this bug fixed that.

| Really, I'd think the live bookmark code should be using ParseAsync
| anyway -- it fit their use case much better.
