Program seek information to let USER "login".

Clicking "LOGIN" button without supplying any information to FORM
result in "ERROR MSG" and (after "OK") a fresh FORM.

Clicking "LOGIN" (w/o info) should cycle indefinitely and sometimes does.

THE BUG (unpredictable) is that the window CLOSES (VANISHES) from UBUNTU.
RESTART work a if vanishing-act had never happens, but window may vanish again.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.OPEN A SINGLE FIREFOX WINDOW
2.VISIT http://123pab.net/acuhome.php
3.In left column, OFFICE LOGIN, click "login" without filling-in any information in the FORM.
4. click "OK"
5. click "LOGIN" (w/o providing information to FORM)
6. REPEAT step 4-5 until
7. WINDOW ERASES ITSELF
8. restarting work


Actual Results:
HOWEVER, when I tried this in the 4th Firefox window (the other window doing FIREFOX BUG REPORTING), there wa NO VANISHING.
