When you close a tab with the middle button and while pressing the middle button you press and release the right button of your mouse, there is a black box that appears instead of the usual right click popup menu. The black box disappears the same way that a popup menu disappears (when you click outside of it, for example). I have only managed to reproduce with 2 tab _only_ open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Hit Ctrl-T.
3. Hover your mouse over one of the tab (first or second, whichever you like)
4. Press (and hold) the middle button of your mouse.
5. Press and release the right button.
6. Release the middle button.
Actual Results:
There is a black box that appears on screen.

Expected Results:
Probably, the black box shouldn't appear.

The problem doesn't occur if you have more than 2 tab open so I assume that it happens because the tab bar is lost. I can confirm that the problem doesn't happen if you have the tab bar in 'always show' mode. If you have more than 2 tab and reproduce the above mentioned step you will get the popup menu of the recently closed tab hanging there, which also might be an unwanted behavior though it isn't such a big problem! :-)
