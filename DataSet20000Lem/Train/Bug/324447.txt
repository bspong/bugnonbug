content of tab move up a pixel a it close
When closing a tab, it content move up one pixel before disappearing.

Steps to reproduce (that make the problem more visible):
1. open a new Firefox window
2. open two new tab with the same page in them (so you have 3 tab total)
3. switch to the third tab
4. close it
Actual results:
4. you see the page move up a pixel and then down again
Expected results:
4. the page should not have moved at all since both tab have identical content

Steps to reproduce (that show it's the tab being closed that jitters):
1. open a new Firefox window and load three tabs, with different page in the last two
2. switch to the last tab
3. close the last tab
Actual results:
3. you see the page in the third tab move a pixel up before it disappears
Expected results:
3. the page in the third tab doesn't move before disappearing

This is a regression from Ben's tab browser landing (bug 308396) at 2006-01-20

This is probably not only a visual problem -- it likely ha measurable performance implications.

It's possible that this bug is only present given certain size of system font (e.g., it could be related to change in the tab layout caused by the appearance/disappearance of the close box, if the close box is larger than the font used in the tab labels). But that's just a guess at something to try if it turn out to be hard to reproduce -- I actually suspect it's not related to the close box since it happens both with small and large number of tabs.
