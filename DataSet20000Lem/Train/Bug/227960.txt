When I try to add a bookmark (by pressing Ctrl-D or choosing Add Bookmark from
my Bookmarks menu) in my currently used profile, the "Create In" drop-down
remains locked on a subfolder I last added a bookmark to. I cannot get the
drop-down to expand neither by clicking on it button, neither by pressing the
down arrow. If I try to cycle the focus with Tab, it cycle through all element
of the window but when it is supposed to be on the "Create In" dropdown the item
is not correctly highlighted and cannot be accessed.
The problem is persistent (closing all browser instance and starting a new one
yield the same behaviour).
Unfortunately I am unable to reproduce the problem if I create a new profile - I
could send you my bookmark if necessary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any webpage
2.Press Ctrl-D
3.Try to pick a different folder from the currently highlighted one.

Actual Results:
It stay locked on the folder which wa displayed when the window appeared

Expected Results:
It should have presented me with the folder tree
