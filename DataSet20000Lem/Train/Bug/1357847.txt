Steps to reproduce:

1. I wa browsing the internet, searching for PDFs on programming via Google, GitHub etc.
2. I had several webpage open and I started reading PDF document downloaded or accessed via the web (programming text book searched for via Google).
3. The PDF document were generally 500+ pages; and
4. I think I had at most 3-4 tab with PDFs open in them, the rest were normal webpages.


Actual results:

1. When I switched over from one PDF to another, or to a site, the response time started to lag.
2. After a couple of second the system just came to a halt..
3. I wa able to move my cursor but there wa no response from any action.
4. I tried ctrl+alt+del; ctrl+shift+esc; alt+f4; clicking various tabs, start button etc, nothing responded.



Expected results:

1. The system should have informed me of the increased memory allocation reaching critical;
2. then it should have offered me the choice of closing unused/least used tabs; high memory items; or
3. the option to cache the tabs, or bookmark them for easier recollection; and/or
4. the option to close the PDF tab and initiate a download instead to a nominated folder.
