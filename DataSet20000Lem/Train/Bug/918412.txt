Steps to reproduce:

I'm having a problem with the search bar. Whenever I use something other that my default search engine (Google). such a Webster or Wikipedia, and then return to Google.




Actual results:

my setting in prefs.js
"user_pref("browser.search.defaultenginename", "Webster")"; and "user_pref("browser.search.selectedEngine", "Webster")"
remain at whichever of the other engine I had selected temporarily in the last session when I log back on, not the last engine I had selected, Google. About:config entry do not fix this, they seem to be changing properly




Expected results:

I understand that FF is supposed to start up with the last search engine that I have selected at the time I exited FF (why?). My problem is that the entry in prefs.js don't recognize that I 've changed back to Google before exiting FF.

Now this is a FF problem and the forum response sending everyone to run an extension to correct it every time it occurs is stupid. It's time this wa fixed.

Also, If I remember right, in the good old days, we had a check box under the Manage Search Engines which allowed u to set a default without editing the about:config. We need that back also.
