I am seeing a problem with the behavior of an applet opened within Firefox.

I am using WebObjects from the Xcode 2.1 distro on Mac OS X 10.4.8. The current java on this box is build 1.5.0_06-112.

In WO, you can create a D2W application. This us a rule-generated user interface. To change the user interface of the web app you produce, you connect to the app you are creating and open an applet and the applet ha UI for changing the rule that drive the generation of the UI of the app.

When I click on a checkbox in that applet, it sends the applet window to the Dock, a if I had clicked on the "minimize" button of the window. One can pull the applet window out of the Dock and see that the click wa not accepted.

I can connect to the same application with Safari, open the same applet and that applet doe not have the problem.
