Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Problem doe not affect Opera V9.25 (stable) IE 6.x untested
2. Windows XP SP1 (1a to be exact) with Flash 9.0.115.0 installed
3. Not reproducable on an XP2 SP2 system at same location (though video wouldn't play-just no runtime error).
4. The affected system appears to have the latest MFC runtime library but due to application installation, may have a slightly older version of MFC. Nonetheless, the nature of the error is troubling a an invalid function call should cause another error.
