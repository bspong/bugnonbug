After creating a subfolder, it can't be seen within a folder on the Bookmarks
Toolbar but the new, subfolder IS actually created and can be found in a hidden
area at the bottom of the same named folder on the Bookmarks Sidebar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

3.

Actual Results:
After creating a new subfolder within a folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar, the
same named folder on the Bookmarks Sidebar must opened and the new subfolder
dragged up from the hidden area at the bottom of the list. After moving the
subfolder up out of the hidden area, it can be seen within the same named
subfolder on the Bookmarks Toolbar. A work around but a major hassle.

Expected Results:
Prior to the Mozilla Firefox 1.0PR release, we could point at a list of
bookmark within a Bookmarks Toolbar folder and created a subfolder at that
position. The created subfolder wa visible and bookmark could be dragged into
the newly created subfolder. This is a major feature that make Mozilla Firefox
better than all other browswers including tabbed browser based on Internet
Explorer.
