All page on my website use Google AJAX API.

When the page is viewed on http connection, the API is loaded from http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=

When the page is viewed on http connection, the API is loaded from https://www.google.com/jsapi?key=

User session normally start from http page and at some point they are sent to http page for login and/or credit card entry. First time such a page is opened, the page behaves a some of the content is insecure. The indication include:

* The favicon not turning blue
* An exclamation icon over the padlock icon
* Right click > View Page Info show "Connection Partially Encrypted" message
* Refreshing the same page fix the problem.

Google AJAX API is used on various website and it is probable that two website might be using same set of files. In such case, above behavior can be observed when user click a link on http://domain.com/regular.html to https://another-domain.com/secure.html; the secure.html page will appear a partially encrypted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Need a webserver that is http capable. See attached html files. Where to place the file and how to reproduce the error is documented in the files.



(a) I believe it ha something to do with "caching"... Google AJAX APIs send aggressive caching instruction to the browser and may be the browser try to use http cached version of the file on http pages.

(b) The problem look very specific but eventually it wont be that way a guru are recommending to switch to Google CDN server for dispatching JavaScript libraries.
