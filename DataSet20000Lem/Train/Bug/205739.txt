2. Select 'Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks'
3. Select a folder (eg. "Mozilla Firebird & Mozilla Information")
4. Right-click on it and select Properties. Note that only the "Info" tab, and
two text field are visible. Cancel out of the Properties box.
5. Select 'View/Set a Bookmarks Toolbar Folder"


Actual Results:
1. "Location" field for folder is set to "NC:PersonalToolbarFolder", and the
original Bookmarks Toolbar Folder is set to "rdf:#$kJ.cX3".
2. Right-clicking on the folder, or the original Bookmarks Toolbar Folder, and
selecting Properties now brings up a dialog headed "Properties
for '**bm_title**'" with three tab and numerous input field
3. You can still select "Set a Bookmarks Toolbar Folder" while you have the
new folder selected, and it's still greyed out if you select the original
Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.
4. Oh, And the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder in the browser doesn't change.

Expected Results:
Changed the Bookmarks Toolbar folder to my new selection.
