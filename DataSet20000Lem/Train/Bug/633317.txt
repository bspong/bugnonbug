Firefox retains large memory/page file usage after tab closed.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b11) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b11

To test the new beta, I held down CTRL + T for a bit, while watching my page file usage. The firefox.exe process went up to about 153000 K of memory, even after I selected "close all other tabs". I consider this a bug, a it should not retain all that memory usage.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox. (I am using the beta, but didn't find a beta bug report page).
2.Open about 100 tabs. I actually opened about 150 "new tabs".
3.Watch Task Manager (windows) or System Monitor in Ubuntu-though I never tried in Ubuntu.
4.Select "close all other tabs" on one of your tabs.
5.Be patient, it take a few second for it to complete the task. Watch your system monitor.
6.Observe your system monitor for a while after closing all your tabs.
Actual Results:
It keep using the same amount of memory.

Expected Results:
Lowered it memory usage, since the tab that required the memory in the first place were closed.

If a user is browsing, the memory usage may build up after a while, slowing down their computer.

I understand that I am using the beta, and it is not perfect. However, fixing bug and making the browser better is what beta stage is for, right?
