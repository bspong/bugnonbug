Firefox seems to have problem recognizing Minimize/Maximize/Move/Close click on the Title Bar or TaskBar. I have tried this with Firefox 2 and other program and they don't have the same problem. For instance, if you click on the Firefox icon on the top left corner and then click on Minimize, the click doesn't always register. Sometimes it take several click before Firefox actually minimizes. This always happens if you right-click on the Title Bar and try to Minimize (or Maximize, etc). Some it take several clicks. Finally, if you move the mouse to the Task Bar over the Firefox item and right-click and then try to Minimize, etc., the same thing happens with it sometimes taking many clicks.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3 Beta 4
2. Right-click on the Title Bar, Firefox icon on the Top Left or Firefox button on the TaskBar
3. Clicks to Minimize, Maximize, Move or Close will not always register. Sometimes it take several left click before your command to Minimize/Maximize/Move/Close will work.
Actual Results:
Clicks would not always register to Minimize/Maximize/Move/Close

Expected Results:
I expected Firefox to immediately Minimize/Maximize/Move/Close

I originally thought this wa a problem with my mouse driver and went through installing several versions. I finally noticed it only happened with Firefox 3 Beta 4 with or without the mouse drivers.
