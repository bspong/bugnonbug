When I use site like
www.mininova.org
www.torrentsearch.org
www.torrentreactor.net
The browser crash with
The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadShmSeg (invalid shared segment parameter)'.
(Details: serial 35 error_code 179 request_code 149 minor_code 2)
(Note to programmers: normally, X error are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
