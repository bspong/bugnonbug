Steps to reproduce:

Started browser , checked my email , opened another 2 tab , all tab were opened (not loaded just opened) when trying to open multiple tab from bookmark instead of opening new window or new tab (along the old tabs)...


Actual results:

browser opened selected tab from bookmark over the old one's and the rest of tab (over 90) disappeared. The restore previous session dose not work anymore.
I did not managed to restore session and could not access, to restore,(there is no such option) all my tab in Sync offered by Mozilla. I want a method to restore my initial tab , tried forced restore , did not work , restore only the latest tab not the 90 lost ones.


Expected results:

Should have opened separately the bookmark in septette tabs.
I'm so disappointing in Mozilla , and Nightly -26.0a1 (a bit better than mozilla but ha a lot of problem with tabs).
It's the 4th time I lose tab in Mozilla , big tab problem . I cant reopen them from history,there I have to many page visited , so revisiting them it's not an option. because I don't know what I have closed or that mozilla ha closed .
