Hello,

Normally I have maybe two to three browsers/tabs opened at a time. When One of the tabs/browsers have any streaming video content (i.e. youtube, worldstarhiphop, and etc.) Once the medium is played or in "action" my firefox browser crashed all the time. But, if I have the same type of medium in one browser by itself with no other tabs/browser open, my firefox doe not crash or crash a lot less. I do not have this problem with Internet Explorer or Opera web browsers. I shouldn't have to use "one sole" browser alone just to view streaming content to prevent any possible crashes. This only happens when streaming video is in effect. Also, the "colortabs" add-on doe not work for 3.1Beta3. I love the colortabs, it help separate everything. This option should be built in and activated/de-activated upon user request. Other than those issue.........FIREFOX IS A GREAT TOOL AND I LOVE IT!!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open at least two to three browser
2.goto youtube.com or worldstarhiphop.com or onsmash.com
3.Watching streaming content within only one of those browser and it will crash
Actual Results:
Crash

Expected Results:
