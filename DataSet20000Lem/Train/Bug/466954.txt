Chrome window opened from priviledged code is invisible when no scrollbar background color in custom theme
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Some might be tempted to say it's a bug in the themes... But it's not.
Same lack of background color for scrollbars in FF2 theme did not have this strange effect.
At any rate, lack of a scrollbar background color should affect scrollbars, not the window...

When an extension open a chrome window, the window will be invisible if a custom theme is loaded that doe not explicitly set a background color for scrollbars...

However, if the document loaded is bigger than the window and scrollbar were not disabled, only the scrollbars will appear (very impressive).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a theme that doe not set a background color for the scrollbars, for instance Aero Fox 3.0.2
(the lacking cs rule can be seen in global/scrollbars.css on the 'background' line)

2. Have some privileged code open a chrome window.
You can use the testcase xpi I'll attached to this bug. Open the "dummy sidebar" from the View/Sidebar menu, and click on the "Open" button it contains.



Actual Results:
When the theme is activated, the window is invisible except for it scrollbars.
When the theme is not activated, the window show google home page.


Expected Results:
The window should be visible with or without the theme.
