Request for relative uri after 302 redirect is occasionally relative to the original request
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

We've observed this behavior sporadically in FF 3.5.8, 3.6.2 and 3.6.3 on both Windows XP and Mac OS X.

The user type in a URL like
http://myserver/ctx/svlt/doit
The server responds with a 302 redirect:
Location: http://myserver/ctx/blah/

The browser issue the GET to that url, and the server responds with an HTML page which includes relative reference to CSS and JS files, such as:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css?123" type="text/css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="myscript.js?123"></script>

Almost all the time, FireFox doe the right thing: it issue GET request for
http://myserver/ctx/mystyle.css?123
and
http://myserver/ctx/myscript.js?123

However, once in a while, it make the request relative to the original request (the one that resulted in a redirect), not relative to the target of the redirect. In other words, it request
http://myserver/ctx/svlt/mystyle.css?123
and
http://myserver/ctx/svlt/myscript.js?123


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Our app is not available to the internet at large, so I can describe this only in conceptual terms.
1. Create a setup a described in the bug report details. That is, a servlet that redirects to another url on the same server; the redirected-to url responds with HTML that includes relative reference (we've seen the problem with CSS and JavaScript files; I don't know if the same problem would occur with image files).
2. Create a bookmark to the original url (the one that will result in a redirect).
3. Navigate to the bookmarked url. After it redirects and you get the page displayed, click on the bookmark again. Repeat many time until you see the problem.
