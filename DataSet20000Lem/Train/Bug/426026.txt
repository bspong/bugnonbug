Back/forward button disappear when moving from 1.8 to 1.9 if they've been moved
This is a followup bug based on my comment here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=417421#c29

Following on from bug 417421 it doesn't patch the case a follows:

I have all my navigation button in my menu toolbar... so I have everything in one line, address bar, search bar, menu. Moving from .13 to Minefield still make the back/forward button disappear. Doubly annoying because they don't show up in Toolbars>Customize, they get dumped in the (hidden) navigation toolbar.

Having it set up correctly in Minefield and then moving to 2.0.0.13 still make the back/forward button disappear.

I would expect that Firefox 3 would figure out where the back button is and put the megabutton there even if it's not on the navigation toolbar and that 2.0.0.13 would look for the megabutton and put both the back and forward button where it is.

It's a minor issue but I can see people who customize their toolbars being minorly annoyed/confused after upgrading to 3 if it's in the final.

Anyhow by way of providing details, below are excerpt from my localstore.rdf after performing a series of steps.

1. Start with a fresh 2.0.0.13 profile. Move button to menubar, hide navigation toolbar.

<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#toolbar-menubar"
iconsize="small"
currentset="back-button,forward-button,stop-button,reload-button,home-button,menubar-items,urlbar-container,spring,search-container,throbber-box" />
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#nav-bar"
iconsize="small"
currentset="__empty"
collapsed="true" />

2. Open in Minefield, see that the back/forward button are "missing" (they're actually in the navigation toolbar). Don't make any change or touch anything, just close.

currentset="back-button,forward-button,stop-button,reload-button,home-button,menubar-items,urlbar-container,spring,search-container,throbber-box" />
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#nav-bar"
iconsize="small"
collapsed="true"
currentset="unified-back-forward-button,__empty" />

3. Make change in Minefield to put the button where they should be.
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#toolbar-menubar"
iconsize="small"
currentset="unified-back-forward-button,stop-button,reload-button,home-button,menubar-items,urlbar-container,spring,search-container,throbber-box" />
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#nav-bar"
iconsize="small"
currentset="__empty"
collapsed="true" />

4. Open in 2.0.0.13 and see that the back/forward button are missing.


You can probably see what's going on from there.
