I am experiencing an issue where FireFox asks whether I want it to try to reload the last page it had open EVERY time it is launched.. even when it wa shut down normally the previous session with only one page open.

As a side note, FireFox seems to continue to run (in the Processes window of the Windows Task Manager after it ha been closed. I have to shut down the process manually in Task Manager in many instances.

This is in addition to another issue where FireFox hang and us up all available CPU when a javascript link that open a popup is clicked on a web page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. Open a page having Javascript link
3. click Javascript link
4. close FireFox
5. re-open FireFox
Actual Results:
FireFox continues to show a running in Processes window after closing.
Have to manually kill process.
once launched again FireFox asks if I want to reload page from previous session.

Expected Results:
FireFox should no longer be running once it is closed.
FIreFox should not ask if I want to reload page from previous session if that session is closed normally.

If this could be the result of a corrupted Application data file, please advise whet I can do to correct it.
