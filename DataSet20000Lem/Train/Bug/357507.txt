I have some live bookmark in my toolbar. I am connected to work (manual proxy config enabled), and later I disconnect from work (VPN) and close firefox. When I restart Firefox, it look for the proxy but doesn't find it, therefore causing all live bookmark to fail to load. Even if I immediately chang my proxy setting back to "Direct connection", my live bookmark do not load.

This might be espected behavior, but the text in my live bookmark say "live bookmark loading" which is not accurate. Either the LBs dont see that I switched proxy, or they have failed to load and the text should say so.

Ideally, they would see the proxy switch and then load. My only work around to this point is start browser, switch proxy, close browser, start browser. I am going to try some extensions, but I think that firefox itself should look into this one.

Thanks!
