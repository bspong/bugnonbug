After restoring my computer from hibernation, the minimize, maximize and close button in Firefox were not visible (they are visible in other programs). The title bar wa transparant and had the wrong color, in my theme it should not be transparant. The title bar of different Firefox window had a different color, they should have the same color (this can be explained by one window not being maximized and the other being maximized, if I maximize the non-maximized window the title bar suddenly ha the same color a the other window). I have attached a screenshot showing the broken interface.

Switching to window 7 basic restores the minimize, maximize and close buttons. Switching back to my custom theme break the button again. The button are also missing in the default Windows 7 Aero theme. All Aero theme that I tried were broken.

I fixed the interface error by restarting the browser (Shift + F2 and typing restart).

This could be a bug caused by the Australis interface changes, since I've never seen this bug in pre-Australis versions.

Usually when I restore my computer from hibernation the Firefox interface doe not get broken. This is the first time it got broken. So it might prove difficult to reproduce this issue.

This bug could be related to the bug that the interface sometimes get broken when switching Windows theme while Firefox is open (Switch between Windows classis, Windows 7 Basic, High Contrast and Aero theme a couple of time and you should be able to reproduce missing minimize, maximize and close buttons). See Bug 1009001 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1009001).

I use the default Firefox theme. I do have the Status-4-Evar extension installed, but I do not think that it is related to this bug.
