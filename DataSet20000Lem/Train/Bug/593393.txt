Need smarter policy for searching with location bar.

Awesomebar could do web search by modifying the keyword.URL.
Since the landing of bug 565966, however, it's now a default action. Compared to Google Chrome's omnibar, we need to come up with smarter policy for determining the type of input string(text or link?).
Most problem happen when there are dots(periods, full-stops) in the string.

Here are some thing I noticed:
1. Since each field of an IPv4 address is a number between 0~255 and there are only four of them in a set. Strings like "1.2.3.256" or "1.2.3.4.5" are recognized a normal string and bring up search in Chrome. For now Minefield still think they're address and try to connect, this one is a rather easy fix I suppose.
2. For more complicated string like "a.b.c.d.e" and "a.b.c.d.ee", Chrome seems to have it mysterious way to distinguish them. Take the above two for instances, "a.b.c.d.e" is treated a a string, "a.b.c.d.ee" becomes an address(and "a.b.c.d.ff" a normal string again). Most basic and easiest way is considering country code top-level domain(ccTLD), but since there's no one a the ".ee" suffix, I suspect Google made up some handsome rule list using their enormous search and domain database. This one's got to be worked hard on if we're going to achieve it.
3. If Minefield can't decide(better yet, even if it could), offer to let the user decide.

There are more patterns, and all those will benefit not only search in location bar, but also "Paste and Go" or "Paste and Search", context menu "Search Google for" or "Open Link".

Please look into it. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always
