AUDIODEV environment variable cause crash on keyboard input
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040221 Firefox/0.8

Setting the AUDIODEV environment variable cause Firefox to crash (or, perhaps
more accurately, close) on keyboard input. It is not clear that Firefox issue
a nonzero exit code when it close in this manner. Keyboard input directed to
the menu (i.e. alt-F for the file menu) doe NOT cause Firefox to close. There
is significant evidence, although I cannot confirm it, that this problem also
exists in Mozilla and derivative (i.e. Nautilus, in which it sound like it
actually cause a segfault). Mouse input cause no problems, and all menu
command work a expected.

Setting the AUDIODEV environment variable is useful for getting application to
use the ALSA dmix pluging for software audio mixing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the AUDIODEV environment variable. Specifically, mine wa set to "DEFAULT".
2. Run Firefox (i.e. $ AUDIODEV="default" firefox)
3. Direct keyboard input at Firefox (location bar, any dialog, or the browser
area).
Actual Results:
Firefox closes, but not obviously with a nonzero exit code.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have accepted input either to the location bar or a dialog box or
begun a type-ahead find.
