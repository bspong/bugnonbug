Extension for Yahoo Email enhancement show wrong font w/ Firefox; display differently with IE
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier:

Using Firefox w/Yahoo email enhancement: 1. Comic Sans MS look right, but
come out to recipient a that tiny script font. 2. Selecting the Script
font w/Firefox, it only show a Comic Sans MS. I confirmed the extension a
the source of the problem, by re-opening the saved (draft) email using IE, and
all look right. 3. The Script font is terribly small. 4. The Script and
Courier fonts, RECEIVED in IE after being created in FFox w/ the Yahoo
extension, are jagged and hard to read. HOW THIS WAS DISCOVERED: I sent a
long email to 200 classmates, in Comic Sans MS. I got immediate complaint
about that "tiny script font" "it hurt my eyes" etc. So the extension
cause the Selection, Comic Sans MS, to ACTUALLY use Script.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create Yahoo email w/ FFox using Yahoo extension for enhancements; fonts,
etc. Write a sentence using all the font selections. Note that in FFox, the
Script font show on originating screen a Comic Sans MS.
2. Save a draft then send it using FFox.
3. Open IE, receive the email and see how font have changed.
I didn't try all of them, only Courier, Times Roman, MS Comic Sans, and Script.
3.

Actual Results:
Already described

Expected Results:
I assumed all the font were appearing in the originating email correctly, but
they were not.

I consider this major; the email this happened in contained critical
information for about 200 people; I assume many saw it a unreadable and
trashed it without bothering to tell me. It ha wasted over 4 hour of
precious time for me and will do the same for other unsuspecting people. I'm
glad I wasn't sending it to my boss, or prospective employer, etc.
