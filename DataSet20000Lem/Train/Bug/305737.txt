I have set two home page in my preference (using a '|' to seperate them)
Starting up with multiple homepage (on multiple tabs) hangsup firefox if one of
the tab (not being the first one) generates an "Security Error - Domain Name
Mismatch" pop-up. It is not possible to select OK,Cancel or Help and therefor
Firefox is completely hung-up. It's even worse after killing Firefox and
re-start-up it happens again: the homepage are opened and the hang-up occurs
again. Only by editing the preferences.js file I can make firefox start-up again.

A "normal" user can only solve this hangup by creating a new blank user profile!
