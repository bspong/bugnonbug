This problem first occurred a few day ago after upgrading from Firefox 3.0.4 to Firefox 3.0.5. After upgrading to Firefox 3.0.5, if I open several window and I click on the close button of one of those windows, Firefox close all of my windows, instead of the one I wanted to close.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox and go to a website.
2. Open another window and go to a website.
3. If you want, open some more window and tabs.
4. Close one of the window or tab using the close-button which is located in the title bar.
Actual Results:
Firefox close every open window and tab.

Expected Results:
Firefox should close only the window or tab you wanted to close.

On older version of Firefox the same behavior of closing all open window and tab occured when using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + W. For more information about that bug see:

The bug of Firefox closing all window when pressing Ctrl + W ha been in Firefox for a long time, but I only had this bug when using keyboard shortcuts. Because of this bug, I just didn't close my window using the keyboard, but by closing the close button located in the title bar.

Now I've upgraded to Firefox 3.0.5 and now this same bug also occurs when closing the window using the close button. This bug is getting really annoying.
