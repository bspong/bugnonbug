since installing Firefox 2 i have had constant problem with page NOT loading from typed search and URL's and from clicking on link and saved bookmarks. Once this operation ha been attempted the original page stay up and the word "DONE" is displayed in bottom left corner of browser. The 'load' bar sometimes appears but may then disappear and the same result occurs. I usually have to click a numerous amount of time until the 'loading' bar stay on for longer than 5-10 secs. This ha become very frustrating a i am a fan/supporter of Firefox and their product and services. PLEASE HELP!!! I recently bought & installed Zonealarm Antivirus (internet security) & Firefox ha FULL access always...however the problem existed prior to this.
