User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040402 Firefox/0.8

Using Fedora Core 1 with Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer mouse which ha the two
side buttons. I have the following in XF86Config to allow these side button to
work:

Section "InputDevice"
Identifier "IntelliMouse"
Driver "mouse"
Option "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
Option "Device" "/dev/psaux"
Option "Buttons" "7"
Option "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
Option "Emulate3Buttons" "no"
EndSection

I also have the following script that run each time I start KDE:

xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 2 3 6 7 4 5"
imwheel -k -b "67"

My .imwheelrc configuration ha the following:

".*"
None, Up, Alt_L|Left
None, Down, Alt_L|Right

The GTK1/XFT build of Firefox properly responds a follows:
Near side button navigates back one page (mapped to Alt+Left above)
Far side button navigate forward one page (mapped to Alt+Right above)
This mirror what happens when using Firefox on Windows.

The GTK2/XFT build of Firefox doe not do this. Instead, both side button act
a thought the Page Up key wa hit.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
The detail section describes what I am doing to reproduce this.
Actual Results:
The side button on my Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer both act a though the
Page Up key wa pressed.

Expected Results:
The side button using the configuration I describe in the problem detail
should allow me to page navigate back and forward.
