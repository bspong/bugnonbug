Too many different ID's

Firefox us an ungodly number of different ID's in referencing menu and context
menu items. It us a vast array for essentially the same fuunction. This ha to
be inefficient. I suspect it unduly burden some computer and slows Firefox down.

I came across this issue a I wa skinning the various menu item for my
SphereGnome series of themes. See below, for example, the number of different
ID's used for the Copy function. Of course, some really are different, and need
different ID's. However, when you go out across all of them, you see lot of
duplicates. Obvious culprit are separate ID's for bookmark and DomI, but there
are others (extension window, e.g.).

I know that duplicate ID's are frequently not necessary because when I use a
particular ID, sometimes I will see a number of menuitems appropriately skinned.

This is an issue for FF 2.0, I think.

Reproducible: Always
