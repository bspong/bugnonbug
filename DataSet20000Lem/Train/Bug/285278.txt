I am experiencing an auto deletion of bookmark after I add them or if I transfer them from internet ex. This happened after downloading the new Firefox 1.0.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

I have had my bookmark automatically deleted between time when I close out of
Firefox and start it up again. This first happened after I downloaded the new
Firefox 1.0. I add new bookmark or transfer tehm from internet explorer and
they are gone when I log onto Firefox the next time I am using the internet. I
absolutely loved firefox before this happened and have told many friend about
the browser, but now I am not really satisfied because i use my bookmark often.
I am sure you can understand why I have a problem and I would really appreciate
if you could contact me and help solve this problem before I switch back to
Internet Explorer. I would rather use Firefox to be honest with you. Thank you
for your time. Luke Roberts lrroberts@yahoo.com
