Should the History menu and History query (in the Library and in the sidebar) list downloads?
The History menu and the History query in the Library & Sidebar list downloads. I've always found this somewhat confusing (it tends to make entry in the history menu open Save As dialogs...), but I guess that's just me. However, it's sure becoming more of an issue with the soon-to-land (well, hopefully) UI introduced in bug 675902 (Manage downloads in the place Library).

There we introduce a special view for the Downloads query. It'll list both current downloads and history downloads. The UI for both kind of downloads will behave more like the current Downloads Manager than like other place views. For example: (*) the context menu will have item like "Show in Finder" rather than "open in a new window" (as we do today for Library downloads); (*) the icon for the download would be the file icon rather than the site-favicon.

This all work a expected if downloads are excluded from the general History queries. However, if we let downloads and site-history mix together, there are two thing we could do:
(1) Handle downloads in this mix a regular page (having the standard place context menu, page favicon, no download "commands").
(2) Treat them a downloads regardless.

I'm in favor of excluding downloads, but I can see how it would could confuse user who have a more abstract view of Browsing History ;) If UX is concerned about those, I think the former option above is better than the later. Your call though!

Note: I've fix-in-hand for excluding downloads, easy and straight forward.
