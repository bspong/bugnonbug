This ha been heavily tested on multiple Intel & PPC Macs all Mac OS X Tiger 10.4.
The shipping label won't come up, or print. I have to use Safari every time.
It may be Java.
All OS update applied.
Tried on clean system, raw FireFox with no extensions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to USPS.com, setup account so you can print shipping labels.
2. Setup a priority mail label without postage so if doesn't cost anything.
3. Try to print. The label won't even display.
4. Try above on Safari and see how it should work.
Actual Results:
No label displayed on screen. Unable to print.

Expected Results:
See result in Safari.
Label should come up on screen for confirmation, then you can print it.

Major problem for me. I ebay a lot and can't print label without using Safari and FF side-by-side.
