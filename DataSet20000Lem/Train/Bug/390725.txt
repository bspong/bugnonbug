Firefox attache keyboard focus to wrong window

Example one:
Several FF window are open on _several_ workspaces.
I move the mouse inside a previously inactive FF window. I press Ctrl+T. It seems that nothing happens, but in reality, in another FF window on another workspace, a new tab wa opened.

Example two:
Same setup, I want to type in a new URL or fill in a web form. Clicking on it doesn't give me a cursor in it. If I start typing, in another FF window "search by type" get activated and feed by the keyboard input. Clicking inside the other window, clicking inside the "wrong" window, heavily cycling through the window doesn't solve the problem. Keyboard input is processed by one FF window regardless which one is really focused.

To get rid of this nasty behaviour, you have to do some magic thing I didn't find out already. This problem wa also present in earlier versions. To much regret, the newer the version, the more often it happened. It happens every day now.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several FF window
2. Do some window cycle via mouse or other way
3. Use shortcut or try to input into the url textfield, web forms,...
Actual Results:
Keyboard input is processed in another FF window, which is not active.

Expected Results:
Spend me some free beer.

WHILE I WROTE THIS BUG REPORT FIRST, FIREFOX CRASHED ON CLOSING A TAB! I HATE THIS BROWSER!

I use fluxbox a window manager. Fluxbox show the right window is focused with the window decoration. WM independent tool like fbpager also mark the right window a focused. The fluxbox guy told me it is impossible within the WM that a window not on the current workspace gain focus.
