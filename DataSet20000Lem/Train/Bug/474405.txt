As shown in the example URL, some textarea element may add line feed to default text when they are displayed.

e.g.
'********
********'
becomes
'********

********'

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page given - http://www.ushrakhan.com/alliance/edk/lineFeedBug.html
2. Scroll to bottom of textarea
3. Look for extra line between the row of *'s
Actual Results:
...
There is only one line feed between the next two line
**********************

*************


Expected Results:
...
There is only one line feed between the next two line
**********************

Changing the number of character between the start of the element and the point where the extra line is added prevents the new line being added. If there is not a line feed at that point then the extra line feed is not added. In the text between the start element and the point where the extra line feed is added any character may be exchanged for another. The exception is that \r\n is equal to one character.

This wa seen in other example a well. No correlation between the example wa found, unfortunately.

The same file downloaded from http://brightentheworld.org/stuff/lineFeedBug.html doe not show the extra linefeed. Downloading that file via ftp and loading into the browser locally now show the extra linefeed again.

The behaviour wa duplicated on a different pc running the same version of Firefox.
