I ran into this problem in the Beta version of Firefox 3 and I have also run into it in the final release several times.

When I change something with my bookmark in the Bookmarks Organizer, the change is often not reflected in either the Bookmarks menu or toolbar. I can restart Firefox or my computer a many time a I want and it never update the menu or toolbar. The change are always there in the Bookmarks Organizer however, so I know it is saving them.

The specific change I am doing is moving bookmark from the Bookmarks menu into a folder on the Bookmarks toolbar.

When Firefox doe this, the bookmark act strangely and I have to reinstall Firefox entirely for them to work correctly again. When I add a new bookmark, it will show up on the toolbar or the menu, but doesn't show up in the Bookmarks Organizer. These new bookmark are lost when Firefox is restarted, thus effectively eliminating the bookmark feature of Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new bookmark and put it in the bookmark menu
2. Open the Bookmarks Organizer and create a folder on the bookmark toolbar
3. In the Bookmarks Organizer, drag the bookmark from the menu to the folder in the toolbar
Actual Results:
The bookmark menu and toolbar will now be unsynchronized with the Bookmarks Organizer.

Expected Results:
The bookmark menu and toolbar should reflect the change made in the Bookmarks Organizer.
