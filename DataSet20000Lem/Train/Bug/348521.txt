Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the BritishAirways.com web site
2. Monitor Firefox process memory size (e.g. via top)

Actual Results:
Firefox process size grows without bound.


Fedora Core 5 (x86) OS with all updates.
Also effect Firefox 1.5.0.4 and 1.5.0.6 Fedora package the same way.

This may no technically be a memory leak a the resident set size of Firefox also grows to a much a the OS can handle. This suggests that the process is accessing all the page in it virtual memory.

When I first discovered this problem a few day ago Firefox (then 1.5.0.4) had been left for several hours. The virtual memory size grew to 1819 MiB and wa causing the machine to swap so much that the CPU wa spending 95% of it time waiting for disk IO completion. Heres the output from top:
