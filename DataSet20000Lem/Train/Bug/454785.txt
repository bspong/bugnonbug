I have retained all my bookmark from the previous version of Firefox. But any new change I try to make revert back. I tried to add a new bookmark file (for my Work Mail) and delete an old one from my bookmark toolbar. The change appear immediately. But once I restart Firefox, the change I've made disappear. The new file is no longer there, and the old file ha returned. The same occurs whenever I try to change the order of the current bookmarks: all change revert back to original state after restart.

The same also occurs when I try to add or delete a bookmark to my bookmark in general (i.e. not just when I try to add to Bookmark Toolbar).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Bookmarks --> Organize Bookmarks
2. Select Bookmarks Toolbar
3. Right click on the whitespace in the Bookmarks Toolbar box and select "New Bookmark"
4. Create new bookmark -- make sure it appears in Toolbar folder immediately
5. Close Firefox
6. Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:
No new bookmark appears after restart.

Expected Results:
My new bookmark should remain after restart.
