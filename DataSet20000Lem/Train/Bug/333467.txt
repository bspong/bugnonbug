If you create a page that ha a frameset that is resizable with a border, if the user manually resizes the frameset by dragging on the border to it minimum width or height (depends on whether frameset is defined with col or rows), the frameset cannot be resized programmatically using Javascript (i.e. frame.cols = "10,*").

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Setup:
Create an HTML page that ha a resizable frameset with 2 cols. For the one frame, include a page with a button that change the col value in the frameset.

1. Manually resize the frame that doe not contain the button to it minimum width.
2. Click on the button.

If the size of the frame without a button is anything but the minimum value, the Javascript call from the button will work.

Actual Results:
The frame within the frameset remain the same size (i.e. the frame without the button is it minimum width and the frame with the button take up the remainder of the screen real estate).

Expected Results:
The frameset should resize the frame without the button to the specified size from the Javascript call and the frame with the button should take up the remainder of the screen real estate.

The HTML test page were run from an application server, not from the window file system.
