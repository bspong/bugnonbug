Bookmarks manager allows creating folder with the same name without any warning.

It would be cool if a user had possibility to see warning ("Folder with such name already exists. Do you really want to create new folder with the same name or would you like to use existent one?") and prompt to move to this folder. Of course it problem becomes actual only when you have too many top bookmark item (folders/bookmarks).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select in menu 'Bookmarks/Bookmark this page'
2. Press button with vertical down arrow (triangle) with tooltip 'Show all the bookmark folders'.
3. Press 'New Folder' button
4. Enter folder name 'temp456'.
5. Press OK.
6. Repeat step 1-5
7. As result you have two the same folders, what in the most case are not expected behaviour.

Actual Results:
Two bookmark folder with the same name.

Expected Results:
See warning window, that prompt you to use existent folder.
