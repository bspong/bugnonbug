A File open dialog (*.exe) appears when you start FireFox by clicking a link (tested from a link in MS Outlook express 2003 and a link in puttytray, I think any way of opening a link from external software would work), when there are update for one (of more) installed extension(s) available.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have FireFox set to be the default browser.
2. Make sure you have one or more extension installed with available updates.
3. Make sure FireFox is not running.
4. Click on a link from any program other than FireFox.
Actual Results:
First a dialog with all extension that can be updated are listen appears.
Then an Open File dialog (looking for *.exe) appears.
After dismissing (or accepting) the updates, FireFox will start with the expected page(s) opened.

Expected Results:
First a dialog with all extension that can be updated are listen appears.
After dismissing (or accepting) the updates, FireFox will start with the expected page(s) opened.

I have seen this happen with a lot of different version of FireFox and different extensions. Every time in a similar situation I got this File Open dialog, very consistent behavior.
I haven't tried to actually open an executable with the dialog.
