build package for locale by starting with en-US complete package
The current build process for creating a copy of Firefox in any locale requires
building the source from scratch (or reusing a set of built files) and then
packaging those file with the locale files. We should add a new process to our
build system that allows the build to start with a set of en-US package file
(maybe just the .zip or maybe the .zip and the .exe), unpackages them, then
repackages the file for a new locale.

I see the human process for managing the build occurring something like this:

* While the trunk/branch is in open development, the l10n build system build
a they do today by checking out the CVS code.

* When we get code complete in en-US, we take the generated file from the
en-US build system and place them in a special location on the l10n build
system that the build process recognizes a holding finished products.

* Upon seeing these files, the build process know to skip checking out most
of the source code (for example, maybe it only check out the locale files)
and instead unpackages the files.

* The build process then pick up at the point where the locale file are
packaged with the product file (from the en-US build), completes the
build, and move on to the next locale.

* The resulting file that are uploaded are sent to the FTP site and are
essentially the same product file a the en-US files, hence having the
same Talkback ID and symbol a en-US users.
