Just upgraded to Firefox 3.5 from 3.0. Bookmarks all transferred to new version with no problems. In the drop-down 'Bookmarks' menu, the 'Bookmarks Toolbar' option ha all the bookmark in it that it should have. However, if I go to 'View' and select 'Bookmarks Toolbar', it insert the space for a toolbar (between the navigation toolbar and my Google toolbar) but it is blank and new bookmark cannot be dragged onto it. There is nothing visible to suggest the toolbar ha been moved out of view or hidden. It just appears to be missing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to 'View'
2. Select 'Bookmarks Toolbar'
3.
Actual Results:
A clear horizontal space is created for a toolbar, but no toolbar actually appears. The space appears to be inactive - item cannot be dragged into it and right-clicking on it brings up the 'View' contextual menu.

Expected Results:
The Bookmarks Toolbar should appear, with my Bookmarks Toolbar bookmark in it.
