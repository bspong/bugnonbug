After a log-in session, I get a time out message and cannot log in again, even if I log-out. Doesn't happen with Safari
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

As above. The URL page above showed up a few week ago and Firefox degraded more and more with increasing inability to open numerous pages, mainly those requiring a log-in. I deleted Firefox then downloaded it anew a few day ago. After a few days, the same problem recurred with the URL above, though I have not yet experienced degradation of other pages. When I go to the problem site using Safari I can log-in promptly, suggesting that the problem is not with the Capital One site.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. All I need to do is log-in to the site, log out, then try to go back later.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
When I attempted to log-in to the site, I got the time out message instead. The message ha a log-in button, but when it is pushed I only get the time out message back.

Expected Results:
I should not have received a time-out message since I performed a proper log-out from the site. Even if I had timed out, I should have been able to log-in again.
