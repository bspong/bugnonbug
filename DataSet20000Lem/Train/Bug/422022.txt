This is an enhancement request.

Current behavior of the bookmark toolbar when it is overpopulated is to place an arrow at the right end of toolbar so user can access additional bookmarks.

Firefox should offer user an option in Tools|Options|Tabs to either keep the current behavior, or to autoexpand the toolbar vertically to accommodate additional bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Size Firefox Windows to approx 3/4 of screen size.
1.Add bookmark to the bookmark toolbar until full.
2.Add yet another bookmark to the toolbar.

Actual Results:
Right hand arrow appears in toolbar. If you then maximize the FF window, the arrow is replaced with the bookmark that couldn't fit before.

Expected Results:
If my suggestion is implemented, the default behavior would remain the same. If the user chooses to enable the option (described in Detals section)to autosize the toolbar, then the arrow will never appear, and the toolbar will vertically autosize to accomodate all bookmark base on thr Firefox window size.
