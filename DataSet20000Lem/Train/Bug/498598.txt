I could previous open multiple/diff gmail account and nav around Sites, Documents etc a multiple users. Since 3.0.11 this ha stopped working, with a gmail tab open if I try open another gmail account (eg corporate gmail account) the page lock with hour glass and doesn't reach google. The same link open fine in IE so it not a prob with the google server.

Similarly, hitting a Documents link now say "sorry you dont have access to this doc..." with "try with another login" option or similar, hitting this link similarly lock up trying to serve up the page to switch users.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open gmail window, log in
2. try connect to another gmail account such a corporate gmail account
3.
Actual Results:
second attempt result in hourglass and never reach google

Expected Results:
happily open multiple google session, when I hit a doc link say in Documents or Sites link it happily allows me to switch gmail user to access if need be.
