keyword search for exactly one word with non-ASCII character (umlauts and accentuated characters) doesn't work due to punycode-conversion

searching for single word from the location bar doe not work when they contain
umlaut (äöüÄÖÜ) or accentuated character (I only tried a few but none of them
worked) because they are converted to punycode.
There is no problem in searching for word containing these character if there
is more than one word that is searched for (e.g. type "à bientôt" in the
location bar) or if the keyword-search is evoked directly by typing
"keyword:Fahrvergnügen".

It seems that whenever the content typed into the location bar might be a domain
(that is doesn't contain any space characters) it is punycode-converted looked
up in the DNS. When the DNS-lookup for this fails, keyword search is invoked.
The problem is, that keyword-search should always search for what the user ha
entered into the location bar, not only when more than one word wa entered.
Punycode-conversion is wrong, because there are no security-concerns that user
are spoofed into doing "unsafe" search :o)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type "Fahrvergnügen" into the location bar and hit enter



Actual Results:
The location bar display "keyword:xn--fahrvergngen-llb" and the page configured
to show up for this keyword-search is loaded (for me this is google). The
result are useless, because I didn't want to search for xn--fahrvergngen-llb
and what I looked for is not displayed.

Expected Results:
The keyword-search should show result for "Fahrvergnügen" and the location bar
should display "keyword:Fahrvergnügen".

This bug is a regression from Firefox 1.0.
