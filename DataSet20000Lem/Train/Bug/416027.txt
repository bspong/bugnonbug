Sites with logins that I used to enter with Firefox now won't work, such a Bank of America and TV Guide.

When I try to sign in to Bank of America, it doesn't recognize that I'm already signed in. When I tred to use the online TV Guide, it would not bring up the list (until today). This problem ha been going on for about a week now. I've been using Firefox now for over a year almost exclusively, and now I have to use Internet Explorer again for these two websites. They have not changed their layout. I spoke to Bank of America, and they are down a compatible, so it must be in one of the automatic update for Firefox that messed it up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Went to website (tried several times)
2. Logged in
3. Page come up saying I didn't log in. Had to use Internet Explorer.
Actual Results:
I get a message saying, "You have not entered your Online ID. Please do so and click the Sign In button."

Expected Results:
A page is supposed to come up showing something that identifies me for Bank of America, but nothing is happening.

I'm using the default theme. There wa an update recently, but I don't recall what it was.

This is important because I bank exclusively online, so this is a major setback.
