I cannot bookmark any web site. This problem started with the previous update of Firefox. I thought that the problem would just go away with the next update but it ha not. This problem is still here with the update that automatically installed a day or so ago. FYI, there doe seem to be something happening on my computer that try to activate IE on it's own. If you think that may have something to do with it I can get you more Info. on that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I click on "Bookmarks"
2. Then click "Bookmark This Page"
3. Nothing happens.
Actual Results:
Nothing at all. No dialog box and no new bookmark anywhere that I can find.

Expected Results:
I would expect a dialog box where I can decide in what folder I want to put the bookmark. Then, I would choose that folder and click the appropriate box to put that bookmark into that folder.

See above.
