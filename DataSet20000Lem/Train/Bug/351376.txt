the site owner (normjenson@yahoo.com)reported this:

"I've had others report this behavior in the past.
I've been unable to duplicate it either on a pc or a
mac running the latest version of Firefox. I had one
person report success by uninstalling both Quicktime
and Firefox and then reinstalling them Firefox first.
Do you recall if you installed Firefox after you
installed Quicktime? "


I tried it on two different comps, and same problem!
I've had Firefox since the beginning...and before quicktime on one comp.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to site onegoodmove.org
2. scroll down to archive link and click on one of them


Actual Results:
Firefox get error and must close. (MicroSuck Internet Distorter work OK here, but I don't want to use it.)


see above...the site owner is familiar with the problem, but is unable to reproduce it with Firefox.
(it is a cool site...worth checking out!)
