Pages using google javascript file take incredibly long to load when behind a proxy server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042708 Fedora/3.0.10-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042708 Fedora/3.0.10-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0.10

I'm currently on a network behind a simple proxy (Squid) which limit access to some page and offer some caching services. I have already checked the proxy configuration file and it doe not block the google website in any way. Bypassing the proxy make the page work correctly, setting Firefox to use the proxy make all such page take an incredible amount of time to load (over a minute for the google homepage). I have checked proxy setting and they are correct, the page doe display but only after an incredible amount of time.
Checking the Squid access log, I noticed a lot of TCP_MISSes, but more importantly the proxy server seems to be spending a great amount of time between TCP_MISS/302 (HTTP redirects).
This problem did not occur in IE8 and Konqueror and seems to be an issue with Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup a Proxy server in the network using Squid
2. Configure Firefox to use the proxy
3. Try connecting to google.com, google-analytics.com or other such site
Actual Results:
webpage only load after an incredible amount of time (more than one minute for the google homepage, others do not progress in ten of minutes...)

Expected Results:
Load the webpage in a reasonable amount of time ( IE8 load this page in le than one second, a well a other such pages)
