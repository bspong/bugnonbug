distribution.ini for testcase

When any link item are defined in the [BookmarksMenu] section of <appdir>/distribution/distribution.ini, the following error is thrown on profile creation, and no bookmark customizations appear in either the Bookmarks Toolbar or Bookmarks menu.

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.insertBookmark]" nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)" location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/modules/distribution.js :: DIST_parseBookmarksSection :: line 189" data: no]

Removing all link item from the [BookmarksMenu] section permit the customizations made in the [BookmarksToolbar] section to be applied, but any other customizations in the [BookmarksMenu] section (i.e. folders) will not appear in the Bookmarks Menu.

Steps to reproduce:

- Create a "distribution" directory off the application directory
- Copy the "distribution.ini for testcase" attachment to the distribution directory
- Start Firefox3 with a new profile

Expected results: Firefox 3 with a test link and folder in the Bookmarks Toolbar, and a test link and folder in the Bookmarks Menu

Actual results: Firefox 3 with default Bookmarks Toolbar and Menu

(removing the [BookmarksMenu] section and restarting with a new profile will result in the BookmarksToolbar being populated a expected with one link item and one folder item)
