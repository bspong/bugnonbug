I have the SkyPilot and BlueMonkey theme installed, and both function normally
under usual circumstances. When switching from SkyPilot to BlueMonkey in option
menu (or to Mozilla default), the toolbar with back, forward, home, etc., and
the address bar are replicated on the same row twice. When changing from any
other theme to SkyPilot, the theme doe not change upon exiting option menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install Firebird 0.7
2. Install using the .jar extensiosn from Mozilla Firebird Help (texturizer
website) the BlueMonkey and SkyPilot theme
3. Try switching between those two theme and the default.

Actual Results:
Toolbar rendered improperly and all webpage in tab needed to be reloaded
(displayed nothing).

Expected Results:
Toolbar should only render once, and change should occur every time option menu
is exited.

Occurs for theme switching from SkyPilot to BlueMonkey and back again.
