Firefox ignores administrator settings, restores default for each user

An administrator installs Firefox to C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox (a path only an administrator can write to), open it, go to Tools > Options > Advanced > Updates and unchecks all value under "Automatically check for update to".

A limited right user then open that same Firefox install, go to that same configuration screen, and the "check for update to Firefox" setting is checked (ie enabled) but grayed out.

about:config show that app.update.auto == true and app.update.enabled == true.

This obviously isn't right. I didn't check what would happen should an update be triggered (I'd need to hunt down an older FF and check for updates), but it's probably one of the following:

1) Worst case scenario: the luser downloads the update to the temp folder, but cannot perform the update a he doe not have the permission to modify the existing Firefox install. Result: a lot of wasted bandwidth quota (or even ton depending on the backoff delay).

2) Best case scenario: FF check write permission to the install folder before downloading the update, spit out an error message or not.

(Note: whether it's wise to disable autoupdate is irrelevant to this issue)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure FF not to check for update using a Windows admin account
2. Log on a limited right user account (aka standard account)
3. Check update setting
Actual Results:
Firefox will check for update on the limited right user account

Expected Results:
Firefox should not check for updates. A limited right user would not be able to install the update anyway.
