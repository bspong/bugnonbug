When I go to the Professional Video Equipment Listing which is under Cameras & Photo I see listing from the Consumer Electronics Listing for DJ Gear & Stage Lighting... ebay ha told me that Mozilla doesn't do some thing that it should with ebay (?) and Ebay told me that I should use Internet Explorer (I would like to use Firefox, thank you!). When I use IE... I see the video equipment listed in the Professional Video Equipment listing a it should be...and not the dj gear, etc. This problem ha ha continued now for about 2-weeks and ha occurred with the previous version of Firefox. I just downloaded the newest version yesterday.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to ebay
2. Click on Cameras & Photo
3. Click on Professional Video Equipment
4. Select Newly Listed in the Sort by: drop down box.
Actual Results:
DJ Gear is mixed in with the video listings.

Expected Results:
Should only show equipment that ha been listed in the Professional Video Equipment section!

Problem started about a week ago... and I don't have this problem using IE. Would like to know if others are having this problem. I have 2 computer here in my office the show the same problem... both XP computers.
