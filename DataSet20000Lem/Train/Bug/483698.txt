Settings to define at what time the subjective date turn over to the next date (the midnight is only by default)

Sounds a bit crazy, but my subjective date turn over not at the midnight, but at somewhat 05:00-07:00 AM. History pane (one opened by Ctrl+H) by default group visited site by objective date - so, it turn over (from "today" to "yesterday" and so forth) at the well predictable midnight. The infinitesimal annoyance this RFE is devoted for come from the fact, that at the 1st half of the subjective day I'm in the "business" mode - when *ALL* the site I visit are there for the business-related tasks, while for the 2nd half - I'm in the "fun" mode, where *majority* of the site are of the far more "private" taste than the former. So, when I'm trying to see and recall what I've done/where I've been today at the end of the business part of the day - I get lost in the trail of the yesterday's "fun" diversity :) And this happens every working day.

So, the feature of the great help could be a simple a to allow the Firefox user to set the turn-over time for his own subjective date, and then to do the per-subjective-date grouping taking that offset into account.

For sure one can put a great thought into this problem and design a affairs-profiling subsystem a well :))

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. work (in the net)
2. have fun late at night (in the net)

4. try to recall what useful have you done at the end of the next working day
