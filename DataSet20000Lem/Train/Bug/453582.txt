Failed to load Java Applet if plug-in is 1.6version with upgrade 6
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.648; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)
Build Identifier: FireFox 3.0.1

It is found that if I am using the 1.6x version of Java with upgrade 6, all the applet failed to be run. However, if I am using 1.5 version, it is okay. I finally solved this problem by installing 1.6 version with upgrade 7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Installing Firefox 3.0.1
2.Installing Java SE 1.6 U6
3.Using Firefox 3.0.1 to browse any website to load applet.
Actual Results:
Scenario1:
If I pressed a button, the javascript will call function from applet.
Scenario2:
I go to http://www.w3.org/People/mimasa/test/object/java/ and select the third item "Archived Java applet test, using attribute of object / using params". Nothing is loaded.

Expected Results:
Scenario1 :
Firebug show error if I try to pressed any button to called function from applet.
Scenaria2 :
Applet keep blank, it doe not like loading.

I am not sure whether it is the problem of installing Java plug-in while I am opening FireFox 3.0.1.
However, most of my collegues are having the same problem, ie. failed to load applet/javascript with the combination FireFox3.0.1 with Java 1.6x plugin of upgrade 6.

This is very urgent. If this is a bug, hoping that it will be announced to the public a soon a possible.
