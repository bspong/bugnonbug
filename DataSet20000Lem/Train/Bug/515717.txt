Bug 514796 discus adding relative tab parenting closing behavior to Firefox and it complication with user expectations. This is just to discus enforcing closing tab 'always right' or switching it to 'always left' regardless of preference or features.

I think i'm seeing some newly created odd close behavior when I'm trying all
the code path we've created factored in the same session otherwise the behavior hasn't really changed so much.

So, maybe we should just have someone cleanup or double check the current code
path of the current tab closing behavior and we should answer the following:

Do all code path close 'always right'?

Do we let 'switch to tab immediate' keep it 'always left', or change it to match 'always right'? Why is this a special case?

Do we enforce 'always right' behavior, or can we change it to 'always left'?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:
Turning on and off feature doesn't have consistent closing behavior.
Ie Relative Tabs, Switch to Immediate tabs, Target Links and New Windows, and Default behavior.

Expected Results:
Behavior is consistent.
