i set the main option to show my "windows and tab from last time" but when i reopen ffx i have lost my prior work. come on when are u going to fix this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a ffx window add a tab
2.close wdw
3.reopen and only a base tab appears, this is not what the main option to reopen prior tab says!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! can't believe this is not fixed yet even IE can do this now, come on guy


Expected Results:
get back my last window/tabs

this seems to basic to add more, even IE get it, but they missed the boat by not putting what u did in an OPTION to make recovering prior work permanent, but your program doesn't what it say - this ha gone on for year now

note that ffx restores prior work if one shuts the computer down, ffx reopens with an alert to reopen prior work, SO why can't you fix this basic bug to restore work when one close the program? wow email me if u need more info but i see this an ancient bug, that frankly is just making your system look bad it is so basic a others too have pointed out

PLEASE prioritize this, if nothing else it ha to be a PR issue at this point
