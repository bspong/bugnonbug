Ever since I upgraded to Firefox 2.0 I have the problem that my profile get corrupted (appearantly). This is a problem I only experienced at the dutch Mozilla-site http://www.mozbrowser.nl/forum/index.php. I'm one of the helper there, trying to solve problem for people that use Mozilla-products.
All of a sudden, trying to log in to the site (or trying to view another page) I get a blank page. The URL is correct (pasting it in another browser like Opera or Konqueror show everything correctly). A couple of week ago, I switched back to Firefox 1.5.0.9, no problem whatsoever (!). Since a week I'm testing Minefield and since today I've had the same problem.
Which can always be solved by creating a new profile. Unfortunatly it is not an "extension thing", tried that...

I've been experiencing this problem only at MozBrowser.nl-be, but I guess that's just because I'm a very frequent visitor of that site.

For those of you who speak dutch, you can read all about it on: http://www.mozbrowser.nl/forum/viewtopic.php?t=9086

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new profile and surf the web
2.After a week or so, on my favourite site I get a blank page, whenever I click a topic, or try to log in.
3.Only since Firefox 2.0 (and also with Minefield!)
Actual Results:
Clicking a link (on this specific site) turn up a blank page

Expected Results:
The page should be displayed (like it always did before)

It's hard to nail it down. It can happen after a few days, a week, or a week and a half (tops).
Like I said, creatin a new profiel solves the issue. Nevertheless, it is NOT an extensionconflict!
