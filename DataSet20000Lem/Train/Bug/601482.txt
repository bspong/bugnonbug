After installing version 3.6.10 I wa not able to upload any files, either in regular mode or SafeMode. When at a site such a Facebook, at the point that the pop-up window appears to browse my computer for the file, a soon a I'd click on any folder the pop-up screen would go blank and freeze and I'd have to close Firefox entirely. Since then I have uninstalled the current version and reinstalled the older 3.5.13 and have no problems.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any site where uploading file from your computer is possible
2. click the "browse your computer" button
3. click on a folder in your computer and watch the pop-up screen go blank and freeze.
Actual Results:
FireFox became non-responsive and I'd have to close the program

Expected Results:
upload the file to the website

I don't know if this is strictly a result of installing 3.6.10, or if it is a result of installing 3.6.10 after removing a TDSS rootkit redirect virus that attacked the older FireFox version I had on my computer last week. Version 3.5.13 is uploading fine.
