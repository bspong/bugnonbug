Mozilla Firefox -Ancestry.com Incompatibility Dialog.docx

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

latest java 6.0.30 compatibility needed.

I recently updated to Firefox 9.0.1 and now the Java Console 6.0.30 in add ons is disabled with a message "incompatible". This Java app is needed to run some feature in Ancestry.com and need to have the compatibility issue resolved. I have been corresponding with Ancestry.com tech support and they stated that it need the latest version of Java 6.0.30 in order to work correctly. Coincidentally, everything worked fine in my previous version of Firefox prior to this 9.0.1 update.


Actual results:

The problem is [while using Firefox 9.1.0] that I must click the "save" button in Ancestry.com and repeat the next pane command to "save as" multiple time before Ancestry.com actually responds in order to initiate the actual "save" function from the example I posted. It function normally in IE, Google Chrome and previous version of Firefox prior to the update of 9.0.1.


Expected results:

When I click the "save" button in Ancestry.com and the next pane command to "save as" pop up, it should execute the command immediately.

Likely other program online who are dependent upon Java 6.0.30 are affected a well.
