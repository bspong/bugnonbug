After clicking to select a full episode of The Office: Season Five, a new page load with an NBC splash screen. It's the NBC logo with a thin white horizontal bar underneath. The horizontal bar start from the middle and expands both right and left to show that the page is loading. The bar expands all of the way but nothing happens after that. The page stay with the logo and horizontal bar

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Arrived at The Office home page by typing "The Office" in Google, then clicking their I feel lucky button. (I don't feel lucky now. haha)
2. On the menu bar above the cork bulletin board, I chose Full Episodes under the Video menu
3. A page with the available episode loaded. I tried episode 519 first. I noticed the error when the page for the video didn't load.
Actual Results:
The horizontal bar start from the middle and expands both right and left to show that the video is loading. The bar expands all of the way but nothing happens after that. The page stay with the logo and horizontal bar

Expected Results:
The video player will load. Then, a few second later an ad will play before they show the episode.

I wa using Adblock Plus and NoScript the first time the error occurred. I disabled them both, restarted Minefield and tried watch an episode by following the same steps. It didn't work again so I cleared the browser history and cache and tried again. I still couldn't get the episode to load so I tried episode 518 because I know it worked with Firefox 3.1. Episode 519 work with IE 7.0
