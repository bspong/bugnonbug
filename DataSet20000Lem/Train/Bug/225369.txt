(Please update summary if necessary. I can't think of a good way to express this
in one line.)

Near the end of a document, PageDown may not actually be able to move a full
page down. However, nothing happens to show this happened, nor where the user's
attention should now be focused on the page. As a result, the user must
interrupt their reading to search through the text to find their place again.

There should be some hint about where the bottom of the page used to be. I
believe I've seen this feature somewhere before, but I cannot remember where.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Scroll to half a page from the end of a scrolling document.
2. Press PageDown, or click the appropriate trough on the scrollbar.

Actual Results:
The page scroll with no indication of how far it went.

Expected Results:
Displayed a hint of where the old bottom of the page moved to, for example a
thin line of white XOR'ed with the content that faded after a short time (~0.5
second perhaps.)

I have smooth scrolling off, but with it on, line move too fast for me to
follow well. I don't think slowing down the scroll speed is right, because that
would make it painfully slow in general usage.
