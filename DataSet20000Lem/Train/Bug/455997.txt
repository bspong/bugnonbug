Visiting these new spam site discovered at 6PM 9/18/2008, injects file into the host machine. I don't know the mechanism someone will need to to a process monitor session to see what is happening.
YRUGyS5t.exe.part wa downloaded into my Local Settings\temp folder in my window profile, so it appears to have invoked the download engine.
Here are 2 URLs that invoke this vulnerability:

Don't know if this is the previously reported Java Script Vulnerability or not. I don't have the time to do a full process trace today.
The reason I reported these site is to demonstrate that whatever vulnerability this is it IS in the wild and need patched today.
