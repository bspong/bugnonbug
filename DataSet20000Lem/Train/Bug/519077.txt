Add a whitelist+blacklist for the modified prefs list on about:support
The "Modified Preferences" list shown on about:support give way too much information about users. Several prefs can be used to gather various private information bit about user including download directory, printer names/IPs, filename of downloaded files.

Just looking through some of my personal prefs, I see the following prefs that can compromise personal information:
* browser.download.lastDir -- compromise home directory
* print.print_to_filename (various print.*.print_to_filename) -- compromise filename of last file downloaded using print-to-file
* print.* -- compromise printer name and/or IPs

This becomes really bad when combined with extension that store personal information such a usernames and password in prefs for use. We're making it way too easy for this type of data to be accidentally released to others.

This list of modified prefs should just be removed for now. One possibility might be to restrict it to Firefox-only modified prefs with some blacklist for prefs that are known to contain personal data. That way, private information from prefs that extension add is not compromised when user post this information on public forums.
