While getting my email done over at "www.gmail.com" Firefox just drop the SSL certificate for no apparent reason. Clicking refresh on the browser reactivates the SSL certificated, for the Firefox secure/encrypted connection identification icon show up again on the browser. This doesn't always work, sometimes the browser fails to recognize the SSL certificated at all, even though the URL is clearly "https://"

-This doesn't only happens at "www.gmail.com", it also happens to me over at "addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/" , "www.ebay.com" & "www.newegg.com"

-The only page that ha given me an in browser "This Connection is Untrusted" is "https://landfill.mozilla.org/bugzilla-tip/"

-My broswer Encryption Protocols setting
SSL 3.0 and TSL1.0 are enable.
-Validation option
Use the online Certificate Status Protocol OCSP & Validate a certificated if it specifies an OCSP server option are enable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit any of the website I have listed under "Details" ex. www.gmail.com
2.Just work on the secure page a you normally would
3.Oddly and at random time the browser will drop the SSL certificated and all visible representation other than the "https:://" on the URL, are gone.
4.80% of the time, clicking refresh on the browser reestablishes the secure connection between the browser and the server. Nevertheless, after a while it happens again.
Actual Results:
The secure connection between you and the server hosting the webiste is dropped. Most of the times, clicking refresh on the browser reestablishes the secure connection.

Expected Results:
Be able to recognize and maintain the secure connection.

-My broswer Encryption Protocols setting
SSL 3.0 and TSL1.0 are enable.
-Validation option
Use the online Certificate Status Protocol OCSP & Validate a certificated if it specifies an OCSP server option are enable.
