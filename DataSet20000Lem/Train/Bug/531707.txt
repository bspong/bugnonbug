When I attempt to check my Gmail inbox Firefox will hang for a bit, then I will receive unresponsive script warning dialogs. When I click to stop the script, the machine hangs, and another dialog box pop up. The box have content similar to the following:

"A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.
