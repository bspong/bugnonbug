If you open an inspect window from the web console and click Update, there should be no change in the display unless the object being inspected ha changed. In some case Firefox doesn't follow dictum and Update cause changes.

I don't know whether the original display or the post-Update display is appropriate, it depends what the intent is of the inspect window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a file containing "<script>var o=new Object(); o.a=1;</script>".
2. Open the file in Firefox 4/pre10.
3. Open the web console.
4. Type "o" to the web console.
5. Modify the file to contain "<script>var o=new Object(); o.a=1; o.b=2; </script>".
6. Reload the file.
7. Type "o" to the web console.
At this point the web console output should be:
o
({a:1})
o
({a:1, b:2})
8. Click on the "({a:1})". An inspect window show "a:1".
9. Click Update on the inspect window.
Actual Results:
The content of the inspect window change to show "a:1" and "b:2:".

Expected Results:
The Update should not change the content of the inspect window since no variable have changed since the window wa opened.
