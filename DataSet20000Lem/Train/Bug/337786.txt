Browser window becomes unresponsive on certain pages, though title bar still responds.

Sometimes when I'm browsing, a browser window will become completely unresponsive except for the titlebar. This includes the entire window (buttons, tabs, URL bar) except for button attached to pull-down menu -- the menu appear and disappear a normal.

It just happened while I wa looking at the Gentoo site (see URL) and I've verified that it's reproducible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. (optional) open up a few tab
3. Go to http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2006.0/handbook-x86.xml?full=1

Actual Results:
The site won't finish loading, and the browser window will not respond to anything, though the window's title bar will change to reflect what you're doing. You can, for instance, click on a tab, and the title will change to the title of the tabbed page, but the page won't change. Or you can go to a bookmarked site, and it look like the page is being loaded b/c of the title bar, but still nothing happens. Closing tab doesn't work either.

Expected Results:
Normal browser functioning.

This only happens in one browser window -- other window are unaffected.

There have been a few page like this (I'll amend this bug if I stumble upon any), and I don't remember if they finish loading or not. I'm using various extensions: ColorZilla, MeasureIt, Web Developer, Slogger, Google Toolbar and a few more. Greasemonkey is installed but turned off.
