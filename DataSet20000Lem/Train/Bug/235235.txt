browsing multiple pages, new mozilla dialog (search, remember password) hang firefox
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8

My setup wa this: I had two fire fox window open, each of them with about 6
tabs. One window had about 6 tab on the URL above (de.tikiwiki.org). That URL
in itself hang firefox while it loads. I opened up another tab and initiated a
search in the page. The search dialog wa un-usuable, no button did anything
and I couldn't close it (i'm on ximian2 on redhat9). Note that the browser wa
still usable, I just had this dialog box hanging around.

I came here to register an account and report the bug, and when it prompted me
if I wanted to remember my bugzilla password, fiefox totally hung, couldn't
close/click anything.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open up several of those complex url
2. open up a non-complex url
3. try to do something that cause a dialog pop by firefox (search, password, etc)

Actual Results:
Sometimes hang

Expected Results:
First, Firefox shouldn't hang - whether that be the 2 second hanging while
loading the above URL, or totally hanging with the dialog box

I marked this a a critical because it hang and caused me to loose my data :|
