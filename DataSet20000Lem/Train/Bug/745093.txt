esr-10: Win PGO build hitting 3GB virtual address space limit, failing with: "nsapprunner.cpp(3629 : fatal error C1001: An internal error ha occurred in the compiler. LINK : fatal error LNK1000: Internal error during IMAGE::BuildImage"
+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #709193 +++

You loved it a bug 709193, when we wound up closing trunk for several day and preffing off all sort of feature and landing various intrusive patch that removed big chunk of code and pulled various thing out of libxul; you're going to just flat out *adore* it now that we appear to be hitting the virtual address space limit on esr-10, where we can do none of those things.

I retriggered the build, which won't really prove anything either way, and I closed the tree in anticipation of more failure.
