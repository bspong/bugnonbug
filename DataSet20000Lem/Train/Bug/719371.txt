Selenium's webdriver stop working in Nightly build starting from 2012-01-12 because it us XPCOM proxies, which were removed.
Starting with the Nightly build of Firefox from 2012-01-12 the extension stopped working when using webdriver. Further investigation with tinderbox build revealed that one of the following changesets have been caused the regression in the extension:

Could this be due to the removal of the XPCOM proxy in bug 675221? The failure we are getting is:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80570015 (NS_ERROR_XPC_CI_RETURNED_FAILURE) [nsIJSCID.createInstance]" nsresult: "0x80570015 (NS_ERROR_XPC_CI_RETURNED_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://fxdriver/content/server.js :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 26" data: no]

David or Dave, can one of you please point u to the code of webdriver for this specific module?

Also I wonder about the following error sent by Dave:

Warning: Trying to re-register CID '{e26dbdcd-d3ba-4ded-88c3-6cb07ee3e9e0}' already registered by file:///var/folders/k8/h9q2wfcn6yxdsm_r9_l3fg040000gn/T/tmphm7IRP/extensions/fxdriver@googlecode.com/components/prompt_service.js.

Could this be related to the change in bug 715576?
