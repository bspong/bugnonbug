essentially some jerk programmer is using a built in pop up in forefox, and you don't know if it is corrupted or not. You can't click anywhere on it for fear of installing a virus or trojan, and you can't navigate away from the infected web site without closing firefox by the task manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. please read the forum post above.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
even pushing alt f4 doe not close the popup, firefox go into a loop that you can't get out of.

Expected Results:
This built in pop up should not be there and should be eliminated. Its use is being abused by others. There is no way I'm going to click on a questionable pop up that say "are you sure?"

pressing alt f4 should permanently close the pop up and the user should be allowed to navigate away without further interference.
