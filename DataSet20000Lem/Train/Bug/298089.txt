Firefox activates alien plugins
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Even though it plugin directory is empty except the manditory NPNul32, Firefox
activates a lot of plugin upon start - without asking me for permission.

It seems Firefox ha somekind of "OS-wide plugin finder" which look for plugins
installed for IE, Opera etc. and activates them, in addition to the plugins in
it own plugin directory. All those plugins then appear in "Options > Download >
File Types > Plugins" and are activated by default.

Problem is, I don't want all my IE plugins to be activated in Firefox. It's one
thing to preform such a search for alien plugins (which is a good thing), but
it's another to do it without asking the user, and finally it's simply
inacceptable to activate the alien plugins silently.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure some other browser like IE is installed, with some plugins;
2. Install Firefox and make sure the plugin directory is empty except NPNul32;
3. Start Firefox.

Actual Results:
Alien plugins found in IE's and other browser's plugin directory are silently
activated in Firefox.

Expected Results:
Prompt before performing the search for alien plugins and/or do not activate the
found plugins by default.

The plugin list a in "Options > Download > File Types > Plugins" ha a bug so
it "forgets" deactivated plugins sometimes. It seems related but not identical
to this bug, I'll file a seperate report.
