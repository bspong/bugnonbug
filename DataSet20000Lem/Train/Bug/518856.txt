Sometimes when attempting to print the checkbox for "print selection only" is greyed out. Other times, there is no Firefox option at all in the print dialog setting dropdown menu (usually every application ha it own special print setting available upon picking this option, including "print this selection". Sometimes, however, there IS this option and printing selection works. It appears to not be page-based, because a page that it worked on earlier today for me, http://www.nalip.org/nalip/NALIP-Resources-Insights.html#declaration
now doe NOT work. In fact i noticed this month ago but then this morning noticed that it DID work for this one page and thought it had fixed itself, but now, it doesn't work again for any page that i've been able to try.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any page with text on it.
2. select some text.
3. print, either via File menu or cmd-P
Actual Results:
There's no "Firefox" option in print dialog dropdown menu, or if there is, the "print selection only" checkbox is greyed out.

Expected Results:
There should be a Firefox setting area in the print dialog and it should include a print selection checkbox that is actually usable.
