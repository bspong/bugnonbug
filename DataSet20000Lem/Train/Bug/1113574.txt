UiTour: Hello FTE still think conversation view wa open even after it is closed
Created attachment 8539197

This bug is not reproducible every time, but I have hit it during testing enough time to figure out how to trigger it.

Note: I am testing with the custom build linked here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1080953#c31

STR:

1.) Open the Hello FTE which is currently on demo2 [1]
2.) When the hello panel is opened, click "Start a conversation"
3.) When the conversation view opens, quickly click the "copy" button, and then close the conversation view (as quickly a you can) before the room ha properly connected.
4.) Close the Hello FTE tab
5.) Paste the copied URL into another browser and click "Join the conversation" to start the video conversation.

Expected result

The Hello icon should turn blue and wait for the user to click the icon before re-opening the Hello FTE tab

Actual result

The FTE tab reopens automatically with the &incomingConversation=open param, resulting in the page displaying the incorrect state (see attachment).

The page can also end up getting a 'Loop:IncomingConversation' event with `data.conversationOpen: true` at an incorrect time, if you follow the above step but leave the FTE tab open.

I think it might be some sort of race condition between a room opening and the conversation view being closed. I've triggered it accidentally a few time but can reproduce it quite frequently if I try the above step :/
