location bar and UI while typing

Steps to reproduce:

I have several client certificate and a website "support.example.com:443" in my history that requires a client certificate to access it. I cannot make use of automatic certificate selection for this site and working around that will not change anything about this bug, so please keep those discussion in the ancient bug about how certificate selection is broken.

Repro:
I start typing a string into the location bar and a the suggestion UI open up and the site populates into the suggestion list, the certificate selection dialog open up.


Actual results:

Instead of letting me continue typing what I wa actually wanting to type, the UI steal all input, and in the worst case, is not noticed until I accidentally accept a certificate.

I speculate that this is either some sort of prefetching or refreshing of suggestion data from the actual site.


Expected results:

I expect that whatever functionality cause this dialog to pop up from background task like whatever it doe to not throw blocking modal UI at me while typing.

In the attached screenshot you can see the result of this. It got a far a processing the "sp" of whatever string I wa typing, and "s" ha my "support.example.com" site a completed site and a one of the suggestions.
