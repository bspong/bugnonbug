As of about 3 nightly build ago, the Cmd-Left and Cmd-Right accelerator no longer move the browser along the history. The history button a well a the History/{Back,Forward} menu item continue to work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
On a page with past page in the history menu (i.e. the back/forward button are enabled), press Cmd-Left to try to go back and Cmd-Right to try to go forward through the history.
Actual Results:
The History menu highlight when pressing the accelerator, a normally happens for such accelerators, but the browser doe not actually change the page being viewed.

Expected Results:
The browser should navigate one page backward or forward in the tab's history.

Please note: I originally added this a comment to bug 428760, but that bug seems to be different, in that the report there is that many key accelerator are not working. As for me, every other accelerator I've tried works, it's only the back and forward function which don't work.
