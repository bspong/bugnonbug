Ebay page refreshes instead of displaying photo enlargement of auction item

The most popular method of posting multiple photo of an auction item within
Ebay is to have a large photo window on the left & three (or more) thumbnail
image on the right of that large window.

Click the thumbnail and a larger view of that thumbnail image is displayed
inside the main photo window.

For the past few days, when I choose a thumbnail image to enlarge, instead of
immediately opening within that larger window, the page reloads (refreshes) and
I'm forced to choose that thumbnail again to make it appear in that window. At
that point, I'm free to view the rest of the thumbnail image a I did before
this problem began.

When the page refreshes, the main photo within that larger widow remains the
same a it wa originally (it doe not change to the image I selected).

I've tried viewing the ad normally, in tabbed mode, and in a new window but the
problem persists.

I haven't downloaded any new extension or program for ages, and I've
re-installed Firefox (over the original) but that ha had no effect on the problem.

Like I've said, this ha only been an issue for the past few days; everything
worked properly before that time. I hope you can duplicate the problem - I'm
stumped.

Thanks.
