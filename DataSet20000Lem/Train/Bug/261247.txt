When I maximise the program maximises about 50 pixel off the top of my screen...

This mean I cannot click on the minimize or close button at the very top right
of the window because they are off the top of the screen... Also the Status Bar
is drawn *twice* at the bottom of the screen.

I am running a Matrox Parhelia over three screens... this doe NOT happen when I
set the screen resolution to just one screen (approx 1024x768)... but a soon a
I set the screen re to anything that spread it over three screens, this draw
error occurs.

I really hope you can fix this a it seems like an excellent browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get a Matrox Parhelia 256MB graphic card...
2.Set Screen re to anything over 2400x600 (so that the desktop go over all
three monitors...
3.Then run Firefox and hit maximize...

Actual Results:
the window will then maximize off the top of the screen (by the number of pixel
of the titlebars height... approx 50 pixels)... and the Status bar is drawn
twice at the bottom (in the space left because the titlebar ha gone off the top
of the screen).

The only way to fix it is to set the browser to full screen mode then press the
"minimize" or "close" button that appears in the top right... unacceptable
basically.

Expected Results:
Maximized a normally (so that you can see the titlebar including the
minimize/maximize and close buttons).

The

I consider this to be a fairly Major problem a it *really* get in the way of
my use of the software... I need my window maximized.

I am tempted to go back to lousy Internet Explorer until this is fixed. :o(

Otherwise Firefox is an *excellent* browser
