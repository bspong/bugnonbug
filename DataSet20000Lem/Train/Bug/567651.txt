With some site that automatically update their contents, such a Facebook, clicking on the Stop ha no effect: the Stop button remains active (doesn't gray out), which is a problem when one ha chosen to merge the Stop and Reload buttons. If the mouse pointer is not over a link, the status bar permanently show something like "Waiting for static.ak.fbcdn.net..." (in case of Facebook). This bug seems to occur when there ha been some problem with the connection (such a an ADSL reconnection?); thus old request to server may not have been closed properly.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Facebook main page (e.g. "Fil d'actualité" in French).
2. Wait (maybe for several hour or days), reloading from time to time.
3. When the Stop button remains active for a long time, click on it.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens. Clicking on the Stop button several time ha no effect either. (In the case of Facebook, the site still update the page with new contents, but this is normal.)

Expected Results:
The Stop button should become disabled (grayed out).

This bug occurs both under GNU/Linux (Debian) and Mac OS X.

I've also noticed that after an ADSL reconnection, normal page loading never time out; this may be related.

Perhaps the same bug a bug 326757. If this bug is dupped, please set platform/OS to All/All.
