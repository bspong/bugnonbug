Firefox V2.0.0.3 becomes non responsive when visiting ebay. Specifically I search for a product when the listing come up of the product hit I than pick a product of interest and go to the seller site. When I am done reviewing the info and click to return to the listing of product Firefox becomes non-responsive and I have to exit out of the program. This happens every time I visit ebay.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to ebay.com
2. search for a product
3. select a product from listing
4. visit seller site
5. Return to listing - system crashes!
Actual Results:
Hourglass appears and Firefox becomes non-responsive.

Expected Results:
Should be able to go back and forth from the search result list to vendor sites.

When this happen the first time I received a message from Windows asking if I wished to report this error. I click on the yes button and the system came back with information indicating Firefox ha a problem with no know fix. I searched the Mozilla web site to see if this problem ha been previously reported and could find no reference.
