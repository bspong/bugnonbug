Steps to reproduce:

When i login to Websphere portal and try to launch the Firfox 17.0.6 applicaiton from the end server using X window application on port 22, before it used to work fine.

We are not sure why this is not working now.

If we try to move or Maximise or minimise the Firefox window it get smaller one. What ever we do to get to original it is undone.

We uninstalled and intalled Firefox no use the same issue repeated.
We uninstalled and installed Firefox 17.0.7 even then same issue, so rolled back to 17.0.6.

Please help u in resolving this issue.

Thanks and Regards,
