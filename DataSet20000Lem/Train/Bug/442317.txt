Text input with transparent background calculates highlight scheme from inheritance, not visual layout.

Visible in FireFox window and Linux variants.

When a text input field ha a transparent background, Firefox calculates the selected text color and background highlight from the DOM inheritance. It should calculate these color from the visual rendering of the page.

For example, a page ha a black background, and a text input ha a background color of transparent. Then, the input is given an image background that is white. When a user try to highlight text within the field, the text change color, but the highlight box is white (to offset the black) and so is not visible. This look very odd.

In the above situation, Firefox Mac properly render a light blue text highlight, but Firefox Win render it white (FireFox Linux also render it white). The visual effect look like the text is not actually selected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a text input field with the CSS background property set to "transparent" in a containing element with a dark background color (#000).
2. Give the text input a white background image.
3. Enter some text in the field.
4. Click and drag inside the field to select the text.
5. Observe lack of appropriate highlighting.
Actual Results:
Text is highlighted with white, which is not visible due to white text field.

Expected Results:
The text should exhibit a contrasting color for the highlight. It should know that the actual value of the text field background is white (from the image) even though the inherited background color is black (from the body).
