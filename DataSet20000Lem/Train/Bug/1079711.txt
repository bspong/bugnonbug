New syncing tool introduces major security flaw
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140923175406

Steps to reproduce:

Enable device syncing.

Once enabled across your device it only take one device to fall in to the wrong hand for a mere few minute or for a hacker to gain access to your computer via other means.

Once they have access to your machine they can get access to your master password file and extract the mozilla syncing account password

Once they have done that they can set up a device on your account that forevemore syncs to your account and thus learn all your password when they are changed what site you vsit and all the other data the syncing tool share accross device

syncing should be disabled until this major design fault is rectified.

It is even possible for a user to setup syncing without the target knowing it in operation and therefore track them.

Lots of terrorist state such a the USA would love this.


Actual results:

Reveals password and browsing history to 3rd party. Allows for ongoing tracking of a user detail


Expected results:

Syncing should never have been deployed in such a way a it force a user to disable the master password.
