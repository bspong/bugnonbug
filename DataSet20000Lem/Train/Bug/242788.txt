Hovers not working in menu within Firefox or for link on web page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Firefox 0.8 worked fine for 2 month but just yesterday, hovers stopped working
in the Firefox menu and on web pages. What happens is the menu item will
highlight briefly and then go back to normal within a second. On link in web
page the cursor will remain a pointer but any kind of hover event like
colouring or putting the link in the status bar will reset within a second just
a in the menu items. I can honestly say that I did not install anything
yesterday. I am running Windows XP Pro SP 1 on an IBM Thinkpad T23, 1.13GHz
with 512MB of RAM. I tried running the install again hoping that I could reset
FF but to no avail. I will try uninstalling and reinstalling next.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
My cube neighbour ha not yet experienced the same problem. I am pretty sure
that this is an isolated incident but IE work just fine and the menu in all of
my other application are responding normally.



Expected Results:
Highlight menu item and web link until you have clicked or moved off.

No crash or themes... clicking on the link or menu item doe the expected
action (goes to the correct page or run the function), just the hovers aren't
working properly. It greatly reduces the functionality of some web sites,
a:hover is a standard event to code style for, but basically it is just a nuisance.
