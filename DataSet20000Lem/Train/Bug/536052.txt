Won't load page from my Google searches, "problem loading page" screen with random, incorrect url.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

Each time I do a search in Google and I click on one of the link in my results, I get redirected to a "problem loading page" Mozilla screen (with the try again button), but when I look at the url, it is a random string of letters.

For example:
A Google search for "firefox nor loading pages" brings up this url a the first result (www.techsupportforum.com/...firefox.../371661-firefox-not-loading-some-pages-fully.html)
When I click on it, I get taken to the "problem loading page" screen and this error message ("Firefox can't find the server at newserversearch.com.")

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.google.com
2. Type in search term
3. Click result
Actual Results:
I get taken to "problem loading page" screen

Expected Results:
It should have taken me to the webpage.

If I copy the address from my Google result and paste it into the address bar, the page load with no problem.
