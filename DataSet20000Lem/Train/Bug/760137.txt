Weird issue: Firefox window size dependant on interface speed?!
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120423122928

Steps to reproduce:

Debian linux kiosk setup: Firefox is started a the sole program in an x window. No window manager etc. Machine is booted via PXE. Root is NFS.
Called command: /usr/bin/xinit /usr/lib/firefox8/firefox-bin -P surfen -- /usr/bin/Xorg :1.0 vt3 -logverbose 15 -config xorg.conf.1280x1024

Installed addons:
• Custom Geometry - should fix geometry to e.g. 1280x1024
• Public Fox
• Reset Kios
• R-Kiosk
• Full Fullscreen



Actual results:

Depending on the ethernet switch used between the server and the (pxe) client, the interface either auto-negotiate 100Mbit or 1Gbit.
When Gbit is negotiated - the firefox window inside the X-window will not fill the whole screen (1280x1024) but rather be 1024x768 in the upper left corner.
If the switch is a 100Mbit model, then both the X-window and firefox window will be 1280x1024.
This is really reproducible!!


Expected results:

Well, the firefox window should be 1280x1024 every time, because custom geometry should fix the size (via javascript) to 1280x1024. At least it should not be dependent on the NIC speed!
