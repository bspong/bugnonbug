A browser window open with no bookmark in the bar, and the home page doe not display. The address bar doe not function. The only way to navigate is by clicking the doodad at the upper right to go to the Firefox home page. Also, the green "updating" symbol show up in the menu bar and doe not disappear.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Double-click an Internet shortcut TWICE. The Internet shortcut must be configured to open Firefox.
Actual Results:
Here's what I think happens: Two browser window open. One is functional and show the opened web page. The other is the dead window a described above.

Expected Results:
Two copy of the web page should have opened, both functional (unless the browser is configured to open all web page in the same tab and window).

I believe a sentence to the effect of this bug ha appeared in at least one magazine publication. I have not yet downloaded Firefox 1.5.
