I upgraded Firefox to version 2.0.0.9 some day ago. The problem is a follows: after the installation surfing wa fine, a usual. When surfing wa finished, i closed the browser. Several minute later I restarted the browser, which instantly told me, that Firefox cant find the page, i use to open first (i.e. Google). I tried another page - same response. I have to completely reinstall Firefox and then it works. The problem: when i close the browser and reopen it again the same procedure a descrivebd above happens/is necessary to get the browser to work. As i told: that did not happen until version 2.0.0.8. Can you help - please?! P.S. This doe not happen with the Internet Explorer from Microsoft.
