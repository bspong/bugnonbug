When going to website with untrusted connection, Firefox displays: "What should I do?". If I click on "I understand the risks" and then on button "Add exception...", a popup opens. I close it immediately, and then keyboard and mouse are not working any more in Firefox, except for some operation like click on bookmarks, which are opened. If I click in urlbar to set cursor, cursor doe not appear. Neither in search bar. And I can't click any more on field in page to give focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to website with untrusted connection, like https://savannah.nongnu.org/
2.click on "I understand the risks", then "Add exception..."
3.close popup

Actual Results:
Keyboard and mouse are not working any more, except for some mouse click (like bookmarks).

Expected Results:
Keyboard and mouse still ok.

This doe not happen with Firefox 3.1b2.
I can't test on Linux right now, I will do later and add comment on this bug.
