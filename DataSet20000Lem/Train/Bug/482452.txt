When a tooltip is displayed one some page (due to a title="..." attribute e.g. of an <acronym> or <abbr> tag), the same tooltip is displayed when hovering over a button (at least <input type="submit"> and <input type="reset"> ar affected).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to e.g. http://www.google.com/ and hover over the submit button -- nothing happens and that is OK
2. In a new tab, browse to a page where tooltips may appear; for example http://www.redeker.de/main-V2.php/en/recht/reach.html
3. Hover over something that cause a tooltip, in the example given above hover over "REACH" and you'll see an explanation of the acronym.
4. Go back to the other (google) tab and hover over the submit button again.
Actual Results:
The tooltip last seen on the other page is displayed.

Expected Results:
No tooltip should display.

The error occurs also after the page/tab with the original tooltip ha been closed. Since a user may have thought that such trace of information are not visible to later user after closing a "suspicious" tab, this *may* be considered a security problem.
