With Firefox set a the default browser Expression Web state it isn't the default html editor
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When opening the MSFT Program "Expression Web" it continuously told me it wa not the default HTML Editor.
After checking numerous registry settings, one user at that forum discovered it wa an issue with Firefox's "check if default" browser mechanism, which he said set an improper value in the registry.
