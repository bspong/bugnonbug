Firefox will not allow some plain text file to be viewed inline

Most text file available by http can be viewed in firefox. But some text file do not open in firefox. Instead a "Opening <name-of-file>" dialog appears and allows the file to be opened with a helper app (e.g. gedit) or saved.

It would be really nice if these file could be viewed in firefox itself (most other text file are viewed). At the least there should be a "view a text file inside firefox" option in the "Open with" pulldown menu.

An example of a page that cannot be viewed inline:
https://cvs.khronos.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=628

Note: the dialog identifies this a "plain text document" so firefox know what it is. There is a menu item in the "Open with" pulldown menu named "firefox-3.5.9" but it doe not work. It open a dialog that say

/tmp/EGL_NK_swap_region2-1.txt could not be opened, because an unknown error occurred. Try saving file to disk first and opening the file.

Saving the file and then opening the file in firefox work fine. But it is inconvenient and seems like firefox could simply open the file on it own.

Here is an example of a URL of a text file that work fine (for comparison):
http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/half_float_pixel.txt

Thanks!
