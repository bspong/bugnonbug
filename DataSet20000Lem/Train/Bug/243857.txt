Secmod.db (containing absolute path) is not migrated properly

In the file "secmod.db", alsolut path are stored. These are not updated during
the automatic migration of the Firefox 0.8 profile to Fx0.8+ profile.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. use a fresh user profile of your OS (no phoenix/firefox profile there)
2. Launch Firefox 0.8, let it create profile
3. Open a SSL encrypted Web site
4. Close Firefox
5. Launch a current nighty, let it migrate profile, close again
6. compare secmod.db of both profile

Actual Results:
both secmod.db contained these lines:
Eingebaute Wurzelmodule

Expected Results:
The migrated on should look like one created by the nighty build:
Builtin Roots Module

Step five above only work if Mozilla Suite is installed, gotta file a bug for
that one, too. :(

I verified the existence of this bug on i686 Linux, too, so marking it
"Platform:all, OS:all"

This bug might relate to the following bugs:
