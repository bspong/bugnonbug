The www.openstreetmap.org site serf map image tile from the tile.openstreetmap.org server. These tile are updated dynamically and if you browse a tile which is old then the backend code return a tile with a 30 minute expiry time which give the server some time to re-render the tile.

It seems that FF is not caching these tile with 30 minute expiry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse map at http://www.openstreetmap.org in Minefield
2. Zoom in to street level in some area of the map
3. View page info and look through image in media.
Actual Results:
Some of the tile image are listed a 'not cached'.

Expected Results:
Every tile should get cached for at least 30 minutes.

It appears that maybe the browser is confused because of DST which mean that the declared expiry time is < clock time in UK BST. An example tile retrieved from the server:-

=> `/dev/null'

[ Note: the specific URL above may well return other expiry time since it will get rendered at some point and then will get a 3 day expiry time set. ]

Above the local wall time is 19:45 BST (Europe/London which is currently UTC+01:00 due to daylight saving) The server declares the tile to be served at 18:45 GMT with expiry at 19:15 GMT. The browser seems to treat this a uncacheable.

If I tweak the backend server code to pas back +90 minute a the expiry then it get cached OK. It look like the browser is ignoring the timezone in the response date/time. Alternatively maybe the browser think GMT is the same a BST when daylight saving is in effect, but this is not true, GMT is effectively the same a UTC even during daylight saving.
