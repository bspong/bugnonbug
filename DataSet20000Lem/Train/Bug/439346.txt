When I try to login to this Bank of America Account after I enter my userID, the browser wa supposed to take me to another page where I can see the "security image" and a field to enter my password. But in Firefox 3, after I enter my User ID and click "Enter", the browser thows in this error message.

Firefox2 work perfectly and Safari work perfectly also. I tested this problem with Firefox3 RC3 also and the problem still persists.

I wa able to access the Bank of America online Banking usign Minefield without any problem till about 10 day ago. I updated Flash to version 9 (the latest player) a few day ago and I am not sure whether that created the problem. I deleted and reinstalled the flas player and the problem still persists.

I created a new profile and tried to use the BofA online banking using the new profile, the problem still persists.
