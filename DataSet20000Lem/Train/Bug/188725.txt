Very strange functionality of the Go Menu.
If I click on it once, I get a list Back, Forward, Home plus ten history items,
then an item called History.
If I click on Go a second time, correct GUI technique is that the menu should
disappear. It doesn't. Instead it draw a smaller menu containing just Back,
Forward, Home and History. Clicking Go on the menu bar subsequently, cause the
mini menu to always appear. Only after the tenth click doe the menu disappear.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Go - note the menu
2. Click Go again - note the menu
3. Continue clicking go - note what happens

Actual Results:
Incorrect appearance of the Go menu which doe not comply with the basic
principal of the Windows GUI - ie. click a menu bar item once and
corresponding the menu should appear. Click a second time and it should
disappear but leave the focus on the menu item still

Expected Results:
First click on "Go" - show the menu, second click on "Go" hide it but keep focus
on that item on the menu bar. Third click - show it again, fourth click - hide
menu drop down, keep focus on menu bar item
