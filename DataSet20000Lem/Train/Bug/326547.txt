This ha started to happen for me lately. It may have been introduced in 1.5

I tried this in "save-mode" and with java and javascript disabled.



Here is an example site: The content type seems to be invalid, so it open in a web page. (The page doe not render, but "view source" show that it ha loaded a lot of binary crap.=

Click MP3 file. (left "sound icon") (http://swedia.ling.umu.se/Ljud/Gotaland/Halland/Frillesas/fri_ow_red_pb.mp3)


press "back"

click the MP3 file again.

CRASH

(You can also try to the link directly, and press reload.)



There seems to be other bug related to content type too, like some
type are always asking for which program to open in, and so on.
(And were did the setting to NOT open adobe document inline go?)
