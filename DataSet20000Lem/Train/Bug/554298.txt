I use firefox a my default web browser for internet.

But since release of 3.6 i am facing some bug in this new version.

Normaly at my work I access internet through a proxy server.

But eventhough i am part of a domain at work, usualy i use my laptop a admin and internet i access through proxy.

When using version previous version ( 3.5..) When i try to connect to internet it asks me for proxy log in detail and then i could navigate normaly.

But i face problem after i installed version 3.6 ( i tried also 3.7) that after i start browsing it asks me for login detail and if i try to open another page it request again for proxy details.

It keep requesting for every page. I have even used remeber password option and it automaticaly completed but i have to press several time OK.

Just to be sure that it wa not happening to my computer only i tested on 10 of my colleague PC and the result is the same.

If i log in in domain i don't face this problem.

It is present in network with domain.
