Steps to reproduce:

i tried downloading file from there: http://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/dlform.php



Actual results:

after clicking some 6 file (and all are in progress) i wa no longer able to click more file and the browser did not respond any more on my clicks.


Expected results:

the browser should have offered me a download target location and let me continue with selecting more files.

it supposed there is a server limit for ongoing transfers. but then when that limit is reached it fall back on the UI behaviour of the browser by making it partially in-responsive to any click. i would rather expect to allow the browser to queue those my request including my desired file target location and start over with the additional transfer one after the other _on it own_ when some other transfer have finished or on some timed shedule.

blocking the UI's responsiveness is probably sub-optimal. so i hope that can be improved in one way or the other.
