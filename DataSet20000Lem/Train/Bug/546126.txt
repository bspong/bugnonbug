'Older' saved Firefox page will not open in 3.6! (or just in basic design).

I use a lot of saved Firefox webpage in my archive. After installling Firefox 3.6.0 from 3.5.7 on my Mac OSX 10.6.2, I wa not able to open any old saved page anymore. By double clicking on the icon nothing happened. By Using 'File>Open' I could reach some newer pages, but the older one just came out in a sort of basic design. As this is some kind of disaster fro me I quickly re-installed 3.5.7. Is this going to change and is this a temporary bug for 3.6, or are you leaving the possibility to be able to backwards open older saved pages? that would be a shame indeed..!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an 'older' (say 3.5.7) saved webpage from the drive by double clicking.
2.Nothing happens..
3. Use 'File Open' and select the same page..
Now it opens, but with older page (say 2008 versions, just in a basic design).


Expected Results:
I want to be able to open older saved Firefox page in full design and by just double clicking the Icon. These page have always been 'backwards compatible' readable. Please restore that in 3.6

Please see 'details text'. I'm currently using 3.5.7 again, but the described problem is about 3.6.0 !!!
