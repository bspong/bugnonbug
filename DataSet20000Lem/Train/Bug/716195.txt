Aurora becomes unstable while downloading a file if an error script occurs.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:11.0a2) Gecko/20120105 Firefox/11.0a2
Build ID: 20120105042010

Steps to reproduce:

I am running Mozilla Aurora 11.0a2 (2012-01-05) on Mac OS X 10.6.8.

I wa browsing Google Images trying to find an image that I can download. I have downloads set to ask me where I would like to store them every time. When I finally found the image, I clicked on it to view the image in full size. I right-clicked the image and got stuck in the Finder box asking where I'd like to save the file.

The URL for the image can be found here: http://www.google.com/imgres?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=firefox-a&sa=N&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial&biw=1440&bih=680&tbm=isch&tbnid=2Daa8xwq9UGqrM:&imgrefurl=http://moongazeponies.deviantart.com/art/Rainbow-Dash-Derping-204280977&docid=e504ewr9L_Nn6M&imgurl=http://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2011/099/5/b/rainbow_dash_derping_by_moongazeponies-d3dmg7l.png&w=873&h=915&ei=r9wHT-2fDYPc0QGL8JmYCg&zoom=1&iact=rc&dur=292&sig=104203876298851133092&page=1&tbnh=137&tbnw=131&start=0&ndsp=21&ved=1t:429,r:13,s:0&tx=90&ty=45


Actual results:

As I wa about to download the file, I got an error message stating that there had been an unresponsive script on the page. The Finder menu already opened and wa asking me where to save the file. I wa unable to switch between tabs, none of the button on the Finder menu were functioning (including 'Cancel'), and 'Yes' or 'No' on the error message about the unresponsive script were both not responding. I had to kill the Aurora process using Apple's Force Quit Applications menu.


Expected results:

I should have been able to cancel out of the Finder menu, and respond to the message properly. I wa not able to do either.

I do not have a screen capture of the error message; I thought I took one but I did not.
