Mozilla is suceptible to a malformed string from the spy virus Loverspy
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98) Opera 7.20 [en]
Build Identifier: All

When a mozilla-based browser, such a firefox, is used to access web-based html e-mail under window XP, it is suceptible to infection from the Loverspy virus. The loverspy virus is a trojan that a user sends via e-mail to a targeted computer user. The user is enticed by a greeting card, and open it. Microsoft Internet exploder and virus...I mean outlook express, are susceptible when they are used a direct mail clients. This is typical!

However, with the latest, and all other update of mozilla firefox, I found by accident, that the virus, which I think is sent a a cab file, auto installs on any machine at the click of a mouse, just like an active-x virus. On html-based webmail, such a that from a web hosting company, clicking the link to the "attachment" automatically downloads and open the virus, which self-executes, and utlizes ntvdm.exe to send out e-mail.

Mozilla need to ask to save the file (or whatever it is), and or, scan it. It appears to be a malformed string issue, a bug in windows, but it pass through mozilla flawlessly. Yes, loverspy is an old virus, from around 2003, but sometimes when a voyeristic employer get stupid, it resurfaces!

Please be careful, the fed are after the guy that use and create it.
