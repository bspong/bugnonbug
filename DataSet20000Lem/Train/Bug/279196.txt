keyboard and screen lock up when scrolling using right-hand slider
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier:

I have an IBM T20 laptop running XP/Pro. The keyboard and screen sometimes lock
up when scrolling using right-hand slider. The problem occurs with Firefox AND
Mozilla, and on various web pages. I have never experienced the problem with
any other application, including IE. The problem ha been occurring ever since
I moved from IE to Firefox, about 2 month ago. I later loaded Mozilla, and had
the same thing happen.
I can't reproduce the problem every time, but it happens 2-5 time a day. I
spent an hour or so going through you bug database, but I can't find anything
that exactly match the the symptoms. I would have expected such a problem to
be more system than application related, but I have NEVER had this problem
occur with any application other than Firefox or Mozilla.

When the problem occurs, the only way I can recover is to reboot the PC.

Sadly, I have had to go back to IE for the time being!
