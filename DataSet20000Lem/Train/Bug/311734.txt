When visiting web page that have a table background specified like this:
Table.mainbg
{
background-image: url(ligerbot.png);
background-position: -2 bottom;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
The image mark up the left border of the table until the affected region is
hidden perhaps by scrolling. I believe this is an Engine problem a the same
thing occurs in the Netscape browser a well. Best if tested on a 56k a the
page load more slowly.
An example screenshot of this can be viewed here:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit this page first (to load 'ligerbot.gif' into cache):
http://www.bearcreekfire.com/zoids3d/home/index.html
2. View this page http://www.bearcreekfire.com/zoids3d/media/dvd/index.html but
keep the scroll to the very bottom a the image load. You will notice the
tracking effect.
3. To remove the effect, just page above until it can't be seen anymore, then
page back down.
