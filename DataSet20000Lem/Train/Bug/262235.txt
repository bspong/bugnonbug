Fresh install on Win XP finish properly, I start the program and Windows XP show it under process but not under application in task manager.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/0.10/Firefox%20Setup%201.0PR.exe

The machine in question is a Dell OptiPlex GX260 (2.4 GHz P4 - 512MB RAM)
I had previously run version 0.9.2 a a test but left it for OS Integration
issues. I had uninstalled the previous version with XP's Add/Remove Programs
and then searched through the registry and deleted all Mozilla/Firefox references.

Downloaded and installed 1.0PR today (Sept 29, 2004) allowed the application to
be launched by the Installer. The application never appeared. Checked the task
manager and the process Firefox.exe wa running with aprox 14MB RAM, 0% CPU. I
restarted and launched the application directly from the install directory to
the same resuly.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start application
2.Check Task Manager to see if process is running
3.

Actual Results:
Firefox never run

Expected Results:
Should have opened browser

Nothing I can think of... I receive no error messages.

I'd really like to start using this broswer at work for web development.
