While a download is in progress and the "Downloads" view is active. Often a drag of a browser window (by the title bar) will cause the browser window to move to the position of the "Downloads" window instead of to where the drag terminated. This only happens when a download is in progress and the "Downloads" window is open. Further it doesn't happen every time the browser window is dragged but often.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the Downloads window and a browser window
2.Start a download. (e.g. http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/a/2/9a2182b3-44a4-44c0-8fe1-03f39f81fff0/RDC200_ALL_Beta3.dmg)

3.While the download is in progress move the browser window around by dragging it title bar. Be sure to release the mouse at the end of the drag.


Actual Results:
When the mouse is released the moved browser window will sometimes jump to the position of the Downloads window instead of where the window wa when the drag terminated.

Expected Results:
When the mouse is released the moved browser window should stay where in the location it wa in just before the mouse wa released.

I've noticed this behavior on many version of Firefox 1.5, 2.0. It doesn't happen all the time. Once it start happening it easy to reproduce in the sense that many (more than 50%) of browser window drag will be affected. Once the download completes the behavior ceases. It probably ha something to do with the update being made to the Downloads window (title change?) while the download is in progress.

Its annoying a all get out. ;-)
