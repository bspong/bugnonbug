When making use of the entry in the right-click context menu, the Back and
Forward menu entry are only enabled if the currently-viewed page ha a
back/foward history - otherwise, those menu entry are disabled.

However, if an extension is installed that add a context menu entry that
contains a submenu, and the cursor is placed over that entry to expand the
submenu, then both the Back and Forward context menu entry are enabled,
regardless of whether or not the page ha a back/forward history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension that will add a right-click context menu entry that
contains a submenu for more function (such a Tab Mix Plus, Linky, View
Formatted Source, etc.).
2. Right-click on a page that either ha no history, or either back or forward
history (but not both).
3. Move your cursor over one of the extension-added context menu entry that
ha a submenu.
Actual Results:
The Back and Forward entry are both enabled, regardless of whether or not the
page ha a back/forward history.

Expected Results:
The Back and Forward entry should only be enabled if the page ha a
back/forward history - otherwise, they should remain disabled.
