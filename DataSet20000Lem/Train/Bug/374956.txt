prfxxxxx.tmp file cause corrupt Windows profile during migration to new domain and refuse deletion.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)
Build Identifier: Firefox/version 2.0.0.2

We moved to a new domain and the user profile were created new in the new old user profile so they would appear the same for their profiles. Several system would intermittently revert back to a generic temp profile when the user sign on. Micro$oft tech support found that the prfxxxx.tmp file were causing an error during the migration and these were associated with Firefox browser and are java related. When we removed Firefox (1.5 to 2.0.0.2) on the system this problem ceased. I WANT MY FIREFOX BACK AT WORK!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Move to another domain with a new profile created for you.
2.Roaming profile on some will not remain what you have set them up to be. Intermittently, the user will not get his roaming profile, but doe get the temp profile on his HDD.



Expected Results:
We had no problem exporting the bookmarks, but these prfxxxx.tmp file should allow the product to move into a new profile on another domain without corrupting the new profile.
