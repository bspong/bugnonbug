Occasionally/Usually, when I'm surfing, and I click on a link, the download button appears out of nowhere asking me if I want to download "x" file when I never clicked download at all or there isn't a download button whatsoever. This shouldn't happen if your just clicking a link, which make me suspect it's some type of bug? or maybe an add-on conflicting with another?

Example:

I don't know if this random request to download is severe or not, but I'll just take the careful route

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a random site (kongregate in my case) (Happens on a lot of other site a well)
2.Click on a link
3.Half or more of the time (in my case), a random download appears out of nowhere asking if you wish to download the "script" or whatever the extension of the file is
Actual Results:
Either half or more then half the time, I'm asked If I want to download "x" object when I never saw any link to download whatever it wa it asked me to download

Expected Results:
I expected the browser to take me to the link, and not ask me to download whatever
