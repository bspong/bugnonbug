Build ID: 20150806001005

Steps to reproduce:

log onto a clean version of firefox ... open face book ...
scroll it, read some story and look at some photos...

during the use of facebook the firewall report repeated invasions/port scanning...

this only happens with facebook (verified) including happening after ip change from ADSL adapter reboot (but only after opening facebook)


direct memory manipulation and driver injection suspected...


Actual results:

kernel error ... security key mismatch... system closedown/crash...
driver error, memory leak, registery fail with inability to boot windows...

multiple fails, the last of which made me re install window because it failed my update to window 10 and window no longer worked...

i found a cure but it involves manually altering system file before boot in hirans bd
because the error happened to window 10 and the first time it did both my system restore point and my registery where fucked...

at that time there where no restore point (i had made about 15 by then because of what happened to window 8.1)

i suspect a virus but no virus found....
direct memory manipulation and driver injection suspected...


Expected results:

clean system
