Minefield crash on session restore
Created attachment 273150
sessionstore.bak - last changed around the time of the crash

This ha turned out to not be reproducible, so this may just be closed invalid if this isn't terribly informative.

I wa running Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.9a7pre) Gecko/2007071904 Minefield/3.0a7pre.

1. Opened the Macbook, bringing it back from sleep. It had to get on the network, and started Minefield.
2. Minefield began loading all my saved tab (several tab in three separate windows). Some of these were bugzilla tabs, and those tab started to hang during their load.
3. Then Minefield crashed.
4. Re-started Minefield again, and again a crash.
5. After this, my firefox 2.0.0.5 that I'd brought up to search bugzilla and look at the brakepad report also crashed, then parallel crashed a I started that application.
6. I rebooted my computer and now all is well.

The talk back report are:

The stack leading here is the different, but end in nsVoidArray::GrowArrayBy(int) each time. I think it must be a memory overwrite issue that caused the crash due to the unstable nature of everything else after the crashes.
I'll attach both the sessionstore.bak and .js to this bug.
