This missing simple feature is very annoying. It might be a enhancement, and I do not know whether people reported it.

1. Open any web page. Suppose this page ha more content than the window can display, it default starting location is from the top and a scroll bar show at right to let user scroll to the content which can not be shown inside the window.

2. Suppose user ha done reading the content in current window. User then move the scroll bar(at right) to move page up so user can read more on the page.

3. Now if user clicked the link and go to another page, then click left arrow or just Backspace to go back to the same page again, user expect to see what he wa seeing before(that mean the scroll bar position is remembered and page is scrolled to this position).

4. Two results: if the web page is written in English, it work a expected. However, if the web page is in Chinese, it doe not work. It ALWAYS go the the top, not the current position.

5. This feature work fine in IE(6.0 and 7.0). This is one thing preventing me using Firefox. Because that mean every time I go back to same page, I have to adjust(move the scroll bar) to the position I had before. When the page is too long, this is not an easy job.

6. This bug exists from the beginning of Firefox. I am surprised to see that it still exists now.
