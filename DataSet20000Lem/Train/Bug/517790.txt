Early last night, I wa browsing for the lyric of a song (which happened to be the first time since I've reinstalled).

Upon reaching on the URL provided for the demonstration, Firefox jumped up to ~600mb before I closed it.

I tested this 3 times, to make sure it wasn't just firefox misbehaving, however, the exact same thing happened each time.

Today, I cannot seem to recreate the incident, however a friend of mine who visited the link say she had a vb script pop up to try and install.

During the memory leak, several trojan were downloaded and installed (without any notice obviously), only this morning I found out that my computer wa behaving abnormally.

The memory leak allowed for the vbscript (or trojan) to be downloaded and executed on my computer.


The 2nd possible link which seems to cause a spike in memory/cpu use is

Additionally, a website popped up (the fake A/V) which requires you to cancel or press Ok in order to leave the website. (Advertisement)
