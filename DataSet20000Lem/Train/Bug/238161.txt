If using a Wacom Pen on Mac OS X with Firefox, the scrollbar often get 'stuck'
to the cursor when dragging scrollbars (it follows the cursor even when not
being clicked on).

Clicking again unsticks the scrollbar, but then Firefox will refuse to open any
new url and there will be artifact over the tabs. Opening the about window
seems to interupt this behaviour, and allows me to continue browsing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a Wacom tablet pen (e.g. Graphire in my case)
2. Drag a scrollbar a long distance e.g. a long page.


Actual Results:
Scrollbar becomes attached to cursor, even though it is no longer clicked/held on.

Expected Results:
Not allowed the scrollbar to follow the cursor.

The Wacom tablet is on the default settings, apart from having set the pen to
'mouse mode'. This problem occurs with every version of the Wacom driver,
including the latest version.

Firefox is not running any extensions. Camino is also affected by this problem,
but far le frequently.
