Office 97, Excel97, WORD97, Visual Basic 6.0 will not "load" after installing FF0.9.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.5; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: "FireFox 0.9.1" downloaded and installed 062904

I downloaded and installed FireFox 0.9.1 today (062904).
Installed to FF default directory.
I did not elect to set FF a default.
Both FF and IE5.5 appeared to operate satisfactorily following FF install

Computer: Dell C800 Latitude
OS: Windows 2000 SP4
Browser: Internet Explorer 5.5 SP2; Q832894 (programs had problem with IE6.0)
e-mail: MS Outlook
Network connection: SBC DSL
Network software: RASPPPoE

Later I attempted to open Excel97, then WORD97 and finally Visual Basic6.0
During each of these attempt the "loading" would seem to freeze. Finally
Task Manager showed "not responding".

I completed the following:
Norton AV - no virus found
Defrag drive and partition
Used Task Manager to "clear program"
Rebooted several time after using Task Manager.

I uninstalled FF 0.9.1 completely, restarted computer - Excel97, WORD97 and VB6
all "load" and "work" a expected.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reinstall FF 0.9.1
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Normal FF and Net connection

Office 97 program do not respond and load

Expected Results:
Office97 program should have loaded and ready to operate

I would have to conclude Office97 program crash after FireFox 0.9.1 ha been
installed. Office97 program become "reworkable" after FireFox 0.9.1 ha been
UNINSTALLED and the computer rebooted.
