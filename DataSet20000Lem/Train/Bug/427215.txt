Both version 3.0 beta 5 nor 2.0.0.13 have trouble reaching some http server after installing 3.0 beta 5.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13

I have one pc with window 2000 installed on it and Firefox 2.0.0.13. Works OK using a wireless connection (802.11g) I then installed 3.0 beta 5 in another directory (standard one provided) and it work with most HTTP server of site I visit, particularly large server and server parks. There are a number of site that are able to load the first page although sometimes partially. Any additional page are not being served, unless one wait several minutes. It then is possible to load one more page. This behavior is very consistent. The happened to my 2.0.0.13 Firefox installation. Another pc with Windows XP that us the same network is not affected, that pc only ha 2.0.0.13.

The problem can be worked around by setting 2.0.0.13 again a the default browser and then restarting the pc. The problem can be recreated by setting 3.0 beta 5 a the default browser.

The http://www.dvhn.nl lik is a regional newspaper in The Netherlands which is very consistent in not serving more than one page at a time with 3.0 beta 5. There are many other site too, but not the big site like Google or Slashdot

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install 3.0 beta 5
2. visit site mentioned above.
3.
Actual Results:
server timeout error while server is functioning properly

Expected Results:
page displayed
