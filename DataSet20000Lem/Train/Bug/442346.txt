There is currently an advertisement (seen at many websites) for a 'Koi fish 3D screensaver thingy'. Whenever I arrive at site with this advertisement firefox grab all the CPU cycle. I have a laptop and this force the CPU temperature way up and then speed stepping switch in. If I hit one of these site by accident I have found that the most reliable way to get out of it is just force an 'end task' on firefox via task manager. I have now managed to track down that if I turn of 'java script' in firefox then when I return to the webpage that had the advertisement the advertisment doesn't show up - and hence my system doesn't (to all intent and purposes) lock up. So really this ha something to do with the way firefox and javascrip are interacting with that particular advertisement.
