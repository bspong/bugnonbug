Firefox start blank instead of homepage/restoring tab after crash
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2
Build ID: 20120215223356

Steps to reproduce:

1. I have disable the crash report of firefox, I have set the crash report enabled=0 in the application.ini file
2. I have disabled window 7 check for solution, Start > All Programs > Maintenance > Problem Reports and Solutions, in the Problem Reports and Solutions window, and clicked Change setting > Advanced setting > Turn off problem setting
3. I have disabled the the window error reporting alert message, I have set in the registry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\DontShowUI to 1
4. I added firefox to the window scheduler to run infinite time and to restart every 1 minute in case it crashes.



Actual results:

When firefox crash (it can be simulated by just ending the firefox process in the task manager) it get restarted from window 7 scheduler but it show always a white page (about:blank), the configuration option of "When firefox starts:" "show my home page" and "show my window and tab from last time" are ignored.


Expected results:

Also if firefox ha crashed, when it restarts the chosen option in the "When firefox starts" should be respected and either the home page or the previous window and tab should be shown.
