I have three background image that are being Tweened-In on the home page; or Tweened-In when clicking on the Title "Vizion Designz." The Background Images are displayed properly in Internet Explorer, Safari, and Chrome, but NOT in Firefox. Firefox display a white line at the bottom and will not display my background images.

Please go to http://www.viziondesignz.com in different browser to see the difference. The site wa build with Flash CS4, ActionScript 3.0. Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Home Page
2.Click on Vizion Designz button
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox will not show three background image that are being tweened-in. Further Firefox display a white line at the bottom of the stage. IE, Safari, and Chrome do not have this problem.

Expected Results:
If you go to this page in Firefox, you will not see the background image tweening-in (left side of Logo) and a white line at bottom of page. If you view http://www.viziondesignz.com in IE, Safari, or Chrome it display a it should.

I consider this a major issue. All browser except Firefox display this page correctly. Further this site is developed in Flash which used by many web-developers and is a problem that they may run into.
