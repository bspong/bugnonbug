If a normal window ha been brought forward above the Preferences window, then
the Preferences window is not visible and the Preferences Menu Item (on the
phoenix menu) is greyed out. The user might think that the Preferences feature
is not implemented! If the Preferences window is allowed to be non modal (a
somewhat brave decision), then there should be a good way of bringing it frontmost.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a working URL such a <URL: http://www.mozilla.org >
2. Choose Preferences.
3. Click on a part of the window not obscured by the preference dialogue

Actual Results:
The Preferences Window effectively disappearedm with no obvious way to
bring it back. Phoenix doesn't have a Windows menu

Expected Results:
Possibly nothing. Perhaps it should not be possible to switch away from
the preference dialogue without formally accepting or cancelling the
changes.

At the least, there should be a menu item somewhere that restores the
Preferences to the frontmost position. Maybe the System-provided Phoenix
menu doe not do this.
