I got 2 problems.
1) When i try to changhe my privacy setting (https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy )the page keep loading and reloading like if I were keep clicking on "refresh" button

2) When I open from the notification menu (the icon with the globe) a "tagged photo" notification, it should open like a preview in theatre mode, but it stay like that only for few second and then ff4 go directly to the tagged photo's fb webpage, instead of stayin in "theatre" mode (as you can see from the url in the image i'm providing below). Here's how the tagged photo opened form a notification should be visualized http://img29.imageshack.us/i/immagine1vk.png/ <--- I used chrome here, because with that everything work ok so it's a ff4 issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open notification of a tagged photo
2. wait for the photo to be shown
3.
Actual Results:
The photo is shown in "theatre" mode just for few second and then ff4 close it and go straight to the very own page of that photo

Expected Results:
should be stayed in theatre mode
