Huge slowdown opening new tab after opening "Go" menu
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0+

I have noticed that after I click on the "Go" menu on the main window, then
middle click link to open page in new tabs, Firefox sits for 5+ second with
the CPU at 100% before the tab will even appear. As long a I stay away from
that menu, tab will appear within a second of middle clicking a link.

This is consistently reproducible at, for example, the mozillaZine forums. If I
middle click the first two Firefox forum links, they open almost instantly. If I
then open the "Go" menu, then middle click the second two Firefox forum links,
it will hammer away, struggling to open the tab and start rendering the pages.
It's almost acting like it's parsing the entire browser history for each page load.

Note that I am using a Pentium II 450 MHz with 256 MB, so this may not be a
noticible on a P4. I also usually have my history retention set to 21 or 30
days, which may or may not be a factor.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open "Go" menu
2. Middle click some link to open new tab
Actual Results:
Tabs open and page render slowly

Expected Results:
Tab opening and page rendering should operate at normal speed
