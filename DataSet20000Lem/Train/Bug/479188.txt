If you have saved tabs, and they have been restoring when firefox is restarted and after computer ha been restarted and you open firefox from a link (ie email) all saved tab will appear along with linked tab. Now you have the original saved all tab when you x out plus the new tab open from a link (ff is the default browser). When you x out now ff doe not ask you to save (current session tab for restart or quit) it just politely quits and you lose your saved session tabs. In addition they do not show up in today history and they were not targeted today. This ha happened to me twice recently since the last update. I would rather see a fresh instance of FF start on a link click than lose my saved tab that i wa using for research or browsing purposes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.close firefox with multiple tab open and select save and quit
2.click on link that will cause FF to open and should have link from save and quit
3.close FF will not get quit ff prompt and all saved link will not appear next time FF is started
Actual Results:
link lost, however in history
It is possible that a restart/poweroff is necessary before performing step 3

Expected Results:
expects quit ff prompt to save tab
