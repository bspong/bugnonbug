OOM crash on code.org tutorial running in a VM
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_3) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/50.0.2661.94 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox is experiencing a browser crash (full crash, not just an error) on a Code.org tutorial that worked fine in past version and which work on other browsers.

The exact point of the crash is somewhat unpredictable but the following sequence of step crash very reliably in FF 46.0 and FF 46.0.1 running on a Saucelabs Windows VM. (It doe not crash in OSX.)

1. Go to
https://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/4/puzzle/4?noautoplay=true
2. Click OK
3. Drag the "Get nectar block" inside the if block and click Run.
4. Refresh the page when you get to the completion dialog.
5. Click Run again.


Actual results:

Browser crash at some point in the repro step above, display the "Firefox ha crashed dialog". Before the crash, sometimes error are visible in the console, suggesting memory corruption. At different time I have seen error about "out of memory", "corrupted PNG", and also invalid scripts, while in fact these resource all appear to be be valid.

I note that FF 46.0 includes security fix to the Jit; is it possible that one of these introduce a memory bug (use after free, double free, etc.)


Expected results:

Browser should not crash.
