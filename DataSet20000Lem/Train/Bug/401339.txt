The input field, where I can enter an URL to go to doesn't work a I well know it from FF under Windows XP.
Example: I am visting any URL (e.g. www.heise.de) and then open a new tab. The new empty tab is focussed and the URL input field still display the URL of the former tab.
When I click to any link, the content of the URL field is not updated. There is always the last information I manually entered there.

Another curious thing: the back navigation button is without any function: I cannot go back to last visited page.

Is there maybe anything wrong with the installation on ubuntu 7.10? I have used the standard upgrade function from 7.04 to 7.10,
