After "bookmark this page" is clicked:
1. the 2-pane --bookmark manager-- should open.
2. the --properties for "new bookmark dialog"-- should open , with the new
bookmark title/url filled in.
3. after that the behaviour should be a the current --properties for "new
bookmark dialog--:
4.the bookmark is placed and can be dragged to anywhere/anyplace right away.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:





advantage:
1.Less dialog, just 1 manager.(and all dialog box are quasi finished, no extra
work)
2.--add bookmarks-- dialog can be removed. (reduce overall codesize)
3.The added bookmark can be dragged anywhere in a folder in contrast to now,
where it's automatically placed at the bottom of the list, inside the folder.
(ergo, easier to use for users)

Because of the simplification for the user/code I request ?1.0 and if the BM
fixing is in progress right now than ?1.0beta shouldn't even be too unrealistic.

request ?1.0
severuty major may be over the top, but that's just to draw attension to this idea.
