Provide an option menu preference for toggling the tab opening behavior
The option menu should provided a preference for user to toggle the new tab opening behavior. The new behavior is a drastic change from the tab opening behavior that ha been in Firefox since probably the beginning. A real discussion of this wa not really talked about in the bug implementing this change.

The exposed preference to toggle this behavior in the option menu would compliment the existing preference located here to alter the default tab behavior and in turn allowing the user more customization of their tabs. With such a major change to the behavior of tabs, an easy way to revert back to the "old way" would be the best thing to do here instead of a hidden preference.

I do not like adding preference to the UI a much a the next guy but how about doing this for at least the 3.6 release so that existing user can easily customize the tab opening behavior to their liking. After 3.6 is release we can remove this from the UI since existing user would have already toggled this to their liking and new user will have started out with this behavior and would be le susceptible to changing this behavior. Please don't WONTFIX this bug due to the previous suggestion alone.

FWIW, IE7 and 8 provide a option to do this in their option menu.
