I have a data in a grid fassion and i wanted to select col1 and col3 and col 5:

I do the following test case in order to select:
Press Ctrl+ (Select the cell in Col1 using the mouse
Hold the key
Press Shift key too and select the next col in Col2 it can select only one cell
in the entire col2


i dont know what you call this a a additional feture to select single colums or
feature to select mutiple column on the table

if this feature could be extended to have multi select of cell it will be kind
of you people

Reproducible: Always
