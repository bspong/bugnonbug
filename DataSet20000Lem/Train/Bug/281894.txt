All product page that use an add to cart .js scrpit to not put anything into
the shopping cart. Product page that do not have this script do work. I
realize that a bug ha been reported that firefox doe not put product into
shopping cart, but no one ha mentioned that it doesn't work when the script is
present but doe work when the script is not present. I thought this might help
you to narrow down your search for a fix. Please fix ASAP a customer using
firefox cannot buy my product and I need to pay my mortgage <smile> Oh
also,... Product is added to cart using IE and Opera

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click add to cart, box come up stating that item ha been added to cart
2. click review cart
3.

Actual Results:
Cart is empty no product ha been added

Expected Results:
Software should've added product to shopping cart

I feel this is due to firefox having a problem handling the java script used to
post product to the cart. Possibly the javascript feature doe not work correctly?
