I have set in the Windows desktop the font color to White.
When using Firefox I notice that every text in the tabulars, menu and open-file-screen also use the font color White. This result in invisible text.

Steps to Reproduce:

In Firefox the tabular font is not similar to the background font, but the text color is. It is ackward that the combination backgroundcolor and fontcolor is not combined together.
