Even with domain guessing off, address bar flash guessed domain
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

1. Turn off domain guessing a per http://www-archive.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/domain-guessing.html - i.e. set:

browser.fixup.alternate.enabled = false
browser.fixup.alternate.prefix = an empty string
browser.fixup.alternate.suffix = an empty string.

2. Into the address bar, enter a domain without the "www." prefix. For example, "example.com". This domain must serve content from http://example.com/ (i.e. not be a redirect.)

3. Press Enter.


Actual results:

The address bar change from "example.com" (what the user entered) to "www.example.com" for a short period of time [1] and then change to "example.com".

[1] I'm not sure what the "short period of time" is exactly. Is it until a connection is made with the server? Until the first byte is received? Until the page is rendered? etc. I don't know.


Expected results:

The address bar should not change from "example.com".

Additional notes:

It *doesn't* appear to be the case that Firefox change the address bar to www.example.com, then load www.example.com, encounter a redirect to example.com, then change the address bar to example.com.

At least, using the "Live HTTP Headers" add-on, Firefox never request www.example.com, and only request example.com (what the user entered.) So this appears to be some UI weirdness, rather than e.g. not respecting the user's domain guessing settings.
