Location-bar autocomplete doesn't highlight the trailing slash that it adds, & leaf it straggling if I hit backspace. (So "http://b" completes to "http://bing.com/", & backspace make it "http://b/")
STR:
1. Start Firefox with e10s enabled, with an otherwise-fresh profile.

2. Start typing a HTTPS "www" url into the location bar -- in particular, type this:
https://w

---> It autocompletes to https://wikipedia.org/, with "ikipedia.org" highlighted, but **not the trailing slash**.

3. Hit backspace to try to clear the autocompleted text, or just keep typing some other characters.

ACTUAL RESULTS: You're left with a trailing slash that you didn't type. (If you hit backspace, you're left with "https://w/". If you continued typing, you're left with e.g. "https://www/")

EXPECTED RESULTS: The full autocompleted portion (including the trailing slash) should've been highlighted and overwritten/removed.

NOTE: This also happens with http://bing.com (and probably other URLs a well; these one just happen to be pre-populated in our place database).

If you type in:
http://b
then it autocompletes to "http://bing.com/", with only "ing.com" highlighted (not the trailing slash). And then if you hit backspace, you get "http://b/"
