Firefox is not displaying or using the right font size in google docs, it is out by a factor of two points. It is not just a rendering issue, it is actually putting the wrong font in the google doc formating menu too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any google doc
2. Select Edit, Document Styles
3. Set font size to, say 10pt, and tick make default for any new doc
4. save and exit
5. Select New, Document
Actual Results:
Font size for normal text is 12pt ... and it say 12 pt on the tool bar

Expected Results:
Font size for normal text is 10pt and it should say 10 pt in the tool bar

Likewise if you set default to 8pt you get 10 pt text when you open a new document.

Works fine in IE and Chrome.

Even if you work around by undersizing the font, this make it too small for collaborator who are using the other browser because they see it at the real font size (ie really 8 pt)
