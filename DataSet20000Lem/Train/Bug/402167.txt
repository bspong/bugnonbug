any site whic requires previous registration to access feature ignores auto-login status, and requires re-entry of password on first time access fro imported l'favorites' list. I have no listing in the 'bookmarks' a of yet

EXCEPTIONS: 1. the site 'www.demonoid.com' absolutely refuse to recognize either my current password or a previous one.
2. The site www.zap2it.com TV listin g site allowed auto-access to my persoalized grid, after re-entering my password, a above. However, whenever I try to access the home page of that site, I get an error screen which say error for an unknown reason.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. attempt to access site requiring registration by hittig button on 'favorites' list
2. initial access to site requires password reentry (SEE ESCEPTIONS above)
3.
Actual Results:
except for the 2 site a noted, using the extra screen firefox provides seem to are-establish the auto-login feature

Expected Results:
auto login and memory of password should have occurred.

another site seems to have forgotten my password, but allows entry after I answer the 'test' question previously established.


NOTE: while writing up this bug report, I tried to test access to other sites, to confirm the above. After 3 such sites, I wa unable to return to the report, and wa forced to start over.

I can't answer question below about 'theme', I have no idea what that is.
