Its very hard to make the bookmark search go away.

After clicking the show bookmark and history icon next to Firefox Central, I can't get it to go away unless I do a long boring process. Until I do it Minefield refuse to do anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Show Bookmarks & History.
2. Try and click anywhere outside the small window. You can't get it to do anything. You can't even click Show & Hide Bookmarks so you can't get rid of the panel.

Actual Results:
Minefield refuse to do anything.

Expected Results:
Minefield should either close the panel and continue with normal work or allow the user to continue with normal work while the panel is still open (I think the latter will be better)

What you have to do to close the panel and allow Minefield to continue:

1. Click Show Bookmarks & History.
2. Click >>
3. Click Organize
4. Close the organise window.
5. You can now do thing in Minefield. This is how it should be. Show Bookmarks & History will now close the panel HOWEVER you need to click it twice. Once to contract the panel, which hide the search but doesn't return to small size, and again to finally get rid of it.
6. You need to click Show Bookmarks & History twice to get the panel to reappear.
