Steps to reproduce:

I walk-through a large code base indexed by OpenGrok. Few file are huge. For instance, a file I work on everyday is of size 2.7MB(yes this is a very old and very large project)

If I open the same file in multiple tab for cross reference, firefox easily grab more a GB of memory.

I use firefox 45.0.1 over Windows 7. Please find the attachment for about:memory Measurements.


Actual results:

For the same static files, the separate DOMs were created leading huge memory occupation. For the above mentioned 2.7MB file, on a single tab it occupies, 250+ MB, so if I open in four/five tabs, voila!, 1.5GB is reserved.


Expected results:

Would it be possible to use same DOM across multiple tabs, if the file are same.

if there is a manual provision to mention or group tab by hand, which can use same DOM tree, that would help me a lot.

may be with some sort of url matching, tab with similar DOM tree can be made to use lesser memory, not just for static files.
