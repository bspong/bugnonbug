something happened. i have no idea what. but if i type www.google.com, for exmple, into the address bar it come up in my history drop down thing, because i use it frequently but when i click on it the browser doesn't go anywhere. the green arrow is there but it's useless. the only way i have now to go to a site is to use the google toolbar to search and then click on the result that i need or use a book mark. not very handy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open browser
2.type in url
3.hit enter
4.wish longingly for some way to make the browser work correctly (there is no go button, i can't even get into about:config to see if i can poke a round and get it back to the way it was. I really don't want to have to reinstall firefox again. this happened before and i reinstalled it and lost everything.)
Actual Results:
it's just like typing something into a text box...nothing happens when you press enter


Expected Results:
the browser should navigate to the url i entered

the browser doesn't crash it just becomes useless for 88% of what i use it for.
