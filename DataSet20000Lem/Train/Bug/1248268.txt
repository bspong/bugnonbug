Firefox Nightly 47_0a1 Recently Bookmarked.png

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
Build ID: 20160214030236

Steps to reproduce:

I did not do anything particular, my Nightly 47.0a1 just self-updated just right now and I just accepted to restart the browser to apply the updates.


Actual results:

After the browser restarted, I noticed that "Recently bookmarked" thing with several recently bookmarked bookmark appeared in my bookmarks, occupying the top slot and wasting space.


Expected results:

The way to disable this thing a I don't need this.

I use Firefox few year already and never in my life have seen this thing before, until now, but the post on Google show it appeared in 2008 already, so I guess there ha been already a way to disable it before and I had it disabled all the time until the newest Nightly appeared and somehow reactivated it (without my permission). But how to disable it again ?

I tried to disable it, but it seems that you can not turn this off, a I searched Google and most of the solution were to delete it by clicking on it and selecting "delete" or by going to Library by clicking on "Show all bookmarks" or Ctrl + Shift + B and deleting "Recently bookmarked" folder but this doe not work in the both case - when I click on it, there is no "delete" option a there is when clicking on regular bookmarks, and in the second case there is no "Recently bookmarked" folder in Library.

There are the link I read after typing "firefox delete recently bookmarked" in Google:

I also tried on a default profile without add-on (except Ad-Block), but no success.
