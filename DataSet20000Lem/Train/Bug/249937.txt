When I run a Windows application that go fullscreen at a low resolution (e.g.,
640x480 like most shareware games), every single open Firefox window, including
those that are minimized, shrink down to 640x480.

This is really a problem with Windows; however I have seen plenty of Windows
application that behave better. At a minimum, Firefox should probably ignore
resize message coming in from the system if the window is minimized.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 3 firefox windows; minimize one, maximize one, manually resize the third
to just smaller than the screen.
2. Run an application that go fullscreen at 640x480. The one I just used wa

3. Exit that fullscreen app and check out the Firefox windows.

Actual Results:
All the Firefox window were resized down very small, however their window
position did not seem to change. The minimized window remained minimized; i
didn't see that they had been resized until I deminimized them.

Expected Results:
Maintained original window sizes.
