Restoring tab from history overwrites tab already open

When attempting to reopen tab lost to a close of Mozilla (where the "You are about to close X tabs" did not appear) via the History menu, I opened several tab that I wanted individually.

Then, I attempted to select multiple History entry with Ctrl+click and selected "Open all in tabs" from the right-click drop down menu. This opened all the tab I had selected, but actually navigated to the selected URLs on the tab I already had open.

The Back button on the overwritten tab show the page that wa navigated away from and I can get back to that using the middle-click function, but surely it would be better to "Open all in NEW tabs" when using the History menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new session of Mozilla
2. Open tab individually from the History menu
3. Select multiple tab from the History menu and select "Open all in tabs"
Actual Results:
Selected multiple tab all opened, but navigated away from the URLs of the individually opened tab before opening any new tabs.

Expected Results:
Opened all the multiple selected tab in new tabs, not altering the tab already open.
