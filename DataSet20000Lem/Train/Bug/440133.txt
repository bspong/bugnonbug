If I compose and send a mail with gmail using latest firefox version(3.0), and right after that I write a web address on the address toolbar and switch to it, firefox freeze and it memory consumption start to increase.
This memory consumption seems endless(caught one at 1.5gb).

This doesnt seem to happen with any other webpage
This doe seem to happen only after sending an email with gmail(not after checking one) and it happens if I switch to ANY webpage, tested it with 10 different ones.
This didnt happen with yesterday's latest 2.x firefox version

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Send a mail thru gmail
2.Change to a different website without switching tab
3.Enjoy watching firefox eating every corner of your RAM.
Actual Results:
Firefox froze.
Its memory consumption started to increase.

Expected Results:
Not freeze and, at least, try to not take more than 1gb of my free memory.

No complements, addons, themes, nothing installed, just raw firefox.
