Basic Auth detail are not sent pre-emptively
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030730 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1

RFC2617 say "A client MAY preemptively send the corresponding Authorization
header with request for resource in that space without receipt of another
challenge from the server."

All version of IE, Netscape, Opera, and Mozilla *do* choose to preemprively
send Auth headers. Firebird 0.6.1 doe not; instead, it only ever sends auth
header in response to 401 challenges.

The behaviour cause broken behaviour in the Zope CMF, and probably other web
application which assume pre-emptive auth headers. You could correctly argue
that these application are broken in their assumptions, but (a) why change from
the default behaviour in all other browsers, and (b) always waiting for a
challenge is wasteful and will increase latency.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit a site which us basic auth
2. log the HTTP header
3. note that in Firebird, any request to that address / realm will always need
two requests, because credential are not sent pre-emptively.

Actual Results:
Digest of HTTP Headers:

> GET /Firebird.html
< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

> GET /Firebird.html
> Authorization: Basic AWRtaWrtZmJHLHltdxJXZ1I=

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Expected Results:
> GET /Firebird.html
> Authorization: Basic AWRtaWrtZmJHLHltdxJXZ1I=

< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
