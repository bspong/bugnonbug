The way Explorer 7 and Firefox handle ftp directory is different ( who is at fault I leave to your judgment )



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

A good example is on one of my supplier web sites.....
http://www.abatron.ch/products/debugger-support/gnu-support.html

On the right hand side under more information is a link to a directory tree of support file

If I follow the config link
ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/
It show the Config and Setup directory
So far so good work the same in Explorer 7 and Firefox
but if I now select Config

in Explorer 7 it show the sub directory fine and I can follow down to the file
in Firefox 3.0.3 it doe not show any subdirectory or file

Both show ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/config/ in the destination box
But if I cut and paste the above ftp into firefox it show what I expect

A little more experimentation show that on the page ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/
the link down to the config level show a

ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/config

Without the last forward /

Explorer will display the content correctly with or without the / but Firefox need the following slash

although when going down from the web page it show that / in the destination box it doe not seem to action it

if when firefox doe not action the slash you hit refresh it seems to work OK

I don't know it that's something the web server ha control over or is something in my Firefox setting .... but I did take a look around and could find nothing
