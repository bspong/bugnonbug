The Clear private date window (from Tools) always show the "Cookies" checkbox unchecked (unless I explicitly check it).

This seems rather odd to me a I can't imagine something more private than cooky that I would want to clear.

If I check the cooky checkbox and close the Clear private data window (or press the CPD Now button), upon a second opening of the CPD window, the cookie checkbox is still unchecked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Clear Private Data Window, check the cooky checkbox and press Clear Private Data now.
2. Browse some more, make sure to aquire some cooky (just about any site)
3. Go again to the Clear Private Data window from Tools.

Actual Results:
- Upon first, and every other opening, the Cookies checkbox is always unchecked.
- Even if a precedent action checked the Cookies checkbox, it will still remain unchecked upon further opening of the Clear Private Data window.

Expected Results:
I would expect the cookie checkbox to be checked by default or, at least, the Clear Private Data window to remember the last usage and keep the same checked/unchecked status.
