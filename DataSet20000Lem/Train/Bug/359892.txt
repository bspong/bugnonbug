Open an RSS feed drop down menu from my bookmark toolbar right click on an entry to bring up the context menu, the correct menu appears (with choice such a open in new tab, new window) it is then covered over by a second context menu (the same one that occurs if you right click on a normal web page in the browser window.) By left clicking on another part of the window this second context window disappears. The first-opened context menu remains until you click on one of the option in the menu. Similar thing observed if yu try to open the right click context menu either over a tab or the menu bar

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have RSS feed in bookmark toolbar, open feed to get drop down list
