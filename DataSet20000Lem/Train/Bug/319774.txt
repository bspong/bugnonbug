FF 1.5 not useable when profile is stored in LAN

When I try to use FF 1.5 with a profile stored on another client in my LAN (workgroup without server), FF need a long time for starting up (about 2-3 minutes) and often hang (all few second for 1-2 minutes) while browsing. It doe not matter, whether the cache is stored locally or in LAN.

Before upgrading to FF 1.5 I completely removed FF 1.07 and did a fresh install. Also I tried it on a PC with a clean XP install. I used the FF 1.5 profile manager to create the new profile in my LAN and this first startup always last about 5-10 minutes. With a profile stored locally all work fine.

When I reinstall FF 1.07, everything is okay like it wa before FF 1.5.

The LAN is 100% okay, because there are other apps with LAN-Access and they all work fine, but they also hang a long FF 1.5 is running!
