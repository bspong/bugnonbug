When a valid bookmarks.html doe not exist in a given profile, Firefox doe not
create one. Attempting to Bookmark a page will bring up the dialog, clicking OK
will add it to the Bookmarks menu, but not close the dialog and not write it to
a file. Import work the same way. Exitting and restarting the browser will
then yield no bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move bookmarks.html out of a given profile.
2. Start Firefox and attempt to bookmark a page (note that the dialog will not
go away when clicking OK, but will add a bookmark to the menu)
3. Exit and restart Firefox, no bookmark again.

Actual Results:
Default bookmarks.html is not created and no bookmark are saved.

Expected Results:
Default bookmarks.html created if it doesn't exist within a profile on browser
start.

This behavior changed between 0.9.3 and 1.0PR. We noticed it a a part of using
firefox with a portable profeil (the -Profile switch). Normally, Firefox
successfully creates a profile in an empty directory. With 1.0PR, bookmark now
fail.
