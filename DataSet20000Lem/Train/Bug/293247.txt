In the 20050506 nightly build on Mac OS X it very hard to open sub-menus of a
menu of Bookmarks in the Personal Toolbar. This is *not* a problem with
sub-menus of menu attached to the main menu bar: these work a expected. I have
a number of bookmark menu on my Personal Toolbar. Most of these menu have
sub-menus. In Firefox 1.0.3 I can open these sub-menus by mousing over the name
of the sub-menu (which highlights) then moving the mouse right into the
sub-menu. In nightly build 20050506, I open a bookmark menu and highlight the
sub-menu name a before, but when I mouse right to open the sub-menu what
normally happens is the sub-menu I am trying to get to disappears and the name
of the menu on the Personal Toolbar is highlighted (i.e. focus is lost on the
main menu). I can sometimes get to the sub-menu, but this is extremely hard to
achieve, often taking 10-20 attempts. I never had this problem in 1.0.3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the Manage Bookmarks dialog, create a folder in the Personal Toolbar
Folder. Create at least two sub-folders within that folder and add bookmark to
both of them. Close the Manage BookMarks folder.
2. The new folder ha appeared a a menu on your Personal Toolbar
3. Attempt to navigate to and open one of the bookmark in the second
sub-folder. The first sub-folder is often accessible.

Actual Results:
Very difficult to open the second sub-folder of bookmark

Expected Results:
Should be a easy to open the second (and subsequent) sub-folders a it is to
open the first.

Vanilla install of nightly build 20050506, but with AdBlock extension installed
(I don't believe AdBlock is the culprit)
