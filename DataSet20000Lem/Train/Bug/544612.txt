After requesting text output and submitting a form, I receive the expected text in Firefox. Looking at the source (ctrl+u) also display text. When trying to save the output using "Save Page As...", instead of the expected output, it save the previous page (the initial form). This seems to happen when output of form ha content-type unknown or text/plain, the HTML and XML output seem to work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://amigo.berkeleybop.org/cgi-bin/amigo/term_enrichment
2. In the first text input (Input your gene products), enter: "YAR003W YBL007C YBL002W YAL034C"
3. In the second text input (Input your background set), enter: "YAR003W YBL007C YBL002W YAL034C YAL034W-A YAL035W YAL036C YAL023C YAL024C YAL025C"
4. Select the "SGD" option (Select the database filter).
5. Click on "[Display advanced result options]"
6. Select: "all result (no threshold parameter applied)"
7. Select: "tab-delimited file"
8. Click "Submit Query" and wait for output.
9. File->Save Page As...->Save
10. The saved file is the previous HTML page.
Actual Results:
The previous HTML page is saved.

Expected Results:
The current text-based page should be saved.

This seems to occur regardless of whether the content-type is unknown or text/plain. However, text/xml seems to work correctly.

Also, even though viewing the source just show text, saving from there also actually save the previous page.
