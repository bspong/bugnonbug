it seems that the table have multiplied leaving a very small space for the
window, and no address ability, no ability to cut and paste my bookmarks.

i have created a new profile, however the problem still remains of getting the
bookmark from the old profile. i have gone to the folder for the old profile
and the bookmark are gone.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.i switch to the old profile
2.i open firefox safe mode or regular, it doesnt matter
3.voila! it is there

Actual Results:
i tried installing a patch which made the window a bit larger, so i did it again
and again, but no improvement from the first install.

Expected Results:
i dont know. i hoped it would fix it. i am using a new profile to write this,
but the problem remains of getting my bookmark without having to manualy write
each url. and a curiosity would fuel me, i am interested in solving the problem.

when the bug first happened, i wa logging on to monster.com to post my resume.
i wa trying to create an account and it requested that i allow pop-ups, so
when i went in to change the pop-up status, and clicked apply, it went to this
hinky state!
