I am showing a text document in the window. I have a button through which i want to highlight text in the document.
Currently there are no direct method similar to IE (moveStart, moveEnd), by which i can specify the range of text to be highlighted. I am using the following code to highlight the text.
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=windows-1250">
<meta name="generator" content="PSPad editor, www.pspad.com">
<title></title>
<script>
function highNode() {
var selectionRange = document.createRange();
selectionRange.selectNodeContents(document.body);
selectionRange.setStart(selectionRange.startContainer, 55); //want to move to the 55th character in the text range.
selectionRange.setEnd(selectionRange.startContainer,66);
window.getSelection().addRange(selectionRange);
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
"Inter coach Jose Mourinho and his player sprinted onto the field to celebrate at the final whistle. Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes tangled with Mourinho a he pointed up to the Inter section of fans. The water sprinkler at the end of the pitch where Inter player celebrated were then turned on."
<input type="button" value="ClickMeM" onClick="highNode();">
</body>
</html>

Can you let me know how to proceed, if for example, the text is a above ?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Save the given html in a file
2.Open the page using mozilla firefox.
3. Click on the button. No text is highlighted

Actual Results:
Nothing happens. No text is selected.

Expected Results:
The text from 55th to 66th character should be highlighted.

I checked the setStart and setEnd methods' documentation. My understanding of those method wa wrong. Is there a way to make this selection work similar to that of IE ?
