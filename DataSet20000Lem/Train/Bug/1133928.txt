[e10s] Momentary freeze
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Build ID: 20150212030231

Steps to reproduce:

Don't know.


Actual results:

Occasionally I will be viewing a webpage in e10s and firefox will freeze but only for a second. For example a I type this sometimes I can't see what I'm typing until a second later. Restarting Nightly fix it.

Although I have just switched to x64 build I had the same problem occasionally in x86 builds.

To measure responsiveness in Firefox I use a swirl graphic, https://i.imgur.com/BdRFZB6.gif , which is an animated GIF that continuously moves. Any break in the animation and I observe a momentary freeze in Firefox.

I have taken attached a video to contrast the difference. I have Nightly open and after the freeze start occurring I open two windows, one e10s on the left and one non-e10s on the right, and put the swirl gif on both. I then take the focus off either window. The video show how the non-e10s window operates without incident but the e10s window ha freezes.

My past experience ha led me to believe this is some sort of interaction between e10s window and plugin-container (see bug 1099497), however I can't be sure. I am not running any extension or any plugins other than the default OpenH264 codec.

Rarely I have experienced a similar type of momentary freeze in earlier version of Firefox before e10s wa introduced, however it either went away or I restarted the browser. I'm sure I reported that but I can't find it here.


Expected results:

There should be none of these momentary delay regardless. They are blocking and stifle the user experience.
