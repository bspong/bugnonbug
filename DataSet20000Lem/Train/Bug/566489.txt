Enable inline autocomplete again, but make it smarter (perceived performance)
(Note: this is filed a part of the “Paper Cut” bug — we assume that there may be multiple existing bug on this. Please make them block this bug, and we will de-dupe if they are indeed exactly the same. Thanks!)

We stopped “speaking URL” when AwesomeBar came along, and it make u seem slower when typing a URL. A large portion of people still "speak URLs" when navigating the internet, and we currently do a bad job at accommodating these people.

If you enable "browser.urlbar.autoFill", you will get something that is very close to the behavior we want. However, it completes all the way to the end of a URL instead of respecting URL fragments, so if the only URL you have visited at cnn.com is:

http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/05/17/extreme.airfares/index.html

and you type:

"cnn[…]"

…we currently complete the URL all the way, making it impossible to go to cnn.com without typing it manually. Since the full result will already be in the AwesomeBar results, there's no need for u to complete this all the way (since if you really want that result, you can use arrow down + enter or click it).

What should happen:

(The URL already in history in this example is: http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/05/17/extreme.airfares/index.html)

- Activate the URL bar

- Type "cnn[…]"

- We complete to the first URL fragment separator, ie. "cnn.com/"

- The full URL to the existing article is always visible in the AwesomeBar pulldown.

- If you arrow left (or click) and start typing the "2010" part of the URL, we complete to the next fragment separator, in this case: "cnn.com/2010/"

- Whenever you hit enter, we complete the URL based on whatever prefix wa already in the history (if we have one), ie. http or www get added in. If there isn't any existing entry that matches, no such completion is done.
