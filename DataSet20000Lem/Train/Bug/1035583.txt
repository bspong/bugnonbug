[Breakdown] Instrument search improvement for fx33
There are several search-related area to measure in the next sprint (33.3).

An etherpad to collect these is here: https://firefox-ux.etherpad.mozilla.org/areas-to-measure-for-33-3-sprint. The list so far:

1. Search suggest on newtab and on about:home
* How often is it being used?
* How often do user re-query immediately after a suggested search (possibly a mistaken click)?

2. Search via search history item in awesomebar result (bug 1034381)
* How often are previous search being clicked in awesomebar results? (this would be compared with search clicked after that bug is finished)

3. Clicking on the awesomebar result for "this will search $searchprovider" vs. just hitting enter
* How often to user click enter for a search string v click the awesome bar results?

4. Searches url with bogus protocol made from URL bar going to Google rather than error page (already landed via bug 982428)
* Are more search being made via the URL bar?
* Are Google-specific string (eg site: define: and math) being used more?

5. How often are people searching for string via the URL bar v the Search bar?
* Our data on this is old
* Could help inform bug on adding search suggestion to awesomebar (bug 958204)

Some others will likely be needed.
