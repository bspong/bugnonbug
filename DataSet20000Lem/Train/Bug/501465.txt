Switching between inbox, sent, bin folder
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_7; en-us) AppleWebKit/530.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.1 Safari/530.18

Horrible problem when trying to switch between the inbox, bin and sent folder in Gmail. This happened after I turned on all the security feature under Security other than Private Browsing. Firefox continually errored and then tried to switch between folders. I kept getting dialog box asking me whether I wanted to leave an encrypted page, which I wasn't, I wa still inside Gmail, and then it would error, more dialog box more errors. i finally gave up and switched to Safari.

The other thing that I wa not impressed with is that when I upgraded to 3.5 I lost all my bookmarks. Luckily for me I had them saved in Safari and I just imported them.

Had I not had Safari's bookmark I would not have been too impressed. I have well over 100 bookmark and I wa not keen to lose them.
