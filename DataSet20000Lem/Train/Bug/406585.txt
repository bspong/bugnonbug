Memory consumption is currently 1.27GB (1270MB) for 10 tab of which 8 are static and 2 are refreshed (cbsnews.com, marketwatch.com). This program ha been running for only 4 days.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Steps to reproduce bug:

1. open a few tab with with refresh like marketwatch.com usatoday.com cnn.com or cbsnews.com. May just be any web page.
2. let it run for a few days.
3. look in taskmanager


Actual Results:
Actual Result: What started out a 100 mb of memory with 8 or 9 tab (you gotta be kidding (it's just text and small graphics) ha turned into 1.27GB of memory. As you would expect my system performance is in the toilet. I also noticed this with firefox (I believe you are using the same engine). This occurred in 4 day of use. It will continue to climb (memory leak) until I run out of memory (physical + virtual) or I shut it down.

Expected Results:
Expected Result: reasonable memory requirements. No slow down of in accepting keyboard input, no system performance penalty


Memory requirement shouldn't be that high on startup either.
