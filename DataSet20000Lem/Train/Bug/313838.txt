In the list of bookmark folders, live bookmark appear among the list of bookmark folders. Their presence there is confusing since all the live bookmark folder should do is represent their RSS/ATOM feed. They shouldn't be available for the user to select from for filing a bookmark.

If you attempt to add a bookmark to a live bookmark, you just get a system beep and the window closes. The user is not made explicitly aware of what occurred (which is a failure to add the bookmark). The live bookmark feed shouldn't be listed in the Add Bookmark dialog, but even a popup stating that the user can't add a bookmark to a live feed and returning them to the dialog is far better than beeping and closing (which, IMHO, is entirely inconsistent with how the Fx UI works; this is the first time I have ever gotten a system beep in Firefox without some sort of notification a to what went wrong).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add bookmark with your preferred method to spawn Add Bookmark dialog.
2. Show all folders.

Actual Results:
Live Bookmarks appear among folders.

Expected Results:
They shouldn't.

If, for some technical reason, feed have to be listed there, the UI should better notify user that the bookmark failed since they tried to put it in a feed.
