blank a a folder name.

Importance of the Bug:

The bug reveals a flaw in an important functionality of the browser.Since
several blank folder could be created using this feature,it can lead to
possible confusion and mismanagement of folder in the directory.
The browser offer no provision to overwrite or stop the process therefore a
many blank folder can be created a desired, therefore leading to a mismanaged
directory of similar named folders.
