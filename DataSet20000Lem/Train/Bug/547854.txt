After bug 329212 wa marked fixed, further testing showed that the current behavior may need a bit of love... :-)

Specifically, I've noticed that the outermost title is being used every time a given element doesn't specify any. Just leaving the mouse parked somewhere display "This is a root SVG element's title" which doesn't feel expected behavior IMHO: AFAIK, the top-level title/desc should be handled specially -- it's intended to provide generic information about the document itself:
* The outermost "title" element would (only) be used a window title, a already wa in previous versions;
* The outermost "desc" element would be used a document information, possibly in page info document property dialog (maybe displayed like meta tag in HTML pages), something which wa never supported.

Note that there's an algorithm [1], proposed by the SVG IG, a implementation proposal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a document with an outermost title element.

Actual Results:
The outermost title element is used a tooltip for the canvas and/or element which don't hold a title element themselves.

Expected Results:
The outermost title element would only be used a document title.

Note that I'm pointing the bug's URL at the current SVG 1.1 Second Edition editor's draft which, although not ratified yet, should be fairly close to the final document. :-)
