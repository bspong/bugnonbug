session history issue [crashing on start-up in 54 and in 55 not even saving session any more]
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0
Build ID: 20170824053622

Steps to reproduce:

In Version 54 I found Firefox crashing when launched on a very, very frequent basis.
In the recent Version 55 it is no longer even saving session since 27th August.
I had 9 window with over 1100 tabs. One window seems to have been lost unless I can get a proper recovery from a session possibly a far back a 13th August.



Actual results:

Version 54 would hog ridiculous level of CPU 60-70% at leak but constantly >50%) and I'd have to stop doing anything else on the laptop for it to stand a chance of not crashing!
Since going to Version 55, I seem to have lost the content of one window and it always open with just the Google home page tab i.e. any extra tab opened are lost. The other 8 window recover but if I open new tab in them they are not saved either.


Expected results:

Firefox should recover the 9 window with a total 1100 tab between them. If there is a limit, it should warn the user and they will do some house-keeping finding what really can be ditched or archive off data such a putting URLs in a word file. I have so many windows/tabs because it keep a thorough audit trail of key info I've found in some case I'm investigating and I can readily look at the info.
