I visited ign.com and opened several review of different game in tabs. I aborted some of the pages, when the text wa already loaded, but the image where not, to save bandwidth. I had about 20 tab open, some where fully loaded, some where not. I viewed some of them and closed them afterwards. Then there were about 15 page open and I left the browser in this state for about 15 minute and went to eat something. CPU usage by firefox wa about 60% (2.6 Ghz P4). Then I came back and looked at some of the other site open and closed them. When there were about 12 left, there came a message by Windows, that there is too little virtual memory, so I checked and Firefox used 300 Mb RAM (of 512) and 1 GB of virtual memory. The amount of memory grew about 5 MB every ten second or so.
I assume, there's a memory leak.
