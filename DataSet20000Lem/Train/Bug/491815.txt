Ads on most site cause Firefox 3.0.10 to hang.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have been frustrated a of late, with ad on most site causing firefox to hang.
Places like Mugen-Infantry.net, Hotmail and even http://news.cnet.com/new-beta-paves-way-for-firefox-3.5/ cause firefox 3.0.10 to hang because of the ad placed on it.

Hotmail especially is suffering from major hanging. It take an approximate one minute of hanging before it go back to normality.

I have not installed any add-on in the past couple of months. I've removed one plug-in (Java Platform SE6 U6, and I have SE6 U12 and U13 on it) and that's all. This problem did not occur in previous version of Firefox.

Also, Internet Explorer and Google Chrome are able to load the ad no problem. Deleting cache and cooky did not fix the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a site with ad (Mugen-infantry.net, hotmail.com after login or http://news.cnet.com/new-beta-paves-way-for-firefox-3.5/
2. Firefox will hang for a moment before going back to normal because of the ad loading.
Actual Results:
Firefox hang for a moment.

Expected Results:
Continuous firefox usage without hangs.

Used default theme, removed one plugin (Java Platform SE6 U6 extension).
