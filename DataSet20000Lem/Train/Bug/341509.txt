Operaing system is Mac OSX 10.2.8 and Firefox version 1.5.04. When I use the open file menu, this creates an area of the browser which show the information in the original window of open file menu e.g the file structure in icon form. When you exit open file menu, area created within the browser with the open file information doe not disappear. To get rid of this area of information is to refresh the browser. Is this a bug or a virus?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to file menu and click on Open File...
2.Open File dialouge box move then use bottom bar to get desired file location
3.

Actual Results:
When moving the bottom bar of the orignal Open File dialogue box, browser creates a pane within the web page with the open file dialogue file location information, also cause the web page to be distorted near the area where the open file dialogue box is reproduced, whem moving the bottom bar. The pain area is near the top left hand corner web browser page.

Expected Results:
Expected result is when using the open file dialogue box, is that when moving the bottom bar to find a file to open the web page should not create pain within the browsed page with open dialougue box information and should not corrupt the web page when browsing for a file to open.
