After upgrading to Firefox 3, attempting to print a copy of online billing statement from Cablevision.com website result in large portion of the page missing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Cablevision customer need to log into 'My Account' at https://www.optimum.com/account/account-detail.jsp
2. Click on 'View Statements'
3. Click latest statement
4. You can either try to a) print at this point, or b) scroll to bottom and click link for viewing printable version of page - both have same result
5. Using 'Print Preview' is sufficient to reproduce
Actual Results:
After clicking Print Preview, page is laid out missing large portion of the content.

Expected Results:
Page should have rendered a it wa on the screen, especially using the print layout. This function still work fine in Firefox 2, only exists in Firefox 3, up to Version 3.0.1

Investigators looking into this bug will either have to have a Cablevision account to log into their own account to try and reproduce, or contact me for additional information, due to personal information being displayed in the correct rendering. I have attached a PDF copy of the incorrect output, which lack personal info.
