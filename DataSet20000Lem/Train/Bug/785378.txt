unresponsive script Gmail
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/536.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/20.0.1132.47 Safari/536.11

Steps to reproduce:

I first open FireFox. Nothing different and getting to Gmail account wa no problem untilI signed into Gamil.com and got a unresponsive scripted error.
I tried Signing into Gmail in Chrome and their is no problem.
I do not know if this problem is in other FireFox versions.
I wa not able to compare or check. Maybe this is already resolved.



Actual results:

I signed into my Gmail account and it started to load. It never finish loading in FireFox and give me this Warning.

It becomes in a loop of thinking always and you have to force it to close. You click on close and window ask if you want to wait and that wont close it. So you must force a close on the program.

This is running on a i5-2400 cpu 3.10HGz

Expected results:

i would like to update the software but company ha rules.
