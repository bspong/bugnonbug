mozSocial injection incorrectly guarded for private browsing
Bug 808215 introduced the following block to MozSocialAPI.jsm:

+#ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
+XPCOMUtils.defineLazyModuleGetter(this, "PrivateBrowsingUtils", "resource://gre/modules/PrivateBrowsingUtils.jsm");
+#endif

...
- if (!window)
+ if (!window
+#ifndef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
+ || !PrivateBrowsingUtils.isWindowPrivate(window)
+#endif
+ )

These were wrong - the last change should have read:

+#ifdef MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING
+ || PrivateBrowsingUtils.isWindowPrivate(window)
+#endif

(Note the negation of *both* the #if and the result of isWindowPrivate) a the intention wa to continue injecting in non-per-window builds, but prevent injecting in per-window builds. There is also one further similar problem later in the file relating to chat windows.

The end result of this is that:

* trunk ha had the check removed when all the MOZ_PER_WINDOW_PRIVATE_BROWSING wa ripped out. While this is benign (as none of the social UI element are created anyway), the check should be re-added to trunk for the sake of being extra-careful.

* Builds on the birch tree (basically Aurora but without per-window PB) are currently broken due to most test failing - we do not inject when we should.

Attaching 2 different patch to address this.
