I am hosting an Applet in a page which us reflection to call Javascript on my page, and I call method in the Applet using the document.appletid.method() strategy.

The first time the applet is run, everything is fine. However, on subsequent reloads of the page, the call which worked before result in the following j error:

uncaught exception: internal error: Can't get Java class name usingjava.lang.Class.getName()

I have to leave Firefox and restart it for the applet to work again.

The only result I could find Googling for this error wa the following page:
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Talk:Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide:LiveConnect_Overview:JavaScript_to_Java_Communication

I am marking this a Major because I believe that this is a serious bug for page which use Javascript<->Java Applet interaction.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I am working to produce a public page where this can be demonstrated. At the present time the site the applet is hosted on is a very confidential project. I will update the bug when I finish the page.
Actual Results:
Internal error message:

uncaught exception: internal error: Can't get Java class name usingjava.lang.Class.getName()

Expected Results:
The applet should continue to be usable on reloading.
