Firefox hang after being open for a long time and browsing huge amount of website durring that time.

OK I have seen this happen on 3 of the 4 computer I use firefox on and the only
difference between the 4 that I can see is because I don't browse the internet
a heavily on the 4th a I do on the other 3. When I browse the web after I open
it for the first time it is fast a hell. After some time (1-2 hours) it start
to slow down a bit. After about 20+ hour the cpu start to stay at about 99% on
a 2.4 ghz Intel. I'm thinking maybe it ha something to do with the way the
cache is indexed. I didn't look at the code but if it doe cleanup after all
window are closed but not at regular interval durring the session then it
might get a very fragmented index file that is hard for the system to dig though
and might be causing the hang. Perhaps scheduling the "cleanup" to run every 1-2
hour the program is open would help this problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse LARGE amount of different complex websites.
2.Use multiple window and multiple tab per window.
3.Repeat for about 20+ hours.

Actual Results:
75% of the time Firefox became unresponsive and had to be "End Tasked". Upon a
new load it take a longer time to load then usual but then is running fine.

Expected Results:
should not become unresponsive. Maybe run cleanup rutines periodicly durring the
session.
