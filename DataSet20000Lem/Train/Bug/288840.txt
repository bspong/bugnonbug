I just bought a new computer, running Windows XP Professional edition Swedish
version with Service Pack 1 (Service Pack 2 can not be installed when using AMD
Athlon 64 for Socket 939). I installed Firefox 1.0.2 Swedish version, downloaded
from Mozilla's homepage. After the installation is completed, I choice to start
Firefox, but after about half a minute it crashes. It have not started up at
all. I only get the Windows own message that the application have meat a problem
and have to be closed (the error report in Windows XP).
Firefox can not be started up at all, not eaven in safe mode. The same occurs
after a reinstall of Firefox (Installation downloaded 2005-04-03 14:17/2.17PM).

1. Start up Firefox in Regular mode or Safe mode
Actual Results:
