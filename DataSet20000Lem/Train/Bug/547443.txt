While entering information (login info. form data etc.) and clicking send or enter the page will reload to the same page and era the entered form data. This happened right after the update to new version of firefox. Also happened after downloading Minefield. Tried signing into Netflix and after clicking signin the page refreshed to the same page but erased the information I entered.

Reproducible: Sometimes

1.Go to any page where you have to enter information
2.Enter your data
3.Click on Send or Enter
Actual Results:
The page reloads the same page with data erased so you have to re-enter the same information

Expected Results:
Sent information for the next page to load

It doesn't seem to do it every single time. And it doesn't seem to be limited to just long forms. Meaning it could be something simple like a log in screen or something long like tax information or insurance forms.
