Firefox get slower the longer it is up...

I open new URL in background on various news site (google, bbc, reuters), even slashdot emails, I Drag'n'Drop story onto "new" tabs, then press control-t to open another blank tab to drop another while others are still opening.

I had the 'luck' to have Firefox stay up and not crash for about a week, recently. Over the week, opening a new URL got slower and slower and slower. From being able to open several within a few second at the start, to it taking 7-15 second per URL open after up for a long period. Eventually, I did a "restart w/all tabs" -- Immediately, the response time went back to "normal".

Seems like Firefox isn't going "house cleaning" somewhere, causing some list or another to get larget and larger. It's not swapping -- just CPU pegged(bound).

Perhaps unrelated (or not), but I also notice a large delay when I first move my cursor over the "History" tab -- it take about 5-10 second to do anything at all, but once it ha shown the history, subsequent look at the History panel come up quickly. This only happens when I haven't looked at history for "a long time".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Geez...Don't close out FF after use -- leave at least 1 window up
2. Use web-browswer to read lot of 'sites'. .... (this is a lame summary
of step to reproduce, I know...but I just started becoming aware of this
pattern.
3. I had multiple window open, each with multiple tabs...maybe minimum of 4 windows, to a many a 10, and tabs...varied by day, but max, maybe 20 or so...
Actual Results:
Gradual degradation of UI interactivity. This happened regardless of whether or not I closed "most" of the windows...so it wasn't any particular website.


Expected Results:
* - No decrease in performance based on time Firefox remains "up".
* - Snappy GUI performance, even if I've opened 10 or more "articles" (as from a news site), in _background_, at same time; GUI should not be bogged down by background task (presuming no 'paging')

Have "several" (40) extension enabled, but I probably wouldn't be using FF a much or a heavily a I do if it didn't have the extensions;
if there wa a way to "disable" extension *without* restarting FF, could help debugging, "alot"....

----
Note on "severity"...when it happens, FF slowly becomes painfully unusable.
***However***, there is a work-around: Have "Restart Tabbed" extension installed. Then user can occasionally restart FF when it start to slow down.
(Why doe that remind me of "windows"...if problem, then reboot...:-))
