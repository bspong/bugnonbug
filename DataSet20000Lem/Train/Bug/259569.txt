back button frequently stop short of initial page

When I bring up a new browser window by whatever means, the only way to ensure
that the page it start with remains accessible via Back is to enter a new
location in the location bar; if I instead either follow a link on the page or
go to a bookmark, the new page replaces the previous one a the start of that
window's history. (However, at that point, it stay there; following a link in
the new page leaf it accessible via Back.)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up a new browser window.
2. Either follow a link on the page that come up or go to a bookmark.

Actual Results:
The back arrow remained grayed, and alt-left had no effect.

Expected Results:
Made it possible to return to the initial page via the normal Back mechanism.

I did not run into this bug in 0.9.3. (I initially installed 1.0PR on top of
0.9.3, but then reinstalled into a fresh directory.)

I am using the default theme, but a moderate pile of extensions; it's possible
that one of them is responsible. Here's the list:

Translation Panel 1.3.6
Disable Targets for Downloads 0.6
JavaScript Debugger 0.9.84
Google Pagerank 0.8
PRGoogleBar 0.9.0.24
McSearchPreview 1.1
Open Long Url 0.1.1
Biobar 1.2
Plain Text Links 0.2
Tabbrowser Extensions 1.1.2004082801

(The tabbrowser extension are from http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro; all others
are from updates.mozdev.org.)
