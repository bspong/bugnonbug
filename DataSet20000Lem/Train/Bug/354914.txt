Make about and other generated page more easily stylable

The browser need to assign a unique ID to the html tag of each generated page. This ID would then be available for use to style the page (e.g. through a theme, userContent.css, extension, etc). If confirmed a an RFE, this will be a tracking bug to the change for the individual pages.

Reasoning: It is difficult to style most of the about:* page (and others) that are generated internally by Firefox. These page are not chrome, but are instead usually rendered a html content. This, and the fact that the page are not uniquely identified, make it hard to style the page according to the current theme being used in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always




The most obvious page that need to be addressed are those most commonly used by users. This includes about:blank, about:plugins, and about:. Hopefully, all generated content will eventually have it own unique ID. For the purpose of clarity, the IDs should all start with a similar prefix; preferrably "about-".

Below is a tentative list of page that need to be addressed. Some page already have subelements with their own IDs, but are not fully stylable since their html element still ha no ID.

about:
> html -
> div "#aboutPageContainer"

about:blank
> html -

about:buildconfig
> html -

about:cache
> html -

about:cache-entry
> html -

about:credits
> html -

about:license
> html -
> body "#lic-info"

about:mozilla
> html -
> p "#moztext"
> p "#from"

about:plugins
> html -
> div "#outside"

view-source:
> html -
> body "#viewsource"

about:config is a special case that render a chrome and already ha a usable ID (#config); so it doe not need to be modified.
