Dr. Watson issue a bug report
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

If you save a web page into a folder loaded on Windows XP 32-bit, and you place a hot link to that folder on your desktop, and Firefox 4.0 ha one or more web page saved to the root directory of that folder, then you will not be able to access that folder and the bug reporter will go off. The more web page in that folder, the worse it gets.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 4.0, latest version.
2. Save web page to folder.
3. Place hot link to that folder on desktop.
4. Try to open up that folder and the bug reporter will go off immediately.
5. Folder will not open, even if the debugger is not run. The more page saved to the folder, the le likely it will open up. I found a work around by selecting the property menu with the right click of the mouse, and then zeroing in on the root folder, and then opening up the file that way.



Actual Results:
Crash, desktop seizes. Can't open the folder. After about five minutes, the desktop unseizes, but you still won't be able to open the folder where the web page are saved.

Expected Results:
Crash reporter go off, and you can't use the computer for several minutes. Eventually you can regain access, but you still can't access the folder where the Firefox 4.0 page are stored.

Folders on desktop should have opened, so that I may access web page saved with Firefox. In addition, the Dr. Watson Crash reporter and the ATI crash reporter should not have gone off.
