After updating a new bookmark to a company is added in the bar.

I have automatic update activated. A few day ago when I started Mozilla Firefox I got a message about completed updating and I recognized a new bookmark called "\bjorn" in the bookmarkbar. If i open the bookmark I end up at http://www.bjorn.se/ who is a IT-consultant in Sweden.

I have newer seen this page before and I have not added the bookmark. It cannot been my girlfriend because she doe not use my account and she us IE.

I´m quit worried about this because I don´t like the thought about someone writing update for Mozilla and in the same time spreading commercials, if that is the case... Maybe it is some kind of virus, i don´t know. But i think you might want to know about it.

I have tried installation of Firefox on my girlfriend computer but it doe not show up there.

Best Regards/ Tor, Sweden

I use XP. I mark this Critical because it can hurt the trust for the Mozilla organisation if this is a commercial scam.
