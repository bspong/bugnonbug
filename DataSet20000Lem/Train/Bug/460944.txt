Both Mac and Windows latest version are displaying this problem persistently. When typing into the Google text field in the browser the cursor disappears and seems to be snapping elsewhere although not to another field on the page. This is persistent and noted by different user (i.e. not an idiosyncracy of the user's keyboard skills).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open browser
2.Type in google search bar
3.Cursor disappears and no further text entry
4. Return to field and recommence text entry - same problem occurs


Expected Results:
I expect to be able to type text - could do with the previous version. Noticed this with the Windows update first and Mac from today.

I have privacy setting set to allow cooky but remove them when browser closes. Have Kaspersky internet security running on the PC and have run MacClean on the Macbook. Using default theme. Other add ons are Fast Dial, Endnote Web 2.0 and Capture for the Mac with Foxmarks. No other add ons on the PC version.
