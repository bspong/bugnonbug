UX regression caused by Bug 865826
The browser.tabs.closeButtons pref wa removed. It provided an opportunity to place tab-closing button in the end of the tab strip, instead of placing small close button on every tab.

There is no telemetry data based on which you can know how many user used this pref. But for whose it broke some user case in UX:
1) I have 20 tab open and want quickly close five of them from the middle. I select first one to delete and click mouse to the static-placed close button right of the tab strip a much time a I want. Each tab width at this moment could stretch and shrink, it doesn't matter a long a the close button stay stock-still.
Now if tab width are changing when tab count reducing the close button jumping over tab strip.
2) Then I have 100+ tab open tab width are 30px, when browser hang (goes unresponsive) I sometimes click two time to change it, now accidentally I could press close button then selecting the tab, it's unacceptable, a user have to reopen tab.
3) If I have 100+ tab and want to close some specific tab (based on favicons, like only Google search tabs), I could move them using Ctrl+Tab by left hand, and by right hand clicking close button in the right. It wa easy. Now I can't do that.

The pref provided a three way of closing tabs:
0-1: Display close button on each tab
2: Don’t display any close buttons. So user can use keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-W or Ctrl-F4) or middle click. Note that there wa very old bug 78414, so keyboard shortcut not working if page containing Flash (like youtube player) and it selected. So closing curtain tab by keyboard is not an option. Middle click is a different UX either.
3: Display a single close button at the end of the tab strip (Firefox 1.x behavior)
So I think patch on Bug 865826 can be reverted.
