Add hidden pref to default to last-used folder for New Bookmark dialog
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

This occurs only since ince I installed Firefox 1.0PR over the previous public
release:

When I use the Bookmarks menu "Bookmark this Page...", the popup is always
positioned to Create my bookmark in the top level Bookmarks folder rather than
the last folder I created a bookmark in.

With the previous release of Firefox, when I used Bookmark this Page, the popup
would be positioned to Create my bookmark in the LAST folder I created a
bookmark in. This wa convenient because I mostly bookmark auction in an
"Auctions" folder within the Bookmarks folder.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
(note - this assumes you have created some folder in Bookmarks in the past)

1. Go to any web page
2. Select Bookmarks menu "Bookmark this Page" and put the bookmark in one of
your folder within Bookmarks
3. Go to a different web page
4. Select Bookmarks menu "Bookmark this Page" - notice that the Bookmarks popup
is no longer positioned tot he folder where you stored the last bookmark, and
instead is positioned back in the top level Bookmarks folder

3.

Actual Results:
When I did step 4, the Bookmark-adding popup wa repositioned to the top level
Bookmarks folder.

Expected Results:
Unless the behavior ha been changed, when I did step 4, the Bookmark-adding
popup should have been positioned at folder I used in step 2.
