Hi,

I have noticed that firexfox 3.5.6 increase PF usage and cpu usage after alot of browsing is done. It work fine in start and when much browsing is done it start using high PF and CPU and keep increasing with the browsing. Also the memory used by firefox after some time reach more than 600 k and firefox get slow and lousy.

Please note that restarting firefox fix the issue or probably just by clearing the cache and browsing history but it is very annoying to restart browser again and again specially when doing any important work. Kindly fix this issue in up comming firefox versions. Thank you

Regards,
Zeeshan
