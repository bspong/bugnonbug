Console `originAttributes` attribute slow thing down and is unused
Based on bug 1382968 comment 42, it look like the call to Cu.cloneInto()
ha significant impact on console.log performances.
http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0f16d437cce97733c6678d29982a6bcad49f817b/dom/console/ConsoleAPIStorage.js#132-135
// Clone originAttributes to prevent "TypeError: can't access dead object"
// exception when cached console message are retrieved/filtered
// by the devtools webconsole actor.
aEvent.originAttributes = Cu.cloneInto(aEvent.originAttributes, {});

Commenting this line introduces a 30% win in console.log performance under heavy usage (see bug 1382968 comment 42).

I'm not an active contributor for the console, but I looked into it codebase, and I wasn't able to find any usage of this `originAttributes` object:
http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=originAttributes&case=false&regexp=false&path=devtools%2F

The only one reference coming from webconsole code is this one:
http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/bd39b6170f04afeefc751a23bb04e18bbd10352b/devtools/server/actors/webconsole.js#1783
delete result.originAttributes;

Where we immediately delete it a soon a we receive the console-api-log-event message...
It ha been introduced in bug 1318006, a well a the cloneInto, in order to prevent Dead wrapper exceptions.

If that is really unused, it look like we should remove it completely.
