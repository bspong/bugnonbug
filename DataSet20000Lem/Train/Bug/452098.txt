Using URLConnection in JAVA Applet throw Socket SecurityException on so called header domains, (multiple domain with the same IP but different header).

The Applet should read file on the same domain, where the applet wa downloaded.

The Error occurs at least on Windows, Linux and MAC Systems on the second and next domain request a soon the URLconnections opens.

Example:
After System Browser start visit the first header domain:
www.firstdon.com , the applet work just fine

trying to visit the next domain with same IP but different header a the first one
www.nextdom.com

trows the Exception.

If after fresh PC start the www.nextdom.com will be visited first, then the exception will thrown and the www.firstdon.com which will be opened a second.

It seems like the Browser doe not recognize the header domain and memorize the IP from the first connection.

Here the important part of the code:

URL url = new URL(“http://www.firstdon.com/index.html”) // the path is just a example
URLConnection uCon = url.openConnection();
uCon.setUseCaches(false);
InputStream inSt = uCon.getInputStream();

By the way, the MSIE Version 5.xx and higher work just perfect even with MS VM or SUN JAVA.

A Old Days BUG
Starting Applet which requires URLConnection and InputStream take a really long time. Ths JAVA Console show some kind of loop, to get the BasicPermission.
This is an old day BUG coming form Netscape 4.0 Version and carrying it even to the newest FireFox 3.0. It will be nice to get finally a rid of this, because applet running in MSIE starting much faster.
