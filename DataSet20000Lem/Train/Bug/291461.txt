We have intranet portal solution in our company.
Intranet portal server is not reacheble through PROXY (ISA).
My connection setting in Firefox 1.0.3 is:
- Manual proxy configuration: Use the same proxy for all protocol __ ISA:8080
- No Proxy for: localhost, 127.0.0.1, infoportal.mycompany.com

I havn't any problems, when i go for RSS publish on internet:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_world_edition/front_page/rss091.xml

But if I go for RSS (through LiveBookmark functionality) published by our
intranet solution, Live Bookmark displaing me the message: "Live Bookmark feed
failed to load"



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place any RSS file to intranet web server (intranet.webserver.org/rss.xml)
2. Disable connection PROXY (packets direction) to any intranet web server
3. Setup your Firefox - No Proxy for: intranet.webserver.org
4. Add Live Bookmark - http://intranet.webserver.org/rss.xml


Actual Results:
Live Bookmark show the message:
"Live Bookmark feed failed to load"

Expected Results:
Load feed got by Live Bookmarks.

Where is the problem from my point of view?
Even though value of "No Proxy for" on PROXY configuration is setup:
- intranet.webserver.org

browser still try to reach RSS placed on intranet through PROXY.
