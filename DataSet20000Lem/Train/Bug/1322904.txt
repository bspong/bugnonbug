The new release of Firefox make it impossible for me to use the proxy that the library at my university us to access the EBSCO site. I keep getting a message that there is something wrong with the certificate. Here is the URL https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/direct.asp?db=lls&jid=R5A&scope=site


Actual results:

Browser refused to load the page, saying there wa something wrong with the certificate. I tried to create an exception, but the new dialog did not like the URL above. It tell me that there is nothing wrong with the https://libproxy.library.unt.edu certificate. So I am kind of stuck.

Here is the message displayed to me:
The connection to libproxy.library.unt.edu:2048 wa interrupted while the page wa loading.
