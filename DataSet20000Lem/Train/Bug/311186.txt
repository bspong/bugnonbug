Hey

I'm using a mac... I'm developping a website using XHTML and CSS. I'm using a PNG background (range
of colors) on the body and a color (#DDEBBE). The last color on the PNG is the background color so we
should not see the background. But in Firefox and Camino, the background color is different from the
PNG latest color. On Firefox and Camino, this color is #E3EEC8. So there is a line.

Then I wanted to use a JPG for the background or a GIF. But there's still a problem. On my page, there is
a div with another PNG background (with transparency). And when I use JPG for the body's background,
the PNG background of the div is not managed a it should be. There's a kind of clear shade appearing
on the transparent areas.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a PNG background with a range of color from white to #DDEBBE
2. Apply the PNG to the body with no repeat and put #DDEBBE a the background color of the page


Actual Results:
There should be a line by the end of the background.

Expected Results:
The line should not appear. The last color on the PNG should be the same a the background color.

It also happens with Camino.
