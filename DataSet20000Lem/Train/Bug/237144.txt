When editing bookmarks.html in your profile, if you change the ID for a
bookmark and folder to the same ID, Firefox merges the two entry into a
single folder entry with the content of the folder entry and the some of the
property of the bookmark entry. Depending on the pair of entry sharing an
ID, an infinite recursion can be produced in which the folder contains itself.

On a restart of Firefox, the bookmark property are absent from the entry,
but the infinite resursion remains. The bookmark mananger display the folder
a having only the original folder's links, but the bookmark menu make the
folder contain the link and itself.
