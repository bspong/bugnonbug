1Password password filling doe not work in Firefox Developer Edition
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20141110030204

Steps to reproduce:

1. Download and install 1Password 5.0.5 from the Mac App Store.
1a. Open 1Password, and add a password for a website (fastmail.fm, in my case)
2. Download and install Firefox Developer Edition (35.0a2 (2014-11-10)).
3. In 1Password > Preferences > Advanced Preferences, uncheck the "Verify browser code signature" option.
4. Launch Firefox Developer Edition.
5. Install the beta channel of 1Password's Firefox extension (https://agilebits.com/onepassword/extensions/firefox?beta=true).
6. Visit website entered in 1a, then use Cmd-/ to select and fill your username/password.


Actual results:

In the Developer Edition, I receive an error upon pressing Enter to fill my password. The error:

Cannot Fill Item in FirefoxDeveloperEdition

FirefoxDeveloperEdition is connected but it code signature could not be verified. Filling and other feature are disabled until this configuration issue is resolved.

On Firefox, Firefox Beta, and Firefox Nightly (36.0a1), this error doe not occur. (Will fetch Firefox/Beta version shortly.)


Expected results:

My username and password should have been filled in.
