Some floating div layer are not rendering in their proper position

Hi. I'm not a Firefox user. One of my customer sent me a screencap of my site on his screen, to let me know it "looked funny." Sadly, I don't know what version he's running or what OS.

The problem appears to be in how the browser handle floating div layer within the main html code. My site us lot of divs within divs. Some have their position defined in my CSS file, others are designated on the fly. From the screencap he sent, it appears that the divs laid out in the CSS file are displaying correctly, but the divs in the main html code are not.

The relevant source code for my index page is a follows:

<div id="navbar">
<a href="index.html"> Home </a><br><br>
<a href="OrderBook.html"> Buy The Book </a><br><br>
etc.
</div>

****** The div above is rendered properly a a column on left side of screen

<div id="header"><center>
<img USEMAP="#banner" src="Banner.JPG" width = "670" height = "144" border="0"
alt = "The Fraud Goes Ever On and On..."></center>
</div>

****** The div above is rendered properly a a banner at top of screen

<div id="content"> This whole section comprises the rest of the screen to the right of the navbar and below the header. It is rendered properly in that position. However, WITHIN THIS DIV, there are problems, read on:

<div style="width: 150px; float: left; position: relative; right: 8px;"><center>
<img src="images/tinycover.JPG" alt="wee little cover" width="120"
height ="184">
<h3><a href="pressrelease.html#chapter"> Read a Chapter! </a></h3>
</center>
</div>

*****This div is apparently rendered correctly a the first element in the Content layer.

************ BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM:

<div style="float: right;">
<div id="white" style="padding:0;"><center>
<H2>When A Fan Hits the Shit:<br>
The Rise and Fall of a Phony Charity</H2></center>
</div>

********THIS DIV IS NOT FLOATING. IT IS DISPLAYED BELOW THE FIRST ELEMENT, RATHER THAN TO THE RIGHT OF THE FIRST ELEMENT.

<div>
In 2003, two obsessed "Lord of the Rings" fan devised
a way to meet their favorite celebrities: create a phony charity and invite the star to host "fundraising
events." Meet the star and pocket the cash--a heist made in heaven! But then they told one lie too many. . . <br>
</div>

********************MORE OF THE SAME PROBLEM: THE ABOVE DIV SHOULD EITHER FLOAT TO THE RIGHT OF THE FIRST ELEMENT IF THE WINDOW IS BIG ENOUGH, OR BE DISPLAYED UNDER THE FIRST TWO ELEMENTS IF THE WINDOW IS TOO NARROW.

<div id="pocket" style="position: relative; right: 10px;"> <div style="direction: ltr;">
<H3>What People Are Saying About <i>When A Fan</i></h3>
<b> Couldn't put it down. It's very funny and incredibly sad.</b> ~
<a href="http://www.john-howe.com/news/more.php?id=101_0_1_0_C" target="_blank">John Howe</a><br><br>
ETC.

****** This one seems to render properly, it's supposed to be slightly offset from the right edge of the Content div. But it generally fit up next to that first element a well, unless the window is very narrow. So once again the float is not being processed.

As far a I can tell, the divs within the Content section are being displayed just a regular sequential elements; the float are being ignored.

Note that the Header, Navbar and Content section are all defined in my cs file a such:

div#header {
margin-left: 110px;
padding: 5px;
height: 145px;
}

div#navbar {
font-family: "Verdana", sans-serif;
font-weight: bold;
font-size: medium;
font-style: italic;
position: absolute;
left: 5px;
top: 10px;
width: 150px;
}

div#content {
margin-left: 170px;
margin-right: 15px;
overflow:auto;
height: 400px;
}

As you can see, the cs us both relative and absolute positioning (but no floats, heh) and appears to be running properly.

Well, good luck! I can forward you the screencap from this customer if that will help.


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
I have a screencap of the improper rendering that I can forward if you want.

Expected Results:
Surf to turondo.com from netscape, aol, or IE and you can see what it should look like.

I also have a lot of complicated div placement on the page www.turondo.com/Media.html (click on "Online Press Kit.") That one may give you an even more ugly example of the nonfloating floaters.

I write my own HTML and try to stay within W3C standard so I would expect Firefox to be able to render it properly. If the issue is in my code, please let me know. Thanks.
