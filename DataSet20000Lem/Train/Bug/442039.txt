I have been saving page from http://affiliate.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ for later reviewing. These page are in a grid form. Yesterday, I noted that the saved page no longer display correctly. Things are not in their proper positions. I have noted the following:

I saved some of these page using Firefox 1.5.0.8, later (as of 05/23/08) Firefox 2.0, later (as of 06/20/08) Firefox 3.0.

I noted that a of 05/21/08, the file size of the saved page wa le than the file size of previous pages. The older page with the larger file size still display correctly. The newer one do not. (I will forward copy on request).

Pages saved using Internet Explorer (which are even smaller than the Firefox page after 05/21/08) display correctly.

The only add-on I have is No-Script. I suspect that the No-Script add-on may be the culprit in this case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load saved page
2.
3.
Actual Results:
page display incorrectly. Things are not in their proper location.
