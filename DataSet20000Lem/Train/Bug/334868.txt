When I enter backslash (\) in a file picker, Firefox should assume I mean slash (/)

When I click a download button in a webpage, FF ask to input the file name. If I type in:
\home\user\path\myfile.ext
Firefox will happily save the file with name "\home\user\path\myfile.ext". However, the user clearly meant to save it a myfile.ext in path /home/user/path. I know '\' is valid char in file, but considering the Windows's usage of backslash a path separator, we can reasonably assume here \ mean / indeed.

FF can quitely convert \ to /, or give user warning and an chance to make the change manually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a link/button that doe a download
2. (With Always ask when download file enabled) type in
\home\user\path\myfile.ext in the File Name:
3. Click OK

Actual Results:
FF Save the file a "\home\user\path\myfile.ext"

Expected Results:
It should save it a myfile.ext in /home/user/path instead or give a warning to user for manual change.
