In one situation for valid http broken link change the colour in other it doesn't. One situation: non existing server, other: broken link on existing server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Two very similar issue handled in two separate ways.

On example page with two links, one leading to :
http://google.com/nourlhere.html
and second link leading to :
http://nogoogleserverhere.kom

When I hit the first link (which link to non existing file on existing
and working server) error page provided by server is shown. Then I go back and visit the page with links. Link change colour. Conclusion 1: Link is broken. Link change colour.

When we hit the the link which is also broken, but lead u to non existing server location error page provided by browser is shown. Now when I visit the page with link again the link doesn't change the colour.

We have two very similar situation handled in two other ways. In one situation
for valid http broken link change the colour in other it doesn't. So there's
an inconsistency for that.
Actual Results:
One link doesn't change the color and second does, even they both are invalid links.

Expected Results:
Both link should be marked a visited because they have been clicked and visited.
