Browser freeze when calling any medium content from the above page

When navigating to any medium content link on the portal zshare (the above link is just a random example; content is of course non-offensive) an standard window xp error sound is heard, but no error message box shown. After that the browser ha to be terminated by using the task manager, because it doe not react to anything at all anymore and us 100% CPU power. I have also tried this with all my addons disabled, so it should be a real firefox issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the above link
2. crash
Actual Results:
I have to terminate the browser via the task manager "end task" option; firefox doe not try to contact mozilla.org to auto-report the bug (which would make my life easier)

Expected Results:
The medium content hosted on zshare.net should have appeared and run.

I am using the default theme; there is no error message box so I cannot give specific about crash IDs or module names; the crash affect ALL of firefox in ALL tab and ALL open window of it, but (except for the 100% CPU usage) doe not seem to affect the rest of my window XP system; the bug occurs indiscriminately at very low (20MB) and very high (1000MB) cash size settings; the bug occurs with and without Java activated; I did not test if it still occurs with a NoScript plugin to block JavaScript, because I dont usually need such an addon - maybe that help to locate the bug?

If there is problem reproducing the bug or any other kind of questions, just let me know what you need to know or want me to do to help locate the problem.
