After doing "Save image as..." the content of the URL bar are sometimes
replaced by the value chrome://downloadmgr/content/downloadtab.xul which
corresponds to the download manager. The content of the window are however OK.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to a page with a large picture in it.
2. Click right on the picture.
3. Select "Save Image As...". A file dialog appears.
4. Click "Save".
Actual Results:
The content of the URL bar were replaced by
"chrome://downloadmgr/content/downloadtab.xul" (without quotes), i.e., by the
"chrome" URL of the download manager.

Expected Results:
URL bar shouldn't have changed, still showing the URL of the HTML page
containing the image just saved.

I'll attach a screenshot when I come back to the bug after filling out this form.

This is an intermittent bug: it doesn't appear every time. I believe that it
appears more often when saving large images.
