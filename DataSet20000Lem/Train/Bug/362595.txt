Everytime I add a name to a bookmark, the name of the bookmark vanishes

Every time I add a bookmark, with a name in it, and click OK, the name vanishes, and the "bookmark" window is still there. And then when I close the window, I check my bookmark "drop-down" menu. The page that I bookmarked is there, but with no name. This ha never happened before. I think this all started ever since I updated to Firefox version 2.0.

Also, when I look in the "Create In" menu, which drop down, I see two parts. One part say "Bookmarks, & Bookmarks Toolbar", and the other part is "Bookmarks, & Bookmarks Toolbar Folder". I use the second part, saying "Bookmarks". Is that normal?
