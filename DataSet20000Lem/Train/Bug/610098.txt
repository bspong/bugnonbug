Installed plugin AniWeather which provides weather information data in the status bar. When hovering over an icon in the AniWeather section of the status bar, AniWeather access a URL which cause the progress bar to show up. This shift the AniWeather toolbar to the right causing the mouse hover to lose focus. The result is cyclical: mouse-hover, url-access, progress-bar-shows-up, mouse-lose-focus, url-access-stops, progress-bar-disappears, icon-shift, mouse-gain-focus

Suggested fix: make progress bar a "background" of another fixed-width, always-shown part of the status bar. note: just avoiding shifting of status bar section by putting progress bar a overlay will cause similar problem when adjacent icon are 'masked' by bar overlay.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install AniWeather plugin (an example plugin only for the problem)
2. Configure AniWeather to show most available information
3. Narrow Firefox window so that hover on AniWeather icon cause described shift
4. Hover over an AniWeather icon such a a weather map display
5. Expect shift of AniWeather icon when progress bar display
Actual Results:
AniWeather icon shift right. Mouse loses focus b/c of icon shift. Progress bar disappears and icon then shift left. Cyclical behavior then occurs.

Expected Results:
Not shifted AniWeather icons.

Not shifted AniWeather icons.
