Firefox is extremely Slow if I browse image on internet (just with images) no matter the size
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-AR; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

I use window xp service pack 2, and have been using firefox without problem for a long time. I recently installed version 1.5.0.1 and discovered that when browsing image (just image on any tab) firefox get slow.
The image load at the normal speed of my internet connection but the program itself get slow, it make the arrow of my mouse to be slow, and change tab slowly. It happens on any website, google, wallpaper sites, etc
There is no problem if I load a webpage with a lot of images, but If I want to see JUST THE image, then the program get slow. For example, I can browse www.gamespot.com or www.gamewallpapers.com, (sites with lot of images) it perfect, BUT if I click on a image to see it bigger and alone in the page THERE IS THE PROBLEM.

I installed firefox in spanish language, my machine is safe, without virus or any other malicious software.
Thanks
