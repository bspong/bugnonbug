Firefox sometimes disappears when minimised to Windows toolbar

Firefox is still running according to ctrl-alt-del command (Windows Task Manager) but it is not visible sometimes. One time also, it actually disappeared spontaneously after several day of continuous running with multiple window (I wa doing some research in my spare time that required several day to complete) and I started a new instance, not realizing that it had actually just vanished from view. The "old" Firefox reappeared later, and then vanished again but I knew what wa going on at that point and wa able to resurrect it after closing the second instance, by clicking on a saved HTML document. This caused the first instance to re-emerge to display the document.
I tried to find any way to specify that I want Firefox to be visible at all times, but didn't find anything under options. If you want to make this a feature, I'd like to be able to negate it a I consider it a bug.

I suspect it might be due to the fact that I keep Firefox running a long time, and just turn my computer to standby when I'm not using it. I only restart if I have a problem and am not busy finishing something online. It's a new thing that I noticed only in the last few months, so might be related to some of Microsoft's last update which seem to have broken some important Internet-related stuff.
