Links are disabled after navigation request

After clicking a link and before the browser navigates away from the current page (only a problem on slower connection or slower websites), the link on the CURRENT page are disabled for opening in a new tab or window.

For example, if, during a Google image search, I see an image that I want to view, and click on the link to view the image on Page A, I am no longer able to open other link on the page in new tab or window while Firefox navigates to Page A.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a slower connection, click on a page link, and then hold CTRL and attempt to open other links, before Firefox navigates to the initially selected link. The expected new tab do not open.

Actual Results:
New tab do not open for the clicked links.

Expected Results:
Links should be active until they are no longer visible, like in Firefox 1.0.

As a side note, if, from Page A, which contains link to Page B and Page C, I click on Page B, but then decide, before Firefox ha loaded Page B, that I wish to go to Page C instead, I can click on the link for Page C, and I will go directly to Page C. Pressing the "back" button from Page C, however, take me to Page B before Page A.
