When viewing image embedded in a page that are sized differently to their actual dimension (height or width, both are affected) by more than 2px, the image doe not display, or only display half. Resizing by 1px seems to be fine.

When the image is not displayed, instead it seems the area where the image should be take on the colour of the first pixel in the image, therefore an image with a pink border would produce a pink block, and an image with a white background will display a white block.

In the example URL, I see one image, and two white box below it, here is a screen capture: http://aycu10.webshots.com/image/2089/1120624524843394424_rs.jpg

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View any site/page which ha image displayed at dimension larger or smaller than the actual image itself.
Actual Results:
Images are not rendered correctly.

Expected Results:
Images should be shown, at their altered dimensions.

This ha happened from 1.5.0.4 to 1.5.0.6
