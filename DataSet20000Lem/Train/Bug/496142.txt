Firefox/OSX Doesnt correctly handle 'display: table-column' possibly more from the 'display: table-*' family

I found while doing some study around the CSS 'display: table' and related display option and found that only on the OS X Firefox doe the problem occur.

What I've found is when using DIV's and assigining the main DIV 'display: table' and it two(or more) nested DIV's 'display: table-column'. When viewing these div tag in Safari, the div's act like table columns. Firefox on the other hand, doesnt display the nested div's beside eachother like they should, but rather one above the other.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a div that us 'display: table'
2.Add two or more nested div tag within the first div tag with 'display: table-column'
3.Make all 3 div tag show a border for better clarification
Actual Results:
The two nested div tag display on top of each other.

Expected Results:
The two nested div tag SHOULD display beside each other.
