It seems obvious that one should be able to save a few URLs to a visible location a webloc files, say the Desktop, and later decide to put them into a folder within Firefox, e.g. in the Bookmarks toolbar. One would expect to be able to select them all at once, then drag them to the desird location. But one get an unexpected (and useless) outcome: multiple copy of only ONE of the URLs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. While browsing, drag a few URLs to the desktop from the addrress bar, creating webloc files. (Quantity = <n>)
2. Select and drag those same <n> webloc file-icons to a folder in the Toolbar or to an appropriate locatiion in the BMLibrary page (Organize Bookmarks...).
3. Open the folder to inspect where the URLs ended up.
Actual Results:
<n> new URLs are now found where expected, but they are copy of only one of the files, not the <n> different URLs expected.

Expected Results:
Dragging n different webloc file put those same n URLs into the folder.

The only workaround is to drag the URL-files one at a time to the folder.
