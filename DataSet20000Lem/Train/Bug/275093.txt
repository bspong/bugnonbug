Unable to move the address field in Navigation Toolbar to the Main / Standard Toolbar,
Hi! - I am always in the quest for a much screen space a possible, and I am
trying to limit all my quicklink toolbars to just two lines.

Using the Customize option, and drag and drop feature, I have managed to move
all the field / button in the Navigation Toolbar to the line above it (i.e.
the standard toolbar), and they work smoothly.

But, when I try to move the last field, i.e. the address field, where I can type
a URL and Go to that page, I have some hiccups, and I have described this below.
1. Initially it accepts the move of the address field to the Std Toolbar
2. For a few times, I am able to type in an URL and link to that page.
3. After a few minutes, the address field becomes in active, i.e. the field is
still there, but, irrespective of what I type in, the same page is refreshed.
4. But if I were to 'UNHIDE' the navigation toolbar, the address field is there,
and if I were to enter an URL, I am able to go to that page.

So, is there a way for me to keep that address field in the Standard Toolbar
(will save me a whole line!).
