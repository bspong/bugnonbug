Steps to reproduce:

I didn't "do" anything. Your update did and I do not recall how long ago it was.


Actual results:

OPENING A NEW TAB OR OPENING A LINK FROM THE FIRST MAXIMIZED PAGE:


You cannot view hovered link in the menu bar --- and cannot use the FIND function -- when FF is any size other than MAXIMIZED. This is because the bottom bar is only visible when FF is full or maximized. Any other window size result in the bottom menu bar (add on's bar, FIND bar, link bar, whatever it is you call it these days) being completely invisible.

For example, opening a small FF browser window and using CTRL + F brings up no FIND box, however you may go ahead and press F3 to be brought to the next query result. However neither the FIND box nor a hovered link URL will display. One must MAXIMIZE a FF window to make use of the FIND BOX FUNCTION a well a actually SEE LINKS IN THE NAV BAR WHEN HOVERED ON THE PAGE.


Expected results:

Any size FF window should show both the FIND BOX a well a the URL of a hovered link. Simple.
