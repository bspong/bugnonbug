When viewing an email with attachments, there is a pane at the bottom of the message which display a list of attachment with a name and an icon. For me, dragging that icon *for a JPEG image* over a firefox window *onto the tab bar* cause both program to hang. The hang occurs a soon a the mouse enters the tab bar, before the icon is actually dropped.

I'm using nightly build of both. Based on the behaviour, I think it is a firefox bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an email with attachments.
2. See the pane at the bottom with the list of attachment
3. Find an attachment that is a JPEG.
4. Drag that attachment's icon over the onto Minefield's tab bar.
Actual Results:
As soon a the mouse enters firefox, both program hang. Killing firefox cause thunderbird to start responding again. Killing thunderbird doe not bring firefox back to life, however.

Expected Results:
I know this probably isn't a likely user action. I expected at least a protocol error message ("Firefox doesn't support imap://" or similar), not a hang. Thunderbird support dragging attachment into the file manager; I think it would be nice to have better interaction here (though I don't know whether that's a firefox or thunderbird bug).
