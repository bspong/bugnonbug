Page Load Error: "File Not Found" when retrieving file from the cache (visible problem: some image are not displayed)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-ES; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

Sometimes, when navigating through web pages, I randomly see broken image (not displayed, like not found in the server). This happens not only images, but CSS and JS documents, and also an entire HTML document (so you get the error page when accessing it via a link).

Opening the missing image/file/document in a window give me a page errora, page that internally is the following address:

about:neterror?e=fileNotFound&u=http%3A//URL.of.the/file&c=UTF-8&d=Firefox%20can't%20find%20the%20file%20at%20http%3A//URL.of.the/file.

Substing the "http%3A//URI.of.the/file" string to the URL of the image:

Document title: Page Load Error:
>
> File Not Found
> Firefox can't find the file at http://URL.of.the/file.
>
> * Could the item have been renamed, removed, or relocated?
> * Is there a spelling, capitalization, or other typographical
> error in the address?
> * Do you have sufficient access permission to the requested item?



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
This is reproducible for me. It happens randomly and I couldn't find any pattern of which step follow to reproduce that.

I cleared the entire cache once, to see if it wa caused by some incoherency on the browser update, but it happens again. But seems like the problem wa corrected immediately after the cache cleared. Maybe when the cache storage grows to some critical point then this happens.

The problem persists when closing the browser and reopening it again. The same file affected still have the same problem.

I think it happens at least since version 3.0.4 (now on 3.0.5)

Maybe, surf a lot on the web? If that matters, I edit and visit any page on several *.wikia.com wikis. That error happens on some image and JS form there, but also I saw it in other sites.



If I right-click the image and select "Show image", It doesn't get displayed. Running WireShark I see a HTTP request with cache header like If-Modified-Since: and If-None-Match:, and a HTTP 304 Not Modified response from the server.

If I right click the image and select "View Image", or access the filedirectly I get the above page error


Then I go to the cache entry for that file, locating it inside the address "about:cache?device=disk"

I found it. Comparing the entry item with another image that load fine, I see those relevant differences:

The file that load fine:
* "file on disk: none"
* At the bottom there a HEX representation of the file

The file that doesn't load:
* "file on disk: C:\Documents and Settings\jesus\Configuración local\Datos de programa\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\owsj7j7k.default\Cache\CF912BDEd01" (I took a look and the file DOESN'T EXIST)
* There's no HEX file representation at the bottom.


I have the WebDeveloper addon installed. If I check the "disable cache" option, right-click the image and select "Show image" the image then shows, but turning on cache at next page reload the image doesn't show.

If I right click the image and select "View Image", I get the above neterror page. If on that page I do a [CTRL + SHIFT + R] then the image get loaded and display OK in further page loads, so the problem on that image is solved


The cache folder is ATM 62.8 MB with 879 file in it

The url about:cache?device=disk gives:
Number of entries: 8192
Maximum storage size: 100000 KiB
Storage in use: 65900 KiB
Cache Directory: C:\Documents and Settings\jesus\Configuración local\Datos de programa\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\owsj7j7k.default\Cache

I have set 100MB of cache storage on preferences.

Remember that when I tried to find the cached file of the missing image, I didn't found it.

Bug 452494: Same page error, but it seems different, because this is a cache issue, and this bug is with local files.

It seems there are some other people with this problem: <http://www.google.com/search?q=firefox+"Do+you+have+sufficient+access+permissions+to+the+requested+item">
