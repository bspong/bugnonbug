When this page (with the embedded Quicktime [I'm using 6.5.2] file) is open in
one tab (Mozilla Firefox 1.5 beta 1), and I'm viewing 1.5's error page (such a
"Server not found") in another (and focus now, it get complicated here), I will
click "Try Again", tab over to the video to watch it while the server page
loads, and go back to find the Quicktime file, for some reason, playing over the
Server Not Found page, and the server not found page is in a different font.
Occasionally, the Firefox GUI will be severely destroyed a well. It can be
temporarily fixed by closing the page with the embedded QT movie (permanently,
you must close firefox.exe and reopen it to be able to go back without error on
other tabs), and minimize and restore the current window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open http://www.stewdio.org/jed/ in one tab.
2.Open a new blank tab, and type in a random URL that you know will not work.
(Example: www.sadjosahjdoijoisajd.com)
3.Click "Try Again" and tab over to "jed".
4. When the "Server Not Found" error is finished re-loading, tab back over to
it. It's fairly easy to tell when you've suceeded.
Actual Results:
What wa described in the details.

Expected Results:
The page should have remained error free and allowed me to continue viewing the
embedded quicktime movie whilst tabbing through pages.
