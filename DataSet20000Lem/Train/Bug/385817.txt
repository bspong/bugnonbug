when i try to send a message or post a comment on MySpace.com the browser clear the message field and say "*required field". This is the only site in which i have encountered this problem. I used SeaMonkey to get around the problem but i do n't like that browser a it ha other problem of it's own. though it is a BRILLIANT concept.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.mail center @ myspace.com
2.select message > reply
3.type message > click send
Actual Results:
result always is the same: message field clear and red lettering saying "* required field" appears.

Expected Results:
should send message/comment and forward me to a screen giving option to "return to user profile" or "return to inbox"

using default theme.. never had the problem before until about a week ago and have been unable to rectify it. I have tried un-installing it and reinstalling it to no avail.
I love the concept of SeaMonkey but it ha it's own set of flaws.. a I understand, it is still in progress anyway. i look forward to the finished product.
