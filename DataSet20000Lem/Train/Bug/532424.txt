when trying to sell an item I am repeatedly asked for username and password when already logged in. is this Firefox or Ebay?

I can log into Ebay fine, but when I try to sell an item I am asked for login detail (even though already logged in). I enter correct detail and asked again for login detail etc etc etc. I dont get this behaviour in Safari but prefer to use Firefox. So is this a Firefox bug or Ebay?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into Ebay
2.Click Sell Item
3.Click 'Browse Categories' or any other option from this page
4. Presented with login screen
5. Enter valiid login detail
6. Presented with login screen
7. Goto 5
Actual Results:
Can never get to sell an item. Sometimes Ebay will let me through this and doesnt ask for the login at step 4, and sometimes it doesnt.

Expected Results:
In Safari, no login screen is presented when I am already logged into Ebay and try to sell an item - it go straight to either browsing category or entering item details. This is how I expect Firefox to behave.

The only help I got from the Firefox forum wa to try removing the Cookies file a this could be corrupted. I tried this (having shut down Firefox first) but it ha made no difference.

I looked through the known bug list but couldnt see anything like this.

I have been selling through Firefox/Ebay for about 8 week and had no problem until the last few weeks. Sorry I dont know exactly when.
