I upgraded from 2.0.0.16 to 3.0.1 last night (WIN XP Professional). This morning I loaded a message board page: http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_thread.php?id=49058
I later added an entry to this page from another computer and verified the page wa updated. Over an hour after that I used the reload button on the first PC with 3.0.1 to view this entry. It would not update. I backed out to the summary page: http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/forum_forum.php?id=21 and tried to reload from the button. It also failed to update. I also tried linking back to the thread page and reloading both page via the button and through the "View" / "Reload" menu. I also tried opening another tab and another window and using the reload button and "View" / "Reloads" there. No success. I did not try reloading the cache. It wa not until I closed Firefox 3.0.1 completely and reopened it that I wa able to see the new entry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Another thread wa added from another PC.
2. I tried the reload button again.
3. Not only did Firefox not show the new entries, but it dropped the earlier new entry and redisplayed the old page that wa cached from last night. This redisplay showed none of the new thread added today!
Actual Results:
Not only did Firefox not show the new entries, but it dropped the earlier new entry and redisplayed the old page that wa cached from last night. This redisplay showed none of the new thread added today!

Expected Results:
I would have expected the browser to display all thread up to the moment the reload button wa clicked.

Firefox option are set to enable Java and Java Script, block pop-up window and to load image automatically. My cache is set to 128 MB. History is set to 99 days. "Clear Private Data" is turned off.
This should be easy to reproduce. If you have any further question about configuration, OS, PC, etc., please contact me.
