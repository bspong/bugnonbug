When browsing secure (https) with Firefox 3.5x, Firefox show a SSL error if there are any broken image on the page. View info doe not show broken images. This situation akes diagnosing a SSL problem virtually impossible. IE, Chrome, Safari do not show SSL error on broken images.

2.
3.
Actual Results:

I'm not sure what the correct solution to this is. It would be best if Firefox did not show a SSL error because of broken images. IE, Chrome and Safari show no error. I'm not sure who's following the standard or if there is one in this case. At the very least there should be some dialog a to why the ssl error occurred.
