During regular browser usage, I occasionally experience a sudden sluggishness to the browser, followed by significant increase in memory usage (I have watched it go from 900MB to 2GB in about 5 minutes), followed by a crash. I have experienced this since 4.0. I am now attempting to disable my plugins to reduce the chance of crashing, which may diminish reproducibility. However, prior to this point I would find my browser crashed every day or two. My system is always-on, and when returning to it, the browser would often have died while I wa away.

I have never been able to correlate the crash with any particular plugin or type of site. I have experienced issue on everything from craigslist to ebay to other random sites.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I cannot reproduce this on-demand. The issue would present over a period of uptime (usually in the 8-24 hour range). My own reproducibility may not be diminished with disabling of many plugins and addons.



quad-core Athlon, raid1 disks. System ha relatively light web and email usage for the most part. Entirely stable, uptime in months, only rebooted for major system updates.
