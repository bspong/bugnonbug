In Firefox 3.0.6, and also in Shiretoko and Minefield updated today, when one us "Save Page As..." or in download "Save File", in both the tree view (Navigation Pane) and the detail pane, scrolling is erratic. The first few click in the scroll bar usually seem normal, but then the scroll bar will suddenly jump a long way down (use a directory with a number of subdirectories, such a "Program Files" in Windows Vista). The behavior is not entirely consistent, I think, but happens almost every time. The scroll bar jump to the position of the cursor. I can't find any mouse setting that would explain it.

On the same machine, no similar behavior occurs in Windows Explorer, Internet Explorer, Openoffice 3.0.1, Google Chrome 2.0.164.0, or other program that I use.

I can't see the same problem on Windows XP or Fedora 10, both with 3.0.6 versions, so it seems to be Vista specific.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On any browser page, do "File > Save Page As..."
2. Browse to a folder with more than a few subdirectory (C:\Program Files)
3. View a detail so that there is one item per line.
4. Click the scroll bar beneath the cursor twice.
Actual Results:
After the second click, see the scroll bar jump down to it, skipping the item in between, which might be the one you are looking for.

Expected Results:
Scroll down a few line or even a full page of the folder or files, so you can select whichever you want.
