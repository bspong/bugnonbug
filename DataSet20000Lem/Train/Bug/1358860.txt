Steps to reproduce:

This problem appears most frequently on page with a large amount of medium or video page with a responsive design. It happens with regularity on Youtube videos. An example of what happens when on Youtube is:

- I will load a Youtube video.
- I will try and resize the window to take up le horizontal space. The issue occurs most frequently when the responsive design ha been triggered (e.g. the playlist sidebar on the right will disappear and the video will change in size), but sometimes the problem occurs even if the responsive design isn't triggered.
- The window will resize. Often it will be quite slow in doing so. However, the cursor then get stuck on resize mode even after the resizing.


Actual results:

The cursor get stuck in resize mode. By this I mean that it switch from the standard arrow pointer to a bidirectional resize cursor. This persists even when the page ha already been resized and I have released the mouse. When I move the cursor off the side of the window, it then change the page size even though I have already released the mouse button.


Expected results:

The cursor should have switched back to the pointer a soon a I released the mouse. It should have continued to resize the window simply by moving the cursor across the scene without me pressing down on the right click button.
