Basically, since the totally lovely and uncontroversial patch for bug 303806
landed, menubuttons inside the menubar ha attempted to be highlighted on
mouseover. Unfortunately, if one middle-clicks on a menubutton inside a
menupopup, the background color remains, though the menupopup closes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Middle click on Help --> Release Notes.
Actual Results:
The 'Help' menubutton stayed highlighted, though the menupopup closed and the
page opened in a new tab.

Expected Results:
The menubutton should have lost it highlight.

I suspect the issue is more that menupopups are not treating middle click a
changing a menu's "active" status; however, I do not recall this issue in the
previous version of the theme, so I think it's a regression.

This should probably block 1.5b2, a it's a significant polish issue and I don't
think the "make menu only compatible with Luna" patch is going to be backed out
any time soon.
