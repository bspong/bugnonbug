Firefox advanced browsing option "open link in the background" misleading

This is an analog to the Mozilla Suite bug I've been working on, #111842

To sum up, the preference under General Browser in Firefox's Advanced option
labeled "Load link in background" is EXTREMELY confusing. It wa slightly
better (though still misleading) in the Mozilla Suite since it wa under Tabbed
Browsing preferences. Under General Browser in Firefox, it make it seem a if
the browser is "precaching" page that are linked to on the current page. In no
way doe it specify that it ha something to do with the manner in which new
Tabs (and Bookmarks) are opened.

I've created a patch that his been approved (but waiting for sr, neither have
gotten back to me for the past five day though) which basically give a new
text for the option, a well a automatically reverse the meaning of the pref in
the backend. Shouldn't break anything existing that depends on this pref.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:




I would normally set this to "Trivial" but this is a VERY confusing option. I
believe it's rather important to clear up for 1.0 exactly what's happening when
people enable or disable the preference.

I'll try to get the patch submitted tonight.
