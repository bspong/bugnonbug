Problem exist only in FireFox - that is why I assume it's a FireFox bug. I have one simple curl function that communicate with paypal. 1st time I call the function with method "Get" - to receive transaction details, buyer's ID. 2nd step is to call the function with method "Do" - to process the transaction (adding buyer id and cart details). Now a you can see (check url) FireFox do something like "double call". When I do Get only everything is ok - but when I'm adding Do to the script - Armageddon occur :/
Everything is ok with script - it work perfectly in IE (lol IE!), webkit, opera etc.
PayPal side? Maybe who know - but then again why it's happening in FireFox only?

Ps. My customer pay on paypal (useraction=commit is added to the very first call ;)) - that is why I call "get" and "do" without user's action.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set up PayPal ExpressCheckout with useraction=commit
2.Try to process a transaction
Actual Results:
FireFox do something like double call of my subpage? Even when I use sleep(); or set_time_limit(); or ever sending header before "do" - I getting an error "transaction already processed" - yeah you can say "paypal" - but why it's only FireFox issue?

Expected Results:
Wait or should not "refresh" my script? Somehow?
