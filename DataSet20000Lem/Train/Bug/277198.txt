Each GROUP of Radio Buttons should be Tabbed, NOT EVERY Radio Button.
Arrows should allow user to highlight radio button and move within the group
(since their Radios and not Checkboxes, the highlight moves).
Currently, if you wish to fill out a form sans mouse, not only must you tab thru
every choice, you also have to press the spacebar to select the correct one.
You should be able to Tab to a group, Arrow to your choice and Tab to the next
group. This make it easier to highlight the "NO, I DON'T WANT JUNK MAIL" choice
on webforms and save year of therapy on web surveys.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a webform
2. Try to fill out the form keyboard-only like an intelligent person instead of
a newbie despately clinging to a mouse that he can't even navigate with anyway.
3.

Actual Results:
I almost wanted to reach for a mouse!
All the extra tabbing and spacing threw off my groove and slowed form use severely.

Expected Results:
Tab between Radio groups.
Arrow between choices.
