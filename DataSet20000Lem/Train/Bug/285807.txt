Incluse a feature that list message that the user told not appear again.

There are several feature in Firefox that display pop-up alert (or some other
form of an alert) to notify the user of something that occurred. Several of
these notification include an option to have the alert never appear again.
While this is very useful, on thing that is lacking is an easy way to re-enable
these message again if the user accidentally dismisses them or want them back
again.

Two example of these message include:
The warning that appears when you try to close a window with multiple tab open.
The yellow bar that appears when a pop-up is blocked.

A solution would involve having some kind of feature either included in the
option window, or via a link on the Tools menu that would show all of these
dismissed windows, notices, warnings, etc... and allow the user to re-enable
them, if they so desire.

In addition, perhaps a message could be included on some of these pop-up to
notify the user of how they can re-enable the notice if they accidentally close
them. Then again, I'm not sure if this would clutter the UI or not.
