Implement Site-Specific Privacy Preferences

Mockups: separate window in current design, interated interface

For Firefox 4, we are integrating the separate manager for individual privacy permission into one site-centric interface within preferences. Rather than having a separate window in preference for each permission category, a single interface will display permission per domain and allow the user to change preference for a single or all domains.

Some window that could be integrated into this single interface are:

- Pop-ups
- Images
- Add-on Installation
- Cookies
- Saved Passwords/Account Management
- Offline Data
- Geolocation

The problem with the current UI is that the one-window-per-preference design is framed around the implementation model rather than the user’s mental model; it’s designed in a way that corresponds with how it wa built rather than how user perceive the action they want to take. A better design would present control in a site-centric rather than technology-centric view. If a user decides that he doesn’t trust site X and doesn’t want it to have any access, it would be more efficient to control all of site X’s access in a single preference window than hunt for the permission individually.
