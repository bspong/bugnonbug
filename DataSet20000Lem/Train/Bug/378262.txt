I am using a Linux operating system with Firefox 2.0.0.3. When I first open Firefox, I can type the web address into the address bar or type keywords into any search engine like Google, but after another window open or if I decide to go Back to the previous page, I can no longer type anything into any text box. There is simply no respone from the keyboard. Sometimes I get a response if I refresh the window, but this rarely works. Sometimes one letter will appear, but another one will not. It is very frustrating and I first thought it wa the keyboard or the operating system. I also thought it wa in the keyboard settings, but testing this did nothing. The same occured with another keyboard. I even performed a fresh reinstall of Firefox from 2.0.0.2 to 2.0.0.3. This did not work.

I have searched the forum and discussion groups. Several people have mentioned similar problem for Mac and Windows operating systems. The same problem exists in Linux a well.

HOWEVER, the solution I found wa that if I completely disable both Java and JavaScript in the Preferences/Content box, then I do not have this problem.

But..... then many other thing do not work on site that need Java.

For example, - I am looking for plane flight and the search engine requires Java to work.. So, I have to press the Back button, Disable Java and JavaScript, type in my new search criteria, again Enable Jave and JavaScript, and then search for what I want. This is very cumbersome, but works. I wish at least there were a way to put a Java and JavaScript enable/disable button on the task bar a a quick work-around, but this may kind of be like fixing a broken toilet with a coathanger. At any rate, it seems to work. I hope it can be fixed soon a this is apparently a long running problem with all operating system using Firefox. I have not run into any solution. I did not have this problem before upgrading to Firefox 2. Good luck solving this problem and thanks for a good browser system.

1.Open Firefox and Google or Yahoo or any webpage with a textbook

6.Go to Preferences/Content and diable Java and JavaScript.
7.Try step 2-4 and they will give no problem a long a you do not need Java for whatever you are using
