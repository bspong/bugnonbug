Over-saturated color balance when compared to IE and Firefox 3.0.12

I recently updated from Firefox 3.0.12 to 3.5 and immediately noticed that the color balance on my company's website wa strangely out of balance. Suddenly the image wa drastically darker and color (particularly red) were over-driven and blotchy, giving the color tone in photograph an almost "solarized/posterized" effect. This can also be readily compared with IE7. I checked your bug forum and saw one post that suggested updating the driver for my ATI video card - which I have done and the color saturation problem continues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View a website with color photograph in IE7 or a pre-firefox 3.5 browser
2. Open same website in Firefox 3.5
3. Compare color tone between image
Actual Results:
Consistently in website with full color photograph Firefox 3.5 over-saturates
the color balance, causing hyper-intense coloration and loss of image detail and texture.

Expected Results:
The color display in Firefox 3.5 should provide real and accurate tone that doe not exaggerate an image's color intensity and cause no loss of image detail in fine line and texture.

This is most noticeable in larger, high quality image and particularly in flesh tones. A photograph of Elmo from Sesame Street is a good test a he is brightly colored, but also ha many fine hair all over his fuzzy body.
