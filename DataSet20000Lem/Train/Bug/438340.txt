Migrating network.protocol-handler.app from Firefox-2 profile fails

I had Firefox-2.0.0.14 set up to properly use external mailto and file handlers. After upgrading to Firefox-3.0, these setting were no longer present, and there seems no obvious way to fix these in the current Firefox-3.0 UI.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox-2.0.0.14 with the following setting in prefs.js:

user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.file", "/usr/bin/roxuri");
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", "/usr/bin/claws-mail");
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.expose.mailto", true);
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.external.file", true);
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.warn-external.mailto", true);

2. Verify that Download manager's "Open Containing Folder" option work properly, a do mailto links.

3. Start Firefox-3.0-rc2, the profile will be migrated. However, neither the Download manager's "Open Containing Folder" nor mailto link function.
Actual Results:
Something is being missed in the profile migration, and these setting are not honoured. Furthermore, it doesn't seem possible to change these setting in the Firefox-3.0-rc2 UI after such a failed conversion.

Expected Results:
The migration should properly convert these setting into appropriate entry in mimeTypes.rdf
