Each time I try to move a bookmark to a folder, using "Organize," the browser crashes. It doe not hang; it disappears from screen. I can restart browser and it offer to open the site I wa on when it crashed; that works. But I can no longer move bookmark to keep them easily organized. I believe the first time the crash occurred, I wa attempting to move the bookmark for the site I wa at.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on "Bookmarks."
2. Click on "Organize Bookmarks."
3. Click on "Bookmarks Menu."
4. Click on Name of bookmark.
5. Click on "Organize."
6. Click on "Move...."
At this point Firefox crashes.
Actual Results:
Browser crash and disappears from screen.

Expected Results:
It should have provided list of folder to select one in which to deposit selected bookmark.

I am still relatively a new user of Linux, although I previously had ThinkPad dual-boot with Linux Red Hat 7.3 installed. I used it mostly to modify file (using "vi" editor) and format/print result using a ported version of a UNIX DBMS called UNITY (invented at Bell Labs, where I used to work). Am hoping to be able to TOTALLY get away from Microsoft Windows (gag, barf!) and use Fedora 12 on new machine. At the Labs, I wa considered a GREAT system tester, a I "got paid to break things" and wa known for causing failure in the most robust of software! If I can assist with Linux improvement, please advise. NOTE: I am not a programmer, so cannot find error in source code; am only good at breaking stuff!! Thanx.
