When I connect to any page that us Java's livconnect, the browser hang anf
firefox show 80-90% CPU usage for 30 second to a minute while thousand (no
exaggeration, three thousand and up!) of these message are issued over and
over. When FF hang on this condition, can't close firefox without using task
manager to end program.

The sites, all mainstream stuff, range from NOAA's radar loop to IBM's PC
pages, Flychicago's Midway airport hotel virtual tours, in short too many to
list. I've found none that worked if liveconnect wa used. I determined this by
setting trace=5 in the Java console.

I've removed and reinstalled FF including blowing out the program folders.
( Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041112 Firefox/1.0 )
Removed and reinstalled Java, installing within Firefox and from the Firefox page.
I've also loosened up the security setting to allow everything and it make no
difference.
