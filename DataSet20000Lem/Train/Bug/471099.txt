Page Load Error message appears after loading a web site. After doing a refresh (around 4-8 times), the page is finally loaded. This is an intermittent problem. Sometimes, the page is loaded after the first attempt, but more often, I need to reload the page.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just enter any website (e.g. google.com)
2. If you received "Page Load Error", try to refresh/reload the page.
3. After a few attempt, it will be loaded correctly.
Actual Results:
