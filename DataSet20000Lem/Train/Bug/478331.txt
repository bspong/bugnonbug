on my home computer, I cannot download a jpg from either dowload or view option
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.19 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/1.0.154.48 Safari/525.19
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0.6

If I choose 'view all' from within an Gmail email WITH MORE THAN ONE jpg attachment, I can right click to download individual jpgs. BUT if an email ha ONLY ONE jpg, and I try to download from the 'download' option OR right-clicking the image that open from the 'view' option, any jpg get renamed a "mail.google" and is unopenable - even if I rename it and re=enter the extension.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Gmail, choose an email with a SINGLE jpg attachment.
2. Either select a) the 'download' option or b) the 'view' option and right-click for a download
3.
Actual Results:
Every downloaded jpg is renamed a "mail.google" and LOSES it extension so that it is unopenable EVEN IF the extension .jpg is re-added to the end of file name. (This glitch only happened after the most recent Firefox update during the past week.)

Expected Results:
the jpg should have retained the name that it appears with a the attachment in the email and should be openable

The above downloading procedure work a expected in both Internet Explorer and Chrome browsers. It work in Firefox with an email that ha more than one jpg atttachemnt AS LONG AS I use the 'view all' option first. It work on my Firefox browser at work, though at work I have not updated Firefox and I have fewer ADD-ONS installed. The ADD-ONS I have installed at home have been installed for the last 4 month and are highly recommended ADD-ONS.
