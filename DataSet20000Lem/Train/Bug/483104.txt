Copying text to or from the clipboard in an APEX script editor (such a for a trigger) doe not transfer text to or from the standard window clipboard.

Text will copy/paste within the script editor, but text cannot be pasted out of, or into the editor (e.g. out to notepad, or from notepad back to the editor).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In an APEX application, go to a trigger code definition and click Edit to edit the code
2. Highlight some code and copy to clipboard (ctrl-c or edit->copy)
3. Attempt to paste into notepad
Actual Results:
Anything previously on the window clipboard will be pasted into notepad instead of the text copied from the APEX script editor. If nothing wa previously on the clipboard nothing will be pasted or the paste option will be unavailable from the edit menu.

Expected Results:
Text copied from the APEX script editor should have been transferred to the window clipboard and be able to be posted a text in any application that can handle pasting text.

Tested with Oracle Application Express 3.0.1.00.08.

Works correctly with Internet Explorer 7.

Script editor doe not work at all with google chrome, so cannot perform the same test with that.

This problem prevents developer from being able to effectively use firefox for oracle application express development - we're locked into IE. Copying/pasting between the script editor and external application is fairly critical for workflow during development.
