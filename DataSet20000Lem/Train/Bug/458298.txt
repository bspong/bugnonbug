Extensive UI bugs, crash on bug submission website, crash on help->about
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)
Build Identifier: 3.03 (can't check build due to crash on help->about!).

UI bug - when clicking on the address bar, the cursor stay about four space in even while typing. After filling up the address bar, the text run on the rest of the UI instead of scrolling over. If a website ha too long of an address, the address bar will take up several line of UI space (gets taller). Address bar is not highlighted when I click on it (even when typing clear it). Various thing do not show up in web page (username, password box for example). Also button don't have any text in them (clear private information or restore tab button for example (click yes or no) are empty). This started after installing 3.03 and persisted after a reboot.

Next, when attempting to submit a bug report, selecting the buggy product crash the browser. Now that I am using IE to submit the bug, opening help->about to check the build number crash the browser.
