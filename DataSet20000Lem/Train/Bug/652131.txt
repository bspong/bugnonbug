Hi. Since the latest upgrade, I have consistently received the following errors:
1. When clicking any e-mail link I get launched to do a file search, the box is titled Locate Link Browser, and default to the my document folder. The browser doe launch and I have to close the locate link browser box, otherwise, it just stay open.

2. When I double click on Citrix to launch my vpn connection, I get a gray box with the following dialog: "Windows cannot find 'https://citrix.fnf.com/Citirx/XenApp1/SSL/site/default.aspx?CTX_MessageType=SUCCESS&CTX_MessageKey=UsableClientForced'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search." It ha an OK button which will close the box.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For error 1, 1. Click a link in any e-mail.
2. Error file open box launches, but so doe the browser.
3. Continue on the browser link.
4. Close the file open box.

For error 2, 1. Double click citrix link.
2. Error box appears.
3. Click OK.
4. Browser open for citrix login and continues on OK.
Actual Results:
The desired function do take place, but in both instance the error box ha to be closed. Just annoying.

Expected Results:
Launch the browser in question without opening a file open activity box and without displaying a citrix error. Just need to launch the browser in both instance and not have these extra box to deal with.
