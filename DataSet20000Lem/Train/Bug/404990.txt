When a bookmark file saved from Firefox 2.x is imported into Firefox 3, all separator silently lose their descriptions.

I have reported the loss of separator name a bug 404983. I have given it minor importace because I am assuming that named separator are meant to be replaced by alternative bookmark functionality such a the use of folders, tags, and better searching capabilites and that the behaviour is there to stay.

However, when importing bookmark file with an extensive use of named separators, the (silent) deletion of the information contained in the named separator is a major annoyance if Firefox 3 is meant to be encouraged a an upgrade to Firefox 2.

At a minimum, the user should be warned before the import or upgrade that such a loss is about to happen and let him decide on whether it is worth it.

It would be even better to provide a real upgrade path with minimal information loss. For example, named separator might be replaced (with a warning such a the former) by a combination of a folder with than name and an unnamed separator or something similar. Although this won't be to everybody's taste (given that the semantics of a named separator and the following element vary case by case) at least information loss will be minimized which will help upgrading the layout to according to the new feature and limitation(s).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save Firefox 2 bookmark in a file.
2. Import the file to Firefox 3.
Actual Results:
The import is done silently and named separator irreversibly lose their description.

Expected Results:
A warning should be shown about potential data loss and preferably a minimally lossy conversion should be offered or applied.

The problem might also show up when upgrading from Firefox 2 to Firefox 3, which would be worse than the importing scenario because:

* the upgrade will probably be suggested to the user (either a an automatic update or through the media) and

* the average user will not be aware of having any kind of backup of his original bookmark layout (I aexpect it to be stored somewhere for a reasonable amount of time).
