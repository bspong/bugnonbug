i am using a toshiba notebook and this thing ha happened to me twice in the past 2 week ( once with v 2.0.0.3 and yesterday with v 2.0.0.4).
i have set firefox to remember history for the last 120 days. but twice the Firefox just crashed (dont know the reason why) and when i restarted Firefox it didn't gave me the option of "restore new session or start new session". i wa puzzled. i kept going. next thing i found out wa that my entire history had been deleted, but most cooky and password were intact(i didn't clear all my private data nor have enabled that option), on further checking i found that only some site cooky and password were deleted and most were there( i checked using cookie manager, a program to see firefox cookies).
this happened first to me 2 week back & i thought it wa on off problem with firefox, and few day back i upgraded to v 2.0.0.4, thinking that the problem had been fixed. but it wa not the case so, the same thing happened to me yesterday also(same each and every step). now i am seriously thinking of shifting to another browser if the problem isnt solved.
i think i have explained to the last detail a possible, if u need more info u can contact me on my mail id, i would help a much a possible.
