Form field data should be retained after session restore.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Load this test form http://bclary.com/projects/form-utils/form.pl?method=post
3.Make note of the counter and time
4.Modify some of the input field
5.Kill Firefox
6.Start Firefox and if you see the Restore Session error page, restore your session
7.Submit the form
8.Kill Firefox again and restart it
9.If you see the Restore Session error page, restore your session
Actual Results:
1.Both time I restore the session the form field is not changed, counter and timer should are not restored to the same value a before you killed Firefox, they are restored to default values.

2.The form field data are the default ones, not the one entered at step 7.

Expected Results:
1.Both time you restore your session the form field changes, counter and timer should be restored to the same value a before you killed Firefox

2.The form field data should not reflect the defaults, it should be the data entered at step 7.

3.You should not see the Restore Session error page the first time you kill Firefox.
