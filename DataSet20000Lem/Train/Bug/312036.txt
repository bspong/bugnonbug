If I visit for example www.google.com and remove this site from the history
sidebar afterwards , the URL won't be visible in the address bar or in any
history list a expected.

BUT it can still be found by greping the user configuration files. Use this
command for validation

# grep -ri google ~/.mozilla/firefox




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit an arbitrary site
2. remove this site from the history sidebar
3. grep your configuration directory with the command specified above

Actual Results:
site is still visible in history.dat and other file

Expected Results:
site should not exist any longer in any file (except cache file maybe)

I've reported this bug long before firexox existed with the mozilla browser.

They have resolved the problem very quickly. Unfortunately I don't remember how
(I think is wa something like a "compressed commit" or "compressed submit" or
something like that)

By the way: in moziilla's case the problem only existed when removing some
entry explicitly in the sidebar or in the history window. It didn't happen,
when pressing "clear all".
