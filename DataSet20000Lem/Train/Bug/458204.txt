Occasional lockup of which the following instance is an example ("summarises" is spelled summarizes on this side of the Atlantic)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3

Firefox, when it works, is my preferred browser. The best thing is the relative simplicity of the way the "Find" feature works. I also like the simplicity of Cntrl-B for the bookmarks. In preparation for our travel I copy a lot of picture (2000+ recently) off the internet and your recent improvement have made that process a lot le cumbersome.

That said the stability of the browser continues to be a problem. This morning I went to time.gov and clicked on the time zone. Firefox locked up. I closed it and reopened it. Upon reopening I selected the "Restore previous session" option. It returned me to the time.gov home page. Again I clicked on the time zone and again it locked. In the end I wa compelled to resort to Internet Explorer just so I could reset my watch.

I wouldn't bother writing you if this were an isolated occurrence, but I see this sort of lockup and the corresponding "(Not Responding)" on the title bar more often than I would like - say, on the order of twice a month. For your information I have Firefox 3.0.3 running on a Windows Vista Home Premium platform.

Please see what you can do.
