Firefox 3 shuts itself down spontaneously every few hours. I can't tell if anything in particular trigger this. It seems to happen more or le randomly, but mostly when I'm clicking on some link (not the same one each time). It doesn't crash the operating system. After it happens I get a message that FF ha encountered a problem and need to shut itself down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. can't figure out what trigger this behavior; sorry! But it still happens!
2. ff shuts itself down about every two hour
3.
Actual Results:
get error message: ff ha encountered a problem and need to shut down; do i want to submit an error report. I do, and them when I try to re-launch it i'm asked if i want to start a new session or restore the old one. then it work until the next time it shuts itself down.

Expected Results:
shouldn't shut itself down. I never had a problem with the previous version of ff, ver. 2. doe this have something to do with my new ant-virus program, Kaspersky?
