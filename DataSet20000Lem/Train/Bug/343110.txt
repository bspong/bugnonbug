I have been noticing since switching from IE to Firefox that when I copy text to my clipboard from webpage in Firefox or to the Google search bar within Firefox, after selecting Paste, no text is displayed. I have been noticing this bug more recently than before. This bug also occurs when pasting text within Firefox to other program such a Microsoft Word, Excel, and within the Firefox address bar itself.
This bug only occurs randomly and not all the time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a website that contains a URL within the page that is not hyperlinked.
2. Select the URL and copy it to the clipboard
3. Paste the URL into the address bar within Firefox

In most cases, the URL doe not get pasted even after being copied to the clipboard. This copy/paste bug also occurs when trying to paste into the Google Search bar in Firefox amoung other programs.

Actual Results:
Nothing get pasted even after being copied to the clipboard.

Expected Results:
Pasted the copied text.
