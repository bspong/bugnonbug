I don't like reporting a problem that I can't reproduce, but a hang in Firefox such that it ha to be killed is not a good thing, especially with data loss. So it's good to note it incase it's an indication of a more systemic problem.

Installed 3.0 on system, earlier version had been removed previously, had been using IE7 for about a year a primary browser (don't ask why). Installed 3.0 on system, imported all setting from IE7, working fine. Decided to clean up the imported bookmark a little bit (move them around to better locations). One move from the "imported" directory up a level to the Bookmarks menu caused Firefox to hang. Firefox not using any CPU time. It apparently wa waiting for a signal of some sort. No other relevant activity on system. Eventually I killed Firefox, restarted, and resumed my process of cleaning up the bookmarks. The bookmark being moved were gone from the import directory, and not moved up. I re-imported just the bookmarks, did the move up, and this time it worked. Same bookmarks. Same location.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Actual Results:
Firefox hung, no CPU time.

Expected Results:
Organized bookmark correctly without losing them.
