crash on malformated url

Ok, If I open up FF 1.0.5 (MacOSX 10.4) and type in "gfx/" in the titlebar - it
crashes... I tried the same thing on Fedora with version 10.0.4 it doesn't
crash (redirects to some site that look like it came from Google's "I'm Feeling
Lucky"). I heard of a FF extention that doe something like that but to my
knowledge I don't have it installed.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2. type in "gfx/"
3. press enter

Actual Results:
It crashed

Expected Results:
a redirect, or an error that that site doesn't exist (or that it is a
malformated url).

I'm not sure if this is a Mac only bug or a 1.0.5 only bug. After looking for
similar bug I found this: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275164

But I highly doubt that it ha anything to do with my problem.

I haven't tested out other form of "some-text/", but my guess is that that too
would crash it.

I originally thought that this may be able to cause a denial of service...
but it can't (with what I tried):
<html>
<a href="http://gfx">link</a>
<a href="gfx/">link</a>
<a href="gfx">link</a>
</html>

If you have any question / remards - feel free to email me.
