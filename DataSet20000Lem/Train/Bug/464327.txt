First thank you for your work on firefox, the best browser from far. But since the last update of firefox, 2.x.x.x to 3.0 I have graphical problem with my joomla website. It ha always been working great until that update. I use joomla and virtuemart and all the item in virtuemart, their description and their image are off center, to the right. This only appears with Firefox, the website work great with explorer or safari. it is easy to see you just have to open the link bellow with firefox and then with another browser, no matter which one.

Thank you for your help,

Timothée.
