Session restore sometimes fails to restore (after an OS shutdown?)
I apologize in advance for the vagueness of this bug, and more importantly for the fact that I don't know how to reliably reproduce it. If there is any information that I can provide to help in debugging this that wouldn't take me hour to collect, please let me know.

Three time in the last 4 days, session restore ha failed to restore my session. I have the browser set to load my homepage on startup in preferences. When I quit the browser, I get a dialog which asks: "Do you want Minefield to save your tab for the next time it starts?" I select "Save and Quit". Usually, when I restart the tab are restored. In the failure cases, the homepage ha been shown instead, and the add-on manager window wa shown. The infobar in this claimed that two extension were installed, and the main area wa blank. I had not in fact installed any extension before quitting. Given the correlation, I assume the two are somehow related.

I did just try to reproduce by installing a nightly update, then quitting with Command-Q, then starting the browser. I also tried disabling an extension, then quitting with Command-Q and then starting the browser. Then I tried the same, but with enabling an extension. None of these reproduced the problem.
