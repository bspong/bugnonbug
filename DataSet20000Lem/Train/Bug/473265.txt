Bug 454242 Not Fixed - The location of file used by helper app location is no longer consistent with the download location

I am still experiencing this bug in the latest download of Firefox 3. When I download a file and save it, it save to my specified default location (the Desktop). If the file are opened with a helper application, they are downloaded to the Downloads folder.
've tried the proposed solution on this hint http://www.macosxhints.com/article.p...80302205219455 but they did not work.

I have gone to the Firefox preference and set the download folder to the desktop. I have also set this preference in Safari. When I simply download a file, this works. When Firefox automatically open a file (like a zip opened with Stuffit), the result still end up in the downloads folder.

I have checked the browser.download option in about:config and reset them. I have removed the com.apple.internetconfig.plist, com.apple.internetconfigpriv.plist, and com.apple.LaunchServices.plist preferences. After that, I've re-checked that both the Firefox and Safari download location are set to the desktop, quit and restarted, yet still this problem is there. If a file is downloaded and opened, it go to Downloads.

I'm using Firefox 3.0.5 on a mac running OS 10.5.6 (Leopard).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a file to download (e.g. a zip archive)
2. In download dialogue, select "Open with" option (e.g. Stuffit Expander)
3. Look for the file - it will be in Downloads, not the specified downloads folder.
Actual Results:
The file end up in the Downloads folder, not the Desktop a I have specified in the preferences.

Expected Results:
It should have saved the file to the Desktop a specified in the preference and a it doe when I simply download the file.
