I have recently upgraded my site above. I'm using YSlow, a Yahoo speed debugger to test the improvements. YSlow us the firebug addon. It let you see headers, compression etc... and give you area of where you can improve your site speed/performance.

My improvement to my site -

Gzip html.
Got rid of etags.
Cached every page component.

The bug appears when you try to refresh the page with YSlow open. You receive "This program need to close do you want to report it to microsoft" pop-up.

I did report something similar the other day on the FF feedback form you get when FF crashes. However I didn't mention that Yslow wa open at the time of the crash. I have tested it on another comp w/o YSlow open and it didn't crash, I then tried it on my comp again, to see if it wa my comp/version of FF, it didn't crash when I refreshed or used my site. I then tried it with Yslow open and it crashed. I restarted FF (NOT with a computer restart) and tried it again with YSlow open and it crashed again. It crash on the first or second page refresh.

Here's the link to YSlow, it's free, incase you are not using it and want to recreate the bug.
