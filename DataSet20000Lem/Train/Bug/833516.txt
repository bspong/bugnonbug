FF becomes unresponsive when forwarding an email via Outlook Web Access when it need to get additional content
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:17.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/17.0
Build ID: 20121128204232

Steps to reproduce:

Use FF 18.0.1 on a Mac running Mountain Lion (not able to test other version currently but will attempt to if possible) and connect to Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2010.

Select an email message that state there is additional content to download by "click here".
Try to forward that message.
A window will pop up asking if you want to download additional content and you are provided with the OK or Cancel option.

I also downloaded the latest OSX nightly build to see if it would work there but it didn't. The nightly build is 21.0a1 (2013-01-22).

I will work with anyone to help fix the issue and can give a webex demo or anything to help track it down. I prefer to use FF a my primary browser but OWA is my most used site during business hours, so I would like to help get fixed instead of switching browsers.



Actual results:

At this point FF is unresponsive. If you click the force quit menu in OSX you will see that the OS thing FF is still responding but it ha locked up.
The only way to get out of this is to force quit the app and then open up OWA in another browser


Expected results:

The user should be able to select either OK - to download the additional content or select Cancel.
