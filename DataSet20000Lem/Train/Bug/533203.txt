This problem exists in 3.5 and on multiple platform it is present. Windows XP, Vista, 7, Ubuntu 9.04/9.10 and OSX10 in Firefox 3.5.

The problem doe not exist on Firefox 3.0

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. goto webpage
3. watch cpu usage, notice high usage and browser virtually unresponsive.
Actual Results:
100% cpu usage leaving the browser unresponsive,

Expected Results:
Much le cpu usage a seen in Firefox 3.0 and no jump/stutter in animation. Animations should not "jump" and "stutter".

My desktop is a 2.2ghz AMD X2 with 4GB mem and NVidia 640mb 8800 GTS
My laptop is a 2.4ghz Intel Core2 Duo with 3GB mem and ATI 256mb HD3400
My macbook pro is a 2.3ghz Intel Core2 Duo with 2GB mem and NVidia 256mb 9400M

The problem appears on all 3 machine and obviously given the hardware, I shouldn't see any lag whatsoever.

This problem cpu usage problem and stuttering of animation can be seen on any website that us the jquery or prototype/scriptaculous framework that us the animation feature of the libraries.

Again, this problem doe NOT exist in 3.0.x

In addtion, other browers such a Opera 9/10, Safari 3/4 and even Internet Explorer 7/8 do NOT exhibit this problem.
