FF10x M17x Roboform crash [@ nsQueryInterface::operator] [@ RoboForm.dll]
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

Throughout the times, the stability between Roboform and ascending Firefox
version ha increased. But There are still some circumstances, where the
conjunction of Firefox and Roboform cause a crash. I have noticed these crash
only occur when a conflicting web page is visited.

To see an example of a valid argument. Follow the step listed below in a
Windows XP Home (if possible SP2) environment.

1. Install Firefox v0.9.3
2. Install Roboform v5.7.6, or v6.03
3. Install Roboform Mozilla/Firefox adapter v5.7.4
4. If not currently installed, install Tabbrowser Extensions v1.10.2004071201
5. Visit http://www.invisonfree.com/forum/
6. Close the tab with the above URL.

You then should receive an error dialog from Windows stating that Firefox need
to close, and asking if do you want to send an error report.

If you were to uninstall the Roboform Adapter, and repeat step 5-6, Firefox
would not crash and you would receive no error dialog at all. Therefore, one
could conclude that there wa a conflict between the web page, Firefox, and
Roboform.

Forum by me.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox v0.9.3
2. Install Roboform v5.7.6, or v6.03
3. Install Roboform Mozilla/Firefox adapter v5.7.4
4. If not currently installed, install Tabbrowser Extensions v1.10.2004071201
5. Visit http://www.invisonfree.com/forum/
6. Close the tab with the above URL.

Actual Results:
You then should receive an error dialog from Windows stating that Firefox need
to close, and asks do you want to send an error report.

Expected Results:
The software should have been able to close the window, and return to a normal
state of browsing.

I am using the default theme. The site http://www.invisonfree.com/ is just one
of the possible million more that could have the same or similar conflict with
Firefox and/or Roboform. In previous version (0.9.1 and 0.9.2) Attempting to
casually browse or post at http://www.forums.govteen.com/ would cause a similar
crash. Or attempting to sending a message at
http://neopets.com/neomessages.phtml?type=send would cause the page to crash
before it finished loading. I ignored these issues, and upon the release of
0.9.3 they disappeared. But now I think it be more beneficial if attention where
brought to them and others, instead of me ignoring them since the release of 1.0
approaches. By then I want to be fully converted to Firefox. One thing that
surprised me, even a I typed this report up, Firefox crashed, luckily I have
Scribe installed.
