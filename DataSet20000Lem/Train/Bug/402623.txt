Firefox keep the name of last seen tab even if closed

I installed the most updated Mozilla, and it's giving me the same bug: When I open 2 or more tabs, and closed all the tab except the first tab, it keep the name of the website of the last tab I clicked on even after I closed the tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open 2 in one Firefox window
2.Go to the second tab by clicking on it
3.Close the second tab by clicking the "X" icon
Actual Results:
Now, the first tab is displayed, but it keep the name of the website of the second tab because it wa the last one opened. Therefore, the first tab is wrongly labelled which is confusing. If I opened gmail on first tab, and hotmail on second tab, and I close the second tab, the first tab say hotmail instead of gmail.

Expected Results:
It should update the label. It should not keep the name of the second tab after it ha been closed and is no longer displayed. It should display the name of the actual tab being displayed, that is gmail in my case.

Internet explorer work fine in this situation.
