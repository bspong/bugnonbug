Firefox3 Beta crash when I try to print to PDF or to any connected printer. I tried other site and have no problem printing but don't know if it is a broken page because I have same problem at all post page (not the main page) and cannot reproduce in stable release of firefox.

Error Console report:
$ is not defined

This line is highligted
$('q').addEvent('focus', function() {



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Beta Version is installed on Ubuntu 8.04 AMD64 server Beta with gnome and ubuntu-desktop installed.
2.Open browser and go to http:ubuntuforums.org
3.Go to the absolute beginner section and select any post.
4.File>print> choose PDF file generator or any connected printer and select <print>
5.Follow same step with several other posts. No problem with other site other than very slow to close when finished printing.
Actual Results:
Firefox closed
When I restart and restore session, the above error report ha been logged.

Expected Results:
It should have successfully sent the print job to print device

Everything on system is fresh install, with default settings.
It is however a Beta browser installed on a 64 bit Beta OS
