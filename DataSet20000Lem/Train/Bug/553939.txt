If I have Firefox minimised to the taskbar then start a full screen game, The game will immediately minimise. If I then alt-tab to restore Firefox, I can then return to the game and it stay in focus. Starting the game with either Firefox running and not minimised or not running at all allows the game to start and remain in focus. I think that this ha only existed since Firefox 3.6

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox and then minimise it
2. Start a Game (I have found it to happen reliably with Zdoom ( http://zdoom.org/ ) but many other game show the same problem
3. Alt-Tab to Firefox and restore it
5. Alt-Tab to the game and it will now run without minimising itself.
Actual Results:
As soon a the game starts, it will minimise and I am left looking at my desktop (ie Firefox doe not restore it window or anything).

Expected Results:
The game should start and remain in focus and full screen.

I have tried disabling all add-ons, no effect.

I have run the game windowed, problem solved.

I have run the game with Firefox running but not minimised, problem solved.

I have tried disabling Windows Aero, no effect.

The link below is to a forum where other people have reported similar problems. Ignore the first few post about Aero and transparency - that made no difference to me. The culprit for me is definitely Firefox and only when Firefox is minimised.

However, I have asked a few people I know about the problem and it doesn't happen for them.

Sorry if this is a repeat report. I did try and search for it but I didn't find it.
