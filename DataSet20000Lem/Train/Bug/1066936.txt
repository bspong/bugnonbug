two instance of firefox / extra? GUI-less background firefox.exe process after closing sometimes.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0
Build ID: 20140911151253

Steps to reproduce:

firefox usually run a a (1) firefox.exe process. I try to have it always a a single window, I don't like extra window or popup window like forsee survey or ad causing my precious tab to be lost. usually there is a single firefox.exe.




Actual results:

but once in a while, I see (2) firefox.exe process (one with a GUI, one without) in the task manager in windows. this may be from closing and restarting ff.
when this happens you had better kill both, because closing the one with the GUI will leave the one without a GUI still running.
Flash Player installs will refuse, plugin restarts will fail, etc because firefox is still up.
and probably browser upgrade also!

it seems the GUI-less process ha not created a single visible window or control. it's just there and taking up space and running. and preventing firefox from working right.
something, maybe a forever loop, or waiting on something like a resource or condition (just a guess, I don't know, just throwing a guess at it), is preventing the browser from exiting completely when I close it SOMETIMES. I think I usually lose my tab at that point. :-(


Expected results:

when closed, firefox should exit(0); OR return(0); from main() a one should think it should do (?) and exit/close normally.
