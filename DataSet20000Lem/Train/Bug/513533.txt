tab & page render view have improper offset because of addons using the sidebar at the same time
User-Agent: Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1; U; en) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.00
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

After enabling two addons, which both make use of a sidebar, the tab bar and the page rendering view seem to be offset to the last-known location of the right-hand boundary of the sidebar -- leaving a useless, empty space.

The related combination of addons that seem to be able to cause this bug are "All-In-One sidebar" and "Snowl".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the addon "Snowl" (don't restart Firefox)
2. Install the addon "All-In-One Sidebar"
3. Click the "Bookmarks" icon in the all-in-one sidebar
4. Go to Tools >> Snowl >> List.
5. Close the Snowl UI overlay (via the 'x').
6. Then close the all-in-one sidebar overlay via the 'x'.
Actual Results:
The sidebar minimizes properly, but the tab and page render view are permanently offset by the boundary of the last-know location of the sidebar.

Expected Results:
The sidebar should have closed, and the tab & page render view should have moved to the left bound of the window.

I'm using some other addons, but none of which should really effect this. I'm pretty sure that this problem can be isoldated to the "All-In-One Sidebar" and "Snowl" addons.

I've been able to reproduce this bug every time.
