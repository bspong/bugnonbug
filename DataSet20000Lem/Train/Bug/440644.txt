Firefox closed but still running/active in the background, cannot start another instance
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

I have observed this in Firefox v3.0 RC1, RC2, RC3 and now in the final release. (Did not have this issue with Firefox v2.x)

The problem occurs when my internet connection is lost while browsing.
If I close Firefox it still show under Task Manager > Processes.

If I try to start another instance it won't show but it will show up under Task Manager > Processes.

The only way to get firefox running again is to kill firefox.exe's shown in Task Manager and running firefox again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type some URL to visit but kill your internet connection, so that you end up with Firefox simply trying to connect to a site.

2. You can now see Firefox trying to connect/open the web site. (Obviously it can never do this, since the internet connection is down)

3. Close Firefox.

4. Open Task Manager and under process you can see Firefox still running. Trying to open another instance of Firefox will not work until you kill firefox.exe that is currently running.
Actual Results:
Firefox no longer work until it's killed from Task Manager.

Expected Results:
If firefox is closed it should not continue running in the background.
