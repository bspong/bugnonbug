If url is opened from the form with the POST request, it is not saved in the history.

I do not know if this is a bug, or it is implemented intentionally. In FF2 urls, which are POSTed, were saved in the History.
I'm aware that in most GETting a url, which should be POSTed doe not make sense.
However, in some case webpage pas also some parameter in the URL even when requiring a POST request.
Typical example is a http://google.com/translate_t:
When one selects a language pair (english->german for example), a string ?langpair=en|de is appended to the form's "action" field. If you then navigate to http://google.com/translate_t?langpair=en|de, you'll immediately have a preselected language pair.

My problem was, in fact, that i tried to search in a location window for a "langpair" to select a directly german/english translation.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear history
2. Navigate to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=POST+history
3. Click on the "Long Format" button

Actual Results:
History doe no contain link to a https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi

Expected Results:
Ideal behaviour would be saving of POST header along with an url in the History. (Except for case when there's a 'password' field). Click on that History entry would result in a POST request to a web server.
