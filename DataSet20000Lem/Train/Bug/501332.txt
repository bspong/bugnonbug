Firefox doesn't exit after I have tried to open a new windows. New window don't open.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If I try to click on a link that should open a new window, the new window doesn't open. (New tab work fine). Later, when I try to exit firefox, it doesn't quit properly.

However, if I just launch Firefox and try to exit directly, it exit fine. This seems to be linked to opening new windows.

Incidentally, I seem to be unable to start Firebug also, which I usually do by hitting F12.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Hit Ctrl-N to open a new window (it doesn't appear)
3. Verify that there is no other window - alt-tab under window show no other window (I am only running firefox)
4. Try to exit Firefox - I usually exit by hitting Ctrl-W repeatedly until all tab are gone in each window
5. I have enabled Options -> Privacy -> Private data -> Always clear... and Ask me..., but the verification window never appears
6. I kill firefox using task manager

Next time I start firefox, it asks to delete private info, and then to try to recreate my previous sessions/tabs (don't remember exact text).
