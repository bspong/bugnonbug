Build ID: 20151029151421

Steps to reproduce:

I'm using 42.0 version.

I'm using PHP bult in development server.

So I have 3 Ajax request one after another (PUT, GET, GET).

Every time I refresh server show "Invalid request (Unexpected EOF)".

I'm developing a site and I basically have three AJAX request one after another.

Code will be in "requests.html" which show how HTML and JavaScript look like.

First PUT request doe not put any data to the page (I have tried with POST also, same error)

Other two GET request put some data from the server on the page but those are only table and table rows.

When I remove just one (any of them) of those Ajax request and leave 2 of them no error occurs.


Actual results:

I have tested in Chrome, Opera and IE and they don't show errors.

After I put third Ajax request on the page

"Invalid request (Unexpected EOF)"

started to appear.



Expected results:

What should have happened is that page load without this error like in other browsers.
