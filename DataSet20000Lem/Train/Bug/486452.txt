Firefox in XSL source file may sometimes be confused by <script ...></script> HTML tag
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032713 Fedora/3.0.8-1.fc10 Firefox/3.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032713 Fedora/3.0.8-1.fc10 Firefox/3.0.8

Blank page on Firefox browser. Workaround is to add <xsl:comment> </xsl:comment> between the <script ..> tag and the </script> tag. Another more painful workaround is to include the script body between these two tags.

To download the source code of the problem demo use http://vouters.dyndns.org:8080/public/beatles.zip

From anywhere of this demo, click on ClikME2 or ClickME buttons. They contain the found workarounds.

Click on Symptom button and you'll notice the problem. View html source code. With the Symptom button HTML source code, you'll see Firefox confusion by the HTML tag after the <script .../> tag being blacked instead of colored.

For the Firefox team knowledge, my

technical article is my way to back up Mozilla team work by comparing Firefox and Internet Explorer 6 from Microsoft in all aspect I can think of. You might use my approach to add comparison with other competing Web browsers.

Yours sincerely and with my personal thanks for this excellent work.

I do not know whether Firefox is confused because of an XSL standard or because of a bug.
