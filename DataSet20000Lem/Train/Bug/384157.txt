I got the new auto updated version of firefox when I logged onto my computer this morning. I let it run and I started viewing spaces.live.com and wa using the side slide bar to view the lower portion of the page when it crashed. I always send off the bug report for any issue I have. I thought I would try it again and see if I would get the same result - I did - I cannot get Firefox to keep from crashing. I wa reviewing Mozilla site itself when it crashed again - Using the side slide to view the lower portion of the page.

I do not know if that is what it is that is making it crash - I just want the Browser to work. I gave up on Internet Explorer to use this program ..

Thank you
