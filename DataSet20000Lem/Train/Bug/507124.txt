If you right-click on a tab in the tab bar, everything is fine, but if you are accessing the context menu on any other part of the tab bar, you get menu option that can apply to the active tab while you are not right-clicking on it. If you're just in empty space (few tab are open) "Close Tab" close the currently highlighted tab, which is probably not a big deal. If you have many tab open and then show the drop down menu from the far right of the tab bar, and then access the context menu from a right click on one of those menu entries, it's the same thing, but now that's weird, because it should apply to the other tab since you are right-clicking on it title.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a bunch of tab so you can't see them all on the tab bar
2. Assume the circumstance such that you would want to find them using the drop down menu at the right of the tab bar, so you can close them
3. open the drop-down tab menu
4. Right click on the title of one of the tabs, in the menu
5. click "Close Tab"

Actual Results:
The tab from the window is closed, not the one whose title you right-clicked on.

Expected Results:
I would expect it to go one way or the other. One way is to not include "Close Tab" in a context menu when the context is not the tab that is going to get closed. The other would be to make it actually close the tab whose title wa clicked on. Maybe if the text said "Close Active Tab" when the context is not already a tab, that would work too.
