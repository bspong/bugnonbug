when printing a web page, you can choose to print the selected area only (instead of "all" or a range of page numbers). if you choose the "print selection" option, the printed document will have the bar of highlighting on it.

i can confirm that specifying the page range by number (ie, "from 1 to 1") doe not cause the highlighting bar to appear on the page, even if you have text highlighted when you select that option. the problem only happens when you have text selected and choose "print selection".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to my assigned philosophy reading at http://marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/carnap.htm
2. hilight the first paragraph (it doe it in blue on my PC)
3. select file->print, and choose "print selection"


Actual Results:
the printed page will have the blue highlighting on it

Expected Results:
firefox should only use the selection to for deciding the range of the page to print... the text hilighting color should not actually appear on the printed page.

philosophy homework suck :)
