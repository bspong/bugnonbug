First off my profile wa whiped (i dont know how it happened it just did),
then while trying to troubleshoot how to fix the problem the site window (not
the browser itself) started to jump up and down rapidly. I closed that window
and then opened a new one, the problem didnt happen on the home page (which is
now default due to my profile being magically cleared), i then opened a new
tab to search forum to see if anyone had had the same profile problem and
that window started to jump a well. Now it doe it everytime i open a new URL
and a new tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up many window and opened a new tab.
2.Opened up new window and tried new URL.
3.

Actual Results:
The window started to jump up and down rapidly.

Expected Results:
The window should have been fixed in one position.

I performed spyware and virus scan and came up clean, so im sure it the
software.

I cant use Firefox until this is fixed. Firefox is my browser of choice and i
feel very weird not using it.
