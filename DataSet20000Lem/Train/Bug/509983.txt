THE FOLLOWING CODE:

RESULTS in the script getting interpreted by Firefox, and the Comment Never Closes. Closing Comment Tag get rendered to browser.

Specifically in my situation wa trying to use the Google swfobject.js to load flash to a page. The flash never get rendered. Works in every other browser I have used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Insert Code above into an .html file
2. Load HTML into Firefox on any platform
3. Does not reproduce on any other browser available today. IE, Opera, Safari etc.
Actual Results:
The "javascript" code get interpeted, and the comment never closes. The closing tag "-->" get rendered to the page a text, and then the rest of the page doe not load correctly.

Expected Results:
Browser should simply ignore all text between the comments.

Tried it on Firefox on PC and on Imac.
