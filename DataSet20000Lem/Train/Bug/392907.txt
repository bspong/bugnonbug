RSS feed throw error and fail to load when IPv6 nameservers listed in /etc/resolv.conf

We're slowly working on rolling out IPv6 here, and one thing that needed testing wa DNS-over-IPv6. So I put in my /etc/resolv.conf:

nameserver 2001:468:c80:6101:213:72ff:fefc:d5cc

(One of our internal nameservers with an IPv6 address) - and that work for most stuff.

However, this give many of Firefox's RSS feed indigestion, and they fail to load/update. The error console show many duplicate of the following 2 errors:

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsISAXXMLReader.onDataAvailable]" nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)" location: "JS frame :: file:///usr/local/firefox/components/FeedProcessor.js :: FP_onDataAvailable :: line 1320" data: no]
Source File: file:///usr/local/firefox/components/FeedProcessor.js
Line: 1320


Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsINavBookmarksService.runInBatchMode]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: file:///usr/local/firefox/components/nsLivemarkService.js :: LLL_handleResult :: line 845" data: no]
Source File: file:///usr/local/firefox/components/nsLivemarkService.js
Line: 845

After this, most, but not all, RSS feed eventually show up, but some remain stuck for days/weeks. If I comment out the IPv6 nameservers, the update show up within seconds. Note that 98% of the *rest* of Firefox seems perfectly happy in doing DNS over IPv6 - following links, bookmarks, and so on all work fine.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. List an IPv6 nameserver in resolv.conf
2. Watch RSS feed fail to update (Ed Felten's www.freedom-to-tinker.com wa particularly noticable in failing to update)
3.



Apparently although Fedora's glibc is able to deal with IPv6 nameservers, there's some subtle IPv4 assumption in the RSS code (though why the RSS code care whether a reply came from an IPv4 or IPv6 DNS server, when 99% of the rest of Firefox doesn't seem to care in the slightest, escape me totally).

The bug ha been in trunk since at least June 24 or so, when I first tried adding an IPv6 nameserver (it took me quite some time to correlate cause and effect for this one).
