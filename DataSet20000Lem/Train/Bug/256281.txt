Dear Firefox designers,

I've got a suggestion for more user friendly handling of cookies.

At the moment if you get Firefox to ask what to do with cooky on a case by
case basis you get four options:

........Show detail

........Allow

........Allow for session

........Deny

........Use my choice for all coookies on from this site


I think it would be extemely useful to have an option for:

"Deny for session"

This is because some URLs set lot of cooky or keep on triggering the ask
function masssive number of times. The only way currently to stop this is to
deny the setting of cooky permanently. But you might not want to do that if
after some browsing you need to accept cookies, for example, to allow password
to be recorded or to enable financial transaction etc.

In addition I think there should be a toobar button/menu option for modifying
the current remembered cookie setting for the current particular URL. This
avoids the considerable inconvenience of making these change through the cookie
management option

"Deny" could be changed to:

........Ask

........Ask for session

........Allow

........Allow for session

"Deny for session" could be changed to:

........Deny

........Ask

........Ask for session

........Allow

........Allow for session


"Allow" could be changed to:

........Ask

........Ask for session

........Deny

........Deny for session


"Allow for session" could be changed to:

........Ask

........Ask for session

........Deny

........Deny for session

The dialogue box for this should indicate what the current status is for coookie
management so you can be sure what you are changing from.


Cheers, Philip
