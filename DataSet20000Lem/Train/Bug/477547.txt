On Craigslist.org page when one selects a category (i.e. under job select Biotech/Science) the history remembers you selected this by changing the font color from Blue (=unselected) to purple(=selected previously). When I try to clear history using the "clear browsing history" it will not turn the craigslist selection back to the unselected state. The only way I can get this back to the unselected state is to uncheck the "save my history for at least" option on the preference page. If I recheck it, the selected item on Craigslist return. I even left the save history unselected for four day and then re checked the box for "save my history for the last 3 days" and still it show all the catagories I selected on Craigslist in the past. The "remember what I enter in form and the searchbar" ha no effect on this checked or unchecked. Note: I run the extension "Session Saver" with Firefox 3.0.6 and clearing this a well a browsing history, cache, offline website data. autheticated session ha no effect on deselecting the previously selected Craigslist items.
