I'm frequent user of keyword search and location bar is what I use very often. So new Fx3 autocompletion feature is greatly appreciated.

Utility of Fx3 location autocompletion (with bookmark search) feature can be enhanced for user like I am, if autocompletion algorithm would be taking into account the keywords from my bookmarks.

I see following possibilities.

1. If first word typed in loacation bar (/^[^ ]+ /) match keyword, then Fx3 should stop wasting CPU cycle searching my (very) long browsing history - goal is clear and with very high probability I already know what would be typed next (and it finished by Enter).

2. If first word is keyword, then extract from the bookmark hostname and put in suggestion dropdown URLs from the host. That way if I type "tt" (keyword for search on Tokyo Toshokan (name itself doesn't include "tt" btw) - 'http://www.tokyotosho.com/search.php?terms=%s'), then URLs www.tokyotosho.com should be shown.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open www.google.com
2. Add keyword search for the engine, make the keyword "gg"
3. Open new page, focus location bar and type "gg"

Actual Results:
URLs which have nothing to do with www.google.com do come up a autocompletion suggestions.

Expected Results:
Firefox should do something more sensible.
