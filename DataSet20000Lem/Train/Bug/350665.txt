Dear Sirs.
Forgive my vulgarity, but you people are fucked up. All I wanted to do wa send an e-mail telling you about a problem that I have had since I installed your up-dated version of Firefox. I have been trying to do that for 45 minute now. It shouldn't be this hard to contact you. Since I installed the new version I have had nothing but trouble. It take 3 or 4 time a long to come on after I click on the Icon and every time that I go on MSN to talk to my wife [she is in China right now] it will freeze and then I lose the conection. This happens several time a night and frankly I am tired of it. You are a bad a those mental midget at Microsoft. Here is a hint for you; "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". My daughter warned me to never install 'up-dates' when they become available, because all they ever do is screw up your computer. I thought it would be OK with you guys, you were offering a good service before so what could go wrong. I started having problem a soon a I installed the latest version so it is obviously something in it that is at fault. I don't know if you can do anything or not but I had to tell you anyway. Sorry for swearing before, but you REALLY pissed me off. George Peterson
