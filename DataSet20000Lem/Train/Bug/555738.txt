When navigating away from the page firefox unexpectedly quits (no dialog or hanging appl.)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100301 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

On some of the news ('nieuws') page of the website above, Firefox immediatly quites when clicking on a link that navigates to a new page (on or offsite). The same happens when closing the tab.

The quiting is really unexpected: No dialog, No message, nothing.

When firefox is restarted it start either by opening all the tab a they were or saying 'oops that wa embarassing...etc. etc.'.

After firefox ha started and the page is loaded, the process may repeat when doing the same a above.

The only way to navigate away from the site is to let FireFox quit until it asks which page to re-open and then uncheck the tweakers page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Note: It doe not happen with every page of the site mentioned below, nor doe it happen only on that site. See 'additional information' for my suspicions...

1. Open the page http://tweakers.net/nieuws/list/1269558000
2. Then either close the tab or click a link that will move to another page on the same site or another site.
3. Poof, FireFox quits.


Actual Results:
Firefox quits and must be restarted (if one wish to continue browsing the web)

Expected Results:
Firefox should not have quited on me, but rather display the other page of which i clicked the link. (Alternatively it should have closed the tab and leave all others open)

Alternatively alternatively I would like Firefox to elegantly report on the problem en let me continue browsing / just close the tab.

I use no theme or personas.
I think it ha to do with the presence of video content on that page. Maybe a certain type embeded player that is problematic.


If i wa editing some wiki in another tab i would have lost data -> Critical
Browsing is the core functionality of FireFox, so i would say a major feature is broken -> Critical.
