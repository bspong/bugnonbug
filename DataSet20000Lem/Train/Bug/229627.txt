On a completely blank Windows system with Sun Java 1.4.2 or higher already
installed, the Firebird installer creates the wrong registry key for Java to work.

about:plugins say the Java plugin is enabled, but site with Java don't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Java 1.4.2 (or the latest 1.4.2_03) from Sun on a blank Windows machine
2. Install Firebird using the installer
3. Go to a site which us java, like
http://java.sun.com/webapps/getjava/BrowserRedirect?locale=en&host=www.java.com:80

Actual Results:
Sun's site offer to download java, a it find it is not installed.

Expected Results:
The site should say "Java software installed".

The installer creates the following registry key:

HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\mozilla.org\Mozilla Firebird
"CurrentVersion"="0.7+ (en)."

That key doesn't make Java recognise Firebird. The correct key should be (as
indicated by the .reg-file offered by
http://texturizer.net/firebird/faq.html#q2.2 ):

HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\mozilla.org\Mozilla

The value of CurrentVersion make no difference, Java accepts that without any
problem.
