Reflow actor should observe reflows in all frame
The reflow actor (bug 997198) only observes reflows in the tabActor's window, but reflows from child window don't seem to bubble, so we'll need to go through them (via the docshell tree) and list for reflows there too, also listening to frame loaded and unloaded.

There are at least 3 place in our actor that have this kind of window management process:

- the inspector actor:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/inspector.js#834
listens to frame load/unload to update the markup-view

- the stylesheets actor:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/stylesheets.js#121
list the stylesheets in the main document and recursively look for <iframe> node in it to list their stylesheets too
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/styleeditor/StyleEditorUI.jsm#117
On the client side, listens to navigation event to list stylesheets again.

- the newly introduced storage actor:
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/storage.js#1501
listens to window created and removed
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/storage.js#1528
listens to pageshow and pagehide event
https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/storage.js#1455
list all window and inner window

Bug 977043 is cleaning this up a bit, so let's wait for this one to be fixed first.

I like the pool management code in the storage actor, I think it should be part of the tab actor.
The tab actor could provide a method to any child actor that need to know the list of windows, and event to notify of window being added and removed.
