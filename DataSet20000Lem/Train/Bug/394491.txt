Cannot successfully subscribe to RSS feed in Outlook 2007 from Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.5) Gecko/20070713 Firefox/2.0.0.5

I have tried this on two seperate machines, both with the most up to date (non nightly builds) of firefox 2.0.0.x; One machine is an XP machine, and the other is Vista. Both of them have Outlook 2007.
I click on "Subscribe to this feed using" and change it to Outlook 2007. I then hit subscribe now, which brings me to the Outlook 2007 window which ha loaded the raw XML file in what look like an embedded IE window. It doe not subscribe in the Outlook RSS feed folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get PC running Windows XP/Vista(/2000?) and Office 2007
2. Go to RSS feed in Firefox 2.0.0.x
3. Subscribe to said feed using Outlook.
Actual Results:
(copied from Details) I hit subscribe now, which brings me to the Outlook 2007 window which ha loaded the raw XML file in what look like an embedded IE window. It doe not subscribe in the Outlook RSS feed folder.

Expected Results:
The RSS feed would be added to the feed in Outlook 2007.

If you would like, I can provide screenshots or anything else.
