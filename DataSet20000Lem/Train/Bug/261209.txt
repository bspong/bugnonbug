JavaScript window.status attribute generates an error.

// instantiate a new Date object
var d = new Date();
var month = new
Array("January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December");
When running the following script externally..

var day = new
Array("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday");

// write out the Date in the status bar.
window.status = day[d.getDay()]+", "+month[d.getMonth()+1]+" "+d.getDate()+",
"+d.getFullYear();

..I did not see the status window change to the date. The only error I get is
FireFox's JS console telling me that window.status is not a function. I am not
calling it a a function, nor am I calling it incorrectly. This ha been tested
on IE a well and worked fine.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. <script type="text/javascript">
<!-- Hide from incompatible browser
// instantiate a new Date object
var d = new Date();
var month = new
Array("January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December");
var day = new
Array("Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday");

// write out the Date in the status bar.
window.status = day[d.getDay()]+", "+month[d.getMonth()+1]+" "+d.getDate()+",
"+d.getFullYear();
//-->
</script>
2. Look in the status bar!!

Actual Results:
The status bar remains in it's default mode, with "Done" reading across it

Expected Results:
The status bar should be showing the current date.

The computer I'm on is running DeepFreeze..could that be a problem?
