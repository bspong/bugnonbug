As I go through CSS file working on my theme, I have discovered that the same CSS instruction for the same bookmark object show up in multiple CSS file and that bookmark panel specific style instruction are scattered across three stylesheets.

For instance there is a expander.css for expander buttons, but the same CSS instruction for expanders is actually contained in both the editBookmarkOverlay.css and organizer.css file instead of expander.css.

In another example, I have found CSS instruction for IDs that start with #editBookmarkPanel in the browser.css and editBookmarkOverlay.css files.

For the sake of cleaning thing up and making theme maintenance easier for Firefox developer and theme developer this type of duplication need to be eliminated. All expander specific CSS instruction should be maintained in the expander.css file and all instruction for IDs that start with #editBookmarkPanel should be maintained in the editBookmarkOverlay.css.

Reproducible: Always
