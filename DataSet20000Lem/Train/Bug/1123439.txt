[e10s] All browser tab crash simultaneously when one of the tab load heavy stuff
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0

Steps to reproduce:

I restarted my Nightly after the 18 Jan 2015 update and ever since the tab (all) were crashing very frequently. Almost like every 15-20 minutes. One of the tab crash and a domino effect cause all other tab to crash simultaneously (or I guess it probably because e10s is running the chrome element of all tab in the same web process so when one crashes, all crash). Sometimes right before a crash, i see an information bar (not unlike IE8's) at the top of the page informing me that one of the page is slowing down Firefox but before I can respond to it, all the browser tab crash and the message obviously disappear.
I did some more testing. The one thing I noticed wa that page that load flash plugin are pushing the browser over the edge. Happened when loading facebook and a couple of other website that had embedded flash in their header. Also, the number of tab open matters. So if FB is the only tab open then the browser happily chug along but once you go over maybe 7 or 8 tabs, then the crash start happening. In fact if you have 15 or more tab open (as I normally do) then simply switching back to the fb tab after a gap of maybe 10-15mins is sufficient to crash the browser tab (when e10s try to repaint the page). Rapidly switching between tab also initiate the crash.
Turning off e10s improved the situation and a far a I could see the problem did not recur. Turning on safe mode also helped but then the flash content doesn't load at all.
I also tried creating a fresh profile but running it in a normal e10s window caused the crash symptom to recur.


Actual results:

All browser tab crashed.


Expected results:

Crash should not have happened
