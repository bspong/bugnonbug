Some Firefox windows, usually configuration menu are too large to be fully displayed on device with small screens. These window typically do not have vertical scroll bars. Since the button to save, cancel, etc. are typically at the bottom of the window and the window is too tall to display the buttons, such program are largely unusable.

Particularly reporter complains about Firefox (and equivalent in Thunderbird) *when run in KDE and/or LXDE* to show dialog for Preferences - Advanced - Network - Settings - Proxy, Firefox Preferences - Privacy - Private data, and Preferences - Main - Add-ons requiring more than 440 pixel height to fully display all of the information and allow it to be fully functional.
