xkb redirected key don't work with autocompletion

Using XKB it is possible to redirect some key combination to some other key. For example I redirect [Control-j] to [Left]. In Firefox this doe not work when autocompletion is in effect otherwise it does. Once there are no completion suggestion anymore redirection work again.

This affect the urlbar a well a any form with autocompletion enabled and ubiquity. I have tried with 3.5_rc2 a well a 3.0.x. I am using xorg-server-1.6.1.901. In 1.5 (and 1.4?) redirection is generally broken. Redirection used to work in Firefox (3.0.x) when I wa still using xorg-server-1.3 (or wa it 1.4?).

Admitted this is quite an unusual requirement but it seam there is a bigger underlying problem with event handling when autocompletion is in effect. See e.g. #61439, #87240. Clearly the autocompletion feature somehow handle event differently than the rest of Firefox.

So while this particular bug might not have a high priority for developer (it ha for me, I might start using a different browser because of it) it would probably be a good idea to check if autocompletion really need different key handling than the rest of Firefox. And if it doe to figure out why it's implementation keep breaking in more esoteric case (though entering an @ is not that esoteric (see reverenced bugs)).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add these file and modify the xkb configuration you use to include it:

// /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/redirect

alphanumeric_keys xkb_symbols "redirected" {
key <I155> { [ Left ] };
};

alphanumeric_keys xkb_symbols "redirecting" {
key.type = "REDIRECTING";
key.repeat = yes;
Redirect.clearmods = all;

key <AC07> { [ j, J, quotedbl ],
action =
[ NoAction(), NoAction(), NoAction(),
Redirect(key=<I155>),
Redirect(key=<I155>, modifiers=Control),
NoAction(),
Redirect(key=<I155>, modifiers=Mod1)
] };
};

// /usr/share/X11/xkb/types/redirect

xkb_types "redirect" {
virtual_modifiers LevelThree;

type "REDIRECTING" {
modifier = Shift+Lock+LevelThree+Control+Mod1+Mod4+Mod3;
map[None] = Level1;
map[Shift] = Level2;
map[LevelThree] = Level3;
map[Control] = Level4;
map[Mod1] = Level5;
map[Mod4] = Level6;
map[Mod3] = Level7;

map[Lock] = Level2;
map[Lock+Shift] = Level2;
map[Lock+LevelThree] = Level3;
map[Lock+Control] = Level4;
map[Lock+Mod1] = Level5;
map[Lock+Mod4] = Level6;
map[Lock+Mod3] = Level7;

level_name[Level1] = "Base";
level_name[Level2] = "Shift";
level_name[Level3] = "LevelThree";
level_name[Level4] = "Control";
level_name[Level5] = "Meta";
level_name[Level6] = "Hyper";
level_name[Level7] = "Super";
};
};

// Modify the file you use to include the above files. E.g.

// /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/us

xkb_symbols "basic" {

name[Group1]= "USA";
include "redirect"
...
// key <AC07> { [ j, J ] };
...
};

// /usr/share/X11/xkb/types/basic

xkb_types "basic" {

include "redirect"
...
};

// Make sure the imported definition are not later overwritten.
// Test if [Control-j] move left in your favorite editor.
// If it doesn't work edit the file you use directly.

2. Enter some text that will complete in the urlbar.
3. See how [Control-j] doesn't do anything.
