Web page is getting dimmed and all the links/ hot point became disabled after a couple of second after opening any page of the web site.

I didn't have this problem with older version of FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.janetkulyk.com
2. Wait a couple of second or try to move the mouse over the page
3. In 2 - 3 second the page becomes dim and, all the link and hot spot are not responsive.
Actual Results:
I refresh the browser window, and everything happens again :(

Expected Results:
Hope the bug will be fixed or I will get explanation what's wrong with my web site. I cannot see this bug in IE7, Safari, Chrome, Opera: I test the page on multiple browsers.

I am the person who developed this website: all the page are valid HTML/ valid CSS, all JavaScript is correct and based on DOM-scripting.

All the software used is updated, latest versions. I didn't see that bug on other websites.
