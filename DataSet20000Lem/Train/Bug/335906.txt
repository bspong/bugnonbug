When we attempt to go to this site we had very slow response. We disabled our personal firewall and received the notification from our virus program that a virus wa detected. It doe not seem like a virus though and came up a the error above (MS03-026_RPC_DCOM_EXPLOIT). We are using the latest version of Firefox and wanted to report this to see if it wa an exploit that had not been fixed yet. With the personal firewall running we never get the error, but the site take a very long time (10 - 15 minutes) to load.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable Personal Firewall, but keep virus security on
2. Go to site https://www.comsec.com.au/default.aspx
3. Receive popup error from Virus security (PC-cillin) that an exploit is being accessed.

Actual Results:
Site is slow because of this exploit. After the above steps, the error is received from PC-cillin and the site come to a very slow load.

Expected Results:
Site should load a it did before (before latest load of Firefox wa loaded).

Not sure, but if it is an exploit we thought you should know about it.
