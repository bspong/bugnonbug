the internet banking page of bank above generates the detail of transmission by database (of course). printout are OK with all part of the form they use but with all variable field preview is OK while print shift all code by 29 position down, e.g. code 68 (D) turn into code 39 ('). if i save the page a html and load the saved page into firefox, the reloaded page work OK.
this is replicable on 2 machine and different printers, and it doe not occur with an older firefox or with internet explorer. sorry, don't know which script language the bank us to fill out those fields.
