Setting for default printer not honored in Solaris

When multiple printer are defined, Firefox print to the most recently used value of $MOZ_PRINTER_NAME when PostScript/default is selected in the print dialog, rather than using the Solaris system default printer. (When this variable is unset -- e.g., immediately after Firefox is launched -- the system default printer will be used when PostScript/default is selected. However, after any other printer ha been used, the most recently used printer becomes PostScript/default.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Print from Firefox to a printer other than the system default printer.
3. Print from Firefox to PostScript/default.

Actual Results:
The print job in step 3 is spooled to the printer used in step 2, above (i.e., the most recent value of $MOZ_PRINTER_NAME).

Expected Results:
he job should be sent to the system default printer whenever PostScript/default is selected in the print dialog.

Note that this is more serious than a simple loss of functionality. It is a potential security issue: it could result in the improper disclosure of confidential information if, for example, a sensitive document wound up on a shared printer without the user realizing it.
