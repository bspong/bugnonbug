I have an HDTV a a secondary display (1920x1080 resolution) and I use the extended desktop mode.

Firefox is on the primary display and the secondary desktop is empty. When lot of tab are open, content are not always painted correctly. The amount of painting error seems to vary. Sometimes 30 tab can be open with no problems, sometimes 60. I'm not sure if the tab amount is relevant. There is more than enough free memory and temp disk space.

As soon a I disable the secondary display, Firefox start painting correctly again.

This problem can be reproduced with both ATI and NVidia card with latest drivers, so it shouldn't be a display driver issue. Also no other application than Firefox is affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable dual display & extended desktop mode from display drivers.
2. Start Firefox with lot of tab with web content.
3. Change tabs, refresh tabs, do some surfing.
Actual Results:
Main window content becomes corrupted. Tab content or basic window component are not painted or refreshed fully. Scrolling, moving the main window or moving mouse cursor over corrupted area may change how thing are painted.

Expected Results:
Firefox paint correctly.
