mailto protocol should be a non-exposed protocol in firefox [makes SendPage work correctly with xremote]
i have the following shell script configured a my default mailto handler in GNOME:

#!/bin/sh

export
MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME="/opt/mozilla-builds/thunderbird-current"

addr_trim="$(echo
"$1" | cut -d':' -f2-)"

if
$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME/mozilla-xremote-client 'mailto('"$addr_trim"')'; then
exit 0
fi


$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME/thunderbird -P default -compose "$1"

when firefox is running, it intercept and try to handle the mailto xremote
command. it discovers that it can handle this protocol using the external
protocol handler service. it doe so, which launch the script again. but,
this time mozilla-xremote-client fails, and thunderbird is launched. however,
for some reason it end up in a loop launching several instance of thunderbird.
there seems to be some kind of race because the number of thunderbird instance
is limited, but varies from run to run. i usually end up with several compose
window and several profile selection dialogs.

now, if i just set this pref in firefox, the problem go away:

pref("network.protocol-handler.expose.mailto", false);

this pref cause firefox's xremoteservice to reject any mailto requests. i
think we might want this pref for the next release of firefox.

with this pref and the script above, send-page and mailto link work perfectly
from firefox to thunderbird.
