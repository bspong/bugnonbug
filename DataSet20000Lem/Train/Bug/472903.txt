I apologize if I have the terminology incorrect. While selecting prior entry text on a web form (returning to a previously-submitted form and double-clicking input text-boxes and selecting from the presented list of prior entries), the browser tab/page will become unresponsive (cursor disappears, input field no longer accept keystroke despite being able to use mouse to change focus between input controls). While the page in question is unresponsive, I am still able to move between tab but they are also unresponsive -- including opening a new tab. Infrequently, this situation can be remedied by performing a refresh of the page in question.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a web form with multiple text input box
2. Complete and submit the form
3. Return to the page (via back button or otherwise)
4. Double-click each text input and select (OR choose not to select) the presented list. I also do this rapidly; perhaps that cause the issue.
5. If able to reproduce, should happen after moving between a few field into the form.
Actual Results:
Page / tab / browser becomes unresponsive. Remedy: kill FF and relaunch.

Expected Results:
Remain responsive
