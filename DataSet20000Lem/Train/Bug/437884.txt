Another strange one.

I have a flash animation on my 'Products' page which loops.

Using IE this animation is fast and smooth. Using FF (all version ever) the animation stop dead, unless the user is moving the mouse!

The animation work is the mouse pointer is hovering over the 'Products' button, but a soon a the mouse pointer leaf this collision area the animation stop completely unless the mouse is being moved.

Very strange indeed and no Flash codeing work-arounds are possible a the buck start and stop with bug in the FF browser.

I hope this is descriptive enough. To see this bug in action please go to:

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Animation stop unless the mouse pointer is being moved.

FF Flash animation being about half the speed of IE (there seems to be some massive processor overhead)

Expected Results:
Animation should be looping, fast and smooth - As it is in IE (all versions)

The way FF seems to handle all Flash animation is about half the speed of IE (if it work at all)
