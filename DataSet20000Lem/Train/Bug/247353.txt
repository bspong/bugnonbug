I have JavaScript that worked fine in FireFox 0.8, but is now broken in FireFox 0.9
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.8

My HTML page for analyzing ClearCase license usage is from abs-consulting.com
and the JavaScript error is "Error: display_text is not defined". This error
happens in a rollover context where the graph is supposed to depict the count
and usernames of anyone currently using ClearCase. The JavaScript is:

<script language="JavaScript">
<!-- begin script
function TurnOver(me, display_text)
{
display_text.value = me.alt;
return true;
}
//-->
</script>

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Page
2. move mouse over graph plot
3. JavaScript Rollover is activated and error message is written to JavaScript
Console

Actual Results:
Nothing crashed, but my text info is not displayed. Again, this used to work
fine under FireFox 0.8.


I've tried changing font sizes/families and changing theme -- all to know
avail. This doesn't appear to be anything related to font or themes. Sounds
like something is missing in your Java Plugin or whatever you use to handle
JavaScript.
