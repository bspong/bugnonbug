Firefox 3.6 beta hang with 100% cpu load on almost every event
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091123 Firefox/3.0.14 (like Firefox/3.5.5; Debian-3.5.5-1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.2b4) Gecko/20091124 Firefox/3.6b4

When returning to the workspace showing Firefox, it hang while consuming 100%. It take several second until it finally redraws it UI and the page.

That happens almost every single time.

Same happens at almost every other event (going to a different tab, clicking on a link, scrolling, ...). Same behaviour. For several second Cpu load is 100%, Firefox UI doesn't redraw and doesn't react to anything. After a few second Cpu load drop and Firefox continues to run normally.

Until I click somewhere else.

It may be related to some of the extensions, I can't tell. At first I thought it wa Operator, a it caused Firefox 3.5 to hang while it wa parsing the site (at least that's what I thought it was). So I disabled Operator, and Firefox seemed to run fine, but a few day later this behaviour returned. This time I thought it wa related to the Test Pilot test that wa running last week, but now the test is over and Firefox still hang whenever I try to use it.

I thought about disabling extension to see whether one of the extension cause this behaviour, but since disabling Operator seemed to help for a few days, this would be difficult, a all of the result would be random.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Load a page
3. Use it for a while
Actual Results:
After almost every click any other event Firefox will become unresponsive for several seconds, with 100% processor load, before it continues a normal.

Expected Results:
Firefox should react quickly, or at least within le than a second.
