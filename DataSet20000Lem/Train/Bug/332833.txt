Firefox on my PC at home show all image on myspace.com correctly. However, when I'm using my OS X (MAC) it doesn't show any of the user image or photos. I've tried deleting cookies, cache, history, check load image and nothing works. I can view the page in other browser fine. I don't want to use other browser to operate certain web site and would like to see if we can figure out how to fix THIS issue.

Also, what would make web site print only the first page and not any of the remaining pages? On our company website if we go into our management system and print a list of company or sale report it only print the first page when we use firefox but not when we use other browsers.

Thanks!
