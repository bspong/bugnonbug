When you choose a printer (other than the default) within Firefox, that printer becomes the Windows default printer from then on for all applications. The expected behavior is that the printer is set to the one chosen just for the session/instance of Firefox, not set a the system default.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Choose a printer other than the default one already selected by Firefox print popup.
3. Print a page.
4. Go to any other application (back to Firefox, or to notepad, Word, Adobe, etc) and the printer selected within Firefox is now the default for all applications. Only choosing 'select a default printer' within window should result in this behaviour.

Actual Results:
The selected printer becomes the new default for ALL window applications, not just that instance of Firefox.

Expected Results:
Firefox should use the selected printer during that session or instance of Firefox and should revert back to the system default printer when you restart Firefox.

I use a laptop and use that between work/home. My system default printer is at work and is the one used most often. If I'm home, I just point to the home printer with any of the program I use, but do not set the home printer a the default since it is not used that often. Those other application only use the selected printer until I close the app.
