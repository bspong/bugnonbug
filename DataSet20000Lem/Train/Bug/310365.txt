Please refer to the uploaded QuickTime movie [Apple Animation codec], which
demonstrates the behavior. The throbber on the tab continues to spin even when
the page ha completed loading and the URL bar at the bottom right of the screen
ha disappeared. The throbber at the top right is no longer spinning. However,
the URL bar doesn't show the correct URL (in this example, it's showing the URL
of the submission page for this bug, coming from the other tab). The page URL
doe show correctly in the Page Info tab. Note: The Stop-And-Reload Button
extension doe change the Stop button to the Reload button, indicating that the
page did indeed finish loading ... but the tab throbber and URL bar never
notice. The URL bar should show the URL of the page a it is loading.

Actual Results:
Throbber throb ... and throb ... and throb ... and URL never show in URL bar

of loaded page should appear in URL bar
