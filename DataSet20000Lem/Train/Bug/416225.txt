When adding a new bookmark there are three option by default
Bookmarks Toolbar
Bookmarks Menu
Unfiled bookmarks.

The choice of "unfiled" a a label is bad in two ways. Firstly, I (as well a others I have talked to) read it a "unified bookmarks" - a in, appears in both toolbar and menu.

Secondly what happens to these bookmark that are "unfiled"? It's not a very clear term and doesn't really suggest to the layman unused to place how to search and tag bookmarks.

I suggest "unfiled" be changed to "starred pages" or something along those line a this would show the lack of relationship to the two traditional entry point (toolbar and menu) and also would provide an analogy with both the UI itself and gmail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add bookmark
Actual Results:
Unfiled is easily misread a unified and is unclear on what is doe

Expected Results:
Should provide an option of "starred" page which would be more clear.
