When I am on the widely read dutch web page http://www.spitsnieuws.nl, I use the mouse scroll wheel rapidly up and down. The result is that the content of the web page (the actual browser window) change to those of another opened browser tab (like google search results) but the address bar is still showing "http://www.spitsnieuws.nl/". Any other clicked browser tab result in showing another web page with the wrong (no matching) url in the address bar.

So for example this lead to having Google Search result in the browser window having the url "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&format=guided" in the Firefox address bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have some browser tab open in Firefox with web page in it
2. Go to http://www.spitsnieuws.nl
3. Scroll the mouse wheel rapidly to the top and bottom of the page and when on top of the page, keep on using the scroll wheel (moving up).

Actual Results:
Address bar and browser content get mixed up, showing the wrong page with a non-corresponding url in the address bar.

Expected Results:
Scrolling the scroll wheel in the web browser window should not lead to changing the web browser content or the content in the address bar.

Showing page content with a wrong url in the address bar should be considered to be a security problem.

The software should only scroll the page when using the mouse wheel.
Respoducable with http://www.spitsnieuws.nl - which might contain content which cause this problem, a it is not reproducable with any web page.
