I created an index page that play a short sound clip (i.e., a wave file) using the embed element when the page loads. In my case, the xine plug-in is what play the sound. Whenever I load the page, the plug-in start normally, and the following text is displayed in the status bar:

xine-plugin: ...playback started

After the sound clip ha finished playing, the following text appears:

xine-plugin: ...playback finished

After this occurs, however, the status bar update become very-sluggish, taking 5 second whenever I move my mouse over or out of any link in this or any subsequent page; I then have to restart firefox in order to get it to return to normal behaviour. If the first page I load is without sound, the status bar update normally; however, a soon a I load my index page, the problem occurs again.

I haven't tested this using other plug-ins; however, I did test this using Konqueror, which us the same plug-in, and appears to display the plug-in's status in exactly the same manner a Firefox. Konqueror doe not have this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load Web page that ha background sound embedded using the embed element.
2.The plug-in that handle the sound file play it automatically, displaying it status in the status bar.
3.Try moving the mouse over any link; the status bar would take 5 second to update. Then try moving the mouse away from the link; again the status bar would take 5 second to update.
Actual Results:
same a above

Expected Results:
The status bar should have updated immediately after the sound ha finished playing, a it doe in Konqueror.

I have disabled the ability for JavaScript to change or hide status bar text in both browsers.
