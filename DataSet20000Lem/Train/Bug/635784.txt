When I click a link in an outside program (steam, messenger, word, excel, etc.) firefox try to open the page in a new window. I have "Open new window in a new tab instead" checked and have verified that all setting remain correct after closing and re-opening firefox.

If I do not have firefox open and click a link, firefox open a normal. At this point I can click a link and the link open in a new tab fine. But not if I manually launched firefox to start browsing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Click link from outside application.
3. Do not profit!
Actual Results:
Firefox try to open the link in a new window, instead of a new tab.

Expected Results:
Opened the link in a new tab.

I use multiple profiles, 3 to be exact. One is mine, one is my wife and the other is an unused profile that we set up for later use by our daughter. When clicking link the profile selection screen come up, and when I click my profile it will not open the new window because my profile is already in use. I have tried this same issue on firefox 3.6.13 and the link open in a new tab a expected.
