In re to the lower part of the subject URL; reference the two weather.com box side-by-side; each represents one of the two domain this web host uses; both default to the link only; one should display the 300x250 weather.com graphic (with the usual content and link therein); the same page displayed with IE7 or Safari 3.1 display the right-hand box properly; not tested on any Apple gear (sorry, don't have any yet).

Everything is default Firefox 2.0.0.14 installation-wise; the only extension are DOM Inspector (1.8.1.14) and Talkback (2.0.0.11); the theme is the default Firefox 2 theme; the only plugin is MoveNetworks Quantum Media Player (1.0) [which I don't remember installing!]. I let Firefox automatically update itself a it see fit. I did search for "weather.com" but only result were unrelated and older.
