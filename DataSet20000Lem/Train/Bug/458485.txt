After some continuous usage, all non-ASCII character appear a question mark in the title bar

After some time in a session of Firefox 3, the browser stop reporting the window title's character to the OS correctly. All non-ASCII character appear a question mark in the window title bar, task bar, and elsewhere. Text in the window client area (on the page and in the browser chrome) is still rendered correctly.

Opening a new window will temporarily fix the problem *for the new window*.
Restarting Firefox also restores title text temporarily.

I haven't figured out what cause the symptom to start appearing -- it seems to just come after several minute of usage.

The problem is limited to Firefox. Other application on my machine have not shown similar behavior, so it's probably not the OS's fault (at least directly).

Apparently someone else ha also run into this problem -- see #2 on this page: http://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?locale=tr&comments_parentId=113022&forumId=1
