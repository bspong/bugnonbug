The following URL appears to cause this bug to occur (affecting only tab in the
current window):

http://plone.org/documentation/archetypes/ArchetypesDeveloperGuide

When trying to load this page in Firefox the current active window will cease
responding correctly. Any existing open tab will no longer display their
content when selected and the URL bar stop working. The page appears to load
correctly in Safari without issues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few site (any sites) in different tab within the same window
2. create a new tab and then paste in the above mentioned URL and hit enter

Actual Results:
Firefox try to load page, but fails (it just sits there with a blank page).
Any open tab in the current window will now no longer respond when clicked and
the url bar will not allow any new URLs to be entered. Toolbar button may also
stop functioning.

Expected Results:
Page should load and be displayed. Switching to other tab in the current window
should work, along with url entry bar.

I have tested this bug on several Macs running OS X (Panther) and it
consistently mess up firefox. I have not yet tested it on my Linux PC at home
to see if that ha the same result. Also only the window in which the page is
loaded becomes messed up, other open window continue to function correctly.
Closing the messed up window doe not seem to affect the functionality of other
open firefox window either.
