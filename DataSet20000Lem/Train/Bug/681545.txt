method to allow user to grant more (or perhaps unlimited) storage for web application
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/13.0.782.112 Safari/535.1

Steps to reproduce:

I am a web developer, with application that will require more persistent storage than is currently offered by many web browsers:
http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/

My web application may need to store (and later retrieve) a single string that is several megabyte long. They may also need to store multiple string that cumulatively occupy hundred of megabytes.


Actual results:

My current experience is that most browser fail to provide unlimited persistent storage (localStorage, indexedDB, webSQL, etc) to web applications. Safari (and Mobile Safari) seems to be the only browser that will ask the user if they will allow more space to be used by a web application (and it is buggy). Other browser will just throw a storage exception when the limit is reached.


Expected results:

When an asynchronous storage request is invoked in JavaScript, and the request would exceed the current storage quota, the user should be asked for permission to increase the storage permission for the current web application. If they accept, then the asynchronous storage request should continue to execute a normal, if not then an exception should be thrown.
