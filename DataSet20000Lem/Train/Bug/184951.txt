behaviour inconsistent with Mozilla 1.2.1 when accessing https:// site with badly named certificate
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20021207 Phoenix/0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20021207 Phoenix/0.5

When I go to https://mysite.com in Phoenix I get an Alert box which say "Error
establishing encrypted connection to mysite.com. Error code -8054"

When I do the same thing in Mozilla 1.2.1 I get a message box "Website Certified
by Unknown Authority" which allows me to accept the certificate. If I accept it
I then get a second error box "Security Error - Domain Name Mismatch" which
warns me that the name on the certificate is "localhost" while the site name is
"mysite.com". I can blow past that error a well and eventually get in to the site.

Yeah, I know I have set up lame certificate on this Apache box, but still -
Phoenix ought to handle it the same way that Mozilla does, no?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. As above...
2.
3.

Actual Results:
I got the error

Expected Results:
Phoenix and Mozilla should present consistent dialog when presented with the
same conditions.

I love Phoenix. It is great. Please fix it. It is a pain in the as to have to
use two browsers.
