My Mac OS X hanged down very few time but recently it happened at least 4 time I had to reset it in a hard way (keyboard and mouse were nonresponsive) and it's probably because of Firefox--the first app that hanged down wa Fx, in several situation it wa the only one I wa using at the time.

It happened at least 8 time in a week that Fx hanged. I don't think it is any site that doe it, but it wa while I opened site with lot of "stuff": javascript, Flash etc. like nytimes.com and several other "big" sites. It almost never happened before.

It happened just on opening sites, no action by me wa made that could interfere. In most case I wa opening 1-3 site at a time. 99% of those site were major ones, that I could expect to have valid html and no malicious code.

I've done no change in Fx configuration, add-ons, extension etc. at the time.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open 1-4 site at a time on recent Fx for Mac OS X, 10.4, ppc
2. Fx hangs, is impossible to quit
3. sometimes Mac OS X hang in several minute while waiting for Fx to 'unhang'
Actual Results:
I checked for update of Mac OS X and Fx. Checked the security stuff and disc permission on Mac OS X. everything seems fine and up-to-date.
