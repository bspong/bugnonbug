On a two-display macintosh system, if the secondary display is placed
(arranged, via System Preferences/Displays/Arrangment) so that the lower
edge of the secondary display is below the lower edge of the primary
display, <select> element of an html form produce "dropdown" box which
extend upwards.

This will frequently result in the option box covering undesirable portion
of the interface, including portion of the surrounding window frame, or
extending off the top of the screen.

If the bottom of the secondary display is located even with the bottom
primary display, or above the bottom of the primary display, the behavior
doe not occur.

The behavior is not reproducable with any other Macintosh application I
tried (finder, ical, microsoft office programs, etc).



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get mac with two monitor (I used MacBook Pro).
2. Place secondary display below primary display (I used internal display a secondary, to the left, and diagonally down from the main display).
3. Open any value/option form.
Actual Results:
Dropdown go upwards.

Expected Results:
Dropdown go downwards.

This is pretty nuts!
