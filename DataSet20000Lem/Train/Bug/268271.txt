At random times, certain page never finish loading, even when Mozilla and IE have no problem
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

Sometimes (more and more often lately) when I try to load a page (examples:
http://login.postini.com and http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-
guidelines.html) the page never finished loading. The progress bar stop
moving before reaching the end, the word "Loading..." remains on the tab, and
the logo keep spinning, on both the tab and the main window.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the URL and press the <enter> key
-or-
2.Paste the URL and click the GO button
-or-
3.Paste the URL with "Paste & GO"

I've reproduces with the following URLs:

http://login.postini.com

http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html


Actual Results:
The page never finish loading. The progress bar stop moving before
reaching the end, the word "Loading..." remains on the tab, and the logo keep
spinning, on both the tab and the main window.

(And if you quit the window the process remains forever!!! But that's another
bug alread in the database.)

5...10....15 qand more minute later, they're still going.


Expected Results:
The page load and display and the progress bar clear and the spinning logo
quit spinning and the status text "Loading..." disappears.
