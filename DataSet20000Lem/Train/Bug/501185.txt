After Firefox updated to the latest version it seems to give me false "Error" messages. Every time I search something in the search bar, with any of the search engines, or on the search engine's main site(mainly yahoo and google), the message appears, claiming that Firefox need to be closed for the error. but will continue to load what you searched. and work normally for that matter. This report is being filed with that error up. I have removed all addon's and extension from my version of firefox and uninstalled it and re-installed the latest version. Continues to appear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox
2.type anything into search bar
3.hit enter
Actual Results:
window appears containing "firefox.exe ha encountered a problem and need to close..."

Expected Results:
directed me to google with listing of what I have searched.

It only seems to do it on my laptop but not my home computer. But our home computer ha not been updated a of yet.
