Might be related to this bug: 327753.

In certain site that use frame (not iframes), if the text size is increased or decreased (using CTRL + or CTRL - or the View > Text Size options)the new text size doe not persist when moving to a new page in the same site. It reverts back to the default size.

Unfortunately, I can't provide a real life example, because the site that I have seen this happen on is a part of our intranet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From site using frames, increase the text size.
2. Follow a link to another page within the same site.


Actual Results:
Upon loading next page, the text size doe not persist. The page is displayed with the default text size, rather than the adjusted text size.

Expected Results:
Expected the text size to display at the adjusted size.


Using the browser back button, I can return to the original page (and see that the text size is adjusted/increased). If I then use the browser forward button, to next page actually show the adjusted text size - but if I click a link to get to the next page, it display the default text size.
