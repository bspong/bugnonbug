Screencast showing the issue

[Affected versions]:

[Affected platforms]:

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Start Firefox
2. Enter Customization and drag the zoom button to ToolBar
3. Hover over 100% value

[Expected result]:
- The hover effect is the same a on the other buttons.

[Actual result]:
- The hover effect for 100% button is missing, though the action of the button is not affected.

[Regression range]:
- This is NOT a recent regression (but a very old one), I've tracked it back to Nightly from 2014-01-18:

I see a bunch of bug that touched Australis, I'm sure Gijs will have a better idea of what caused this.
