I've seen there are a lot of problem with plugin-container.exe, but FF's response ha been that that is the way it's supposed to work, so it's not a bug. However, I've seen nothing about satellite users. We are limited to 200 MB download per 24 hours. Whenever plugin-container.exe starts, our bandwidth is consumed in second costing u $5.00 every time to restore. We simply cannot have this thing automatically running, no matter how intentional it is.

We need to know how to delete it from our computer completely, and forever. Otherwise, we will start billing Mozilla every time we crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I'm not sure when this plugin-container kick in, maybe when we use Paypal, but EVERY TIME it kick in our bandwidth disappears.
Actual Results:
I can't show you the error, because when it happens we lose internet and I wouldn't be able to get on this bug site. But, in Task Manager it say plugin-container.exe and mem usage is maxed out.


We need to know how to remove this, in effect, virus completely.
