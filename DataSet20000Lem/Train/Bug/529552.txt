Cannot edit page in PBworks when using Firefox. Clicking the edit button result in a "Security Error" message. This doe not appear to be connected to any specific add-on, but general to Firefox regardless of which add-on are installed. PBworks page can otherwise be edited in Internet Explorer and Chrome. The Comment feature and other user setting feature in PBworks do not appear to be similarly affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Register an account with PBworks and create a wiki, if not already registered with one
2. Go to any page within the wiki and click "Edit"

Actual Results:
"Security Error" message appears at top of screen; PBworks doe not open the editing page but remains on the static View page.

Expected Results:
It should open a page with a text editing box.

I have discussed this issue with PBworks and they thought it might relate to a Firefox add-on. They suggested removing the Skype extension, but I have the same problem on another computer using Firefox that doe not have that extension installed. Please see if this can be fixed. I love Firefox otherwise, and it's annoying to have to switch to another browser whenever I need to edit a wiki page. This happens with the default theme (I haven't tried another theme). Both computer are PCs. I have not tested this issue with Mac or Linux.
