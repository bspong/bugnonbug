After loading this page, the image which should show the pagerank won't load, and take a giant amount of time to allow the page to finish loading, this somehow choke up the browser, and it crashes. (you might need to wait for the pc to go into standby or black screen), wake the pc, notice the crash, click dont report to MS, and the pc reboots instantly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open this page.
http://www.louverdrape.nl/startpagina-startpaginas-belgie-duitsland-nederland.htm
Notice a whole lot of the image not loading, and notice photobucket.com being queried for each of the missing image very slowly.

Allow the pc to go into standby (might not be needed)
Wake the pc, login to window again,
Notice the MS box stating firefo had a problem, don't report the problem.
Instant crash, pc reboots.
Actual Results:
Pc reboot

Expected Results:
The page the image is being redirected to is a photobucket html page, a image could not load would be in order since the mime-type is not valid for an img tag.
