Sorry if this ha already been noticed, but it is very frustrating to see firefox slowly hogging a lot of CPU cyclee on Windows 7 Professional RTM build.
I have a 2 gb machine, and I have noticed this when a lot of tab were open, and firefox had been running through a series of sleep-hibernate-restores on the machine.
Also, firefox taes atleast half a minute to start up, so when I click a new link, I never realise that firefox is in the process of opening it, and end up clicking multiple time - result in a lot of firefox windows. I had to switch my default back to IE8 because of this.

I guess this is a know issue, but it would be great to see an update for this. I heard the next version of firefox ha a fix for this (not sure) but now that Windows 7 ha RTMed, it would be nice to have an update to fix this soon.
