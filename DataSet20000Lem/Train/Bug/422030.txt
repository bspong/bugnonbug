The theme in Firefox 3 beta 3 wa the best I've seen from any browser. It wa beautiful. It blended in perfectly with the standard Mac interface. I sometimes mistook it for Safari, but it actually looked niceer than Safari. Beta 4's theme is not nearly a attractive. The huge back button is ugly. The tab that blend in with the bookmark bar above them make it look like the bookmark are part of the tab, and are associated with that specific tab. (This break the interface standard used on OS X applications.) The new theme doesn't look nearly a clean and smooth, and is rather chunky. Please bring the old one back!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox 3 beta 3.
2. Fall in love.
3. Install Firefox 3 beta 4.
4. Question your superficial relationship with your favorite browser. Looks don't really matter, right? :-)
Actual Results:
Firefox Beta 4 is not a attractive than Beta 3

Expected Results:
Beta 4 would keep the same theme, or have a more attractive one.

It would be great to have the Beta 3 theme a an option from the theme download site, at the very least.
