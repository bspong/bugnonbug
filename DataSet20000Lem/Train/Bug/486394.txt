I've noticed this start to occur over the course of the last 1 to 2 week in the nightly build of 3.5b4pre. At first I thought it wa the drive I wa saving the file to, so I swapped it out with another one, but that didn't fix the problem. Anyways, when I load up a page that ha a bunch of image on it and I right click on one and select save image as, Firefox 3.5b4pre freeze before it save the file. Subsequent save on the same page do not cause the freeze. However if I move on to another page minute or hour later, I encounter the same issue.

Actual Results:
Firefox 3.5b4pre freeze before saving image.

Expected Results:

Windows Vista Ultimate 32bit, Intel 975XBX2 Mobo, Intel Q9450 CPU (3.0ghz per core), 4GB DDR2, 500GB C:, 320GB X: (where I'm saving the images).

Also, I have not seen any error in the Error Console and disabling jit.chrome ha no effect. (Not that I thought it would, but I tried it anyways.)
