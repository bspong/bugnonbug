Print output formatting is only using about 1/4 of page capability (pg. width wrong??)

When a Print Preview is requested it show that the page capability is being reduced to about 1/4 of a Portrait page size handling capability of the printed page. This is also what will be printed when an actual print is attempted. In my example one page became 4 page of output, PLUS the FIRST page and each subsequent page would not print without manually causing a form-feed by pressing the "Go" button on the printer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Yahoo "Y! Mail" (not Yahoo Mail Basic mode)
2. Open an email of 40-50 line of text
3. Request a Print Preview (do these same step using I.E.6 or greater)
Actual Results:
The print out will match the Print Preview (which is dramatically under utilizing the page size of the paper) and doe not automatically print out the paper a it should

Expected Results:
The output should appear very similar to the output I.E.6 output and the print should also eject properly. In at least one of Firefox's previous release it worked properly.
