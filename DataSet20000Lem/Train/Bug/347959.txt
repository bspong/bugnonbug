Fault in javascript security:
while searching for bus timetable on a site my antivirus alerted for a file called "ms.exe" dropped onto automatic startup folder.

Solutions i found:
a. block the browser from opening "http:// js.gbeb.cc / advertizing /" (I used the "hosts" file trick to prevent any browser from browsing that shit.)
b. turn javascript off.

Notes: I noticed that shitty page ha a script that's crypted but the string arguments.callee.toString().replace is in clear text. I think it somehow us that function.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Steps: it's already explained in the "details" part.
Actual Results:
a trojan ("ms.exe") is dropped to the startup folder I dunno what the exe can do but it's not good to have shit dropped to the startup folder.

Expected Results:
Refuse the action ?

It may applies to other Fx version and related software.


Please find a way to fix this. It's possible that many other site are using such a way.

I dunno if this ha been reported before, and say "sorry" from now for I'm to lazy to check out,but sincerely I don't have the time to do.

I hope this report can be helpful for someone.
