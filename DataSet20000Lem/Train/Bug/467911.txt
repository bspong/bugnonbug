Registry installation fails silently with invalid path in Software\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I'm developing an extension which I want to install via Registry (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Adding_Extensions_using_the_Windows_Registry).
Everything work briliant if I enter the mentioned registry key using regedit.

I wrote an MSI-Installer which set the registry key mentioned. In addition it add all Registry key above the one (Software\Mozilla, Software\Mozilla\Firefox, Software\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions). Each key is set to an REG_SZ value with an empty string (I don't know how to avoid this - it seems to be done by the MSI installer itself).
When installing the extension using this installer it is not recognized by firefox.
When I remove the empty string from the default value of Software\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions, the extension _is_ recognized.
Also when I enter an existing directory into this value, the extension _is_ recognized.
The problem seems to be in the function WinRegInstallLocation._readAddons:
I replaced
dir.initWithPath(key.readStringValue(id));

if (dir.exists() && dir.isDirectory()) {
this._IDToDirMap[id] = dir;
this._DirToIDMap[dir.path] = id;
}
by
try {
dir.initWithPath(key.readStringValue(id));

if (dir.exists() && dir.isDirectory()) {
this._IDToDirMap[id] = dir;
this._DirToIDMap[dir.path] = id;
}
}
catch (e) {}

and ith work even with invalid paths.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.prepare registry installation for some extension
2.enter an invalid path into HKLM\Software\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions' default Value
3.Watch Firefox not recognizing the extension
4.remove HKLM\Software\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions' default Value
5.Watch Firefox recognizing the extension



Expected Results:
Firefox should recognize the extension even if there are invalid path in HKLM\Software\Mozilla\Firefox\Extensions' default Value
