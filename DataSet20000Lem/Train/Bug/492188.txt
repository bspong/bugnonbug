Sometimes when I press the home key, the page will correctly scroll all of the way up, but the scrollbar will stay in the same position. It will update when, say, the scroll wheel on the mouse is used. If the scrollbar is used when it ha not updated, the page will immediately scroll down to match the scrollbar.

I have discovered one way to reproduce this, but there may be others.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to a longish page, scroll right to the bottom (ie. with the end key)
2. Follow a link to another longish page, and scroll to the bottom of that page.
3. Use the back button to return to the previous page, which is correctly scrolled right to the bottom.
4. Now press home to scroll to the top.
Actual Results:
The page correctly scroll to the top, but the scrollbar remains in it previous position.

Expected Results:
The scrollbar should update and move to the top.
