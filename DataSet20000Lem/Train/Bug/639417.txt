firefox 3.6.15 (and 3.6.14) immediately use all my memory and hang. They also constantly throw up a window asking me to authorize Firefox to access the keychain
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 GTB7.1 Ubiquity/0.1.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 GTB7.1 Ubiquity/0.1.4

I've tried to install both Firefox 3.6.14 and 3.6.15. Both version IMMEDIATELY use up all of my free memory, according to Activity Monitor. I have 2GB installed and before opening these two version of FF more than three-quarters of that 2GB wa free. Upon opening either of these versions, the spinning beachball start and won't go away.

In addition, both version pop up a window over and over saying: "Firefox ha been updated. Do you want to allow the new version to access the same item (such a passwords) a the previous version?" It doesn't matter which of the button offered ("Change All" or "Don't Change") that I click, the same window with the keychain question continues to pop up every few seconds.

Needless to say, Firefox is unusable in both 3.6.14 or 3.6.15. I've gone back to 3.6.13, which work fine for me.

Reproducible: Always
