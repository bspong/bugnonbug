*after* a file ha been uploaded using firefox to a remote server, firefox
crash . The feedback agent offer to send the report but that doesn't work
(but thats another bug completely).
For example, if I use flickr.com to upload an image file, or geocaching.com to
upload an image file or try to upload a zip file to microsoft's bug reporting
website, or upload an image to my movable type website the page that get
