This always happens when I happen to upload a bunch of stuff to a site (mainly image board 4chan). Afterwards, all downloads, websites, etc. will not load unless I either start typing with the keyboard or move my mouse around. Same go for when I download a bunch of stuff (images). It is very annoying. Also, if you try to watch a video on YouTube while having this problem if you pause it Firefox will freeze but the computer will still see the program a running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with plenty of image to download.
2. Manually keep downloading them. Usually after 50 it should happen.
3. Once it happens, watch how page stop loading.

OR

1. Upload images/videos/etc to a site.
2. Continue to do so.
3. After awhile, the bug will once again occur.
Actual Results:
Began downloading image in a thread and sorting them all. At around 50 or 60 image downloaded everything would stop downloading unless there wa mouse/keyboard activity.

Expected Results:
Firefox shouldn't stop after this. It should perfectly download/upload stuff like usual without stopping.

This seemed to have began with the Firefox 4 betas.
