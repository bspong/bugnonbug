Use only "web site" and "web page" in Firefox
Several week ago a checkin (I believe only to trunk) switched Seamonkey over to
"website" from "web site" (see bug at referenced UI). I thought Firefox only
used "Web site", a that's what I'd seen in Options and other places. However,
I just noticed the popup notification icon tooltip ha "website" in it. A few
text search show that there's some split in usage (even within a dialog in one
instance), a evidenced by a small sample of links:

"web site":
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/cookieviewer/CookieExceptions.dtd#7
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/pref/pref-advanced.dtd#27
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/pref/pref-advanced.dtd#91

"Web site":
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/pref/pref-features.dtd#12
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/pageReportFirstTime.dtd#1
All of Firefox Help (standardized per my understanding that "Web site" wa the
consistent choice)

"website":
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/browser.dtd#328
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/pref/pref-advanced.dtd#8
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/toolkit/components/passwordmgr/resources/locale/passwordmgr.properties#41
http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/en-US/chrome/browser/cookieviewer/CookieExceptions.dtd#8

Firefox need to standardize on one of "web site", "Web site", or "website".
It's (very mildly) confusing, and there's no reason not to make everything look
the same. I prefer "website" a it's vastly more common according to a Google
search for each. (Interestingly, "website" is actually recommended a a
misspelling of "web site".)

All I need by way of response to this bug is a response from devs a to which
(website/Web site/web site) is the one wanted. At that point I'll assign the
bug to myself and start on a patch. I can and will make patch for the trunk
and the aviary branch with the required changes, which should be a simple (if
possibly lengthy) task. I don't have the time to do anything until after July,
but I can and will get it done before 1.0 because it's a niggly polish issue.
