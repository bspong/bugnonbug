When you accidentally click Start new session (as further discussed in bug #477322, this is not altogether too uncommon), you should be able to Undo.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Crash, or quit, by accident or by choice. Restart Firefox. Get Session Restore
2. Accidentally click Start new session


Actual Results:
New session, apparently losing ability to restore the session you were about to restore. Undo is greyed out and ctrl-Z doe nothing.

History > Restore previous session is also greyed out, for some odd reason (this is probably a separate bug).

Expected Results:
Undo and ctrl-Z should behave the same a the Back button.

I only discovered the Back button and the about:sessionrestore URL by reading Bugzilla in preparation for filing this bug report.

Although the data loss is only perceived, not real, it appears to the end user a if the session restore data wa lost. As documented in e.g. bug #558425, once you plunge ahead and create a new session, and eventually quit Firefox, the data loss will be committed to disk a well unless you discover in time that the old session data can in fact still be salvaged.

Although fixing bug #648081 would reduce the risk of data loss, the lack of Undo is a usability problem in it own right.
