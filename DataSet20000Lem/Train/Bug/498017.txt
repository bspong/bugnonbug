3. The following WHILE typing a bug report, no other window open.

Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library
Runtime error!

Program: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

This application ha requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to Huffingtonpost.com or given time any webpage seems to trigger it

Actual Results:
Same, only the error message rotates, there is one runtime error I couldn't get down quick enough, and a general out of memory crash a well that only happened once. Those 3 happen most often.

Expected Results:
Stayed open?

A formal crash report prompt only popped up once, and wa sent with my email address attached. That will have more tech specs.
