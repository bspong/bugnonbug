URL: DNS: very long domain name (VLDN) a spoofing
(mentioned in several places, including bug 232567#c2)

A URL that ha a very long domain name can sometimes be used to deceive a user:

The general confusion is created by either user ignorance of the URL syntax
(where doe the hostname begin and end?) and is possibly aided by UI that
truncates the hostname.

http://www.microsoft.com.windows.2000.badsite.com

There are several aspect of this that should be noted.

1- what are valid character in the hostname? are there character that could be
used to suggest, visually, that a hostname ha ended (when syntactically it ha
not)?
2- are UI element doing any unescaping or filtering of hostname charaacters
that change the displayed URL -or- confuse users?
3- are there UI element that are truncating (edge of text box or "..." after a
certain length)?

If necessary to avoid drift, if these item become full blown issue that need
to be fixed via patch, let break out new bug quickly.

NOTE:
This threat is probably a lower priority than the other two issue (bug 232567
and bug 122445), because in most case there is a clear line of authority both
for who configured the spoof, and who can turn it off. A hostmaster would have
to either delgate a subdomain or have made the configuration themselves. The
spoofing domain is likely a trademark or other intelectual property violation
that can be quickly addressed through legal channels, and/or cutting off the
offending domain at the TLD.
