Show connecting / waiting / loading status message in small overlay on top of content at bottom of screen
The status bar wa removed, and there is a concern that the browser feel slower for that removal since message about page load status were removed with it. This bug is about restoring those message (as they appeared in Firefox 3.6) to Firefox 4. Let's not scope creep - please file additional bug for: returning link hover message to this spot, calling this new widget the "status bar" and returning the menuItem in the View Menu for it, etc.

// Design

Like seen in Chrome, provide a grey-background, rounded-corner overlay on top of content anchored to the bottom-right (or bottom-left in RTL locales) of the screen in which the page load status message will appear. This overlay should disappear when the page is done loading. It's fine if this obscures content while message exist, and even if the mouse cursor fall on top of or beneath it.

// Implementation Notes

After talking to various engineers, I suspect the safest and easiest way to implement this would be a new XUL window in the browser <deck>, though some felt that a new top-level window would be required. If we create a top-level window, we need to make sure it doesn't have an impact on a11y or mouse driver and other program which index our window heirarchy - see bug 130078 for some of the issue that we've encountered when messing with that sort of thing.
