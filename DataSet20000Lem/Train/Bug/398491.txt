my son da programmer asked me da computer idiot to contact you. I frequently have up to 50 window open at one time. I just hit ctrl T and keep browsing. Sometimes da computer get shut down for something and when I start Foxfire (Da latest version) it asks me if I want to recover. I love dat feature and always use it. Anyway after I get close to 50 window or so I take some time and go down da line and start closing or book marking and closing windows. I wa in da process of doing that today when I closed a window and ended up with a popup that said a program wouldn't run (I think a video program of some kind) unless I downloaded and installed a upgrade of some kind. I closed da window and had another window pop up and ask if I wanted to install da upgrade. I closed dat window and went back to da first window and ended up with a loop that I couldn't break. Everything on Foxfire wa frooze, I couldn't go to file, edit, popup blocker, nothing. couldn't even close it.

Finely I used Task Manager and closed Fox fire. When I started it again I ended back in da same loop when I hit recover. I finely shut it down and hit don't recover and it work fine. Thought I would go to history and see what window I lost and even though history wa set for 9 days, it only showed today. I also checked and popup blocker wa set the way I thought it wa - on.

Don't know what else to tell you, thats all I know or remember, hope it help
