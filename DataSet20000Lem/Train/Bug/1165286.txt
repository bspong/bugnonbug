Java plug-in no longer support 'Use browser settings' for network connection with Firefox 38
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0
Build ID: 20150504194141

Steps to reproduce:

Run Firefox 38 (or 38 ESR) with Java plugin installed (JRE 1.8.0_45 - from java.com) and attempt to load the Java applet from <https://www.java.com/verify>

I'm running Firefox on Linux (CentOS 6.6) with network setting set to 'Auto-detect proxy setting for this network' - i.e. no direct connection to the Internet


Actual results:

The Java plug-in load (I'm asked to activate it) but I just get a grey box and eventually the message 'We are unable to verify if java is installed and enabled in your browser.'

The same happens with various other Java test site


Expected results:

The Java applet will run and report the version of Java installed

This work with all previous version of Firefox (i.e. FF 37 and FF 31 ESR)

If I change my user Java preference (via 'jcontrol' that come with JRE) to not ''Use browser settings" - in my case "Use automatic proxy configuration script" and give the URL to my local autoconfig pac setting - the Java applet run fine

i.e. it appears that he Java ''Use browser settings" setting (the default) no longer work with Firefox 38
