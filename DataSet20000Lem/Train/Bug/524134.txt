crash most often when trying to open Google's email page with win2k

I have very old Dell PC with very small amount of memory .
On the power-on I start immediately the FireFox - the default page is www.google.com - it take 5-7 minute before the FireFox window appears
(I have SpyBot/TeaTimer and NoScript which probably slow thing down )
Then I go to Groups (gmail tab is not available directly) and immediately to gmail where I do the login. At this poin (or sometimes even before)
I am getting dozen of "script is stopped due to low memory condition" and
sometimes FireFox crash at that point ("FireFox had a problem and crashed" and then something like "application left no coredump" ) ... or sometimes after
dozen or so "script is stopped due to low memory condition" I am getting "Windows is increasing Virtual memory ...", then again few "script is stopped due to low memory condition" appear and then FireFox crash at that point ("FireFox had a problem and crashed" and then something like "application left no coredump" ).
Since the "application" is usually Google mail - what need to be done to enable crash dump - so FireFox could report it to you guy ?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Windows 2000 on Dell PC with very small amount of memory and SpyBot/TeaTimer and NoScript installed; FireFox default page is www.google.com
2.On power up click on Firefox
3.Go to Groups and then to gmail and login
Actual Results:
"script is stopped due to low memory condition"
"Windows is increasing Virtual memory ..." (sometimes)
"FireFox had a problem and crashed"
"application left no coredump"

Expected Results:
Desirably no crash but firstly a the least to have the crash report being generated and sent to Mozilla site for further debugging ...

Ditto
