Text and image shifting by 1 pixel on mouseover (Linux Firefox 2 only)

This is a little strange to me since I can reproduce it so easily on multiple systems. Hopefully I'm doing something wrong. On a lot of sites, *some* text and image will shift left and right by one pixel on mouseover. This issue is specific to Firefox 2 for me. I can get the rendering to reset by switching to another virtual screen and back, at which point the same thing happens. Here are a few examples, if you open these in a couple tab and quickly alt-tab between them, you can see the shifting text and image (it's pretty annoying when it happens regularly):

Now for the list of thing I've tried:
Safe mode- no change
Wiping out my .mozilla folder- no change
Switched between WindowMaker and no window manager at all- no change

No problem on:
Firefox 1.5.x.x
Firefox 3.0a6 or a7 nightly

Systems that have this problem, easily reproducible:
Debian Etch desktop, Firefox 2.0.0.0-2.0.0.5 from Mozilla.com, Xorg 7.1 w/ nVidia driver, msttcorefonts
Debian Etch laptop, Firefox 2.0.0.0-2.0.0.5 from Mozilla.com, Xorg 7.1 w/ i810 driver, msttcorefonts
(Old) Mandrake 9.2, Firefox 2.0.0.0-2.0.0.5 from Mozilla.com, XFree86 4.x w/ i810 driver, no idea on the font (ugly)
(Old) Mandrake 9.1, Firefox 2.0.0.0-2.0.0.5 from Mozilla.com, XFree86 4.x w/ i810 driver, no idea on the font (ugly)

No problem on Windows with any version. Thoughts or confirmation would be great, it's been driving me batty since 2.0.0.0. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load up *most* site with anything more than basic html.
2. Mouse over text and images.
3.
