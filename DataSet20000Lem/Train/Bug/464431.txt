hi,
pl look into this scenario:

say i have my firefox window in workspace-1. and another application (say) pidgin in workspace-2. whenever i receive some http link in IM windows, clicking them would cause my firefox to be pulled to workspace-2 and then firefox only lie there without focus. After i press 'alt+tab' it get focus. It is the same issue when i click link from 'openoffice.org-documents' also.

This is causing me lot of inconvenience, a i usually work with multiple
workspaces.

hope this get fixed asap for this would be having definite user impact.

regards.
