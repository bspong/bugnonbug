session restore doe not ensure restored window are actually on-screen
When Firefox restores a previous session, it try to position the window(s) at the original screen location.

However, it doe not check that the resulting position is actually on-screen. This mean that if the user had a window open on a large screen (or a multi-screen extended desktop), and then restores the session with just a single, perhaps much smaller display, window that -were- fully visible on-screen may be restored to a position that is partially or even completely off-screen.

STR, using FF20 on a single-display machine:

1) Have the display set to it maximum resolution (i.e. pixel dimension - NOT talking about the Windows "logical dpi" adjustment here). In my case, I have a 1920x1080 display on this laptop.

2) Open Firefox, and ensure it is set to reload the previous session on startup. Make the window small, and position it in the lower right of the display. Quit Firefox.

3) Re-launch Firefox, and confirm that Session Restore put the window back in the same place at the lower right. Quit again.

4) In the Windows Display control panel, reduce the resolution (e.g. to 1024x768, i.e. simulate swapping a large-screen display for a standard VGA monitor).

5) Re-launch Firefox. Note that Session Restore move the window to it "original" position, even though that is now completely off-screen due to the reduced amount of screen real-estate available.

I think Session Restore should sanity-check the window position it's restoring, and ensure that the window is actually on-screen. (Entirely, or is partially on-screen sufficient?)

This issue will be exacerbated by the transition to HiDPI support, currently in FF22, a this in effect reduces the available desktop space if the system is configured for a higher "logical DPI" - making everything on the screen bigger is equivalent to making the screen itself smaller, in term of window placement.
