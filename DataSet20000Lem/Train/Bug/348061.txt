Browser unnecessarily fetch all SWF file twice.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

On any page with a Flash SWF Firefox will issue two GETs for the swf file. I tested with Firefox 1.5.0.5 and 1.5.0.6 both with Flash 8 on WinXP SP2. I used Ethereal Version 0.10.13 to grab the traces.

The first GET, in my test case, produced a 7700 byte trace in Ethereal and I assume it is incomplete because the second GET produced a 26000 byte trace. In any case, the two GETs are not the same.

This came up because we've developed a banner server that track impressions. People using Firefox, at least version 1.5.x and perhaps others, are generating double the impression and this is a problem.

The HTTP header are below:
