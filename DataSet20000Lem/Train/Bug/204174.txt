When going to the mentioned site and doing a print preview, the first table is
moved to page 2 (ie there's a big blank on page one after 'to execute the
command' and page 2 start with the first row of the table) but when one then
doe Print Pages 2 to 2, it print out only part of the table (it print the
correct row title but start with 'Backspace / Delete previous character.'
instead of 'Up / Move back one command in the history list.') Printing page 1-2
give the correct result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/debian/chapter/book/ch13_02.html
2. Do a Print Preview (I used A4 size paper) and check page 2 (table start with
'Up/ Move back... ')
3. Do Print -> Pages 2 to 2
Actual Results:
Table on printout start with 'Backspace / Delete...' which is somewhere in the
middle of the actual table. In print preview the table is shown a being
entirely on page 2

Expected Results:
Print a shown/rendered in 'Print Preview'
