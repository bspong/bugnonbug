My window setting are set to the default blue XP theme, however, there are time when the title bar text in Firefox 3 (i.e. "Enter a Bug - Mozilla Firefox") turn dark blue against the lighter blue XP background. This bug doesn't happen all the time when I have Firefox open; it seems to happen almost exclusively when I minimize Thunderbird to the tray and have Firefox open behind it. When TB minimizes to the tray, I can work in the ACTIVE Firefox window, but the title bar text will still be dark blue. This doe not change until I refresh the page, click a link, or do something else in the Firefox window. I don't think this is an XP problem, since this happens to no other program when I have two open, and minimize one to leave the other open behind it. The advanced XP color setting do not have any dark blue text for inactive windows. Even when the Firefox window is inactive I have the regular white text; I only get the blue text when I minimize Thunderbird in front of it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open and maximize window in both Firefox 3 and Thunderbird 2 (with MinimizeToTray addon)
2. Close Thunderbird, leaving just Firefox open and visible
3. Windows XP title bar text will be dark blue in Firefox (i.e. "Enter a Bug - Mozilla Firefox") and thus barely readable against the regular blue XP color until any link or button in Firefox is clicked, when the text will return to it normal white
Actual Results:
When Thunderbird is minimized to tray, the Firefox title bar text becomes dark blue and unreadable against normal XP colors.

Expected Results:
When Thunderbird wa minimized to tray, the Firefox title bar text should have stayed white.
