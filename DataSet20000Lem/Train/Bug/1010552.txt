Breakpoints not removed from server when tab is closed
STR copied from Shu in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1008372#c1:

1. Make some page with some JS and open it.
2. Open debugger, set a breakpoint somewhere.
3. Reload. Breakpoint hits.
4. Close the tab.
5. Open a new tab and navigate to the same page from step 1.
6. Open debugger, verify no breakpoints are visually set.
7. Reload. Invisible breakpoint hits.

This is because the DebuggerController try to cleanup everything on shutdown, including removing all the breakpoints. However, that code is triggered from the tab "close" event, and the debugger server is immediately disconnected afterwards, and the server deletes all the associated actors. So when the DebuggerController cleanup code get around to sending packet to remove all the breakpoints, the server ha already removed all the associated actors. server log:
