History Quicksearch: keywords instead of exact phrase

Currently, when you press Ctrl+H to bring up the history sidebar, and type a few
word in the quicksearch bar at the top, an exact phrase match is done.
However, a Google-like keyword search would be far more useful.

For example, sometimes I want to recall a recent Google search. I can press
Ctrl+H and type "google" into the quicksearch bar, but I may need to narrow it
down further. Say I want a search about Linux. So I type in "google linux",
expecting to see all Google search related to linux. Instead I get Zarro
results. The HTML title of the Google result page is "Google Search: search
terms"--in this case, "Google Search: linux image organizer"--but when I type in
"google linux", I get nothing. Instead I have to type in "google search linux".
That, obviously, is counter-intuitive.

A keyword search would be far more useful here. Then I could simply type
"google whatever" and get all recent Google search that included the
"whatever" keyword, and I could also narrow it down by adding another keyword.
