Steps to reproduce:

In several instances, clicking on a button or hyperlink associated with JavaScript cause nothing to occur. It's like the JavaScript event fails to fire.

In every case, I simply clicked on a button or link. Some example include:

(1) Clicking the Post button in any Slashdot post, even after logging in. Ordinarily (and currently in other browers), this button insert a textbox and some control for submitting a reply.

(2) Several link within Facebook - e.g., when a wall post is truncated with a "See More" hyperlink, clicking the hyperlink should Ajax in the rest of the post.

(3) The "Start" button on this site:

Actual results:

In each case, the button or link, when clicked, doe nothing.


Expected results:

In each case, some sort of behavior should have resulted (e.g., navigation to a new page, a pop-up window, some AJAX insertion of text, an animation, etc.)
