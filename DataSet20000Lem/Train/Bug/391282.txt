"Connect Broadband" dialog box. This happens
. when doing next on a multi page search.
. clicking on an item to view it detail
. clicking to view bidders. This happens
. searching for an item

NOT A BUG BUT AN ANNOYANCE. STARTED WITH LATEST FF RELEASE.

If you must show Connect Broadband dialog, it might be nice to have it timing adjustable on the Tools bar.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In your FF 2.0.0.6 release, to to ebay at www.ebay.com
2. Type the below into the search box, then hit enter
3. Keuffel (Ad*, AD, bill, Calendar, catalog, Catalog, coffee, document) -Leroy

Strange thing is it only happens with eBay and not other site like news sites. Other browser like SeaMonkey wait a generous amount of time before the "Connect Broadband" dialog come up.

Actual Results:
Connect Broadband dialog box come up loading basic www.ebay.com

Expected Results:
Just load www.ebay.com

And/or have a Tools item that adjusts time before Connect Dialog come up.
