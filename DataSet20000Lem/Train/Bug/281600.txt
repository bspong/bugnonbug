I have massive problem using FireFox to upload picture via http post to
different webservers. Very often the upload stall after some kilobytes.

I sniffed the network traffic with ethereal to see what is exactly happening. If
you inspect the packet flow while the upload stall you will almost see the same
happening:

- The server sends multiple (>50) duplicate TCP ACK packet
:loop
- wait 10
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 10 second
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 20 second
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 40 second
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 40 second
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 20 second
- The server sends a FIN to close the connection
- goto loop

Hint: To find the interesting packet add this ethereal filter: "tcp.analysis.flags"

The problem only occurs on my internet connection (128kbit upstream via a DLINK
router). I couldnt reproduce it on my webserver in my lan.

Here is the interesting part. If i upload data via ftp or ssh it sometimes
stall too. But it stall for very short time only. Normally the server sends 2
duplicate ACK packet and almost immediately the upload resume with full speed.
Where is the difference to FF?

Is FF using some kind of "special" TCP socket ?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. upload a file via http post

Actual Results:
transmission stall

Expected Results:
transmission should complete
