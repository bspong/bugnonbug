Hi!

Im using firefox 1.0.7 wich is the latest stable version. I have window xp professional with no service pack on it. The problem is with the latest Shockwave flash player plug-in. This bug happens sometimes, and it could be realy annoying. I describe the full bug now: When i go to a page where are flash animations, and if im using shockwave instead flash player, sometimes the browser crashes, and left behing a message with the following sentence: "The shockwave player ha made an invalid proces, and now will close. The data what with you worked will be lost." The other thing is that if im using IE and view that page again, there are no problems. It happens sometimes, that there is no crash with the browser (firefox), just the flash animation is frozen, and i cant navigate, or enter a new url.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to en.prizee.com
2.View some saple game in the guide


Actual Results:
Sometimes the browser crash or the animation is frozen, and all data that i worked with are lost

Expected Results:
No crash or frozen flash animations, just regular, stable work.

I am using the firefox with some extensions: Flashgot, Tabbrowser, IE View, Image Zoom, and Fasterfox, i am using sometimes the gmail notifier.
I am using one theme with firefox, that is the "Noia 2.0 (eXtreme)"
The shockwave flash and the flash player installed too.
