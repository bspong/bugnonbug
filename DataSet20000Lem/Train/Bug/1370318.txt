Steps to reproduce:

Visited an http website that is not fully secure.


Actual results:

Firefox throw out all these icon/symbols in the identity section. A circled "i" is always displayed no matter the connection and another icon is posted over the lock icon.


Expected results:

I find this confusing and suggest that you guy simplify this. I have uploaded two screenshots: Chrome and Firefox.

Look at Chrome. To me, this presentation is very clear and understandable.

Look at Firefox. I don't know what this is. Is it secure or not? There's definitely something not right but it involves dropping everything and investigating. Security/Identity thing like this need to be made simpler, not so much for me but for the general public that doesn't understand this stuff a well a we do. The general public want to know if they can enter their credit card or not. Frankly, if everything on the site is not encrypted, the site isn't secure and presenting this middle ground with a bunch of traffic sign make it very confusing.

I recommend the circled "i" only present on non-secure site (ones that do not have a lock icon). And the other sign I don't think ha real use. If the site is not full-on secure, it is not secure. Period.
