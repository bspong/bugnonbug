Installer should import compatible setting from previous installation

I just upgraded FireFox to 0.9 today, from 0.8 (no dev version here). The first
time I run 0.9 it sayed something about an error (I had extension installed on
0.8, so I expected that) and started beautifully... but it deleted completely my
bookmark and browser settings.
Extension and theme thingies are likely to cause problem when upgrading, I
assume it. But I cannot see any reason of why my bookmark and browser setting
must be completely erased. This is a bug, of course, I cannot believe that this
is the default behaviour by design.
The installer should check for firefox configuration on all user account and
purge non-compatible setting ONLY, and import compatible settings.
Don't misunderstand me, please. I use FF because it is the best browser around
(by far), but AFAIK this is the only program I ever tested that could not import
setting from previous versions, on the installer or the program itself.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have an existing and previous FireFox installation, with your user parameter
on your window user account.
2. Install FireFox 0.9
3. Run it first time

Actual Results:
Bookmarks and browser setting deleted completely.

Expected Results:
It should purge uncompatible setting (including extension and so) and maintain
compatible setting (bookmarks, download folder, etc).
