firefox -remote broken if some mozilla package not present
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

NOTE: I am running this on Suse 9.2 with Mozilla installed, but firefox requires
mozilla component that are not installed by default, and are not part of the
Suse 9.2 distro.

Bug is that firefox install should check for required shared libs and at least
warn on installation, or better yet download them...

Trying to run firefox -remote 'openURL(http://www.yahoo.com)' yield
Error: No running window found

On investigation, this is because it call mozilla-xremote-client which requires
libplds4.so which is part of the mozilla-nspr package which is not part of Suse 9.2.

Installing mozilla-nspr-1.3-0_rh7 allows mozilla-xremote-client to work, but
firefox -remote still fails because it requires libmozjs.so which is not part of
the mozilla package distributed with Suse 9.2 (mozilla-1.6-74.9).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Uninstall all mozilla files.
2. Install RPM mozilla-1.6-74.9
3. Run firefox -remote 'openURL(http://www.yahoo.com)'
Actual Results:
Error: No running window found

Expected Results:
Opened the URL
