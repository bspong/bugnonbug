I have a video running in one tab and then start a web cam (from some site) in another tab - the result is a crash (i.e., --firefox ha encountered an error and will now close --). Also to note, radio/audio is running in another tab prior to starting the web cam. Audio and first video work ok together; the crash happens when the web cam is attempted to be started.

Also, the web cam and the audio, two separate tabs, (no other video) work fine a well at the same time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start a internet radio station (e.g., last.fm)
2. start a movie (e.g. youtube)
3. start a web cam from some site (e.g., maronvseder.tv)
Actual Results:
Crash, i.e. firefox display an error message and you are directed to close, or is terminated automatically

Expected Results:
continue working with the web cam on - multiple video (movies) seem to work simultaneously in different tab

web cam freeze happened in the previous version I used a well, firefox 2.something, not exactly in the given scenario but just on their own: live web cam streaming would result in browser freeze
