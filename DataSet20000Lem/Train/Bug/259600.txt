The new release candidate doe not work properly with WebCT. I have found two
action in WebCT which cause it consistently to crash (neither of which did this
in 0.9.3).

The first one I noticed wa when I clicked on the Browse button to find a file
to which I wa making a link, a a designer, in the Edit Link dialogue. The
first time I tried this, the beachball spun indefinitely, and I had to force
quit. The second time, Firefox quit immediately.

The other one, which consistently crash Firefox, is clicking on a discussion
submission to view it. This result in the beachball spinning for 20-30 second
before the browser crashes.

I can't figure out how to use Feedback Agent through our proxy server - when I
put in the correct address and port just a in Firefox, I get a network error
message.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Designer view in WebCT, select Add Page or Tool
2.Click Browse

or

1. In Designer view in WebCT, go to Tools/Discussions
2. Click on the arrow to the left of any topic
3. click on the topic title to view it

Actual Results:
Version 1: either constantly spinning beachball, requiring a force quit, or
Firefox crash

Version 2: spinning beachball and lot of hard disk activity, followed after
20-30 second by the browser crashing

Expected Results:
Version 1: brought up the file manager dialogue box allowing me to pick the file
to link to

Version 2: displayed the message

Default theme.

No Talkback ID apparent.

It crashed only the browser, a you would expect on Mac OS X. I don't have time
to look up how to print out crash logs, or if these exist for applications.
