Problem ha been occurring in both 3.5 and after 3.6 update. Existing text in forum text box can be selected, but cursor never appears, and text cannot be deleted (backspace doe nothing). On page with multiple text box (Blackboard test for college) focus / cursor stayed in first text box. Was forced to type answer in first box, cut/paste into the rest. Reloading page doe nothing; closing the tab and opening a new one change nothing.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to reply to a forum post, fill out a Blackboard test, anything using a text input box.

Actual Results:
1. Randomly, the cursor / focus will not lock onto the text box. No input can be made unless pasted in.

Expected Results:
I expect to be able to type in any text input box. Not being able to render Firefox unusable for me, a I require a reliable way of taking online test for school, and posting in the discussion boards.

I use very few extension (Adblock Plus and bug489729 1.3, to disable tab dragging) and Plugins (Java Embedding Plugin 0.9.7.2, Quicktime Plug-In 7.6.4, Shockwave Flash 10.0.42).

Unless I can find a solution, I am forced to use Safari. I cannot take chance with my education. Ironically, this bug report form worked just fine. The lack of consistency make it difficult to diagnose.
