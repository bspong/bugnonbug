I have elected not to use tabs, yet continue to have tab line appear, not only with the site I am looking at, but all the Mozilla Firefox Start Page tab appears a well. I have gone into tools, made sure tab were not elected and they were not. saved setting and tried again. Same problem. I really don't want tab to appear nor do I want the google start page to always appear a the Mozilla Firefox Start Page tab. Can you fix this bug. Was not a problem in old version. Really like the vers 3.0 beta is much faster and very few crash compared to the older versions. Thanks for listening.

Don't want to see tab appear at all, if a tab MUST appears, then only the tab for site I am looking at. Do not want to see The Mozilla Firefox Start Page tab every time.
