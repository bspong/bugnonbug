[e10s] chrome (e.g. Location bar) steal focus when I switch to tab and click on web page content and vice versa
>>> My Info: Win7_64, Nightly 48, 32bit, ID 20160403030243
STR_1_simplified:
1. Open attachment 8714031 , focus location bar
2. Open new tab (Ctrl+T)
3. Switch back to tab from Step 1 (Ctrl+Shift+Tab), click in <textarea>

AR: [screencast] <textarea> is focused for a moment, but then urlbar steal focus
ER: Urlbar shouldn't steal focus because of latency



STR_1_detailed (146% reliable):
0. Open new window, open 10 tab with http://www.rp-online.de/ , close other tab
If your PC is super fast, open more tab with http://www.rp-online.de/
1. Open attachment 8714031 in a new tab
2. Select all text in <textarea>, then focus location bar in tab from Step 1.
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Tab 3 time to switch to a tab with http://www.rp-online.de/
4. Move mouse pointer to the area on the screen where <textarea> wa placed in tab from Step 1
5. Hold Ctrl
6. Press Tab key 3 time with pause of 0.5-1 second, then immediately hold left mouse button
over <textarea> (without 'mouseup')
7. (unnecessary) Release left mouse button and Ctrl key.

AR: You see the text blink, but then urlbar becomes focused.
ER: Urlbar shouldn't steal focus using latency a excuse. <textarea> should stay focused.



Notes:
1) See also bug 1252183 - it's a stress-test and e10s doesn't pas it.
2) I can reproduce this bug without any effort, because I usually open 20+ tabs, but Step 0 in
STR_1_detailed should make it easy for you too. It's an emulation of real-life loaded browser

// In fact, STR_1_detailed are so great that I should be granted a free Firefox account for a year
