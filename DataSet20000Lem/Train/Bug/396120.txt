When drawing constantly on a canvas element (such a in animations), switching globalCompositeOperation mode repeatedly cause massive memory loss, and eventually a crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an animation function that copy an image on to a canvas element
2. Make sure that this function draw once, in "source-over", switch mode to "destination-atop" and draw again.
3. Call the function repeatedly (say 10000 time or with setInterval)

Actual Results:
Browser loos memory in large chunk until it crash (or system kill it due to "out of memory" error).

Expected Results:
Browser should draw image without rendering the system useless

Problem seems to affect Macs only. Short testing on Windows did not cause this behavior. The effect is actually quite intense a the system try to allocate virtual memory to accommodate, the whole system becomes unresponsive and slow.
