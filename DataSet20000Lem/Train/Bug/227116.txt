If I am using multiple tabs, one of them is displaying
http://software.yalaso.net/ , and I close this tab, none of the rest tab will
have focus. And after it if I continue clicking on the tab close button, I will
close a page but the corresponding tab will not disappear. So I end up with more
tab than pages, with some tab that can never be closed.

I experience this problem in Nov 29's official nightly win32 build, and all
build from aebrahim and cypher77 (refer to the Firebird build forum on
MozillaZine.org) after Nov 19. At least one person confirmed this. And some one
said about similar problem they ever had.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 3 or more tab using Ctrl-T or what ever way you like
2. Switch to one of the tab in the middle and let it go to
http://software.yalaso.net/
3. Close this tab

Actual Results:
None of the rest tab will get the focus. If continue cloing tab without
clicking any tab to give them focus, the browser will end up with more tab
than actual page displaying. And the spare tab with no page associated cannot
be closed until closing the whole browser.

Expected Results:
The next tab should get the focus. And no problem when closing more tabs.
