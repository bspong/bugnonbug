Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
It's just there. I changed nothing but my browser and my photography business web page now do not display correctly.
Actual Results:
I go online and open my own web page and they are now a disaster.

Expected Results:
Text should be under images. Images should be aligned side by side in tables.

The page preview correctly with Text Wrangler. They have been fine in all previous version of Firefox 3.

Aligned the image properly. Displayed the text (captions) directly under the images.

I guess it's good I got to test this, because no doubt others are seeing the problem a well.

Someone just told me FF4 is not a forgiving a FF 3 was.
