Firefox process runs, but no window open
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98; yie6_SBC)
Build Identifier:

After using firefox successfully for several months, i tried to open it today
and it did not open. no window opened. window ie opened, however. i
unistalled the software, restarted the computer, and downloaded firefox again.
when i clicked on "finish," no browswer window opened.
when i hit "control-alt-delete" to see what program were running, firefox
wa running. i tried to open firefox through the shortcut and from the "start-
programs" menu but no browswer window would open.
i attempted to uninstall the software again, and before i could do so i wa
instructed that i must close firefox before i could uninstall it.
i uninstalled and re downloaded the software, same results.
i have not installed any new program in the time when firefox worked and it
didn't work.
it seems that firefox is opening up and running (as seen on the list of
program running), but the browswer is not opening.
i use zone alarm firewall, but have given access to firefox. i have had
zone alarm for several month also, with no ill effect until today.
please advise
