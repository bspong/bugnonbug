For ex in page
http://www.ikea.it/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchProductView?storeId=10&langId=-4
you enter an article to search for, than you click "cerca", and Mozilla and
Firefox do nothing; (checked IE 6.0 open the query results); Or: filled a form
for internet banking; pressing "commit" button Firefox and Mozilla do nothing,
whilst IE check the form and accept it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to
http://www.ikea.it/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SearchProductView?storeId=10&langId=-4
2. enter a product name to search for (maybe Mozilla...)
3. press "cerca" button: nothing happens (whilst IE give results)

Actual Results:
Mozilla and Firefox still fully work, but the requested page dont open

Expected Results:

Excuse me if it's an already known bug... My english is poor, and I found it
difficult to read the bug's list...
Thanks for your work!!!
