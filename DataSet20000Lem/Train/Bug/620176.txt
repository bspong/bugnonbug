When FireFox starts, it's not loading last session tabs!

This issue seems to be recent,
My general setting have (When Firefox starts, Show my window and tab from last time).
Previous version worked well, even when I had 80 tabs!
Now with only le than 10 tabs, Firefox frequently (daily) forgets these tab and start with one tab only, to my default home page.

I have rechecked the settings, and they are still a I described above.
This is getting very annoying, a I have to open the History, and start loading these tab one by one.
It's not bad when you have a few tabs, but it becomes very ugly when the tab are many!

It seems to me that this happens when some of the plugins or addons are automatically updated by Firefox.

I have Chrome 8 also, and I have loaded it with 95 tabs. It always restored the previous session, with all the tabs. Never missed even once!

Thank you.
