The plain textbox (either single line or multi line) used in most site (such a
Gmail's compose new messege page or even the bugzilla enter a bug page) which
FireFox render doesn't allow you to switch text editing direction - from LTR
to RTL.

This mean RTL text enterd into the textbox (such a Hebrew text) will always be
LTR aligned (Hebrew is an RTL lang).

It is worthy to note that certain other browsers, such a IE, allow you to
swtich text direction using the Shift+Ctrl combination. This is probably
becuase IE user the Windows OS generic textbox (that support RTL) while
Firefox us it's own that doesn't?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter the compose a new messege page in Gmail.
2.In the messege body textbox, try switching the direction of the text to RTL
(by using Shift+Ctrl for example).
3.try writing some text.

Actual Results:
The text will be LTR aligned and not RTL aligned

Expected Results:
The text should be RTL aligned - a required by BiDi langs.
