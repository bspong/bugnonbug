I tried to create an account to view my power bill and received a page/form with several error messages: Error: Return Method is required for WebLogin, Error: Return URL is required for WebLogin and Error: Application Id is required for WebLogin
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I have a snap shot of the page and results. If you email me, I can send it to you.

I tried to create an account to view my power bill. In Firefox, I get to the
submit point after filling out several forms, but it did not look and feel like
a webservices form. Anyway, the result wa the same each time:

Error: Return Method is required for WebLogin
Error: Return URL is required for WebLogin
Error: Application Id is required for WebLogin

Thinking it wa something I did wrong, I tried it in IE6 and it worked fine.
Then, I went back and tried it again in Firefox with the same result a the
original attempt.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. www.alabamapower.com
2. select e-bill link
3. select login link
4. select create new account
5. create username and password and click submit
6. fill out personal info (very minimal required) and click submit
7. create secret question and answer and click submit
Actual Results:
8. voila, error returned

Error: Return Method is required for WebLogin
Error: Return URL is required for WebLogin
Error: Application Id is required for WebLogin

Expected Results:
Should have created my account and taken me to a login screen to view and/or pay
my bill.

It doe not crash, but the process is incomplete. Not so sure, but the site
might be built specifically for IE and NetScape. I have not tried any other
browser but Firefox and IE.
