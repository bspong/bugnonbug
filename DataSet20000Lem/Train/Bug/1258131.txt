Expected results:

Nothing should be "blocked" for my graphic card. Matrox card are used in many industry and have established themselves in certain high-demand environment a the graphic solution of choice.

I have the very latest driver for my card. Yes, it's from 2013, but it's the latest.

Matrox us a unified driver package and ha put out lot of update subsequently (including 11 March 2016), but the Win7 x64 driver is still the one from 2013 (version 2.4.3.2). My impression is - barring some unforeseen calamity - it will never be updated.

I'm not certain, but the issue appears to have a real-world negative impact. Please see

My graphic card ha 1gb of memory and my system (a Lenovo S20 workstation) ha 12gb. I shouldn't be experiencing this type of problem, which, by the way, only happens with Fx.

As mentioned in my forum post, both Norton Internet Security and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware - a well a Windows itself - regularly pop little message up in that corner of my desktop; the "residue box" or whatever you want to call it only occurs a the result of some type of activity in Firefox.

The two case that come to mind - and always cause the problem - are message related to the Screengrab and DownThemAll extensions.

Thank you.
