User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0
Build ID: 20170418004027

Steps to reproduce:

Using Firefox 54, both 32-bit Beta and 64-bit Dev Edition
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0

I'm using the Firefox developer tool to inspect several request that include URL-encoded param value and I started getting worried that the value I wa sending were broken. However upon inspection through Fiddler and comparng with Chrome it seems Firefox is decoding the entire URL before displaying it on the network panel.

Minimal example (can be accessed for live testing at https://jsfiddle.net/zbp5L0dp/1/):

var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
oReq.open("GET", "?a=b&c=d%20e%20%3D%20f%20%26%20g%20%3D%20r");
oReq.send();

I want to emphasize that this is a devtools issue, the actual request is sending the params correctly in their raw form, the decoding only happens in the inspector UI.



Actual results:

Network panel show these a the params:

a: "b"
c: "d e "
g: " r"



Expected results:

The actual params on the request are a and c, so:

a: "b"
c: "d%20e%20%3D%20f%20%26%20g%20%3D%20r"
