Calling window.open() from a modal (page B) that ha been opened via window.showModalDialog() by a page (page A) open another modal (page C). I would expect B to open a window C that isn't modal. You should be able to focus the calling page B. Instead page C is a modal on top of B and you can't focus B until you close C.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Implement three html page with the following body content:

A.
A: This is the first screen. Open Modal from here.<br />
<a href="#" onClick='window.showModalDialog("ModalTestB.html",null,"dialogWidth=300px;dialogHeight:200px;dialogLeft:10px;dialogTop:10px;edge:raised;help:no;resizable:no;status=no")'>Open Modal</a>

B.
B: This is the second screen - opened a a modal from the first screen. Open third screen from here.<br />
<a href="#" onClick='window.open("ModalTestC.html","onLineDoc","width=250,height=150,left=20,top=20")'>Open Window</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#" onClick='window.open("ModalTestC.html","onLineDoc")'>Open Window w/ no size</a>&nbsp;
<a href="#" onClick='window.showModalDialog("ModalTestC.html",null,"dialogWidth=250px;dialogHeight:150px;dialogLeft:20px;dialogTop:20px;edge:raised;help:no;resizable:no;status=no")'>Open Modal</a>

C.
C: This is the third screen opened from the modal.

2. Open page A in FF. Click the link. Page B open a a modal.

3. On page B, click the three link and observe the results.
Actual Results:
"Open Window" on page B open page C a a modal (wrong).
"Open Window w/ no size" open page C in a new tab (ok).
"Open Modal" open page C a a modal (right).

Expected Results:
"Open Window" should open a window that is not modal.

IE work a expected.
