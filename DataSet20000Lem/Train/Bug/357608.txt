Firefox will not load the plug-in library (provided by Apple) for a SmartCard reader (SCR331)

This affect Firefox (up to and including v2 RC3) and Thunderbird.

I go to Preferences-Advanced-Encryption-Security Devices, select "Load," select "Browse," navigate to the library "pkcs11.shlb" and select "Open."

The dialog box now show a very long ASCII string in the Module filename field. When I hit "OK," an alert box appears asking for confirmation that I intend to load this module. This alert box fill the width of the screen with the incredibly long ASCII Module filename running off the right side of the box. There are no buttons, where I would expect a choice between "Cancel" and "OK."

I have tried using every key to confirm. The only key that ha any effect is "return," which simply close the open box without loading the module.



Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Module doe not load

Expected Results:
Module load and I can use US Government CAC to access password-protected sites.

I have screen shot off the process if they help
