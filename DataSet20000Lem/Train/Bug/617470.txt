When I click on "Firefox" menu (Which is present at the upper left most corner of the mozilla firefox web page), I get an option " New Tab" which open a new tab in the same window of the mozilla browser.

However that "New tab" option ha got a sub-menu which again ha the option named a " New Tab" which again open a new tab in same window.
