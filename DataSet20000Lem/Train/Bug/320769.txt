I'm trying to trace the history upwards, from parent referer to the last page checked. As my XUL template didn't seem to work, I then tried to debug it in javascript. I finally found that when using GetSource(s) to get a target's referrer, the result would by the target itself.

Example session : google.com -> result for "mozilla" -> mozilla website.
if I ask for mozilla website's referrer, it give the result page
( mozilla , referrer , ? ) -> google results. That's ok.
but if I ask which page google result refers to, it doesn't work
( ? , referrer , google result ) -> google results. Bad !
Doesn't work either with getSources , still give only one result, which is faulty.

I checked the source for nsGlobalHistory.cpp but I can't figure it out.

Here is my test :

var RDF = Components.
classes["@mozilla.org/rdf/rdf-service;1"].
getService(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFService);

var globalHistoryGraph = Components.
classes["@mozilla.org/rdf/datasource;1?name=history"].
getService(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFDataSource);

var list = globalHistoryGraph.GetAllResources() ;
var str = "" ;
var property = RDF.GetResource("http://home.netscape.com/NC-rdf#Referrer") ;
while (list.hasMoreElements()) {
var target = list.getNext().QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFResource) ;

var source = globalHistoryGraph.GetSource(property,target,true) ;
if (source) {
target = target.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIRDFResource) ;
str += "'"+ target.Value + "' is referred by '" + source.Value +"'\n" ;
}
}
alert(str) ;

Reproducible: Always
