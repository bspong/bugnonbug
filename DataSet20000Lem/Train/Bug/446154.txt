I have had this happen every time I use Firefox now for whatever reason.

During any session of use, if I have a good deal of content up on a page or multiple tabs, after I close out FF and log on again I lose all my bookmarks, content of quick link etc. If the computer ha had any kind of extra load on it, you can bet that FF will not have all my data ready to use again. You have to completely reboot to get it to completely load up again. This did not happen on version before 3.0. You guy have any idea whats causing that. I mean it a real pain having to reboot your machine when you were ready to fire up FF and do your banking and other item of business and find you have to reboot. Whan it first happened I thought I had lost everything. It wa a good thing I had Nortons password bank.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Boot FF
2.Open two, three tab (work within each of them for a period of time (close out)
3.Boot FF again and all your content is gone unless you reboot your machine
Actual Results:
All content come back but if you stay logged on for any continued amount of time you can bet it going to happen again.

Expected Results:
There are time when you dont even have to have FF open to have this problem occur. If you have a load on your box (CPU intensive application such a Photoshop Audio Video apps etc. When you boot FF I have had the same problem (all content gone. This machine isnt ram starved , it ha a gig of ram in it.
