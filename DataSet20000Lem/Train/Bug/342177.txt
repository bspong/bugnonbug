I have 4 booksmarks in my Personal Toolbar Folder. I have read all the reports. I tried renaming this folder from Bookmarks Toolbar Folder to Personal Toolbar Folder. I have Firefox customized to show the Bookmarks Toolbar. Despite all this, the link are not showing up on the Bookmarks Toolbar. I have to open Manage Bookmarks to find the link to go to them. What do I need to do to see my Personal Toolbar link on the Bookmarks Toolbar of my Firefox browser?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Bookmarks Toolbar is blank
3.Open Manage Bookmarks and the bookmark are in the Personal Toolbar Folder but not on the toolbar of the browser.

Actual Results:
I still do not have anything showing up on the Bookmarks Toolbar of the Firefox browser.

Expected Results:
I should have the link on the toolbar.

I updated my Firefox to the newest version today. However, I have not been online on this computer for a while, so it may have happened some time back and may not have anything to do with the newer version.
