if you have a table with many row and columns, and use JS to turn toggle the CSS display value of the last two <td> element of each row between "none" and "", the border of the element don't re-render correctly if there are also some row that only have one <td colspan=0> element.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a table that ha many row and many colums, where one row contains a single td that ha colspan=0
2. for all row of the table, except for the one that ha only one td, give the last two <td> element in each row a class name of 'x'
3. set CSS so all td element have borders, and we are collapsing border
4. specify a CSS rule that "table.hide_x_cols .x {display:none;}"
5. use JS to dynamically add the class name "hide_x_cols" to the table
6. use JS to dynamically remove the class name "hide_x_cols" from the table
Actual Results:
when the table first render it look fine. when the table's class name is changed for the first time, everything look a you would expect. but when the dynamically added class name is then removed (so that the hidden <td> element are re-displayed), some of the <td> element do not render their left and right borders. which <td> element don't show their border depends on the placement of the row with the single <td colspan=0> elements.

if the user scroll up and down on the page, or highlight the table with the mouse, the border will sometimes show up again.

Expected Results:
when the <td> element reappear after having been dynamically hidden, they should render with their original borders.
