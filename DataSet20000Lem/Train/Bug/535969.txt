Operatin system is window 2000 professional

In firefox I have choosen the option to check for updates.

There wa an update. Si I loaded down the update:

Firefox 3.5 herunterladen
3.5.6, Deutsch, Windows (7.6MB)

I started and wa able to choose the Directory to put the programm in the directory D:\windows\programme

Then I clicked on for further installation.

Then the istallation window told to close firefox. I did close firefox. But the download window wa maybe somehow active in background.

In effect for the installation assistant firefox wa not closed. In Taskmanager firefox wa no more.

So I loaded the installation file down with internet explorer and started the update. No problem, because firefox wa not running at all.
The installation of the update wa successfull.

Does Firefox need IE to get up? I hope not. In my case it wa alike.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
So I loaded the installation file down with internet explorer and started the update. No problem, because firefox wa not running at all.
The installation of the update wa successfull.

Actual Results:

Normal user may not be able to install the update.

Could be risky. Is it an internal error or a problem affected by outside action?
