Firefox get corrupted when renaming/moving Divx Stage6 video in “Total Commander”

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox with a new session, and play a Divx Stage6 video. The Divx web player should be set to save the streamed video to disk.
2. After download go to the folder where the player saved the video, and rename it.
3. Move the renamed video to another folder on you’re hard-disk with “Total commander” (I didn’t try with Explorer) and Firefox start to display “Server page not found” message.
4. Start IE and you can see that it’s not related to server downtime, Firefox is corrupted.

Actual Results:
“Server page not found”

Expected Results:
Connect to any online server.

Reinstalling Firefox corrects the problem. The firewall may be responsible to, I use Comodo. When copying stage6 file you are prompted to allow some OLE permission for “Total Commander”. I would mention that Firefox wa not started from “Total Commander”.
