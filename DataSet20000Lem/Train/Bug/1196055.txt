User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
Build ID: 20150807085045

Steps to reproduce:

Places.sqlite and places.sqlite-wal both contain URLs for every site you visit that ha a favicon. Deleting history doe not delete the favicon entry keyed by the URL of the site you visit.

Firefox Settings:
Privacy:
Clear history when Firefox close [checked]
Browsing & Download History [checked]
Active Logins [checked]
Form & Search History [checked]
Offline Website Data [checked]
Site Preferences [checked]
Saved Passwords [not checked]


Actual results:

After closing Firefox and examining places.sqlite and places.sqlite-wal, URLs remain for site I have visited on that session and previous sessions.


Expected results:

ALL entry in the place database that contain URLs should be deleted when Firefox is closed.

There should be a checkbox in the "Settings for Clearing History" dialog to delete favicons and any other object that is stored in any Firefox database keyed by the URL of site you visit.
