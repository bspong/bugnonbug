On the website, http://www.bigcharts.com there is a control panel on the left side of the page supply textboxes to type in a ticker symbol, or select various technical analysis tools. If a new website is accessed it will open within the previously opened web page.

For example, if the following address is used:

http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/interchart/interchart.asp?symb=C&time=&freq=

and then another:

http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/interchart/interchart.asp?symb=XOM&time=20’

The control panel on the left (dark blue background) will be replaced by the new web page. It is almost a if the control panel portion of the web page is incorrectly defined a a tab, and get replaced by the new web page address. I always use Bookmarks to open page where this error occurs, so maybe that is a factor.

Also, this web site us Java script to display content. I frequently get script error message that provide two options, “Continue” or “Stop Script”.

I have a dial-up connection, which I’m hoping may not be an issue because of how slow it is in comparison to broadband.

I just tried to recreate this error while writing this report. Unfortunately the error did not happen.

I also uninstalled and reinstalled Java. I would do the same for Firefox, but am not sure if that is the issue at this point. This could be some problem with the website itself, since this problem rarely occurs in other website having nothing to do with Bigcharts.

Also, these problem are intermittent, in that they do not occur every time. In order to view content when the problem occurs I must close the web page and reopen it again from the saved Bookmark.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open > http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/interchart/interchart.asp?symb=C&time=&freq=
2.Open another web page from the same site:
3.http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/interchart/interchart.asp?symb=DJIA&time=20
Actual Results:
While writing this report I did get the error giving me the option to "Continue" or "Stop Script". However, when opening another page it did not open within this page,

Expected Results:
It should have replaced the old website displayed with the new one, instead of opening the new one within the display of the old one.

This is occurring now with greater frequency.
