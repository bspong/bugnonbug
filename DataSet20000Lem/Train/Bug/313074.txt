Wrong mixture of CSS and HTML cause JavaScript to crash Firefox
User-Agent: Opera/8.50 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050919 Firefox/1.0.7

The sample page at http://daniel.softel.co.jp/firefox_javascript_bug.html cannot
be opened because Firefox crash on every attempt. It appears that one very
specific combination of CSS and HTML cause a line of JavaScript code to crash
the browser. This is a crasher so please view the *source* at http://daniel.
softel.co.jp/firefox_javascript_bug.txt - there you can find more detail in the
comments. Opera 8.5 and IE6 are both fine and so I think the source code is OK.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://daniel.softel.co.jp/firefox_javascript_bug.html in Firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, the "Mozilla Quality Feedback Agent" launch (if installed)
and Firefox ha to be aborted. Windows XP also launch the Microsoft "Submit
Error Report" dialogue.

Expected Results:
Nothing out of the ordinary, just not crash!

Unable/don't know how to obtain DLL module information.
Reproduceable every time in colleague's Firefox (Japanese language version on
Windows XP).
Have not tested on Linux (yet).
