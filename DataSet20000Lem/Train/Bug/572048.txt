Moving a tab outside the main window (creating a new tab) cause the page to reload.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any website (preferably a larger one with lot of embedded stuff if you have a faster connection so you can notice the effect more visibly).
2. Drag that tab outside of that window (meaning you probably need at least two tab going).
Actual Results:
The new window/tab doesn't really act a the same tab, it seems to just destroy the original tab and create a new window with the same address (page data may be transferred a well, but that's what I'd assume is going on).

Expected Results:
The tab should, instead *actually* move instead of being destroyed/re-created.

This doesn't really make much of a difference while browsing Google, but it is definitely a problem for page composed of large applets/embedded content (like Youtube even). Since the data is already loaded, why spend the time to reload when the user never explicitly asked for it.
