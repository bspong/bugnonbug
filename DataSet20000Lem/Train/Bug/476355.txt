Hello,

An interesting new feature ha been included in firefox 2.0.0.14 (I'm not sure of the release number).

I use 2 different certificate issued from the same root CA used to identify myself when connecting to some http sites. As the root CA is the same for both certificates, I can't use the automatic certificate selection feature because firefox always chose the first one (Preference -> Certificates -> "When a web site requires a certificate" : "Select one automatically").

In firefox >= 2.0.0.14, a new feature appears in the "User Identification request" dialog. This feature is the "Remember this decision" check box that let firefox remember the decision for the whole site until the next restart.

This feature is really useful and I don't understand why it a not been included in firefox 3.

Regards,
Pierre-Emmanuel.
