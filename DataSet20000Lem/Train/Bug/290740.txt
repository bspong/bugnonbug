Unwanted conversion of url when pasting html text (absolute->relative)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041217

I am running into this bug or misfeature. When pasting html text within Firefox
into some web site html editor window, all absolute url refering to that site
get automatically converted into relative urls. As an example if I send mail
from gmail.google.com, an absolute link
href="http://gmail.google.com/test/test"
get converted into
href="../test/test"

While this is an artificial example, at the web site I am running, user
frequently paste link refering to other page on the site in a discussion forum
like this one. The forum posting are also emailed to the participant . The
resulting email message thus contain dysfunctional links. Worse yet our email
server ha been configured to scan both outgoing and incoming email for cloaked
url redirecting user to phishing sites. The dysfunctional url in this email
are interpreted a such, and lot of warning are inserted into the email about
this, making them unreadable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into http://gmail.google.com
2. Compose a new message in richtext (html) format
3. Paste html text containing url of the form
http://gamil.google.com/something-or-other
4. Mail it to some address and look at the html source of the resulting message
Actual Results:
Absolute url got converted into a relative url

Expected Results:
Should leave the url alone a absolute url.
