the above link is an application enhancing the Google Maps API. but i expect the problem is not related to this javascript API. my extension basically allows you to zoom by drawing a box when the Ctrl-key is held (similar to what SVG-viewer do). that work a expected, except when, for some reason, the user selected the text in the location bar (for some copy-paste action of the URL) or the text cursor remains active in that location bar.

any mouse interaction still work well (including mousemove, look at the coordinate running), but the keydown event doesn't get through, at least if it is the Ctrl-key (nr. 17) that get needed.

the script code is rather long, but i guess this can be reproduced.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set cursor into the location bar
2. invoke a keydown event with the Ctrl-key


Actual Results:
no present onkeydown function get triggered

Expected Results:
a present onkeydown function should get triggered. it work a long the cursor is not in the location bar.
