There is no point in asking confirmation when you close a multiple tab window
where all tab (but the current one) where from a homepage or empty (either
because we have a multiple tab home page, or because we created new tab - empty
or loaded with homepage.)

The confirm dialog should come only when any tab other than the current one ha
seen is content changed.

We cannot just test if the "back" arrow is active, because the dialog must also
appear when we have manually filled the address field, which doesn't activate
the "back arrow" in the case the tab wa previously empty.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.configure a multiple homepage (ex :
http://www.google.be/fr|http://www.yahoo.fr ) and optionnally close firefox
2.open a new browser window or launch Firefox
3.Close the newly opened window


Actual Results:
Confirm dialog appears when there nothing to save in the window

Expected Results:
Windows should close without asking confirmation, like when there is no more
than one homepage.
