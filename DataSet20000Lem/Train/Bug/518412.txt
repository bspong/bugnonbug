Firefox is causing frequent Windows Explorer crash under the RTM version of Windows 7 Ultimate x64.

The Windows Error Reports always point to either 'explorer.exe', 'msvcrt.dll', 'ntdll.dll' or 'comctl32.dll'.

The problem seems to always occur when you either right-click on the desktop, right-click the Recycle Bin, it also happens just a Firefox is closed or when browsing Control Panel

Originally I thought it wa Microsoft Security Essentials beta causing the issue, but it wa not.
Following advice from a forum I used ShellExView to disable any 3rd party entries, and remove any suspect software.

After several week of trying everything possible including re-downloading Windows from Technet and a complete fresh install, somebody suggested that it wa Firefox 3.5.2 causing the problem.

Having removed Firefox 3.5.2 the problem stopped.
I decided to try Firefox 3.5.3 to see if the problem wa resolved.
As soon a I installed it I started getting the issue again, I have tried Firefox with Add-ons and without and created a new profile, the issue still persists.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close Firefox
2. Right-click the desktop or Recycle Bin
Actual Results:
The issue generally occurs once or twice a day and once it start Windows will crash on right-click around four time then revert to normal behaviour.

Expected Results:
Firefox should not make Windows unstable.
