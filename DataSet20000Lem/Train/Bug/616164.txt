If you use the location bar autocomplete and edit one of the entry before hitting enter, this appears to be tabbed up a a visit for the entry that you edited, not the page you actually went to.

This is really annoying when a misspelling get on top of the autocomplete and editing just make it stay there longer.

2.visit a particular page on that website by typing it into the location
3.close these open window

5. remove the part after the domain name and hit enter
6.repeat 3-5 a few time

the page that you were used a a base for your search is now a top site in the autocomplete, but you only went there once
