Dragging to dock cause Dock crash, OS X becomes extremely unstable, requiring hard restart

When I drag an image to an open application in the Dock (such a Photoshop or
Safari) the Dock crashes. I have reproduced this three time -- the first time,
the dock and the finder restarted (though Firefox wa fine), but quickly became
unstable, along with every other program I wa running, forcing me to force quit
them and restart. (I couldn't even open the activity monitor or terminal!) The
second time, neither the Dock nor the Finder were able to restart -- they both
hung, along with every other program and the Force Quit dialog. I wa forced to
HARD reset my computer. The third time (just now, dragging an image to Safari),
the Dock and Finder both crashed, but immediately restarted, and my system ha
not become unstable a of yet (though I rather expect it to.)

I am using 10.4.2, and a clean Firefox install (i.e., new profile, though I did
install a bunch of extensions: Adblock, Web Developer, downTHEMall, Session
Saver .2, Duplicate Tab, Link Toolbar, Favicon Picker, and ChromEdit.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Photoshop or Safari open on the dock.
2. Navigate to a web page containing a draggable image (i.e., not an image
background.)
3. Drag the image onto the Safari (or Photoshop) icon on the dock.

Actual Results:
The image doesn't open; program and system process start crashing like dominoes.

Expected Results:
A cached copy of the image should have been opened in the target program.

I am using Gerich's Grapple Classic Pro theme. I am attaching the crash log that
the Dock printed to the Console. (If other log are needed, please ask and I'll
find them. Sorry, I'm new at bug reporting.)
