When adding a new printer in the CUPS 1.3.8 web interface over SSL, after selecting a printer make and clicking "Add Printer," the page will hang. The page should load a list of all known printer driver for that make. According to the CUPS logs, the cups-driverd successfully obtains the list and return with exit status 0, so CUPS seems to work fine.

This problem doe not exist for Konqueror or IE7, and is reproducible for Windows XP Firefox 3.0.1 a well.

I know this might be something the CUPS guy need to know about, but I figure I'd let you know.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://your.cups.server.com:631/admin
2. Choose "Add printer"
3. Name it.
4. Set it's socket path
5. Select a make, and click "Add printer" and watch it hang.
Actual Results:
Progress indicator spun for the timeout period (set to 300 second on my server), and then returned a blank white page.

Expected Results:
Displayed a list of all known printer driver for that Make, and allowed a user to select a single value, and choose "Add Printer"
