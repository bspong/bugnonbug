The browser correctly open plain/text file in it window when the file doe not contain any particular text-enhancing code (for instance mIRC colour code and such). However, when the plain/text file contains code (like bold, underlined, colours), the browser display the download window and systematically asks the user to choose between opening the file in an external application or to download it in a folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two file : One with colour/bold/underline code (example : with mIRC or any other software able to integrate such codes), and another just with raw text.
2. Save them (make sure the colour code are present in the test file)
3. Upload them on a server.
4. Open the text file not containing colour code : it display normally in the browser.
5. Open the text file containing colour codes, it open the download/open window systematically.
Actual Results:
The result is systematically the same : plain/text file with code fail to display in the browser window, whereas "normal" file open normally.

Expected Results:
The software should simply open the text file regardless of colour code in it, even if it were to display missing spaces, or "wrong" UTF codes.

The browser doe not crash.
