A popup spawned from Toolbar/Bookmark Toolbar should disappear when clicked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move the mouse cursor onto an item in Bookmark Toolbar (Bookmark Toolbar is
preferable to Toolbar a when you move the cursor out it's likely to focus other
Toolbar item when you spawn a popup from a Toolbar item)
2. A popup appears
3. Move the mouse cursor down onto the popup without touching other Toolbar item
4. Click the popup
Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
The popup should disappear.

You have to click the main area of the browser window or focus other Toolbar
item to kill the popup. IMO once the mouse cursor move out of the Toolbar item
that spawned the popup, the popup should be killed automatically after a few
seconds, but it's sticky even when you move the window by dragging the title
bar. I'd like to submit this sticky behaviour a a bug, normal or enhancement,
but not sure it's the design or not.
