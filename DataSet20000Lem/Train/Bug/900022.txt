After double clicking Firefox icon on desk top, Firefox not opening if I then immediately open or work with another application
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

Have just fired-up laptop and had Outlook and Windows Explorer open. I double clicked the Firefox icon on the desktop and then, a it take a while to load up, immediately went to open some document from Explorer. Firefox doesn't load. Went to Start button and selected Firefox from there but it still wouldn't load. In both case the hourglass appears for about 5 sec then stops. To open Firefox, I had to restart laptop, open Outlook and Windows Explorer and then open Firefox before I work with any other application (I could poen Firefox first but don't always use it and I like Outlook and Windows Explorer a the first 2 button on my task bar a they are in use from opening to closing laptop). This ha happened about three time in the last week or so and never previously (have been using Firefox for several years).

Am using Firefox 22.0 under Windows XP HE 2002 SP3. Using Office 2003.
I have not loaded any new s/w to the laptop in this time although there may have been some Microsoft, Norton, Firefox, Samsung update happening in the backgound during this time.


Actual results:

Nothing. Firefox doesn't open unless I reboot laptop and then do nothing between double clicking Firefox icon and Firefox opening.


Expected results:

Firefox should have opened first time (which is what it wa doing up until about a week ago)
