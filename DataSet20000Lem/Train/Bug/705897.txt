Releasing left mouse button on button/menus in Firefox button doesn't activate them

Steps to reproduce:

Recently (for some reason), I have become used to opening the item of menu by clicking on a menu, holding down the mouse button and releasing the mouse button on the item in the menu that I want.

I tried to open item in the menu in the menu bar and the preference (and 'help' etc.) button/menu combo (I do not know the correct terminology) by using this method. (These are the button in the 'Firefox' menu button (the one that appears when the menu bar is hidden) that act a both a button (by clicking) and a menu (by hovering))


Actual results:

In all the menu in the menu bar, this method of opening item seems to work on all the menus' items, a it should in menu everywhere. Upon releasing the left mouse button on the preference button/menu combo, nothing happened. The same thing happened on the combo 'New tab', 'Print', 'Bookmarks', 'History' and 'Help'. It also happened on the 'Cut', 'Copy' and 'Paste' buttons. Releasing the left mouse button on the item in the submenu that are produced upon hovering over the combo worked a they should.


Expected results:

Releasing the mouse button on the combo should activate the appropriate response, for consistency with all item in menu that aren't only submenus. It should not have to be press-and-release.
