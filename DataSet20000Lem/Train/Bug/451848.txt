I can't get this new firefox to open standard a linkpage from a website in the same window (being a new "tabblad" - sorry, that's the dutch name for it). Preferences doesn't do it, the only way is everytime again and again: rightclick mousemenu+t. That's cumbersome.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a website
2. open a link on the website

Actual Results:
It open always in a new or another window, despite of preference to open in the same window (from the option menu). Sometimes if there are already window open, it even open behind te current window, the only workaround is to open a link everytime by rightmouseclick+t.

Expected Results:
If I indicate in the option menu that I want to open it a a "new tabblad" (dutch) I do expect that a left mouseclick on a link ha the same result a rightmousclick+t. Just a I wa used to get with Firefox 2.
