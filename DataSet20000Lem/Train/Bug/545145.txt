After filling a form and pressing back 4 or more time i will no longer be logged in (bc i logged out ealier). Thus a missing form so i cant comment. However i logged in again before or after i hit back i can refresh the page which will bring back my log in information and comment.

I expected my login information to be the way it wa no matter if i logged in or not. Not a big deal tho.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in
2. Visit page and write comment
3. Log out of page (i use middle button to do it in another tab)
4. Go 3 (better 4) page further and log in. I logged in incorrectly for this.
5. Hit back until on original page with login and comment. You'll see your not logged in and no form (thus no comment).
6. Since login ha occurred in step 4, hit refresh. I am logged in again and what i wrote in the form is back. But why wa i logged out?

No a big deal.
6.
Actual Results:
Was no logged in, possibly be a few page ago i wa not logged in.

Expected Results:
The page be the way it originally was, me being logged in. Not a big deal.
