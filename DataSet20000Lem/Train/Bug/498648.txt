There seems to be a problem where starting private browsing while an edit box is open and canceling the navigate-away retains the page. This may apply only to those like Yahoo mail with Javascript that check for this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start composing an email in a Yahoo! email account. Don't finish.
2. Start private browsing.
3. Either Firefox or Yahoo's javascript pop up an alert asking you if you're sure you want to navigate away from the page.
4. Click "no"
5. The alert appears again, which is odd.
6. Click "no"
7. You seem to enter private browsing, but the Yahoo tab is still open.



Expected Results:
I expect that either this should cancel private browsing entirely until the problem is properly resolved, or that the state of the editing should be saved by Firefox so that it can be restored when private browsing is exited.

I'm not a security expert, but I'm wondering if this couldn't cause security problems. Javascript (secretly) prevents private browsing from becoming fully private and monitor what you do.
