When trying to submit a html-form with target to an iframe-name it will not work!

This is the sample code:
<form name="f" id="f" accept-charset="UTF8" method="post" target="result" action="transliteration">
input type="hidden" name="command" id="command" value="monitor"></input>
<input type="submit" name="absenden" id="absenden" value="refresh" ></input>
</form>

<iframe name="result" id="result" scrolling="auto" src="" style="width: 400px; margin: 5px;">
<p>You no have iframes</p>
</iframe>

The response should show in the iframe, but it is displayed in the same window overwriting the actual page.

But if I change the attribute "name" of the iframe to uppercase "NAME" it will work.
<iframe NAME="result" ...

This is really odd. I don't remember I ever had this problem in other browser or in older firefoxes, but may they were not installed on linux...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. copy above example and execute towrds a servlet that return repsonse
2. it wont work
3. change the attribute name to NAME in tag iframe and it will work
Actual Results:
Response is not shown in iframe but in web-brwoser replacing original content

Expected Results:
Reponse should be displayed in (form-targeted) iframe.

A lot of webpage rely on the target attribute in the <form> element. That the attribute name of the iframe can not be found is a major show-stopper for these applications.
