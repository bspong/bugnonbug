Dragging a bookmark from the bookmark bar to the bookmark manager window's right pane add the bookmark to the list control twice. Refreshing the pane (by, for example, clicking on another folder in the tree to the left, and then back in to the folder you were previously viewing) display properly only one of your newly-moved bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a bookmark on the bookmark bar.
2.Open the bookmark manager window. (Bookmarks->Show All Bookmarks...)
3.Drag the newly-created bookmark in to the right pane view of the bookmark manager window.
Actual Results:
The bookmark will be displayed in the right-hand list twice.

Expected Results:
The bookmark should be displayed in the right-hand list exactly once.

At random guess, perhaps an event to append the item to the list control is being fired not only when a bookmark is added to that folder, but also when a bookmark is dropped in to the window...???...

Apologies if I have filled anything out unconventionally, or failed to notice this bug in any of the existing lists. This is my first bugzilla post.
