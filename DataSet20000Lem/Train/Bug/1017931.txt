Allow about:accounts to be used before Sync is configured for FxA
Currently about:accounts is blank if Sync is not configured for FxA - the intent being to not show the ability to login to FxA if Sync is already configured for a legacy account.

This will need to be tweaked for the migration process - it will be necessary for the user to perform an FxA login *before* we have reset Sync - ie, during the migration process there will be a period where Sync is still configured with the legacy account and the user must be logged in to FxA so the migration can complete.

On one hand, it might be reasonable to assume that this state implies the user ha opted to upgrade their sync account - however, we will also need to take into account the user might type about:accounts into the URL bar.

Blocking the UX breakdown to determine how about:accounts should change to reflect these states. A straw man:

1) about:accounts check (a pref?) to see if a migration is in progress. If so, just allow it a normal.
2) If no migration is in place, it could serve a an entry-point to the migration process (ie, offer to migrate with a button to start the migration process. Clicking this button would end up setting that pref and starting the migration process, meaning when about:accounts is re-displayed a part of the migration, it act a in (1)
