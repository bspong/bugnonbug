With the release of 3.0.6 I can no longer access my GMX email account. I have t use IE7 (uge)

Using GMX email (web mail) account ha worked well up until this release (3.0.6). The initial url open just fine but when I go to log into my account the page just sits at the intermediate screen never completing the loading of my mail page.

Fr the duration I have had to turn to IE7 (which I don't like) in order to get my mail for this account. As this is my primary account I find this more then a bit inconvenient. The previous release, 3.0.5, worked OK. Is there any way I can back up to this release from 3.0.6?

Thank you very much, I do love FireFox, it is the best of the bunch.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into GMX.com.
2. try to log into your account.
3. there I will sit for ever with nothing going on except an indication that the page is loading. I don't know if the page will ever time out. I haven't tried to out wait it.
Actual Results:
See step 3.

Expected Results:
The proggi should have logged in and collected my new mail.

I have not tried to open a new account using a different name etc.

I have only a few add-on in use in my copy of FireFox.
These are: Weather Bug, Java quick start and update notifier.
