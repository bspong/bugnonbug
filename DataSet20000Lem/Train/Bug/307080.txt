Use mouse dragging to select an area containing text and a png graphic in the
middle. Copy it and paste into Microsoft Word (I'm using Word 2002). The png
graphic is corrupted.

The problem doe not occur if only the graphic is copied via a right-click and
selecting "Copy Image".

The problem doe not occur with jpeg or gif files. It seems limited to png's only.

A colleague did a similar thing on linux into some word-equivalent, and it
pasted without corruption.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a webpage with a png graphic surrounded by text. Select an area of text
which includes the graphic by mouse dragging.
2. Select "Copy" either from context menu or Edit menu. Don't choose "Copy Image".
3. Paste in Microsoft Word.

Actual Results:
The text pasted correctly. The png graphic is corrupted.

Expected Results:
The png graphic should be correctly pasted without corruption.

Not sure whether this is Firefox specific or Mozilla specific. Seems like an
interaction with Word or Window's support for png's.
