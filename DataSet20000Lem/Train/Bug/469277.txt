I use Firefox regularily. When I try to use networking site called orkut, firefox crashes. Also when I try to go to any user profile in Orkut, it crashes. When I start firefox agian, I get option of restart previous session and start new sessions. Other site work fine.
Same problem is happening on two different systems. I have Windows XP SP2 a OS. But on few other computers, thing work ok.

I tried using Firefox 2.0.0.18 and 3.0 versions. I also tried it on 3.0.0.4 version of Firefox. Result same for those PCs. There is something wrong with firefox only. So many other application work nicely without any problems.

So many time I used Windows send report option after crash. It would be helpful if you can help me please solve this problem.

In case you need any more help or you need technical detail of bug, please let me know. I would be happy to report those. But please I want this to be solved asap.
