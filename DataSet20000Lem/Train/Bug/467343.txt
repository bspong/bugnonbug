When I include &crarr; in a line of character (inside a table) the line take up 3 lines. (&hArr; also us multiple lines) If I remove the symbol the line only take up a single line in the display.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
View sample HTML below. Row 1 is single height. Rows 2 and 3 are double height. The only difference is the presence of &crarr; and &hArr; in the second and third lines, replacing the &Delta; in the first line.

<html>
</body>
<table border=1>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>&uarr; &darr; &Delta; &larr; &rarr;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>&uarr; &darr; &crarr; &larr; &rarr;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>&uarr; &darr; &hArr; &larr; &rarr;</td>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>

Actual Results:
The second and third line take up 3 vertical line of space in the display

Expected Results:
The second and third line should only have taken up a single line of vertical space in the display
