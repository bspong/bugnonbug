I have had Leak Monitor 0.3.6 addon installed for over a month without it complaining of leaks. This morning FF received an update. FF applied the update and I restarted FF. Now every time I close a firefox window, Leak Monitor raise the following "Leak Alert":

Leaks in window 0xbd76d60:
[+] [leaked object] (bd78a48) = [Object]
[+] observe (bd78a40, chrome://safe/content/framework.js, 2379-2397) = [Function]
[ ] prototype (205a278) = [Object]


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Leak Monitor addon version 0.3.6 (or latest)
2. Open 2 Firefox windows.
3. Close one window.



I created a new FF profile and installed only the Leak Monitor addon (ie to insure there were no other addons potentially affecting the performance). In this configuration, Leak Monitor still display the leak alert after any browser window is closed. This alert is NOT raise when closing an open tab.
