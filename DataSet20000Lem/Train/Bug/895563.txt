IMHO there is a lot of vertical space in the top area of Firefox. While Australis finally brings tabs-in-titlebar (at least on Mac), there is still room for improvement.

Specifically, I propose to shrink (vertically)

a) the gap above tabs: The current space is about a wide a the space between a tab title and the top border, however I don't think it's necessary to use such a wide gap here. See the attachment (top area) where I reduced the gap to 4px, so 5px less, and it still doe not look unbalanced! If you are worried about the user not being able to move the window around, there's enough space to the left and right (where the window and fullscreen button are) on which a user can click to drag the window around (the current clickable spacing of about 5px is not really helpful anyway).

b) the spacing inside the #nav-bar: I reduced it to 3px (was: 4px) for both padding-top and padding-bottom in the lower half of the attachment.

c) the size of a tab. This is probably the most controversal one (at least towards the UI people). I think we can gain at least 1px or 2px in the spacing both above and below the tab title. (I did not manage to produce a prototype because I could not find the "culprit" for the vertical spacing inside the tab element, neither a padding, margin, nor height property.)

Adding this all up, we can easily shrink the top bar by 7px to 11px(!). In the hunt for reducing chrome area, this is a big win! I'm happy with any small gain we can agree on, but the current vertical size of the top area in Firefox is just too much.
