File name dialog disappears behind Firefox when downloading a file

Left-click on a link to a file to download (ie - a zip or EXE), the "Opening <file>" dialog show fine.

Then click the "Save file" button, the file-browsing dialog for "Enter name of file to save to" flash briefly on screen (less than a second), then disappears behind the main Firefox window. Using Alt+Tab will bring the file-browsing dialog back to the front (it's always the first window in the Alt+Tab list).

I noticed this quirk in both FF 3.5 and 3.5.1 on Windows 2000, a well a FF 3.5.1 on Windows 2003 Server.

This quirk doe not happen when right-clicking the link for the file and choosing "Save Link As". When right-clicking the link, the "Enter name of file to save to" dialog display normally and doesn't get sent to the back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Left click a link to a downloadable file
2.Click "Save File" button in the "Opening <file>" dialog
3.Watch the file browsing window appear, then vanish
Actual Results:
The window wa behind the main Firefox window.

Expected Results:
The window should have been in the front.
