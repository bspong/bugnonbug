In Firefox 3 RC2, while viewing hotmail, the separation between "From" and "Subject" line is far to the right.

In Firefox 3 RC2, while viewing hotmail, the separation between "From" and "Subject" line is far to the right. This is unaffected by font size.
In other words, it seems a though the table containing the email subject and date is not sizing correctly.
There are long name in the "From" fields, and they are not text wrapping, however all "subjects" are text wrapping.

For example (hopefully my formatting stays):
From Subject Date Size

This is a very long description in the from field. Now the Today 5kb
subject
get all
scrunched
up.

I believe this is different from bug 419728, where it seems to be talking about Firefox 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to hotmail
2.Have an email with a very long description in the "From" field in an email
3.Click folder containing that email.
Actual Results:
See above

Expected Results:
Possibly text wrap or annotate the from field.

I didn't notice this in Firefox 2. I logged in to hotmail, and the message with the long "From" field have been there for weeks.
I don't believe this is a big problem, but the underlying cause may be interesting to developers.
