Clicking on button to close/confirm dialog box take 5-10 second for them to
actually close. The button still "clicks" after the first time.

Apparently related issue: Scrolling via the mouse wheel or keyboard work fine
once per web page, then doe the same a above. Takes 5-10 seconds, then
performs it action. If you throw more movement in while it's waiting, it will
do all at once, though it doesn't seem to affect the time it takes. Very jerky
a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any dialog box. (About will work.)
2. Click close.
3. Sit for 5-10 second while it make up it bloody mind.

1. Scroll with keyboard.
2. Scroll again.
3. Sit and wait.

Actual Results:
Dialog closed, eventually, but after a much longer wait than normal. Or screen
scrolled.

Expected Results:
Closed immediately.

Right now, I'm only sure this is happening with Win2k Advanced Server. I only
used this build for a few minute in Professional, so I can't remember if any of
this occured.
