With Firefox 1.x (or MS Explorer) you can browse through help project created by Robohelp without problems. You can select several item in the content tree and then move backward and forward through these different help item at your will. This is broken since Firefox 1.5.x. The navigation toolbuttons are simply not accessible. They are plain grey. Keyboard shortcut ALT-<Arrow left> is not working too. This is really bad, since Robohelp project can be found quite often and it force user not to use Firefox! This problem happens almost everytime (>99%), but I have seen very seldom circumstances, where the navigation toolbars are working (<1%)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start a new Firefox session
2. Open a new tab with ALT-T
3. Open the Help project at the URL above http://www.basis.com/onlinedocs/documentation/index.htm
4. Select a new help topic (eg. Contact Basis)
5. You should see that the Navigate Back Toolbutton is still grey

Actual Results:
The navigate Back button is grey, though I selected a new HTML page.

Expected Results:
The navigate Back Button should be green. Firefox 1.5.04 should allow to simply go back to the previosly displayed HTML page.
