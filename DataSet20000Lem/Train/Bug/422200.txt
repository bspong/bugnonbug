Problem summary:
1. "Start new session" button ha same effect a "Restore previous session"
2. Tab history is not cleared - always the same set of tab are re-loaded at startup

Problem details:
When re-starting Firefox, the pop-up dialog to choose between starting a new session or restoring the set of tab from the last session. Pressing either button ha the same effect of re-loading the set of tab in the last session.
Also, if I right-click on a tab and choose "Close other tabs," all but the current tab are closed (as expected). Next, exit out of Firefox; re-launch Firefox; select "Start new session"; and the same set of tab from old session will still be re-loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open many tab
2.Exit from Firefox
3.Start Firefox
4.Choose start new session
5.Old tab still re-loaded
Actual Results:
Old tab still re-loaded

Expected Results:
Single tab pointing to default home URL.

This just started to happen in the last few days.
There must be some configuration data that Firefox is not able to clear.

I un-installed Firefox (2.0.0.12) and re-install the same 2.0.0.12, but the result are the same. The set of old tab survives the un-install and re-install.
