Slow (Frameskipping) text typing starting from version 13
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/31.0.1650.57 Safari/537.36 OPR/18.0.1284.49

Steps to reproduce:

Download or compile version Firefox 12. Start rapidly Typing a text in some field (just press "f" key with the lowest key pressing delay. Watch a it typing smoothly and synchronisly in almost any text field...
You can Simply add to registry (to work with fastest delay):
REGEDIT4

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\Keyboard Response]
"AutoRepeatDelay"="150"
"AutoRepeatRate"="7"
"Flags"="59"

Then... Download or compile version Firefox 13. Do the same - Start rapidly Typing a text in some field. Watch a it typing breakably and frameskipping almost every key EVEN on a simplest text field...



Actual results:

Starting from Firefox 13, there is made some code fail in text processing module.
Firefox 12 work good enough and no such frameskipping slowdowns.
The result - All the latest version have this bug and frameskipping of text typing. (From 13-27 now)
I compared the files. The difference wa made not so big (5 days)... But, new version gone to > msvcp100.dll. Version 12 wa on msvcp80.dll. Maybe difference is there. Can you recompile and detect the problem between this two source (12.0 and 13.beta1).


Expected results:

The text must be entered smoothly and without big delays.
