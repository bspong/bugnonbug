Loading a Java Class fails in an extension (used to work in FF 3.x)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.19.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.3 Safari/533.19.4

Extensions that elevate JAR policy using LiveConnect fail in Firefox 4. They used to work in Firefox 3.x. The exception is thrown when the class is loaded saying class not found. If you try to load the class without the elevated permissions, the class can be found. This break our extension and will break many other extension too. I have created a very small test extension that demonstrates the problem. See step to reproduce below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the test extension from http://dl.dropbox.com/u/18722922/fireaxe2.xpi
2. Install the extension
3. Go to Tools->Error Console to see the exception printout (Error: LiveConnectUtils policyAdd error: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: edu.mit.simile.javaFirefoxExtensionUtils.URLSetPolicy
Source File: chrome://worldspace/content/worldspace/LiveConnectUtils.js
Line: 92)
Actual Results:
Extension fails to function

Expected Results:
Extension function

I have created the extension using the minimally required code from http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Java_Firefox_Extension and the URLSetPolicy.java class from http://simile.mit.edu/repository/java-firefox-extension/tools/
