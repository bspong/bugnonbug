Using the Bookmarks -> Favorites Converter -> Export command, a folder on the
local system wa selected rather than a FF favorite folder. This wa accepted
the first time and new Bookmarks do still get exported there regularly. However,
when both attempting to use the Export command and on every exit of the FF
application, get the following two error messages:

1. Alert
Canceled cleaning up because the selected folder is not one of the Favorites
folders.

Clicking 'Ok' on this alert then brings up the following:
2. Alert
[Exception… “Component returned failure code: 0x80520011
(NS_ERROR_FILE_NAME_TOO_LONG) [nsIFileOutputStream.init]” nsresult: “0x80520011
(NS_ERROR_FILE_NAME_TOO_LONG)” location: “JS frame ::
chrome://booktofav/content/booktofav.js :: anonymous :: line 113” data: no]

In spite of re-install of FF version 1.0.1 and then subsequent upgrade to 1.0.2
and 1.0.3, the problem persists. During re-install or upgrade I have not however
deleted the profile.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Bookmarks -> Favorites Converter -> Export
2. Enter a folder and filename other than a FF favorite folder. Folder name wa
set a 'Firefox bookmarks' including white space between the two word
3. Click ok.
Any attempt to select Bookmarks -> Favorites Converter -> Export or exit the
application now re-produces the above error

Actual Results:
Accepted the folder and filename but then alerted that filename too long

Expected Results:
Accepted the folder and filename specified or warned that file name is too long
but let the user modify it. There is now no way to modify so the error persists
