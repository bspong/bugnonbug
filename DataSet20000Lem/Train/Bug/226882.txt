lock up system on startup

I have had Firebird and Mozilla 1.4 both occasionally lock up my system (Mac OS
10.3.1) during startup of the browser. Normally Firebird and Mozilla start in a
somewhat straining way a if something in Firebird is conflicting with the Mac
OS. When the system lock up, the mouse pointer can move around, but clicking
or trying to force quit doe nothing, so maybe it overloading the kernel on
startup. One time it happened a day after a system boot, the other time it
happened after the system had been running stable for about 3 or 4 weeks.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firebird or Mozilla App Suite
2.System lock during loading
3.

Actual Results:
System lock sometimes, otherwise the system seems excessively strained with
both Mozilla and Firebird.

Expected Results:
After loading Firebird/Mozilla it should open normally without strain.

I am using the default pinstripe theme in Firebird. In Mozilla I am using the
Classic netscape theme.
