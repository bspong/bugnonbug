RelNote incorrect: 3.0 RC1 installation will overwrite 2.0 on Windows
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008051206 Firefox/3.0

The release note for Firefox 3.0 RC1 include the following statements:
"Please note that installing Firefox 3 will overwrite your existing installation of Firefox on Mac OS X and Linux. On Windows, Firefox 3 installs in a new folder."

This wa not my experience in Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit SP1. I had already installed Firefox 2.0.0.14, and it ha been running with no issues. When I installed Firefox 3.0 RC1, the default folder that wa suggested in the installation folder apparently wa the same folder a Firefox 2.0. I wa not paying attention, though, so I accepted the suggested folder.

After installation, I found that there wa only Firefox 3.0 RC1 on my system. Firefox 2.0 had been overwritten.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 2.0 to suggested folder: Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox.
2. Install Firefox 3.0 to suggested folder: Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox.
3. Try to run Firefox 2.0.
Actual Results:
Can't run Firefox 2.0 any longer.

Expected Results:
Should be able to run both Firefox version 2.0 and new version 3.0 RC1.

Please consider having 3.0 installer suggest a different installation folder if the user is running Windows Vista 64-bit, and ha already installed Firefox 2.0.
