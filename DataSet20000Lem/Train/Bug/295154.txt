While using FireFox I encountered a non-critical bug. I am using Win Home XP sp2
and this bug involves the tabbed browsing system. Once I middle click a link and
open a new tab the scroll icon appears at the top of the window on the divider
between the tab and the web page. The only way I have found to get rid of it is
to close all tab to return to a by-window-browsing but the artifact of the
scroll icon still exists on the screen above all content. The only way to remove
that is to place the mouse cursor over the artifact and middle click refreshing
the scroll cursor over the artifact.

The scroll icon only appears over the second tab. I can open new tab and
continue browsing normally with this problem but while tab are open it
impossible to remove the scroll icon over the second tab. While browsing the web
page it distracting to see two scroll icon on the screen at once and threw my
own forced habit I constantly try to remove the problem while I’m browsing.

I hope this report help to improve FireFox, it’s my favorite browser and I plan
on using it even if serious should arise. Thanks for taking this report and
thank you for making a top-notch browser!
