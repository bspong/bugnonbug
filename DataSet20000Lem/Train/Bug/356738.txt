The "Report Broken Web Site..." confirmation page display the descriptive text (the "Description" field) all bunched up with line break and whitespace all reduced to a single space. It is not converting plain text to HTML properly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select "Help" -> "Report Broken Web Site...".
2. Fill in a report. In the "Describe Problem" field, include line breaks, such a two paragraph separated by a blank line to make the bug nice and clear.
3. Select "Submit Report". Either make sure the report is a real one that you want to submit, or arrange for the report to submitted a a test only (if you know how to do that; I don't).

Actual Results:
In the "Description" field on the confirmation page, the line break are all rendered a single space characters. (Possibly other text-to-HTML conversion error too.)

Expected Results:
The text should be presented properly, with paragraph break intact.
