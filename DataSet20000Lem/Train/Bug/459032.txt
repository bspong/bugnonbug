behavior differ if some other app running while browsing form method post page message

Mac o X 10.4.11 6gb ram 2x G5 computer.

for me it is a productivity problem (it slows me down) but it can mean a greater security issue of inter-application forbidden impact.

It happen when i browse in page from form to form, and those form use past-data. (html 4.01 apache 1.3 php 5 postgres 8 )

Bug is when i am asked to repost form data where i shouldn't.
If i repost form data, it lead to a slow complete reload of the page when i hit the back button.

No bug is when i hit the back button and the page is a fast cached one.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.keep activity monitor running while using firefox 303
2.browse page all resulting from post data of form
3.hit BACK button once


Actual Results:
a message is shown asking to repost form data (bug)

Expected Results:
expected behavior is to have a fast back from cache

reproduce step 2 and 3 without running anything in the background while using firefox 303
= bug gone

I think this bug may have critical root since theorically two running application in mac o x should have little or no impact on eachother.

list of application that seem to affect firefox :

Activity monitor.app (APPLE)
BoincManager.app (seti@home process, not the manager itself)
Console.app (APPLE)

i think safari ha the same problem, affected by same apps.

other apps like Mail.app or iTunes.app DO NOT make firefox have this behavior.

I don't know if this bug is a severe security breach or a normal bug.
