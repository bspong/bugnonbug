Firefox hang on URL after updating from 3.0.10 to 3.0.11
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11

The referenced url is loaded forever on SOME PCs after updating to 3.0.0.11 and a a result firefox hangs. So far I wa nt able to identify why it work on some pc running 3.0.0.11 and on others not.
URL is running on different version of ie, safari, google chrome and so far on every firefox version. 3.0.0.11 is the first version which make trouble.

URL embeds a java applet, which is dynamically added to the dom via the official deployJava.js javascript library.
In a wireshark trace I cannot even see a call to load the applet jar file, which seems to indicate that the "hang" is happening before actually loading the applet.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the browser
2. Go to http://www.highstone.de/speedchecker/speedchecker.html

Hang happens every time on an effected pc.
In my office there a four people and 2 have the issue.
Actual Results:
Firefox hang and need to be killed.

Expected Results:
Firefox 3.0.0.11 load the url a any other version before.

After downgrading to 3.0.0.10 the problem wa solved.
Another try to install 3.0.0.11 generated the same result.
