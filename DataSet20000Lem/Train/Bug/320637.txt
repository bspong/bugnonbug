When I selected the following item (hyperlink) on the page (URL above):

Joss Whedon Interview
IESB Interview with Joss From Wizard World

the browser wa sent to the corresponding page on the IESB website,
(http://themoviereporter.com/movies2/josswhedonwwint.php) then it displayed an error message stating "The plug-in performed an illegal operation You are strongly advised to restart Firefox."







Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://browncoats.serenitymovie.com/serenity/index.html?fuseaction=tools.av
2.Select the IESB interview with Joss Whedon
3.You will be transferred to: http://themoviereporter.com/movies2/josswhedonwwint.php)




Actual Results:
The error-message box always popped-up within a few second after arrival at the page. It explicitly begin with "Windows Media Player Plug-in Dynamic Link Library" followed by the statement that I wrote above. Nothing happens after that, WRT the IESB website. After two attempt to access the interview, I decided that re-starting Firefox after a third attempt would not likely change the outcome. I didn't have any problem accessing any of the other item on the Browncoats website page. There wasn't anything that I wanted to access on the IESB website page that wa displayed.



Expected Results:
Access to the interview, of course -- probably a video interview that would be played by Windows Media Player (I run version 10).

AFAIK, the Quality Agent apparently did not detect any problem and did not initiate a report.
