Prefetch download is not canceled, when source tab is closed
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20150320202338

Steps to reproduce:

1.) Start Firefox and open at least two tab
2.) Click at download link of some big file (from data sharing server for example)
3.) Dialog with choice "OPEN or DOWNLOAD" will be shown
(at this time download begin - prefetching to temporary directory)




Actual results:

1.) If user click on button "OK" of this dialog, download succesfully continues and file is downloaded to standard target directory -> thats OK
2.) If user click on button "CANCEL" of the dialog, download is correctly interrupted and temporary file is deleted -> thats OK too
but...
If user close the tab from which the download wa initiated and click on button "OK" at dialog, dialog disappears, at download manager is not any active downloading shown, but downloading of file CONTINUES at the background until the entire file were downloaded. File (with random name) stay in temporary directory (on XP at "C:\Documents And Settings\[Account name]\Local Settings\Temp") even after the Firefox ends. This can bee a problem for many user I think (slowing down the Internet connection, wasting disk space)...


Expected results:

If user close the tab, from which the download wa initiated and next click at OK button, download of the file should maybe continue (classically in download manager).
