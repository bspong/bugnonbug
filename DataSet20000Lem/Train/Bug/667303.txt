Every since FF4.0, then 4.01 and now FF5.0, the frequency of crashing ha increased. All but 2 of the session restore ha bee successful. But this is taking too much time and data loss is critical. Mozilla may be moving too fast with updates. Some site accessing is also slower. The file created in about:crashes show the same result which state that the cause is unknown. Are tere setting in about:config that have to be changed, reset, etc.?...
I have also seen case where FF freezes, screen fade and FF is unresponsive. Sometimes after a few minute it go through okay and sometimes I have to go into task manager and shut it down. When go back in, all site are lost

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just accessing a website. There is no consistent cause.
2. Happening at least twice weekly and increasing since FF3.6.XX
3. Accessing URLs for shutdown and freezing.

Actual Results:
FF attempt to restart and recover loaded tabs. Fortunately, most of the time it works.

Expected Results:
I expect normal operation a in 3.6.XX. I never had any problem with freezing/non-responsive or crashing prior to FF4.0. (Use sine FF1.0)
