I'm not sure where to send this request, and the feature might even already exist, but (1)I can't find it, (2)I want a reply (so suggestion won't do), (3)I may be interested in doing the work myself, but will want some advice about how to go about it.
The idea is that for debugging or figuring out what a server is doing, it would be useful for the browser to record a transcript of it communication, including multiple tcp streams. This could sort of be done by a packet sniffer except that it can't deal with encryption, so of course I'd like to tap into the decrypted streams.
So the first question: doe this already exist? If so, how do I use it?
If not, is it the sort of thing that you are likely to do soon? And if not, can you offer advice for me if I want to try to do it myself?
And if I send such a facility, do you think you're likely to add it to the code base?
