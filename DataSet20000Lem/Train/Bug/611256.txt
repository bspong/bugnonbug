I have on various occasion tried to access link via the awesome bar that I had visited month before that no longer showed up in my history because it remove link after a few months. This is slightly annoying and the fix would have been for me to bookmark those links. However, I find I rarely bookmark stuff now that I have the awesome bar.

A solution could be for Firefox to automatically bookmark link I frequently access, thus keeping them available for auto completion via the awesome bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a wiki page a few time (wikis are where the awesome bar is truly amazing)
2. A few month later, after the wiki link ha been removed from the history, try to type the page title or wikiword in the awesome bar

Actual Results:
The link no longer appears for autocompletion

Expected Results:
The link wa automatically bookmarked and now show up again for autocompletion

It is probably a good idea to make the threshold for auto bookmarking configurable. E.g. 10 seems like a reasonable number.

Additionally, there probably need to be some bookmark management features, like a separate folder for automatically created bookmark + the option to remove all of them or move them to regular bookmarks.

Finally, this of course need to be inactive during private browsing
