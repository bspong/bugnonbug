My girlfriend recently got herself a shiny new MacBook Pro, and installed Firefox, a that’s her browser of preference. She kept having a problem that her tab would not be saved when she closed Firefox, and asked me to look into it.

All the setting under Preferences were OK, so the problem wa not with the settings. Likewise, the relevant setting under about:config were set correctly. We tried deleting prefs.js, but that didn’t help either.

Then, a a last-ditch attempt, I tried closing Firefox using the option on the menu bar. I then got the beloved question “Do you want Firefox to save your tabs”. I clicked yes, then restarted Firefox. All the tab were reloaded. I then used the red X in the upper right-hand corner, the opened Firefox, and the tab were not reloaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Open several tab
3.Use the red "X" to close Firefox
Actual Results:
Tabs are not saved, dialog box asking whether to save tab is not displayed

Expected Results:
Dialog box asking to save the tab should appear, Firefox should save the tab

I'm not reporting the problem from her computer, will return with full build info.

Bug found and confirmed in version 3.5.7 and 3.6
