Firefox fails to import Seamonkey bookmark if "Saved Passwords" are imported
If a user save a password for a website in Seamonkey, importing bookmark into Firefox will fail if Firefox attempt to import the saved password.

1. Install and run Seamonkey from seamonkey-project.org.
2. Log into a website and save the password and cookie from it. (I used livejournal.com.)
2. Install Firefox 3.01 build and run it (if prompted to import on first run, decline).
3. Go to "File" -> "Import".
4. Select "Netscape 6, 7 or Mozilla 1.x" in the dialog and "Next".
5. Make sure that the checkboxes, "Cookies," "Saved Passwords," and "Bookmarks" are selected and select "Next" in the dialog.
6. Select "Finish" in the dialog.

Result: If the bookmark are examined in the Bookmarks menu, there is no folder titled "From Netscape 6/7/Mozilla" with Seamonkey bookmarks.
Expected Result: There should be a "From Netscape 6/7/Mozilla" folder in bookmark with Seamonkey bookmarks.

If step 2 through 6 are repeated but the checkbox for "Saved Passwords" is *not* checked, bookmark will appear in Firefox.

This wa seen in Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1pre) Gecko/2008062404 GranParadiso/3.0.1pre and using Seamonkey 1.1.9.
