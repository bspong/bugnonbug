While using the firefox binary package, I noticed that some small font have a spacing issue. I then went into about:config and changed the font.antialias.min value to some arbitrary value (say 7), and upon restarting the browser the problem is solved for the rest of the time that I am logged in. This problem doe not occur with the natively compiled version of firefox (64bit gentoo).

When I restart my computer and log back in at some point, I must redo this to obtain proper font in firefox bin.

In order to demonstrate the actual problem, I have taken before and after screenshots from two website that I have noticed displaying this problem.

It almost seems a if a different font face is chosen?

I have just realized after writing this that I have not tested the effect of logging out and back into GNOME on firefox so I will try that extensively later and report back.

Reproducible: Always

2. Visit one of the two listed website
3. Look for area with some small font
