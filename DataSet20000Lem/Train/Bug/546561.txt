I started noticing that every now and then, when I make a post at several online forum that once I hit the Send button, it will refresh the page and all of the text I have written is deleted.

So far I've found that copying my entire text before punching Send is a good safegaurd against this annoying quirk, a I can (usually) paste all, hit Send again, and it will finally go after the second or third time.

I also noticed that it seems more likely to act up when I have several tab open...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
It doesn't always act up on me, but generally this is what happens:
1. I type a bunch of text on a Reply or New Topic text box
2. I punch the send button
3. The page refreshes... or in some website it report back "No post mode specified"
4. I retype or paste my backup copy
5. I pun the send button again

If it doe not go through, I repeat 4 and 5 until it doe or get tired of it.
Actual Results:
It either 1. Takes me back to the Reply or New Topic page or 2. send my message through like nothing happened.

Expected Results:
It should've just gone through the first time I hit the Send button.

All of the forum I've been on and had this problem support HTML, BBL code, and PHP... or some mixture of those.
