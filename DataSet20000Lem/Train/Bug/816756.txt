Proof-of-concept: CodeMirror 2 a our source editor.

This bug is an experiment to see how well CodeMirror 2 stack up to Orion for our Source Editor needs. I understand that there were many hour spent on integrating Orion but I think it is worth it to do a comparison.

Attached patch is a proof-of-concept. Since SE wa nicely written with multiple editor in mind all I had to do is to write another SourceEditor object that can be enabled via the devtools.editor.component config.

I ported just enough method to make all Scratchpad test to pass. Other tool (style editor, debugger, etc.) will most likely fail simply because I didn't get around porting all method before creating this ticket. Will update the patch once I have more.

As you can see in source-editor-codemirror.jsm you don't really need to write lot of code to implement all the feature we need. Most method are two-three liners.

That said, we _will_ need to compare both editor on large minified (emscripten generated) scripts. When I wa profiling debugger for bug 757408 the main culprit wa our source editor.

Advantages:

* Only 3k line of code.
* Author (Marijn Haverbeke, CC'ed here) is a mozillian and is willing to personally help with integration.
* Has nice support for inline widget and marker ranges[1] which allows u to write thing like Irakli's interactivate[2] and other cool stuff.
* WebKit devs did a similar experiment and reported that CodeMirror's runtime footprint and file loading speed wa better than their old editor[3]. Of course, we will have to run our own benchmarks.
* (subjective) Source is easier to understand.

Disadvantages:

* Lots of hour spent on integrating Orion.
* Mihai and others are familiar with Orion code base.
* CodeMirror wa already considered in past but the team found that it lacked some features[4] (I couldn't find what feature specifically).
* + Add more in comments. My only experience with Orion so far wa in bug 737803 and bug 757408. See this comment[5] for some of Orion's limitations.
