-Since upgrading to the latest Firefox version 3.0.11, the saved ID and password file ha disappeared. It is empty!
- Every time a request for a fill in of E-mail and P/w appears, a request for the master password screen show up. It is unnecessary. Even when filled in, it merely returns. If I just close it [X], I can proceed without satifying the request.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to an old site that requires Log In. It is always empty.
Check of the ID and Password List: it is empty. Used to have many ID-P/W entry in previous version.
2. Anytime, E-mail address need to be filled in the
"Master password required " screen appears; always unnecessarily. Not needed.
3.
Actual Results:
No ID or P/W saved
Asks for mater password.

Expected Results:
Fill in Log In from saved list.
Use Master Password for logging into PC only.
