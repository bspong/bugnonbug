Firebird worked fine for about 2 weeks, then one day - couble clicked the exe,
saw the hourglass, and nothing happened. Tried again, nothing happened.
Did a delete and re-install, and worked fine. About a week later, same thing
happened. Did a DnR again, and lasted about 4 week before problem reoccurred
again. Delete and Reinstall of latest version fix the bug...
PC is otherwise stable.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install firebird
2. Run every day...
3. Use for an unpredictable amount of time... (weeks)

Actual Results:
Application didn't launch after double clicking on executable.

Expected Results:
Application should have launched

Wasn't using any particular theme - bug occurs with default theme.

No special configuration on the PC. Usually my Regional setting are UK or US,
but occasionally I have them set to Islandic, or Italian (Swiss). Changing
these never affected firebird.

Often open Internet Explorer for viewing certain filetypes (Mostly XML and XSL
-- Firebird is a bit weak for viewing such files... can't "View Source" and
launch it to Notepad for example). I sometimes have IE and Firebird open at the
same time.

Also sometimes have IntelliJ open at the same time. PC ha 256MB Ram....
