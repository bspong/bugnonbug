Pages are reloaded too often: POSTDATA, save page as, view page source, moving tab

Firefox reloads page too often.

Previous version would force a reload on "Save page as", or when moving a tab between window (but not when re-ordering tab in a given window). However, I could get "Save page as" functionality by first viewing the page source, and then saving from there.

Today, while paying my credit card bill, I found that "Save page as" will force a reload.

This mean that there is no way to save the page that I am looking at. None. Any attempt to do so will ignore what's in front of me, and try to fetch a fresh copy. But to my bank, that look like a second payment and is turned down, returning a different page.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page.
2. Try to view the source, or move the tab to another window, or save the page
3. This is easier to see if the page is a POST instead of a GET

Actual Results:
Firefox want to reload the page, and resubmit POSTDATA

Expected Results:

Expected results:
Any attempt to work with a page that firefox ha should work with the page that firefox has, not just with the URL / fetching information.

Moving a tab between window should move a tab a it look now.
Save page a should save what I am looking at now.
View source should show me the source of what I am looking at now.

Refetching -- even on GET's -- can return different data (just think of discussion forums.)


Marking a "Major" because:
Cannot save pages. Cannot store a receipt of payment.
