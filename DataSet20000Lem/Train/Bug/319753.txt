In Firefox you can use the Manage Bookmarks (pull down menu) to organize bookmarks, make new folders, rename, etc. I created a folder called Redux. In that folder I have “Redux Home Page”, “Redux Forums”, “Redux Tickets”, and “Redux Annoucements.” Now when you do that, it automatically give you the additional option to open ALL (bookmarks in that folder) a Tabs.

It ha been working great until I upgraded to Firefox 1.5 on the Mac OS-X.

Now when I start the program and click on the folder the first one or two time it work fine. Then about the third time I ask it to open, BAM blank folder and Firefox lock up.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
I must use Force Quit to regain control of my computer.

I expect the menu to open and to be able to click to the next request.

Firefox is in RED letter in the Force Quit menu. All others are Black letters.

I had another Mac user check my result and duplicated it.
