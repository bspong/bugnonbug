Clear history when Firefox closes: cookies, doesn't clear session cooky in Firefox 4+

In Firefox 3.6.x, checking 'Cookies' inside 'Clear history when Firefox closes' doe what it's supposed to do: clear browser cooky on Firefox exit.

Since Firefox 4, this preference no longer clear the locally cached browser cookies. Closing, then starting Firefox show previously set cooky despite having the aforementioned preference enabled.

I have read that since Firefox 4, work ha started on supporting clearing plugin cooky when the preference is set, e.g. Flash LSOs. But starting Firefox 4, this preference no longer clear browser cookies, at least in Linux.

Perhaps this might be a side-effect of the problem with the ongoing work on supporting cookie cleaning for plugins, unless I missed a change in policy concerning this preference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check 'Clear history when Firefox closes' inside Preferences -> Privacy.
2. Check 'Cookies' inside 'Clear history when Firefox closes' settings.
3. Close, then start Firefox.

Actual Results:
The browser cooky that were supposed to be cleared are still present when viewing cookies.

Expected Results:
The browser cooky should be cleared and viewing cooky should show up empty.

I do have the browser remember opened tab when it exits. At the same time I have browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs set to 0. But even so, I have a blank tab selected when the browser restores it session, so viewing cooky should still show up empty, save for extension that I have allowed to set cooky via exceptions.
