If attempting to scroll (long) web pages, the page seems to freeze (not scroll) using the PageUp and the PageDown button if "Always use the cursor key to navigate within pages" is selected (in the Options > Advanced > General > Accesibility window, or turned on with F7). I tested this with either the "Use smooth scrolling" turned on and turned off; in both case the page freeze scrolling with the Up/Down button if "Always use the cursor key to navigate within pages" is selected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select "Always use the cursor key to navigate within pages" in Options > Advanced > General > Accesibility window or turn it on with F7.
2. Navigate to a (long) page that display in 3 or 4 screen-lengths.
3. Click on the text so the cursor shows.
4. Click the PageUp and PageDown several time so you can see the page "freeze" and not scroll correctly.
Actual Results:
Page freeze and not scroll with the PageUp and PageDown buttons.

Expected Results:
Page should scroll.

I am using the Firefox 3.5 build described above downloaded from PortableApps.com: http://portableapps.com/news/2009-06-30_-_firefox_portable_3.5

I have not tested this with a "regular" (not portable) version of Firefox.
