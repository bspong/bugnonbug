I have a server that I connect to which requires credential to log in. It time out after so many minute so you have to supply the credential again.

I have bookmarked, for example: http://username:password@192.168.0.1/index.html

This works.

However, once the connection ha timed out to the server and I attempt to load it up again from the bookmark - it pop up with a message box asking for the credentials.

I have to restart Firefox to make the bookmark supply the credential automatically again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a site which requires credentials, eg. http://username:password@hostname
2. Bookmark the above URL
3. Access the above bookmark
4. Let the connection time out (in my example my router time out after 5 minutes)
5. Attempt accessing the above bookmark

Actual Results:
It pop up with a message box asking for username and password, even though they are supplied in the URL.

Expected Results:
It should simply pas the credential in the URL to the server again, but it doesn't.

Maybe a trivial bug to some, but this is plain annoying for me, a I access my router on a regular basis checking up on my crappy MaxADSL connection.

It is not an issue with my router a the URL work perfectly the first time and work again once Firefox ha been restarted.
