Page up or down or space bar all inoperative on 'stale' tabs: only scroll bar & button function

For about the last 3 year and still a problem in both Windows Vista and Ubuntu Linux 9.4 a well a previously when using SUSE, the following control (although mostly effective immediately after a page loads) stop being effective after a while: 1) page up; 2) page down; and, 3) space bar.

On both/either OS, I typically operate with 5 - 8 window present; each with 6 - 30 tab open; many open continuously for days. Whereas the three control typically operate correctly initially (right after loading), FF invariably cease to respond to those three key after the page becomes 'stale' (an indeterminate period of time).

I assume this happens to me because I typically leave my computer on indefinitely along with FF, for period of many day and possibly 2 - 3 weeks.

One can typically get rid of the problem by reloading the page. It's obviously not a showstopper but it erodes user confidence in the application coding.

I did not see this problem listed before submitting this bug but for me, it's been around what seems like forever. I gather this problem must be difficult to reproduce much like the memory leaks.

Good luck & best regards.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open lot of window and tabs.
2.Refer to these pages/tabs 2 - 5 day later.
3.Try the problem key starting with the space bar because that's usually the normal page/window down key.
Actual Results:
a above

Expected Results:
a above

page up; page down; page down
