Hints are persistent when under dock.

My dock is on the left side and hidden, with magnification. Firefox place it top window against the left edge of the screen. Here's what happens: I mouse to the left edge to look at my mail icon (for the message count). The dock appears and the mail.app and other icon magnify. I hover over the mail icon, which happens to be over the first item on the bookmark toolbar. Hovering cause the Firefox hint to appear. If I then click on the mail.app icon, the hint will persist and remain on top. It can only be removed by making Firefox the top window.

The hint should disappear if Firefox is not the top window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Dock on left side, hidden with magnification. Firefox open and on top, with bookmark toolbar.
2. Mouse to icon on dock that happens to be over bookmark toolbar. Hover over icon (and bookmark) until hint appears.
3. Click on icon in dock. That app should activate on top.

Actual Results:
Firefox hint should disappear, but doesn't.

Expected Results:
Firefox hint should disappear.

Since the hint cover valuable upper real estate on the screen, I'm always forced to go back to Firefox to get rid of it. That's what elevates this bug from minor to a normal bug that should be fixed. (IOW, it's a real PITA.)
