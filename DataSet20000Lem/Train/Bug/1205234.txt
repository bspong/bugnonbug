Remove Windows XP/Vista/7-specific toolbar button styling rule
Created attachment 8661723
patch

The toolbar button styling on Windows is pretty messy, because there are base rule used across the board and then there are Windows XP/Vista/7-specific rules, which make it brittle to touch the base rule since you might break the others along the way. It's non-trivial dependency since the rule are fairly complex.

I think we can largely drop those XP/Vista/7-specific rule and basically just set the CSS variable to get the desired background, border and box-shadow. The difference for Win7 and older implemented by these legacy rule are often arbitrary if they make sense at all. There are some difference worth explaining:

- There wa a 2px border radius, but the location and search bar use a 1px radius across the board, so it make sense to have toolbar button follow suit.

- type="menu-button" toolbar button had an extra hover state for the nested buttons. We don't have this on Linux, and considering that we haven't implemented it for Windows 8 when it came out nor for 10, I think this is safe to drop.

- --toolbarbutton-checkedhover-backgroundcolor wasn't used on Windows 8 and 10. I moved the corresponding rule so it's used for all versions.
