Figure out why tab close is slower on UX outside of the CSS transition
iconFade-close-DPI1.half is close to m-c while icon-close-DPI1.half is much worse. This mean that there is a lot of extra work other than the CSS transition that is making the close frame interval much worse on UX.

[20:24:40] <avih> ux ha a definite win with everything layout/gfx related compared to mc
[20:25:05] <avih> but for some reason, when closing a tab, it make all the value suck
[20:27:15] <MattN> good question about tab close/fade. I'll have to look into that more
[20:27:22] <MattN> I don't know of change we made to that
[20:27:37] <MattN> other than onLocationChange
[20:27:40] <avih> look at this
[20:27:41] <avih> icon-close-DPI1.half 16.72 25.25
[20:28:00] <avih> mc is 16.7ms, ux is 25ms. that's on the second half of the animation
[20:28:16] <avih> and this is the same, but with fade only:
[20:28:16] <avih> iconFade-close-DPI1.half 17.75 15.36
[20:28:28] <MattN> because when a tab closes, the bookmark button, identity block, URL bar, etc, have to update to reflect the change in tab
[20:28:43] <MattN> wow
[20:28:49] <avih> ux loses so much by closing the tab over the theoretical animation performance, which, in itself, is better than mc
