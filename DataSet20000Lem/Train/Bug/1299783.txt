The camera indicator translates between "Allow temporarily" and "Allow"
[Affected versions]:
FF Nightly 51.0a1


[Affected platforms]:
All


[Steps to reproduce]:

1. Open two tab and in each go to https://people.mozilla.org/~fqueze2/webrtc/ .
2. In Tab 1 click on video and share selected device and check the permission label in Control Center.
3. In Tab 2 click on video and share selected device and check the permission label in Control Center.
4. Switch to Tab1 and check permission text.
5. In Tab 2 open Control Center and click x closing the camera share then check the permission label in Control Center for tab1.



[Expected result]:
For each tab, the device permission should state that Video is Allowed Temporarily.

[Actual result]:
Step2: The permission text states(tab1): Allow Temporarily.
Step3: The permission text states(tab2): Allow.
Step4: The permission text states(tab1): Allow.
Step5: The permission text states(tab1): Allow Temporarily.

[Note1]:
I think that the standard permission status label in use currently is a bit confusing. In my point of view it it should be like:
Allow temporarily : Allow Once
Always : Always Allow

[Note2]:
I don't think this is a regression, the behavior for version 48 is somehow similar. The permission status label keep translating between Continue sharing and Allow depending on how many tab you open.
