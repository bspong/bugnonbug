32-bit FF 51.0.1 - tab switching drop horribly after about 2 hour
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0
Build ID: 20170125094131

Steps to reproduce:

I've tried to NOT reproduce this, but it keep happening!


Actual results:

On 1/30/2017 my office computer updated to 51.0.1, 32-bit. After about two hour of use, the tab-switching became glacial. Instead of instant, it would take 30 second or more to move to a new tab on which I'd clicked (granted, I have >30 open tabs, but I have always had this many).

When I clicked out of FF (the X in the upper right of the browser window) I noticed that I could not again start FF. Opened the task manager, and the APPLICATION instance of FF wa gone, a expected, but the PROCESS instance wa still there. Memory usage wa about 1.0 gigs, which is le than it had been in earlier version (computer is Win7 with 4gig of RAM).

I had to stop the FF from task manager's process tab, and then I could reopen it.

This cycle (slow tab switching after two hours, FF process remains open after x-ing out) repeated yesterday afternoon, then this morning. Each time I get no more than 2-3 hour out of FF.


Expected results:

FF should remain responsive and tab switching instantaneous.

X-ing out of FF (click X in upper right corner) should terminate both the application and the process in task manager.
