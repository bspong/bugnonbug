profile management broken

I have three profiles, let's call them "default", "user", and "anon".

What I would expect to happen is that "firefox -P someprofile" make sure that there is exactly one firefox process running for profile "someprofile" and then open a new window for the browser running with that profile.

Well, that's not what happens.

"firefox -P default" always seems to open a new window in whatever firefox is already running, even if it's running a different profile. When choosing "default" through the profile manager, however, the "default" profile behaves like "user".

"firefox -P user" start a new firefox process for profile "user" if one isn't already running and open a window. But if one is already running, it complains that I "first need to quit" the running firefox process and then doesn't start up a new one.

(The firefox developer should probably also rethink how firefox work in a distributed X11 environment, where multiple instance of firefox may be using the same X11 display but running on different host and even a different users.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Create multiple profiles, then try to start them up with "firefox -P something" and "firefox -ProfileManager".

Actual Results:
Sometimes open window for the wrong profile, sometimes refuse to start up firefox (see above).

Expected Results:
The profile should behave a if each of them were the default profile for a single-profile user; they just happen to share the same display.
