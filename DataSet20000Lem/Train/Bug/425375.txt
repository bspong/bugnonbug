First of all, nearly identical bug report (bug 356581) is already on the bug tracker. But, though that bug (see the title) wasn't tied strongly to particular step (closing CTRL+W or another method, just abstract *closing tab*), Simon Bünzli said (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=356581#c15) that the new bug should be reported, so here it is (and naturally it is mainly copy of mentioned existing bug report, only closing method and Firefox version are changed).

When we try to close last tab when the option "Always show the tab bar" in dialogue [Tools] -> [Options] -> [Tabs] is turned on, the location bar loses focus.

It make big sense at this situation to focus location bar -- a it take place both on Firefox start and when we create new tab with CTRL+T. It is useful and it really make sense.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox with one tab open. One (empty) tab is open and the location bar ha focus.
2. Close the tab by clicking close button on the tab. One tab is a before open and empty, but location bar isn't focused anymore.
3. Click CTRL+W (that only ha been fixed), and location bar ha focus again. (Just another closing method, and the problem disappears. Non sense.)
Actual Results:
The location bar loses focus though visual and functional status of browser and of the tab are the same a right after Firefox start.

Expected Results:
Location bar should (or is very useful/expected-by-user at least) still have focus when user ha tried to close last tab.

This bug affect latest trunk build of Firefox 3 (Gecko/2008032106) a well a all prior Fx3 builds.

Probably it may be easily fixed before final Firefox 3.0 ships. Thanks.
