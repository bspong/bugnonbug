I am using a script to move a toolbar type thing around the page so that a user
can move it out of the way, etc. Originally I wa using position: absolute, and
everything worked fine. However, I decided that position: fixed would be a
better alternative to absolute because then the toolbar would remain in the same
position during scrolling. After changing this, the toolbar would still drag,
but on Mac, it would move around a little "floppy"-ish. It still follows the
general movement of the mouse, but it will at time move around quite a bit
relative to the mouse...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple div or whatever that will have draggable content
2. Make sure that the div ha position: fixed
3. Drag the div around
4. Change position to absolute
5. Drag div around

Actual Results:
The div move strangely when position = fixed but move a expected when
position = absolute.

Expected Results:
Both fixed and absolute would move in the same manner.

I will upload a small sample HTML file that reproduces this problem. I did not
personally test this on Windows, but a coworker did and he said it work a
expected on Windows with both fixed and absolute.
