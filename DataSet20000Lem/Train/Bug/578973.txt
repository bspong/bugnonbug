Hi,

I've been using NoSquint for a while and i should say that it a must have, excellent program for those people who have wide screen laptop and displays.
The only drawback of the program is that when the website are zoomed, the scrolling make the image or flash object in a website kinda flicker and it give a stucky/sluggish feeling.
I did some testing myself and found out that it not a bug in NoSquint, but it a problem with Firefox browser itself. And I've tested other browser (IE & Safari) with the same setting a firefox(125%, 150% zoom), and i wa surprised to see that there were no problem at all.

NoSquint is a great program, i hope Firefox would find a solution for this matter.

Thankyou,

huchein
