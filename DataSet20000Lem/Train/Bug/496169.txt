Before I start, this is not a problem with my mouse and it is driving me crazy.
I have a number of problem which all began a few day ago:

*When opening a link in a new tab, two tab will open for the same link.
*When single clicking a tab, it will close.
*When left clicking on button or in a text-box I will have to click a number of time before it work because strangely the navigation arrow appears and then suddenly it will be okay for one click, this also applies to clicking desktop item and button in the toolbar such a bookmarks, tool etc.
*Previously I had a problem where single clicking anywhere on the page would enable cursor navigation (caret browsing?) yet when clicking f7 it would ask me if I would like to switch caret browsing on.
These thing are pretty much making my internet unusable/unbearable!
The problem's don't appear until about 10mins of browsing. I have tried other browser and the problem persists but a I had FF when it began I figured it should be reported here.

Any help appreciated!
