An external web shortcut doe not work if it URL exceeds 483 bytes, it result
in whatever error that the external program that contained the shortcut will output.

This *only* occurs if Firefox is *not* currently running when the shortcut is
launched. If Firefox *is* running when the shortcut is launched, it open the
page in Firefox a expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Under Windows 98[SE] 4.10.2222.A:

1. Find a URL that exceeds 483 byte (the entire URL including the protocol,
etc). Eg.:
http://electronics.attr-search.ebay.com/zire-31_Handheld-Units_New-Never-Opened_W0QQa10244Z22656QQa10244Z22656QQa12ZQ2d24QQa14ZQ2d24QQa35ZQ2d24QQa35ZQ2d24QQalistZa14Q2ca10255Q2ca12Q2ca35Q2ca10244QQcatrefZC6QQcoactionZcompareQQcoentrypageZsearchQQcopagenumZ1QQfposZQ5AIPQ2fPostalQQfromZR10QQfrppZ50QQfsooZ1QQfsopZ1QQftrtZ1QQftrvZ1QQgcsZ7QQmaxrecordsreturnedZ300QQpfZShowQ20ItemsQQpf_queryZQ22zireQ2031Q22QQpfidZ7QQpfmodeZ1QQsacatZ38331QQsadisZ200QQsargnZQ2d1QQsaslcZ2QQsatitleZQ22zireQ2031Q22QQsbrftogZ1QQsofocusZpf
2. Create a shortcut for that URL in an external application. Eg.: navigate to
the URL in Firefox and drag the URL icon from Firefox to an Explorer window, the
desktop, or a toolbar *OR* send yourself an email with that URL. This email
must be received in an external email client (eg.: not webmail). [Note that
these are just two possibility in which this behaviour can occur. The outcome
or error depends on the application from which the shortcut wa launched.]
3. Close all instance of Firefox including download windows, extension windows,
etc.
4. Attempt to launch the shortcut from the external program you created it in.
Actual Results:
If the URL is opened from a shortcut (*.URL) in Windows explorer, the desktop,
or a toolbar, the following error message is displayed:
"Access to the specified device, path, or file is denied"

If the URL is opened from a different external application, the result depend
on that application. For example, launching the shortcut from Eudora resulted
in no error message of any kind - it wa just "click" and nothing happened.

Expected Results:
The shortcut should have launched Firefox and navigated to the URL.

- I am currently using NO additional theme nor do I have any installed
- I am currently using NO additional extension nor do I have any installed
- I am currently using the SPL and SWF Macromedia Flash pluggins
- I have the Adobe PDF pluggins, but they are disabled
- There wa no "Illegal Operation" error or crash when this occured
- There wa no TalkBack report or crash ID (I *do* have TalkBack installed)

There is no fully-fixing or complete work-around that I am aware of. One can
manually copy the URL from the shortcut and paste it into the address bar in
Firefox.
