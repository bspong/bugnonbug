Status bar claim "Stopped" when loading a page

Status bar is sometimes very slow in upgrading the page status. On slower
connection it often claim "Stopped" at page that is loading, even when circle
on the all tab are rotating (claiming activity).

I haven't stop any page. I started Firefox and I just have so quickly written
address of page I wanted to visit, that the homepage wasn't displayed at all,
and it even haven't displayed it name in main navigation bar. Other words, I
haven't given any chance to homepage :-) It's true, however, that I haven't
needed to press "stop" button nor clear any page address from navigation bar.

Mayba Firefox took the homepage a "Stopped", and even it wa loading new page,
the status "Stopped" remained there.

I'm uncomfortable with that, because while no page is even partially loaded
(blank tabs, circle rotating), I'm not sure if it isn't really "stopped" for
some unknown reason. Firefox should not claim false status in status bar. Better
display nothing than not true claims.
