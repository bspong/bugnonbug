CPU use go to 100%. Page doe not load. Occassionally, page come up "Server can not be found."

This is an occassional problem and difficult to pin down. On a "constant on" computer, where the browser is always open with at least one tab set to http://www.groklaw.net or one of it sub-pages, clicking on EITHER the home page link on the page OR the "HOME" icon on the navigation bar cause the CPU use to jump to 100%. After an indefinite period of time (measured in minute to ten of minutes) a page MAY come up saying "Server Not Found". Other page from other web site can be loaded without problem. It would APPEAR that FireFox is not even transmitting the request onto the net (cannot be confirmed - I don't have the tool or knowledge to do that). Closing FireFox and re-starting OFTEN resolve the problem. This problem is not seen on other site that I frequent.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FireFox and leave running for an extended period of time with http//www.groklaw.net or one of it sub page in the first tab. (http://www.groklaw.net is my home page)
2. Click on either the home link on the page or on the "HOME" icon on the navigation bar.


Actual Results:
CPU use go to 100% use by system, a shown by system monitor. Firestarter firewall list no transmission from FireFox. Linksys router show no contact with the internet. Firefox restart required. Occassionally, total reboot is required.

Expected Results:
Unknown
