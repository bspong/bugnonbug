Go to the web page above.
(I have WMP 10 installed, but happened with WMP9 a well)
It should crash and display this:
"Windows Media Player Plug-in Dynamic Link Library
The plug-in performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to restart Firefox.
[] Don't show this message again during this session."
Then Firefox is pretty much dead, in all other windows/tabs a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Be sure that You do not have anything important open.
1. Go to http://www.break.com/articles/modelb52.html
2. Watch crash.
3. Restart Firefox.

Actual Results:
"Windows Media Player Plug-in Dynamic Link Library
The plug-in performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to restart Firefox.
[] Don't show this message again during this session."

Expected Results:
One of these:
1. Not to crash, but to load and display the medium properly.
2. Not to crash, but to display and error message that FF is unable to handle some content, and that particular content will not be loaded/visible.

No additional information.
