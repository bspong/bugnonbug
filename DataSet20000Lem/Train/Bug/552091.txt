Since updating to firefox 3.6 and downloading personas, once I open my bookmarks, my browser start to bounce up and down
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

After that update and download, every time I open my bookmark menu (the one that pop up on the side, not the drop down menu), or sometimes for no discernible reason, the site displayed on the browser start to, for lack of a better description, bounce up and down. It look like it just scrolling up and down over and over again, but it only a matter of a few pixel up and down. It's like my browser is flinching. It isn't the entirety of firefox either, just the actual website. The toolbars section doesn't move at all, just the web page. I've found the only way to make it stop is to close and reopen firefox or SOMETIMES, for some reason, go to the fox mask icon for persona in the bottom left of the screen, and click on anything in that manu that cause a new tab to open on the persona section of the site. It doesn't work if I open other link in a new tab though, just personas.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Update firefox to 3.6
2.Download the Persona Plus (or Pro. Whatever the add-on version is)
3.Open bookmark (for immediate result although I've found it will sometimes just do it on it own)
Actual Results:
My browser started bouncing up and down

Expected Results:
NOT started bouncing up and down and remained still unless I scrolled up or down

I'm not sure when it started, but the persona I used were: franz ferdinand skin, Tri Force Hyrule Crest, Halo Reach - Spartans, and Halo Reach - Noble Team.
This still happens on the default
