when i close firefox process is not being killed! it's still on a window task manager process list and it take 50pc of cpu usage. when i open again firefox window task manager process list's show another firefox process which take 0pc of cpu usage and the previous firefox process which still take 50pc of cpu usage. when i close firefox and open it again window task manager process list show me on window task manager process list's 3 firefox process which 2 out of 3 take 99pc of pc usage!!!
the only way to deal with it is to kill process manually

i've noticed this happening after upgrading firefox to 3.5 and i've always been upgrading to newer version once after it show up

here is the list of my extensions:
-adblock plus 1.0.2
-british english dictionary 1.19
-download helper 4.5
-downthemall! 1.1.4
-flashblock 1.5.11.2
-foxytunes 3.5.5
-java quick starter 1.0
-microsoft .net framework assistant 1.1

and my theme is default 3.5



Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
after finished using firefox process should have been killed
