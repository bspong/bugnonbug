I don't know the minimum number of tab for which it happens, but I often have >100 tab open at a time, and when I want to Bookmark All Tabs, I enter a name for the set, and then trying to bookmark them I get an "Assertion Failed" dialog box, and no tab are bookmarked. I have to keep all tab open across even more sessions, in order not to lose them.

If I delete heap of tab (I don't know down to what level - I haven't proofed it to that level), Bookmark All Tabs work again. It is clearly a bug associated with having many tab open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have MANY (I have >100) tab open at a time
2.Bookmarks>Bookmark All Tabs>enter name>Add Bookmarks
3.Get failure dialog
4.No tab are bookmarked
Actual Results:
Failure dialog popup upon trying to Bookmark All Tabs. No tab bookmarked.

Expected Results:
Tabs bookmarked into a set, no matter how many tab I have open.
