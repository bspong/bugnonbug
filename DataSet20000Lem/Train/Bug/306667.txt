Requirement: An option for setting print/page setup preference speicifically
for the firefox browser.

At present there is no option to set the printing / page setup preference for
Firefox in a global manner i.e. a setting particularly for printing document
from the browser. Anyway, firefox remembers the last used print/page settings.

This would be useful if -

The user prefers to print generally to one printer - say a dot matrix - and
want to print web page to a duplex enabled Laserjet printer on the network.
Therefore, some method to set these option specifically for the browser is needed.

Further, the user can opt to change these from the Print or Page Setup dialog
under File Menu. These setting will be remembered for the session only and
would not alter the global setting under Preferences > Print.

The implementation could be quite simple a providing two button to call the
present Page Setup, Printer option box and Properties dialog for the specific
printer. These could be 'remembered' by Firefox per user/machine (?)

Further the Print Icon of Navigation bar (I strongly support for adding it to
the default set of icon - Why such a basic thing is not there?) could use the
default setting from the preference and print to the specific printer opted
therein (this would avoid user interference and save time). If the user change
the setting within the session, this will be used for further printing by
clicking the icon.

Please consider.

Reproducible: Always
