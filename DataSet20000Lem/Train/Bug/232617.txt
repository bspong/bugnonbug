Location Bar dropdown load new tab
UA: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040129 Firebird/0.8.0+

When you manually type a URL into the location bar, and you then drop down the
location bar menu and select a URL, Firebird should open that URL in a new tab.
It doe this on a very inconsistent basis.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open new process of Firebird on linux
2. Type in the location bar the URL of a page that you have never been to before
3. Click on something in dropdown URL bar
Actual Result: It open in a new tab
Expected Result: Same

4. Exit Firebird
5. Open Firebird again
6. Type in location bar same URL a in Step 2.
7. Repeat Step 3
Actual Result: The page load in same tab, doesn't open new one.
Expected Result: It open in a new tab
Actual Result (on Windows): It open in a new tab

This seems to be related to some caching issue on Linux, because any URL that
ha been visited before doe not seem to count a having been 'typed in', even
if it was. The only way to get the dropdown menu in the location bar to open a
new tab is by entering the URL of an unvisited page and then doing it. So even
if you open a new Firebird process on Linux, and you go to 20 pages, a long a
they're all cached (or in history, not sure), going to the location bar dropdown
and choosing a URL there will not load it in a new tab.

On Windows this problem doe not happen.
