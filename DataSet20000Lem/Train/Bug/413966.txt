Hi i use Firefox and i also have the latest quick time installed a plug in. whenever i want to see online medium from a newspaper or anything else online it is performing very poor, you can hardly understand or se much of anything.

On the same site i use IE and i performs perfect, that lead me to believe there is nothing wrong with the site but with Firefox or the way it handle it s plug in .

I even had this problem with firefox when i wa running xp

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Reinstalled both Firefox and plug in "quick time"
2.Updated Firefox and Quick time
3.Updated Vista
Actual Results:
log in for example at www.expressen.se and try to click expressen tv and try to watch something.

Expected Results:
You will not be able to watch and or hear much of anything.

More probably ask with which player i want to play the clip instead of using it s internal plug in. And maybe let me play it with winamp, medium player or maybe real player, etc.
