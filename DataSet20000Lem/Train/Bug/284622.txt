wmode=transparent make the flashmovie behave transparent. When trying to fill
in a form to enter my email, I had to fill in the @. It wa impossible to do so
because not all key work properly.
Copying the '@' solved the problem, but this is not supposed to be a solution.
Even a '.' is impossible to type with an azerty-keyboard, since you would have
to use the shift-key (which also doesn't work).
A blinking cursor is also not shown...
Possibly a flash player problem?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. make a flashfile with an insert field (include all signs, also the @)
2. set in html code the swf with wmode="transparent" (in embed and object tag)
3. use Firefox to surf to the page
4. fill in the emailaddress
5. you don't see a blinking cursor, nor it is possible to type an '@'

Actual Results:
impossible to type '@'
keyboard doe not function properly (FN, Shift, Alt, Alt-gr doesn't work)

Expected Results:
Everything what it doe normally (keys must work)
