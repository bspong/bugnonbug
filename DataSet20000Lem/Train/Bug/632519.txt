I have Google a my homepage on Mozilla Firefox. Today, I noticed that sometimes (not always) when I'm on the Google page, all the menu of Firefox flicker. To be more specific, the menu itself open normally, but moving the mouse cursor over any option make the option constantly flicker between selected and non-selected. This is not just a visual problem, because it take several click to actually select that item.
I haven't noticed this problem on any other site so far. Maybe the reason is that today (8 February 2011) Google is running some sort of animated logo in honour of Jules Verne and that is interfering with Firefox. But anyway, this behaviour should not occur on any page.

1. Go to the Google website.
