Firefox fails to import bookmark from Chrome when it also try to import a large history
[Affected versions]:
- Firefox 47 beta 5
- latest Developer Edition 48.0a2
- latest Nightly 49.0a1

[Unaffected versions]:
- Firefox 46.0.1

[Affected platforms]:
- Mac OS X 10.10.5 (although I did not reproduce on another machine running 10.11.2 and 10.10.4)
- Windows 7 64-bit (unable to reproduce on Windows 10 64-bit and Ubuntu 16.04 32-bit)

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Run Firefox for the first time (or simply remove the profile folder: On Windows - %appdata%\Mozilla; On Mac - Library\Application Support\Firefox; On Linux - /home/user/.mozilla)
2. Go to "Bookmarks -> Show All Bookmarks -> Import and Backup -> Import Data from Another Browser
3. Make sure Chrome is not running
4. Import data from Chrome

[Expected result]:
- Bookmarks are successfully imported

[Actual result]:
- Bookmarks are not imported. Folder 'Imported from Chrome' is empty.

[Regression range]:
- I am unable to determine a regression range using mozregression but:
Mac OS X 10.10.5 - Firefox 47 beta 4 is not affected by this, so it's something between 47 beta 4 and beta 5.
Windows 7 64-bit - Firefox 46.0 RC build 5 is not affected, all 47 beta are affected.

[Additional notes]:
- Console output:

[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x804b000a (NS_ERROR_MALFORMED_URI) [nsIIOService.newURI]" nsresult: "0x804b000a (NS_ERROR_MALFORMED_URI)" location: "JS frame :: resource://gre/modules/NetUtil.jsm :: NetUtil_newURI :: line 191" data: no]
