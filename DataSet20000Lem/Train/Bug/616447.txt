History faulty - not showing result for the past month (although it should and used to)

Sorry if this ha been posted before but I did try searching and can't really find anything on my problem.
Basically, up until recently, my history had been working just fine. However, now I can only display site from the past two days.
The option 'Last 7 days' and 'November' do show up, but when I click them, there are no results.

Now here is the curious thing: When I search in the history, page that I accessed in say, late October (my firefox is set to remember browsing history for 21-35 days), do show up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.(Re-)Start firefox.
2.Start bookmark/history manager.
3.Click on 'History', then 'Last 7 days'.
4.No results.
5.Search for 'oil' (or any random query).
Actual Results:
The search for 'oil' return result of page which are not bookmarked, that have been visited in the last 7 day (or month)!

Expected Results:
In step 4, it should, a it used to, show the page I have visited in the past 7 days.

Perhaps my places.sqlite is damaged, but I would not know why that would have happened. I don't want to lose my browsing history, so I do not want to delete the file.

I modified some thing in my about:config, but not a lot, really:

[There are also a few printer related changes, but I cut them out cause I think they are not relevant.]
