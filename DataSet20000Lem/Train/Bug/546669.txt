This problem seems to be happening with Windows 7 in Classic Mode. There are vertical black bar at the end of the text in the tab when the text is long. If I go back to the regular Windows 7 desktop, these bar are gone. In addition, more problematically, the printing capability is affected. In some instances, bar are inserted when I view the text in print review, or the text turned into complete gibberish. I have no such problem when I use IE 8.0. I do not have these problem with the latest FF browser with XP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Windows Classic theme in Windows 7
2. Go to the New York Times site. See the vertical bar in the tab.
3. Go to http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/02/student-facebook-tirade-against-teacher-is-protected-speech/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+wired%2Findex+%28Wired%3A+Index+3+%28Top+Stories+2%29%29 to print or print preview the text to see the vertical bar within the text or the printed gibberish.
Actual Results:
2. Vertical bar in the tab
3. Vertical bar in the print preview or printed gibberish

Expected Results:
2. No vertical bar in the tab
3. No vertical bar in the print preview. Text should be printed normally.
