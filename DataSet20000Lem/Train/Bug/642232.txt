Just installed Firefox 4 RC (i.e. Minefield) and it ha imported all my bookmark automatically.
After visiting google.co.uk and news.bbc.co.uk, I can open the bookmark menu, but any attempt to move the mouse down to select a bookmark cause the bookmark menu to close itself.
This is happening randomly, but once it start closing the bookmark menu, it will always keep doing this until Firefox 4 RC is closed and restarted.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 4 RC.
2. Browse a couple of web sites.
3. Attempt to select an existing bookmark from the bookmark menu.
Actual Results:
This problem only happens sometimes, and I am yet to find a sequence of step that will cause it to happen every time, but it doe happen within a few minute of using Firefox 4 RC on Ubuntu.

Expected Results:
I have Firefox 3.6 installed and bookmark always display and can be selected from the bookmark menu, expect Firefox 4 RC to do the same.
