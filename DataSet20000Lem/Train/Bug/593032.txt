I have not been able to reproduce the problem. I just used a link from Mail using a URL. The Window failed to appear. I tried to open other window and could see them in the window list but saw no window. Minimize and Zoom were faded. I quite without saving and restarted and got window after clicking on the now darkened Zoom. THis ha happened four time but seemingly random. When I reproduce the step that I think I took just before the event, the problem is not repeated.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Actual Results:
I have not been able to reproduce the problem but it ha occurred several time in what seems to be randomly. I always find the Zoom and Minimize under Window to be dimmed. I can recover, once I get Zoom to be darkened by clicking Zoom. Once I actually saw a reduced window in the upper lefthand corner of the screen and got the window back by clicking it.

Expected Results:
The window should simply appear

I am sending you this report via Safari which ha not exhibited the problem. I have however gotten Firefox to run again and so far today it ha not repeated.
