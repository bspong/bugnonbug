More and more user use high security site to handle bank account and
eCommerce. Since most of user tend to use the same site regularly I believe
the feature described below would contribute to prevent phishing and other
problem by giving a clear visual feedback of the secure state.

It work a follows:

- first allow user to list their secure site somewhere in Options/Preferences
or on a special bookmark folder.
- second when a user browse to one of those site an icon would appear
indicating the 'quality’ of the connection according to the list below list:


1 - dangerous case – something is pretending to be a site on my list (show
something RED)
2 - non listed http site (no icon / or neutral icon)
3 - non listed http site but certificate not ok (yellow icon)
4 - non listed http site (usual golden secure icon)
5 - http site is on my list and certificate is ok (green icon or better)

The icon would be placed on the address line like the RSS icon on FireFox 1.5
Beta. If possible on the left side.
