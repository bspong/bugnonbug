Loading the PKCS#11 provided by RSA for their SOM Smartcard crash Firefox (1.5, 2.0) and Thunderbird

Firefox and Thunderbird both crash when loading the PKCS#11 module provided by RSA for the use of their smart card "C:\Program Files\RSA Security\RSA Sign-On Manager Client\Pkcs11.dll" This module load fine by IE and RSA's SOM and SoftID programs. I've uploaded a talkback, ID=24983524

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open "Security Devices" Tools->Options->Advanced->Security Devices
2.Browse to the RSA Pkcs11.dll and load
3.Crash

Actual Results:
Crashed. I enabled a clean install with only talkback enabled to capture the talkback above. This crash on all version I've tested: Firefox 1.5, 2.0RC3, and Thunderbird 1.5.0.7

Expected Results:
Ideally, the module should load and I can access my digital certificates. Minimally, I should receive an error and a graceful exit.

Marking this a "Major - A major feature is broken" - If I can't load the digital certificate stored on the smartcard, then client authentication and secure email are essentially not available for u with Firefox and Thunderbird. Note: I'm making an *assumption* that since this is an RSA provided PKCS#11 and RSA authored this particular standard, then the fault is with the firefox/thunderbird routines. Since the application crash outright without an error or graceful exit, this feel buglike. Talkback ID=24983524
