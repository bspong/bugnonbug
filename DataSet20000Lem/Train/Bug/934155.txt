audible.com downloads not working
1. Log into Audible.com and navigate to the Online Library
2. Click a "DOWNLOAD" button to download the audio file
3. In Fx 26.0b1 it doe appear to download a small bootstrap file but then finish
4. It doe not schedule the Audible Download Manager to then download the audio file *

* This worked fine in previous Fx releases.

Workaround:
It seems to be related to the profile mimeTypes.rdf file. This file is what Fx us to determine what to do with a download file request with a mime type associated with it, in the case of Audible it's mime type "application/aa-dhelper". The thing is, I copied my Fx 25.0 profile to be used a my Fx 26.0b1 profile and the Audible entry were there. Also, the same problem exhibit itself if I simply use the existing profile rather than making a new copy. This problem never surfaced in past profile copy-overs from one release to the next. The solution turned out to be easier than expected, I just had to remove the Audible mime type RDF entry from the file, re-save it, restart Fx26 and have Fx re-create it by going to the Audible.com site and requesting a download.

Conjecturing now, I believe that starting with Fx 26.0b1 there needed to be a re-registering process that wasn't needed in past releases. As such, I may find other instance of this occurring a I run into other mime type download file but, a yet, can't confirm.
