Cannot configure user profile and copy to default user in Windows XP

When I launch Firefox 3 b5 and configure it exactly a we like it and then logoff and copy that profile to the default user profile to ensure that the setting are saved and consistent across our enterprise, the setting don't persist.

Is there an alternative way to do this if it will not be supported in the full release?



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Logoff and log back on a user
2. Customize preference (and bookmarks)
3. Save setting and copy Windows profile to the default user profile
4. Same result, it launch and asks me the first (default browser) ?


Actual Results:
See above

Expected Results:
The same behavior...the profile setting didn't copy with the user's Windows user profile.

I would like to see the setting be non-specific enough to copy successfully with the user's Windows-based profile so that we can ensure that the look and feel and all preference setting are consistent across our enterprise.
