The dropdown menu on amazon.com that allows one to specify which credit card is being used (particularly in the "change shipping address" or "cancel orders" page is invisible (a dropdown appears, but it it too tiny to display anything), and can't be operated by arrow key or typing the name of a credit card.

After a few tries, Amazon cancel the intended change and ship the incorrect order!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter an order with amazon.com
2. Try to change the shipping address or cancel the order
3. Try to specify the (required) credit card information.

Actual Results:
Drop-down menu for type of card (AmEx, Visa, Master Card) is tiny and no information can be entered.

Expected Results:
Information should be accepted.

Amazon obviously ha a bug a well. They should never force an order through when the customer is attempting to change it. Firefox, however, should display the drop-down menu correctly.
