OS X : Firefox running but either hung or in background (No UI)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.77.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/7.0.5 Safari/537.77.4

Steps to reproduce:

Unfortunately, I don't know how to reproduce this. I've noticed it several time during the last few weeks. It may be a new bug in Firefox 28.


Actual results:

Several time during the last few week I've noticed the following…

1. "Firefox" process in Activity Monitor
2. "Firefox" show in cmd+opt+esc Force Quit dialog)
3. No Firefox in the cmd+tab application switcher.

1 and 2 indicate that Firefox is running, but 3 indicates that Firefox is running in the background. Using a third-party application switcher (which probably sends an 'activate' Apple Event to Firefox) may or may not result in Firefox coming to the foreground, showing it menu, etc. In other words, sometimes it seems like Firefox is genuinely "hung" and must be force quit, sometimes it is just hiding in the background.


Expected results:

In either case, it is misbehaving. Firefox is not a background app. If it is running, it should always be available in cmd+tab app switcher, not in the background, and, of course, should never hang.
