[meta] We seem to be leaking hundred of window until shutdown during browser-chrome test
I wa looking at http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/Firefox/1305941364.1305945463.28696.gz for unrelated reasons, and noticed that at the end of the test there are about 500 DOMWINDOW object around, and only a few docshells. So I grabbed the log and looked at the url of the window being destroyed _after_ the hidden window. The top offender of the 500 or so window left at that point are:

339 about:blank
96 chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
84 about:addons

I tried a quick test of just opening and closing window locally and the browser.xul window go away.

Oh, during that whole test run about 186 chrome://browser/content/browser.xul window go away.

And window are going away through the run a we go, so it's not like _all_ window leak. Just a bunch of them. Looking at the log, we seem to have both inner and outer browser.xul window around at the end there.

The big question: is this just test code holding on to windows? Or is this test code calling code that would normally run in our UI and hold on to windows?

Again, all the window are _closed_ (no docshell) but the inner and outer window object are hanging around at shutdown.

It'd be nice if someone familiar with the browser test took a look at which test are opening the window that leak or something. Do we have any other way of finding their allocation points?
