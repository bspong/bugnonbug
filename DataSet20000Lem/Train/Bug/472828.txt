After loading my normal tabs, a a Firefox user for years, I am now unable to use Firefox in the current release because it crash regularly and repeatedly. I trade online, and must have a stable browser. No earlier version did this. Aslo, I tried the beta 3.1 and although it didn't crash, it would not open mail in hotmail. Both of these problem have sent me away form Firefox to le likable browsing with Safari and MSN Explorer. If this is not fixed, I feel certain million will turn away from Firefox a I wa forced to do.

Please, please fix this crashing problem!! (also the staying in memory after closing is a minor annoyance)
