When I tried to checked my yahoomail and hotmail using firefox 1.5 beta1 I found
that whenever I tried to set the Unread message a Read Messages using the
option given in hotmail and yahoomail but it doe not take in effect even after
the browser is reloaded after the click.
I did not experience the same problem with gmail
Please consider this problem. I couldnot find any one who ha reported this problem.
I guess this could be because of some JavaScript action is not considered properly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to hotmail or yahoomail account
2.try to set the unread message a read message using the "Mark a Read"
option given
3. You can see that nothing is effected even after the browser responded to the
click

Actual Results:
If such a step is followed in old firefox and all the state that show that the
message is and "Unread" must be changed to a the state of a message is already
"Read".

Expected Results:
Browser did not change the state of the message of the Unread Message to a Read
Message state.

The browser did not give any error message. I guess this must be related to the
way in which the script are handled in the firefox code.
