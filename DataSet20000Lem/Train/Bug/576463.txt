Cursor move from address bar location when creating a new tab

When opening a new tab, the cursor move from the address area, leaving it display: "History and bookmarks" or whatever is selected from Options->Privacy->Location bar. This is a desturbing situation a it is uncomfortable to open a new tab and not being able to type the address I want to go to, unless a click with the mouse on the location bar to bring the cursor there. I started having this problem for the last few days. I can't remember any major update regarding add-on or plug-ins. Instead, I noticed that this problem doe not reproduce if I log in to my computer using another Windows account. I would like to be able to solve this problem if it's possible because I have many bookmark and saved link and password for many site and I cannot afford to lose that quantity of information.
I also tried reinstalling Firefox and restoring the profile but the problem still occurs.

Thank You very much for your help.

Best regard
