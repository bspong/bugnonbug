Occasionally, regardless of what site, if you type a bunch of stuff and, say, you go to select the text, once you click (I can't tell if you have to also let go, click and hold or if either will cause it) the text in the large text box (the multi-line one such where the body of a message goes) the entire box will suddenly disappear visually.
It's still there, you can select text and type etc etc but the only way I can get around this temporarily is to use the preview function (of message boards, for example) then hit Back to return to the page. Once you're back, you can see it again.

When it disappears, it seems to show whatever the background colour of the table or the webpage (if not in a table).
