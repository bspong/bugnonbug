-FF 22.0
-Adobe Acrobat plug-in (10.1.7.27)

System 2:
Win7 Pro, 32Bit
FF 22.0
Funnelcake July 2012
Mosilla14-1.0
Adobe Acrobat plug-in (10.1.1.33)

A fix that wa found to work, BUT ONLY FOR SYSTEM 1, wa to...
1. Disable Adobe Acrobat plug-in
2. Restart FF
3. Open the PDF in FF, generated correctly
4. Enable the Adobe plug-in
5. Restart FF
6. Open the PDF in FF, generated correctly

Actual results:

All letter "b" were missing from the document when using the FF in-app PDF viewer. If I click "download", then open the document in Adobe Acrobat, it look a expected. In addition, some user have reported that negative sign "-" were displaying a squares. If the user highlight the text with the missing character(s), and set focus outside of FF, the missing character show up in the highlight text. Then, the character disappear when focus is set back to FF. Users are in the habit of using the ptint functionality within the FF PDF viewer. When they use this (instead of downloading and then printing), the character are missing in the printed copy.


Expected results:

The viewer should have displayed a PDF containing all expected characters.
