drag and drop in bookmark toolbar no longer work since 2.0 on OS X
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: all OS X version after 2.0

like the headline say - since upgrading Firefox to 2.0, there is no longer any way to drag-and-drop organize the bookmark directly in the bookmarks-toolbar.

it is still possible to arrange bookmark via the sidebar.

I had Firefox 1.5 installation on both Windows and OS X, and upgraded both to version 2.0, and they work a follows:

Firefox 1.5 on Windows: WORKS
Firefox 2.0 on Windows: WORKS
Firefox 1.5 on OS X: WORKS
Firefox 2.0 on OS X: DOESN'T WORK

I first upgraded Firefox on OS X, and wondered why drag and drop in the bookmark toolbar no longer worked. I assumed it wa a feature that hadn't been built into 2.0 yet, so I upgraded Firefox on Windows to see, but it work fine on Windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Switch on the bookmark toolbar.
2. Try to drag and drop a bookmark - you can't.
3. Pull hair in frustration.

Actual Results:
Instead of dragging and dropping, when you release the mouse button after dragging, it just register a a click on whatever bookmark the mouse is over at that time.

Expected Results:
I wa expecting drag and drop to work.

Default theme, latest OS X version, several Firefox upgrade (just upgraded two day ago).
