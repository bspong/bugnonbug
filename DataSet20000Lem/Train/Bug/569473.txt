Firefox hang every page, every link, and .php issue
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100423 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.3

Every time I use Firefox, it hang on startup, stop loading pages, will not quickly access links, and asks me what to do with .php pages. I have re-installed Firefox with apt-get options, and also installed a different version of Ubuntu (Studio) to see if it will help. Nothing I do to troubleshoot the issue is helping. I have disabled ipv6, and have made some minor adjustment in the about:config page and NOTHING I do is helping. I have resorted to multiple click on links, stopping and refreshing the page I am attempting to load, and ultimately closing the browser and restarting.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Click a link from one page to another
3. Click a .php page when browsing for a short period of time
4. Open a new tab
No special step needed to recreate this anomaly, just happens without regard to special circumstance.
Actual Results:
See detail section

Expected Results:
Not ask what to do with .php pages, open all link with little effort(like I am used to experiencing with previous edition of Firefox), not having to refresh every page. Not trying to be unhelpful, just not sure what the problem is to begin with.
