getFolderContents() can crash [@nsNavHistoryContainerResultNode::CloseContainer] when JS GC happens
getFolderContents() can crash when JS GC happens

with the patch in #378558 I am crashing when I attempt to copy the "root" bookmark in the left hand pane of the bookmark organizer.

What I think is going is that JS GC is happening, and we are garbage collecting "result" [see getFolderContents()]

getFolderContents:
function PU_getFolderContents(aFolderId, aExcludeItems, aExpandQueries) {
var query = this.history.getNewQuery();
query.setFolders([aFolderId], 1);
var option = this.history.getNewQueryOptions();
options.setGroupingMode([Ci.nsINavHistoryQueryOptions.GROUP_BY_FOLDER], 1);
options.excludeItems = aExcludeItems;
options.expandQueries = aExpandQueries;

var result = this.history.executeQuery(query, options);
result.root.containerOpen = true;
return asContainer(result.root);
},

See attachment #1 for the stack to when we GC.

Later, I'll crash in nsNavHistoryContainerResultNode::CloseContainer() because result point to freed memory. See attachment #2 for the stack

Not, this is obviously not 100% reproducable, depending on when GC runs.
(I think cyen didn't see it with a new profile, but did with an old one.)

To fix this, in nsNavHistoryContainerResultNode, make mResult be a nsCOMPtr instead of a regular nsNavHistoryResult *. This way, mResult won't get collected until the node is no longer referenced.

I'll attach a patch.
