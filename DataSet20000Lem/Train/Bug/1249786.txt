Sanitize on startup prefs are broken
Once we complete a sanitize on shutdown we set privacy.sanitize.didShutdownSanitize to true

We never unset it, and on startup we do:

+ if (Preferences.has(Sanitizer.PREF_SANITIZE_DID_SHUTDOWN)) {
+ // Firefox crashed before having a chance to sanitize during shutdown.
+ // (note that if Firefox crashed during shutdown sanitization, we
+ // will hit both `if` so we will run a second double-sanitization).
+ yield Sanitizer.onShutdown();
+ }

this is quite wrong, since we will always have that pref set!

didShutdownSanitize indicates that a shutdown sanitize succeeded
sanitizeInProgress indicates that a sanitize failed

so if we don't have didShutdownSanitize, but we have sanitize on shutdown, mean we were interrupted and also sanitizeInProgress will be set.
if sanitizeInProgress is set, we were interrupted, but it may have not been a shutdown sanitize.

In practice when a sanitization fails sanitizeInProgress is always set, didShutdownSanitize along with sanitizeOnShutdown tell u it wa a shutdown sanitization. in both case we should sanitize on startup.

Ideally didShutdownSanitize is no more needed with sanitizeInProgress, but we will keep it for add-on compat.
