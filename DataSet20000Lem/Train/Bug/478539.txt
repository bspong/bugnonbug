Whitelist Cookies cleared after restart of FF 3.0.6

I observed that cooky vanished although they are mentioned in a whitelist. The cleared cooky are on the whitelist since FF2 and there were no trouble until the last FF update to 3.0.6.
Reguarly I order FF to clear all cooky except the cooky on the whitelist.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the above example (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?symb=LNUX) change the timeframe to 5 year
2. Store chart setting and confirm with ok
3. You can see the new cookie in cooky sqlite
4. Make "bigcharts.marketwatch.com" and "marketwatch.com" whitelist member
5. Make a copy of cookies.sqlite

When the cooky disappeared I restored the cookies.sqlite file and all seems ok for a few new start (maybe 3-5) of FF. Then the cooky got lost again.
Actual Results:
The cooky vanished after a few starts, mean the timeframe of the showed chart shrink to one year again.

Expected Results:
There should be no change, mean the timeframe of the chart should be 5 year a long a the cookie is on the whitelist.
