Autoscroll (clicking the middle mouse button and moving the mouse) performance
is much slower and jerkier than other form of scrolling on the same page,
including using the scroll bar, or rolling the mouse wheel.

This ha been discussed before and if I recall correctly I believe that it may
have been blamed on the partially transparent icon that is visible during
autoscroll. I believe the performance wa improved a bit a couple of version
ago. However, the performance is still significantly poorer than using the
scroll bar, so there is still something wrong.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Autoscroll on a web page, particularly a long one like the example URL


Actual Results:
Significantly slower and jerkier than using the scroll bar, or using the mouse
wheel.

Expected Results:
Smooth and fast scrolling.

If this problem really is due to the semi-transparent autoscroll icon, then this
could be indicative of poor performance in general of rendering semi-transparent
image and moving them. In that case the problem would be due to rendering
speed, but a workaround would be not to use a semi-transparent icon for the
autoscroll icon.

Unfortunately, the dreaded MSIE autoscrolls much more smoothly on the same pages.
