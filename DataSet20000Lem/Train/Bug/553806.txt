When I use Firefox to download the Roxio Creator 2010 & 2010Content install file from the Roxio website these .exe files, after decompressing, open HP Update install shield Wizard instead of the correct Roxio installer. Wheh I use Internet Explorer to do the download, the file open the correct Roxio installer and load correctly. This could drive user back to IE. I have not had this problem with any other downloads. My computer is a Sony VGN FZ140E running Vista.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just download these file (requires that you pay for the software - or contact Roxio)
2.double click to open, let the file unzip, and then the HP Update install shield wizard opens.
3.


Expected Results:
The download should have opened Roxio's install program - it doe when I use IE to download.

Roxio Technical support know about this a of yesterday - but they and I wasted more than 8 hour of my time trying all kind of other fixes.
