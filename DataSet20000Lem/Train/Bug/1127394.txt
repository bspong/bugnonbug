Cannot close single tab after choosing to remain on page (from onbeforeunload dialog)
Reproducible with:
- Firefox 38 Nightly latest - BuildID: 20150128101733

NOT Reproducible with:
- Firefox 35.0.1
- Firefox 36 Beta latest
- Firefox 37 Aurora latest

Reproducible on: Windows 7 x64, Mac OS X 10.9.5, Ubuntu 12.04 x86

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and go to http://dolske.net/mozilla/tests/prompt/onbeforeunload.html (make sure it's the only tab).
2. Chose to close the tab (click "x" or Ctrl+W).
3. In the prompt that appears click "Stay on Page".
4. After the dialog is dismissed, attempt to once again close the tab (click "x" or Ctrl+W).

Expected results:
The onbeforeunload dialog should once again display asking whether to leave or remain on the page.

Actual results:
Nothing happens.

Notes:
- this scenario used to work for previous version (where bug 305085 is not yet fixed). However, there wa a variation of this scenario where this issue wa showing also for older versions: prior to the fix for 305085, in the scenario above we display the dialog 2 times, and if you click "Leave" and then "Stay" on the second prompt, then this bug also reproduces there.
- choosing to close the window still work a expected, a the dialog display and work correctly
- trying this scenario with more tab work fine... it's just the one remaining tab that cause this issue
