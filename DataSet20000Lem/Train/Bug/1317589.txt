Sync report a zero'd UID and no device ID on transient error renewing token
From the sync ping we can often see a UID with all zeros. There are 2 main time we see this:

a) When sync fails with a network error. My speculation here is that the token ha expired normally, then sync fails trying to fetch a new token a part of the sync. At that point we've lost the hashed uid. This seems likely to happen when the PC appears to have been put to sleep during the sync - the laptop wakes, immediately notice the token expiry and try to fetch a new one before the network ha reconnected.

b) Around 7% of syncs that fail with a shutdownerror also seem to have a zero'd UID. This is harder to guess about, but it may be the same basic issue - token ha expired and fetching a new token fails. Another edge-case might be (a) user shuts down but one of various bug cause shutdown to take a long time, (b) during this time the timer fire and we have an expired token, then fail to get one (bug 1317587)

I think we should fix the underlying cause here by storing the hashed UID in memory and *not* discarding it on token expiry under the assumption we will get the same UID. We *will* discard it on sync reset, a new login, etc. That should almost certainly fix (a) and will hopefully fix (b) and we'll let telemetry tell u whether it did.

Blocking bug 1301389, a otherwise that bug will cause a ping to be submitted in these transient case which we don't want.
