(Option to) disable "I'm feeling lucky" Google search in address bar for Mac build

From Safari, Internet Explorer and every other browser I've used on the
Macintosh, I expect, when I type "example" into the location bar and press
Return, that I'm taken to "http://www.example.com/". I do not expect for a
Google search of "example" to be performed and to be shown the first result.

Camino 0.8.4 and Mozilla 1.8b1 both meet my expectation in this regard, while
Firefox 1.0.4 doe not.

Actually I expect that the browser would first try "http://example/" and, if
that fails, then try "http://www.example.com/", and if that fails, then display
an error dialog. Firefox seems to do the first part of this, but then go to
the Google search.

I have read in bug 233853 that I can apparently hold Control while pressing
Enter to skip the Google searching and instead go to www.example.com. However
this doe not work on my Mac. (By the way, even if I were on a PC where this
feature presumably works, I'm not sure how I wa meant to discover that it exists.)

If the behavior of searching Google and returning the first result is deemed
useful and will not be removed entirely, then there need to be an option to
turn it off, and it need to be off by default in the Mac build of Firefox, to
match Macintosh user expectations.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access the URL "example"
Actual Results:
A Google search for "example" is performed and the first result (currently
"http://javascript.internet.com/") is shown.

Expected Results:
I expected to see "http://www.example.com/".
