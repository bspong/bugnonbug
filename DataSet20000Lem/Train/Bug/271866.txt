After upgrading from version 0.9 to 1.0, some web page are failing to load
images. Not all images, just some border images. You should probably see what
I'm talking about, e-mail me and I'll send you some screenshots. I've tried
wiping all trace (including registry) that I could find clean and
re-installing, but there's evidently something that I'm missing because fresh
installs of ANY version now have this problem. Installing on a virtual machine
I get normal browsing, and I haven't been able to reproduce the situation,
however once in this state, I can't seem to get out of it. I've even tried
clearing out my HOSTS file (which wa a good 400k, I've got a backup for when I
can fix this problem).

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install version 0.9
2. Wait until you notice that 1.0 is out (saw it on /.)
3. Update and check out some web pages.

Actual Results:
Large number of image would fail to load on webpages, oftentimes resulting in
poorly formatted pages. Viewing in MSIE or a VM with Firefox showed that page
looked normal.

Expected Results:
Loaded all image cleanly displaying the webpage a intended.

I'm submitting this a a Minor bug because nobody else seems to be whining about
it, and it's not really stopping me from using Firefox. I did try to go back to
IE for about a week, but found myself screaming obcenities after clicking the
middle mouse button to open a new tab only get get the stupid scroll thingie.
