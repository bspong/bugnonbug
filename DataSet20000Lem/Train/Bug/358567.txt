Bug occurs when I have more than one tab open and one of them is Gmail with Gmail Chat active. If anyone sends me a message while I'm looking at some other tab, no notification sound play and when I go back to Gmail tab the message I just received is not visible. If the chat box wa not open, it will pop up a it should, but the message is still invisible. This bug doe not occur in version prior to 2.0 and in latest build Minefield. I have friend who got Gmail to work correctly in FF2 in the same circumstances, but I also found some FF2 user who have the same problem a I do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Gmail, log in and enable Gmail Chat.
2. Open any other site in another tab.
3. Go back to Gmail tab and ask someone to send you a message. Quickly switch to the other tab (before the message arrives).
4. Give your friend enough time to send you a message and then return to Gmail tab.
5. The message will not be there. If you closed the chat box it will pop back up but there will be no new message in it. You can see the invisible message with "recent conversations" option.

Actual Results:
The message doesn't display in the chat box.

Expected Results:
The message should display in chat box.
