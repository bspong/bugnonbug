Firefox 2 RC 1 http-encodes some character (including spaces) twice when doing Google 'Browse By Name", making it fail

When doing a search in the location bar that result in a Google 'browse by name' search, Firefox encodes the % in the already http-encoded results. This cause the keyword search to fail for all search which contain these characters, including any with spaces.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "moo cow" (without the quotes) in the location bar and press enter
2. Firefox briefly show moo%20cow
3. Firefox then go to the Google Browse By Name search
4. Firefox re-encodes the % in the already encoded moo%20cow, and instead end up making the keyword in the URL be moo%2520cow
5. The Google search come up (because this particular example doe not autocomplete), and the resulting search on Google is for the text "moo%cow" not "moo cow" (all without quotes)

Actual Results:
Google search for "moo%cow"

Expected Results:
Google search for "moo cow", a originally typed.

This appears to be a regression from 1.5 - didn't file it earlier because I thought it wa so obvious it had to have been filed already.

This really ha to block Firefox 2, because it make all keyword search including space (and some other character - I imagine all those that get http-encoded) fail, and make u look really silly.

I don't think this should be hard to fix, I imagine it's just a case of evaluating which encoding step wa not needed. Best probably to see how Firefox 1.5 did it.
