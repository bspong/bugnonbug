Middle Click "Back" and "Forward" button should jump to next domain

Since middle-click on the "Back" and "Forward" button is currently
non-functional, I propose that this should adopt a new behavior of going Back to
the previous domain (or Forward, I will abbreviate by just referring to "Back"
here, you can assume that I'm implying the reverse behaviour for "Forward").

Opera introduce "Fast-Forward" and "Rewind" button to the browser genre in
version 7.5, which performs this functionality. While powerful and useful, it
doe require additional button be present on the toolbar. Since Firefox is
already encouraging the use of "middle click" (close tab, for example), it would
make sense to extend middle-click (alternate click) functionality to other part
of the UI.

There is an extension available for FX which mimicks the Opera 'extra buttons'
implementation.

Forward is arguably le useful than Domain-Back, but if implemented should be
provided for consistancy, even if it were used more rarely.

Expected Results:

Jumping back and forward by entire domain is useful when browsing forum and
blogs, and most type of site. Consider searching Google for a type of page.
You'd click on the top match, check out the site, but might look at a good
number of page before deciding to jump back to your starting place. Rather than
multiple click on the Back arrow, or choosing the back drop down, a single
middle click is both faster and intuitive for user introduced to using the
middle button by other Firefox functionality.
