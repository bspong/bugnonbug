Wheneven I'm managing the bookmark using bookmark manager, I drag a bookmark to
it new location (mouse drag) for normal organization of bookmark like
classification etc.

The bookmark stick in it new place properly. However, apart of this, the
bookmark is also opened in the same tab and bookmark manager becomes history
(literally, a you need to go back in history to go back to bookmark manager).

This is very annoying a after every bookmark move, the bookmark load and I
have to do history back to get back to bookmark manager.

Also, I remember, Earlier we were able to drag folder in new location on toolbar
itself. That no longer happens now. What happened on that front.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load Bookmark manager (Bookmarks->Manage..)
2. Drag a bookmark (in right pane) from folder "foo" to it new location in
folder "bar".


Actual Results:
The bookmark move from foo to bar.
However, bookmark also load in manager tab.

Expected Results:
Two choice
1. Bookmark should only be loaded in case of click and not in case of drag.
2. In manager window/tab, bookmark should never be loaded (since it is bookmark
manager afterall and not a sidebar)
