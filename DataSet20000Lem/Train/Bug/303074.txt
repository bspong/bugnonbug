I am running Firefox for Mac and have discovered the following bug.

When using the command: File>Send Link...

My email editor (Mail) will open and the link will appear correctly inserted in
the emamil. However, the recipient of the email usually receives the URL with a
space inserted, thereby disabling the link.

These link will get sent correctly:
http://www.engadget.com/
http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000057052775
http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html

These link do not:
http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/announcements/index.php#aim-hax0red-or-fuks0rd-fiks0rd-115317
(space inserted after third "-" -- after "...hax0red-or")

(space inserterd after "?")

It appears that certain character (?, -, | ) trigger this behavior.






Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
See above.

Seems to occur only with complex/long URLs which contain certain characters,
such a "?" "-" "|"

Actual Results:
This link:
http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/science/space/02nasa.html?hp&ex=1123041600&en=9382d2755684e5f3&ei=5094&partner=homepage

Will appear in the received email as:
http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/02/science/space/02nasa.html?
hp&ex=1123041600&en=9382d2755684e5f3&ei=5094&partner=homepage




Expected Results:
No space inserted in the sent URL
