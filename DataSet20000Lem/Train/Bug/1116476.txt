after day of use, often get "unable to connect" or stuck on "looking up"
This could be hard to reproduce. Used browser a normal, except I did not close it for a week. Mostly, I do not use tabs, I open new windows. I also clean up every once in a while, and close many but not all the windows. This is Firefox 34.0 under a 64bit Lubuntu OS, so it's the Ubuntu canonical branded version. For extensions, I have Adblock Edge 2.1.7, Hide Tab Bar With One Tab 1.4, Textarea Cache 0.9.3.2, and the Ubuntu one that wa installed by default, Ubuntu Firefox Modifications 2.9. Also have 7 plugins all related to playback of video.

Loading of web page became slower and slower. After about a week, Firefox will not fetch anything from the Internet, though it seems able to do everything else a normal. Each window I have trying to reach a website is stuck on "looking up www.google.com" or whatever the website is. Before reaching this point, I would sometimes get an "Unable to connect" screen, which a refresh fixed. Firefox appears to be working normally except for this. Windows that already have content loaded continue to work mostly a normal, except that web page that update themselves (like slashdot.org) no longer update. Even the Addons screen never loads, just say "looking up services.addons.mozilla.org..." in the lower left corner, while a spinner spin endlessly in a little box with the word "Loading..." in the center of the window. I can still bring up new windows, and open HTML file I have stored locally. I can ping, and connect to web site with Chromium at the same time that Firefox is stuck, so the problem is not with my connection, it must be Firefox. I tried removing all the cooky I'd accumulated, and that did not help. I do not know if trying to load a page from 127.0.0.1 would work a I don't have a web server running on my box at the moment. Finally, I closed the browser and launched it again. Then Firefox wa able to retrieve web page a quickly a normal.
