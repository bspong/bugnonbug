Start menu task jumplist not always updated when browser start

Start menu jump list with missing task

When minefield is closed the task on the start menu jump list just ha 'Enter Private Browsing'. When minefield is running the task list is supposed to have the additional item 'Open new tab' & 'Open new Window'

There is an intermittent issue where the additional entry are not added to the jump list when minefield is running. This only appears to happen on the start menu jump list, and never on the taskbar jump list.

I include a screenshot of minefield running with the start menu jumplist missing items.

This problem can be intermittent, and the jumplist state appears to be consistent in a browser session, only on browser restart will the state switch between working and broken.

Looks like bug 594821 - delay initial jump list update may be the culprit. A patch wa pushed that day despite the bug having been renamed and currently still open.

At lease one other person ha confirmed they are seeing this on mozillazine, however others can't reproduce.

Not sure of the correct component, maybe a core thing, please move a necessary.
