Links in hotmail message behave differently than on FF 1.0.7
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5 RC3

When there is a link in an email in a hotmail message, FF 1.0.7 open it up in a new window, while FF 1.5RC3 open it in the same window.
I liked the 1.0.7 behaviour better - I will not loose my hotmail window that way.
Also, the right-click menu doe not include "Open in new window" link.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Send yourself a mail to hotmail that includes a link (bugzilla link work like this for me).
2. Just go to hotmail and open up an email that contains the link.
3. Click the link.

Actual Results:
Link open in the same window (very bad because of forum You will have to back up a lot to get back to the hotmail inbox).
Right click menu messed up.

Expected Results:
Open the clicked link in a new window.
Right click menu to contain the same item a in 1.0.7 (particularly the "Open in new window" item).

I changed the Build Identifier (User Agent) to refer to FF 1.5RC3 because I am using FF 1.0.7 here atm (where I actually verified the different behaviour).
If You need further info or testing - let me know.
Thanks!
