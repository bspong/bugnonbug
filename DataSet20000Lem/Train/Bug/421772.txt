I accidentally deleted the 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder from bookmark manager. Now if I use the 'star' button in locatioon bar to bookmark a page, the bookmark doesn't appear in bookmark sidebar or bookmark manager. Recreationg 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder doesn't help. But, if the previously 'starred' page appears in location bar drop-down list, it show that the star is set, like it should be.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 'Library' bookmark manager.
2. Delete 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder.
3. Close the 'Library'
4. Open 'Bookmarks' sidebar
5. Load a web page that wasn't previously bookmarked.
6. Activate the 'Star' button in location bar.
7. Create 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder manually.
8. Repeat step 5,6
Actual Results:
1. The star activates (changes color)
2. The bokmark for the page doesn't appear anywhere in sidebar.
3. The bookmark doesn't appear anywhere in 'Library'

Expected Results:
1. The star activates (changes color)
2. If the 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder is present, the bokmark for the page should be added to the 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder in the sidebar and in the Library.
3. If the 'Unfiled Bokkmarks' folder wa deleted, the bookmark should be added to the root folder, or 'Unfiled Bookmarks' folder should be recreated and the bookmark should be inserted into it.
