This is the second time this ha happened in the last couple of months. I click the upper right x to close Firefox, immediately get a blue screen for le than a second (not enough time to read anything), then screen go dark and shortly reboot starts. After letting everything get initalized, I start Firefox. All bookmark and search engine are gone. I close Firefox and look in my profile. I have not made a lot of bookmark since I lost seven year of bookmark in the first crash. Both the .html and .bak file are 31K. I double click the .html to have a look at it. The page is blank. I close Firefox. I see both file length change to 1 KB.

I'd be glad to provide more data if anyone care to work on this.

From looking at bug about bookmarks, i take it this is two problems: Something caused the crash. The longstanding habit of deleting bookmark and the like in various circumstandes ha not been fixed.
