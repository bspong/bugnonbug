I use jquery and it blockUI plugin for my pages. One of my page had the issue described below, which is a note i posted on jquery forum. This issue is Firefox specific (IE8 wa okay).

Here is my post on jquery forum, and please feel free to contact me for more information:

The GIF image (animation, part of the block message) only show every other time for one of my page. When the image did not show, it wa completely missing from the page, and wa not any of the following: 1) the image showed but did not animate, or 2) the image did not show, but a placeholder wa showed for broken link etc.

I initially suspected that efficiency might have been the problem and there wa not enough time for the browser to load the animation. Since I noticed the every-other-time pattern, I moved away from that thought.

I think that this is more likely a Firefox issue, but still would like to post the question here, maybe someone had seen this before.

I use the latest version of Firefox, jquery and blockUI.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
GIF Animation (part of the blockUI block up message) show only every other time.


Since my site requires login, even if I provide you the URL it won't be useful...
