Windbg Log for Amazon's "Throbber freezes" and "plugin-container.exe" crash Bug.

Very distantly related Bugs: Bug 335058, Bug 448832.

When loading Pages on Amazon it us JavaScript to load the Images for Items being displayed. On SOME Pages the JavaScript cause a "Warning: Unresponsive script:" message. It also may cause the "plugin-container.exe" to crash, popping up the "Microsoft Error Reporter" IF you have other Tabs open with Flash Player (like YouTube).



I started at this URL: http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_pg_3?rh=n%3A172282%2Cp_4%3ACanon%2Cp_36%3A50000-250000&page=3&bbn=172282&sort=-price&ie=UTF8&qid=1319415029 and I scrolled down to the bottom of the Page and clicked [next] a dozen times.

As the Pages continue to increment the "Amazon Throbber" (center screen) will often (but not always) slow down. The "Amazon Throbber" often pause for an extended period of time (2-4 seconds) before completing and loading all the images.

The "Amazon Throbber" should spin smoothly, since it is pausing that is JavaScript hanging and not slow Internet connection (my Internet is quick).

Eventually the "Amazon Throbber" will lockup and Nightly's "Warning: Unresponsive script" message will keep popping up.


When I get this far (from Page 20 or higher) this is the URL:

http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_pg_3?rh=n%3A172282%2Cp_4%3ACanon%2Cp_36%3A50000-250000&page=3&bbn=172282&sort=-price&ie=UTF8&qid=1319415029#/ref=sr_pg_18?rh=n%3A172282%2Cp_4%3ACanon%2Cp_36%3A50000-250000&page=18&bbn=172282&sort=-price&ie=UTF8&qid=1319415271

that Nightly hungs with this message:

"
Warning: Unresponsive script

(?) A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now,
or you can continue to see if the script will complete.
"

You MIGHT need to start at the first URL given and keep scrolling to the bottom of the Page and using the [Next] Link on the Page to "build up" to the point where whatever is overloaded fails - using the _second_ URL given directly and not 'nexting' your way through to the next Page (Page 20) may NOT "build up" to the issue.


Script: http://z-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/browser-scripts/DAE-us/DAE-us-1056997335.js._V167677772_.js:123 (and line 596)
"


As I continue from Page 20 onward I keep getting the "Warning: Unresponsive script" message with only a single Tab open. When I am at Page 22 I get the "Warning: Unresponsive script" message over a half dozen time before I can continue.

When I tried to exit the Site to come here to report this Bug the "Warning: Unresponsive script" message popped up a dozen time and I could not leave the Site without aborting the Script.


With multiple Tabs (EG: Flash Player from YouTube) it is at this point that the "plugin-container.exe" will (usually) crash.


I am enclosing a Windbg Log and used "wget" to grab the JavaScript that cause the message.
