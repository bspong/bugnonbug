[proto] area around tab border lack transparency

screenshot showing problem

In Proto, tab border get drawn by image like tab-left.png, and these image contain both the tab border themselves and a little bit of the area around the borders. But the area around the border in the image is non-transparent, even though it is the same color a the underlying tab container that surround the tabs.

This is not just unnecessary, it make it hard for extension (and themes, when Proto becomes the default theme) like Personas to simply change the background of the tab container, since the area around the border retains the default background color.

See the attached screenshot for an example of the problem. In it, the Personas extension ha changed the background of the tab container, but the area around the tab retains it default background.

That area should be transparent so that extension and theme can easily modify the tab container background.

(Related but probably different issue: the border at the bottom of the tab container get drawn by the image a well, so extension that modify the tab container background remove the border in area of the container that don't have tab but don't remove it from area that do have tabs. That border should be drawn by CSS so that it can be modified independently.)
