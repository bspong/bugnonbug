XUL Template Builder cannot rebuild with Places datasource once database ha changed
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042807 Iceweasel Firefox/2.0.0.4 (Debian-3.0.9-1)

Once Firefox ha accessed it Places database it seems to acquire some kind of lock or some other problem occurs that precludes an XUL Template from using it a a datasource.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
01. Create a new profile
02. Install any extension (I used Firebug, so further direction will use it a example)
03. Restart and then close (so the extension's fully installed)
04. Copy the provided bug.xul and bug.js (see attachments) to the extension's content folder
In the case of Firebug that's extensions/firebug@software.joehewitt.com/content/firebug
05. Start Firefox
06. Open the bug.xul in the location bar.
For Firebug that's chrome://firebug/content/bug.xul
07. Note the list is built and there are item present.
08. Right click on the "Getting Started" item in the Bookmarks Toolbar
09. Select "Properties" and modify the name of the bookmark. Save.
10. Click the "rebuild" button in the bug.xul pane.

Actual Results:
All generated content disappears.

Expected Results:
The content to be rebuilt with the updated data.

You can go to about:config and set javascript.options.showInConsole to true; then the error console will display an error: "builder is null"

You can also restart Firefox and this time modify a bookmark before ever opening the bug.xul. Then when you open it, the content is not initially built.
