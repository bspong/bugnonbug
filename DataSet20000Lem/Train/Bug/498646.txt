Restoring a session with multiple tab to the same web site is VERY VERY VERY slow
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30618)

I have only seen this problem starting with the latest version of the browser (3.0.11). My typical session ha several tab that are connected to various page within the same site (it is a discussion forum with multiple threads).
I typically have several tab open (about 100 of them). Now, when I restore the session, it take almost 8 minute for all the tab to be restored. This wa never the case in previous version of the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up a browser window with several tab going to different page on the same web site.
2. Shut down the browser asking it to save the session.
3. Restart the browser and restore the previous session
4. Sit back and wait FOR EVER for the browser to come up.
Actual Results:
Took 8-10 minute for the browser to come up. The problem were only with the tab going to the same site a though the request were single threaded (I may be completely wrong about the implementation underneath).

Expected Results:
In previous versions, the whole process would only take a couple of minute at best (same number of tabs, same web site).
