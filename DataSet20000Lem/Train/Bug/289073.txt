Mouse selection followed by changing tab cause temporary freeze until focus is changed
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050405 Firefox/1.0.2

If I select some text using the mouse and then switch to a different tab, then
*some* of the time the UI freeze totally. If I alt-tab away from firefox to
some other X11 application, and then alt-tab back again, it carry on going a
though nothing had happened.

I've tried both Firefox 1.02 and the nightly build a of 5th April '05 (the
latter core dumped when I tried this rather than freezing).

The webpage involved don't seem to matter - I've even seen it with the
'about:config' page. But it is very intermittent - repeating with the same
combination of page will often work fine.

Sometimes it's just a bit slow (takes a second or so to switch tabs) but this
isn't the same thing, AFAIK.

I'm running Debian 3.1 with kde3.3.2, xfree86 4.3.0.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a second tab
2. Go back to the first tab
3. Select some text with the mouse
4. Switch to the second tab (with the mouse).

Actual Results:
UI froze until I alt-tabbed to a different X11 application and then alt-tabbed
back again.

Expected Results:
Should have carried on responding.
