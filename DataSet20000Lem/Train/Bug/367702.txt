come and go - right now I have 2 browser open with multiple tab - both have a weather.com page open and one look good and the other is all expanded...
The page format seems to get's lost, the dropdowns & listbox(s) are all expanded (dropdown list is not compresed into the box), (scrolled listbox data not concealed within box)
I have opened new browser both before and after a re-boot and sometimes the new browser will look OK, other time (more often than not) it will retain the 'expanded' look - - - I just ignore it
Then 2, 3, 4 browser later all is back to normal for a while?????

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Actual Results pane = page source of good page
2.Expected Results pane = page source of bad "expanded" page
3.
Actual Results:
Page Source of another tab in this browser - look OK:

TOO Big 65K max - I got cut off...


Expected Results:
Page Source of another tab in a different browser that is all "expanded":

TOO Big - same a above...

I entered my zip code 77095 on the home page, then on the zip code page I used the MyNeighborhood tab to select Local Schools, then CyFalls . Error come and goes. If you get to happen try to hover over the expanded list on the top left of the screen and portion dissapear - take a page re-load to get them back and so far they have always come back expanded. Is this just me?
