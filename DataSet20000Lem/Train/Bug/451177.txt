z-index ignores the nesting level of the element

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create two separate divs(div1 and div2), div1 with z-index: 1 and div2 with z-index: 2 and position them absolutely so they overlap and color them both differently
2. in each div create another 2 divs(div11 in div1 and div22 in div2) and this time in the first one(div11) should have z-index 200 and the second(div 22) z-index:100 and again color them so they show.
3.
Actual Results:
Div11 is above div22 even though div2 is above div1.

Expected Results:
In firefox 2 series this did not happen. The z-index worked within the container element much like gtk/qt/microsoft nested gui controls.

This is used mainly in js/ajax heavy application where you want to move stuff around and make use of position absolute and z-index.
For whom it may concern:
A possible workaround is not to use z-index which will cause hazzardous result and to remove the element from it's parent and append it to the former parent so that it is the last element.
Example j code:
var myelement = document.getElementById('mymovingdiv');
var myparent = myelement.parentNode;
myparent.removeChild(myelement);
myparent.appendChild(myelement);
