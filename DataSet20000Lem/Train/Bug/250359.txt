If I have opened a pdf-file in Firefox, it is showing like it should.

When I open a pdf-file which is located on my desktop (or any other folder),
Acrobat Reader is opened and show my local pdf-file.

Now, I close Acrobat Reader (with my local pdf) and a a result, the pdf-file
showing in firefox before ha gone away.

It seems that Acrobat Reader closes/unloads all of it's plugins/processes.
