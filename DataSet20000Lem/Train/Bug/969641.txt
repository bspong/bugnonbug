Click to play method of enabling JAVA for a specific site fails to retain the customer desire to "Allow and Remember"
Created attachment 8372595
Example of the "Allow and Remember" sequence that I think is NOT saving customer desired solution.

When I a a user try to enable a known Java applet in the FireFox 26, 27, or 28 build it continues to block the Java applet. The FF application doe not retain my desire to run this applet. Browser page are closed automatically and restarted but the applet continues to be blocked and continues to offer the "Allow and Remember" option but the browser doe not honor that request.

Replication:
1 - Authenticate into a LMS / Skill port system to review a learning course.
2 - Expected a popup indicating that this requires user authentication to run Java because it's considered to be insecure.
3 - Authenticate or approve.
4 - Top left of next window show icon indicating that FF ha blocked access.
5 - AGAIN authenticate to "Allow and Remember" this should be an application that's to be run.
6 - Browser request resend, authorize.
7 - Browser closes.
8 - Retry and process repeats.

** NOTE I cannot put my company credential in this format, but Skill port and other Learning Management Systems will likely exhibit this issue. **

Expected Results:
We should ask the first time, a Internet Explorer does. After the user ha authorized the applet to run we should retain the customer desired choice.

Actual Results:
The end user customer is authenticating and want to enable the JAVA applet. Even if the end user know it's quite possibly an insecure app. We are not honoring the customer's request to enable the JAVA applet.


Additional data, I have:
** Changed the about:config setting for Javascript.enable == True. (Yes I know Java and Javascript are not the same thing I am trying everything here)

** Changed the java control panel applet within control panel set to LOW. (to test)

** Changed Add-ons Java platform within FF set to "Always Activate"

** Within Java control panel security I have added all URL's for the LMS I am using. MS-IE / 11 always works. FF always fails.

** Reviewed the suggestion in the following, none resolved this issue.

and

** Works with MS Internet Explorer 11- 64 bit or 32 bit on Win-7 / 64.
