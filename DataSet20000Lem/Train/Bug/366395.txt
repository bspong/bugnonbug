We have math quiz software that generates HTML. Frequently, large round or square bracket are needed. These are built from unicode glyphs. The thing is in early version of Mozilla such large bracket displayed just fine, but the more recent
version of Firefox just display question marks. Here is a code fragment with
large round brackets:

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td align="left" nowrap="nowrap">
= f </td><td class="cl" align="left">&#63723;<br>&#63725;
</td><td align="center" nowrap="nowrap">
g(x)</td><td class="cl" align="left">&#63734;<br>&#63736;
</td><td align="center" nowrap="nowrap">
</td></tr></tbody></table></td><td width="50%"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="50%"></td><td colspan="1" align="right" nowrap="nowrap"><table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td align="left" nowrap="nowrap">
</td></tr></tbody></table>

The glyph with entity #63xxx for various value of x appear to be unknown
to Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the Character Encoding to Western (ISO-8859-1)
2. Put the code fragment above inside (where the dot are) <html><body>...</body></html>
3. It's supposed to render as: = f( g(x) )
where the outer bracket are large ones.
Actual Results:
The latest Firefox render both large bracket a question marks.

An early version of Mozilla:

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.0.0) Gecko/20020605, build 20020605
1

display both bracket fine, whereas a later version rv: 1.7.8 for Linux display the opening large bracket fine but print some strange screwed up
mess for the closing bracket. All more recent version of Firefox simply display
question marks.

Expected Results:
I hoped for large brackets.
