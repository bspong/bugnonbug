Only 1 extra (other than Navigation and Bookmarks) toolbar show in FireFox when I have 2 installed

I installed a toolbar called "HSR Toolbar" for Firefox made by the program "ToolbarStudio" from this website: http://fanstuff.hrwiki.org/index.php/HSR_Toolbar
I also downloaded "ToolbarStudio" and made an additional toolbar of my own. However, when I installed the toolbar that I made, it replaced the "HSR Toolbar" in the FireFox browser window. I went to Tools/Extensions, and the HSR "Toolbar" is still there, but it doesn't show up in the FireFox browser window.
I tried to reverse the process by uninstalling both of the aforementioned toolbars and reinstalling them in the opposite order, but the "HSR Toolbar" ended up replacing my toolbar! Why can't both be used at the same time?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download and install HSR Toolbar from http://fanstuff.hrwiki.org/index.php/HSR_Toolbar
2.Make a toolbar using ToolbarStudio (http://www.besttoolbars.net/toolbarstudio-custom-toolbar-software.php)
3.Convert the toolbar you made to work on Mozilla/FireFox (http://www.besttoolbars.net/toolbarstudio-custom-toolbar-software.php)
4.Install the toolbar

Actual Results:
The HSR Toolbar wa replaced with the toolbar I made.

Expected Results:
Both toolbars should have been in my FireFox web browser window.
