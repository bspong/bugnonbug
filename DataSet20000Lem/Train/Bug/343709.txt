Undo Close Tab menuitem ha only the following associations:

label = Undo Close Tab menuitem
accesskey = U

If one try to skin the menuitem using the accesskey, then the Uninstall button in the Addons manager loses it skin because it also ha accesskey = U.

The only remaining association is the label, which is in English.

This will fail in localization other than English.

Reproducible: Always




Note that the context menu us accesskey = U for the Undo function. There are apparently other item that use this accesskey. Do an attribute search in DOMi to see everything this access key is used for.

This Undo close Tab menuitem us the accesskey U to call the command undoCloseTab or something. Ideally it would be something along the line of:

undoCloseTabItem.setAttribute("command", undoCloseTab); or whatever the Undo Close Tabs command is.

This would allow u themers to put in a single selector to address the menuitem wherever it appears in the browser (e.g.--main context menu, History dropdown menu, tab context menu, etc.). We would use:

menuitem[command="undoCloseTab"] {etc.}
