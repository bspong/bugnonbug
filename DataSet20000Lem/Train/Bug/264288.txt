Links from other application don't launch Firefox when it is not already running
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041013 Firefox/0.10

When Firefox is set a the default browser on Mac OS X (10.3.5), clicking on a
link in an application (such a Thunderbird) doe not launch Firefox and open
the URL. Instead, seemingly nothing happens. No browser window opens, and the
dock icon never bounces. However, if Firefox is already running, the URL will
open in a new Firefox window or tab, depending on the preference (in my case,
the preference is set to open a new tab).

It is possible that this is a regression from bug 172962, which added the
preference on how to handle link launched from external applications. The
Mac-specific version of this patch wa checked in within the last two days.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure that there are no Firefox window open, and that Firefox is not
running.
2. Set Firefox a the default browser (in 10.3, through Safari), by explicitly
selecting the Firefox application from the Applications folder.
3. Click on a hyperlink in a program such a Thunderbird.
Actual Results:
Nothing happened...the dock icon never bounced to indicate that Firefox wa
starting, and no Firefox window appeared.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have launched, and a new window should have appeared with the
content of the URL that wa clicked in the external program.
