I spend a great deal of time on Yahoo. Lately, in the last week or so, my Firefox broswer (latest version) is extremely slow or won't load Yahoo pages. At first, I thought maybe my ISP's searching bot wa being updated but then I started surfing with Internet Explorer and it wa working normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
As soon a I access yahoo, the slowdown begin almost every time. I check my Internet explorer at the same time and the speed is fine.

Other site I access with Firefox work at normal speeds.




Actual Results:
As soon a I access yahoo, the slowdown begin almost every time. I check my Internet explorer at the same time and the speed is fine.

Other site I access with Firefox work at normal speeds.

Expected Results:
Same thing keep happening...

I have tried many different site on yahoo, including email, and I'm experiencing
problem with every page on that site I've tried to load so far.
