Submit crash report wont stay ticked Archive.zip

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

Two problems: 1) Firefox crashed, and it seemed a crash report wa submitted. But when I checked log on my machine there were 2 crash pending, so I checked about:crashes. The last 2 crash had failed due to timeout.

2) The tick "Submit crash reports" will not stay ticked. Once it is ticked and I close Firefox preferences, it is always unticked. This is even after I've restarted in Safe mode and gone back to all defaults. Firefox doe not have to be restarted for option to be unticked. This is how I started looking for crashreporter.app

I ran Apple Capture data, but it locked up then crashed while trying to collect and write files. The attached screen shot were taken while I wa running the Capture data.


Actual results:

I looked for crashreporter.app . I cannot find it anywhere on my Macbook Pro, looked in all directories.


Expected results:

Crashreporter.app should be some place where I can find it. Crashes should be reported.

NOTE: since this happened several day ago, I think I've been able to submit my old pending crashes.
