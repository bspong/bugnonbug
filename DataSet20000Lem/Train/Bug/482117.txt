After the update yesturday I have been getting the oddest bug the page will load okay for maybe 10-20 pages. Then it will just hang while trying to load I got fed up and pulled up IE which I hoped to never u again. When I load any page in IE the Firefox page will go through. So I can be sitting on the page trying to load in firefox for 10 minutes, have hit refresh many time to make sure it isn't a dropped packet etc. But the moment I visit a page in IE firefox start working like IE push the packet through.

Please note that I have a Killer Nic installed in my machine Things were working without problem before I updated firefox yesterday. I don't know know if it's something with my environment or what.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf 10-20 page will load fast a always
2. eventually it will just hang like it's trying to load
3. Then I go to ie on my other monitor and vist any page I haven't been to before (non-cached page) and the moment that load firefox will load it's page. Doesn't matter how long you wait before using IE firefox will wait that long then IE will make it happen
Actual Results:
Page load and I'm good for another 10-20 pages.

Expected Results:
Continued to load page without hang up.
