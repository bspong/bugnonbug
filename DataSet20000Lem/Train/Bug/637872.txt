Usually I'd like to keep my computer on a wired conection to my laptop computer at work, but sometimes I need to use a wireless network, I noticed everytime I change from one to another, I get an extreme slow response on Firefox, weird thing is if I close and save session, then open Firefox again, nothing happend, then open again, it open but the session is not restored, thanks for your attention, regard and keep up the good work.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Connect through a Wireless network and do some browsing
2.Change to a wired network and try to do some browsing
3.Close Firefox saving session and open again
Actual Results:
After network change, Firefox should be very slow, and after closing and saving session, then reopening, session is lost and Firefox won't open, you have to open it again.

Expected Results:
First there should be no problem with your browser if you change networks, browser shouldn't care of routing AFAIK, but even so, it should save session and restore it after you do it.
