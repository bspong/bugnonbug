Firefox 1.01 doesn't accept cooky from localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

This is a problem I've had with IE6 and now Firefox 1.01.
I do web development on my home machine, in Windows. I have an
apache server with PHP, I'm using ADODB to implement session cookies.
I'm using something like PHP 4.28, which is a pre-Pear build..

Anyhow, I like to connect to localhost:8080.. When I do in Firefox 1.0,
I can use session support to implement a login.. It work fine in
1.0, but 1.01 denise the cooky and redirects me back to the login
page I wrote.. The login page I made, basically validates, and throw a
session cookie on the browser.. When the browser come back, the cookie
contains PHPSESSID which key to a database field and restores the session
between the server and the client browser.. My experience is that IE6, which
also ha this problem that forefox 1.01 doe have now, ha
no problem when the server is running remotely, but when accessing localhost,
or even 127.0.0.1, the browser whether it IE6 or Firefox 1.01, will deny
the cookie..

I'm thinking it might be a new support for P3P, but I don't know how to diagnose
if it a lack of P3P..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start webserver on local machine
2. Write A Login Script that us PHP sessions, and PHP session cooky
3. Connect to Login script via Firefox 1.01, and try to login
4. If you cannot obtain a cookie, this is proof of the problem

Actual Results:
Session is lost because browser cookie is never registered,
for localhost.. I assume that the behaviour would be different
if using a remote server, but for localhost it fails to register..

Expected Results:
Retained session.

If this is a new security fix, tell me what I need to do
to my code to allow for localhost cooky on Firefox 1.01.
