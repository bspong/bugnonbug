attempt to run firefox-1.0.6 process on remote machine cause local process to start
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I have firefox-1.0.6 installed on a local linux machine and a remote linux
machine. I ssh from the local machine to the remote machine and issue the
command to start firefox-1.0.6. There is a wait of several second and then a
new firefox window start up on the local machine, with the process running on
the local machine, and with my local default homepage and other settings.

I want to achieve the same behaviour that I get with all other application that
I launch remotely, where the application is in fact running on the remote
machine but with the display sent to the local machine using X and ssh. In this
particular case I want to use the remote firefox process to access a web server
that cannot be accessed directly from the local machine.

On the remote machine I also have firefox-0.8 installed and it behaves
correctly, with the process running on the remote machine and the display window
sent to my local machine using the X/ssh protocol.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install firefox-1.0.6 in user directory for local and remote linux machine
2.ssh from local machine to remote machine.
3.try to start firefox-1.0.6 process running on remote machine using command
"./firefox-1.0.6/firefox-installer/firefox"

Actual Results:
After several second a new firefox window appears on the local machine,
complete with the local machine user account default settings, with the process
running on the local machine.

Expected Results:
As with all other applications, the process should have started to run on the
remote machine and the display should have been sent to the local machine using
the X/ssh protocol.
