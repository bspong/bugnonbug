Dear Firefox-Team!

We received this issue a an bug report ourselves - our customer complained that the page isn't correctly printable with Firefox running on Linux.

The print output leaf one or more page blank - funnily enough depending on the underlying operating system. On Windows, for example, it wa page 3 and on Linux page 2. Sometimes it also wa more than one page that wa missing.

The page aren't completly empty - the page number are there. But there is really data missing in the printout - if, e.g., page 2 is empty, and you compare page 1 and 3 there is exactly one page which should have been printed but is indeed empty.

In my test case the error happend every time - regardless of the operating sytem. It's reproducable on Mac, Win and Linux.

I asked the W3C validator about the page, and it find that the page is "Valid HTML 4.01 Transitional" - so there shouldn't be any problem with the html.

In addition, the printout work correctly in Safari, Opera, IE and Konqueror. So I really suppose there is an bug in the FF rendering engine - since Camino on Mac OS reveales the same behavior (at least one page on printout is blank).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the above URL in Firefox (regardless of the operating system)
2. Print it, or use print preview
3. One or more page should be blank
Actual Results:
One or more page are left blank.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have printed the page correctly.

Here I uploaded an PDF print output created with Firefox/Mac, which show the issue I described above.
