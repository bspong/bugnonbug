I have a new webpage, with videos, and when in Mozilla browser, the video won't play (Microsoft Media Player). So, I am informed that I probably don't have the most current plugins for the the medium player. So I go to Mozilla support, I look at the instruction for downloading the plug in. I follow all th einstructions, download the plug in, install the plug in. But when I check to see if it is installed, it isn't. And I still can't play the videos. So, I have tried this multiple times, removing the installed plug in each time, and despite the fact that my computer report that it is installed, and I have gone through the installation procedures, the "test installation" fails, a doe trying to view the video in my website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open mozilla
2.go to my webpage lifeskills4parents.com where video are supposed to play a soon a sign open (and they do in Internet Explorer)
3.videos fail to play
Actual Results:
Go to support page, frequently asked questions, Microsoft Media Player. Click on download plug in from Firefox or from Port 25. Click download. After downloaded, go to C drive to which I downloaded it, click on exe file. Takes me through the installation process. Go back to support page, frequently asked questions, Microsoft Media Player, click on test installation. Fails - say it isn't installed. Tried it multiple times, never installed; browser won't play video on the website

Expected Results:
plug in should be installed; test should indicate that it is installed, and video on the website should play from the Firefox browser.
