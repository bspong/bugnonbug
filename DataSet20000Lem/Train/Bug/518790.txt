If a website in 1 tab change status bar text via the use of Javascript and another website in another tab doesnt, then the status bar doesnt reset it content when switching to the other tab (the one that didnt change the status bar text)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new browser instance
2. Go to http://twitter.com/nicolefrance5 in tab #1
3. Go to http://www.clipmagic.com/ in tab #2
4. Wait until the clipmagic site start writing something in the status bar.
5. When it is in the middle of completing the sentence, switch to the other tab.
Actual Results:
It show the status bar that got changed from the clipmagic tab, giving the (misleading) impression a to it is this site that change the status bar text. Given a status bar text change when you have several open tabs, you wouldnt be able to tell exactly which tab is changing the status bar text.

Expected Results:
One tab <-> One status bar text area. Shouldnt affect other tabs' status bar text. They should read "Done" or the normal default.
