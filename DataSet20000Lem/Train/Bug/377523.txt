Firefox 2.0.3 (and earlier) on Windows XP SP2

When many, let say 90 tab are open which are spreaded across
a few Firefox window this happens:

- Switching with the mouse to other tab doesn't work anymore,
though changing the tab position with the mouse via
drag'n'drop work always and for every tab.
Switching to an other tab doe only work via keyboard.
Mouse hover blending-effects over tab work too.
- Clicking on the active tab work a supposed to:
the focus get to the active tab ( and then <- and -> can be used )
- The loading animation (the animated ring) isn't animated any more
- When switching to other tabs, the text in the location bar isn't updated
- The text in the location bar isn't updated by webpage either.
- If you have configured to start Firefox window with a blank page,
then newly opened firefox window are unusable.
There is a blank page and confirming typed-in address ha no effect
(neither with "enter" nor mouse) (i.e. no browsing is possible)
But if you have configured a startup-page for Firefox then
Firefox will try to open that page and
all other manually typed-in website will work too.
- Firefox need >85% cpu while idling


But now a positive report:
- In 2.0.1 there were many memory hole - the situation seems to have improved
