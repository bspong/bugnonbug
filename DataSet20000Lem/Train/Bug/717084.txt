Firefox doe not remember setting of spell checker language / Firefox us wrong language
Last time when visiting page X, I switched spell checker language to "german".
Several day later, when revisiting page X, spell checker language is not "german" any more but "english".
Spell checker language wa switched back to "english" automatically.

Using english Firefox with additional german dictionary.


I am not sure about the intended behavior, but in nearly all cases, this is a bug. My simple expectation was: I changed the language to "german", it will be "german" until I change it again - I am the master.


A) If Firefox should auto-detect the language of page X (bug 338427), it is broken. Page X state 'lang="de"' in HTML source.

B) If Firefox should remember spell checker language setting per page (bug 360668), it is broken. It didn't remember for page X.

C) If Firefox should remember spell checker language setting at all, it is broken. It didn't remember.

D) If Firefox is not supposed to remember spell checker language setting at all, this is strange behaviour. Please change it.



PS. Would be even better if Firefox were able to auto-detect the language from the text i entered. There are already several bug for this (e.g. bug 633911); all pointing back to bug 69687 (quite old one).
