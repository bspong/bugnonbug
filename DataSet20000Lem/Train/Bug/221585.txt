In Tools > Options there are 7 icon on the left. Clicking and releasing on an
icon will highlight in in a dark color indicating it is "active" in the window
on the right. You can mouse over any of the icon to get a lighter color highlight.

1) The first bug is found when you click and release on an icon to give it a
dark highlight, click and hold down another icon and drag that on top of another
icon. After that you will have two highlighted icons.

2) The second bug is easier to find. Click on any icon then click on the
"General" icon. You will get two highlighted items. "General" isn't even the
dark one, but it is the active section on the right.

3) To complicate the 2nd problem...follow those step then click and drag the
dark Highlighted icon over top of another icon. You will see the "General
Section" on the right with a completely different icon highlighted on the left
in dark color.
