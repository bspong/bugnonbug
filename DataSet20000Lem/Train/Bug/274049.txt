The 10 X 10 web site selects the 100 most mentioned and seen word and picture
from a variety of news source around the globe and coalesces them into a single
photographic grid that is refreshed every hour on the hour. The site work
properly with IE, launching the automated review of the 100 image a chosen by
user, but fails to launch the automation with Firefox 1.0 and Netscape 7.2.


Reproducible: Always

<a href=" http://www.tenbyten.org/now.html ">Click here</a
2.When site opens, click on, " >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Launch 10x10" at bottom
of picture grid.
3. You should receive an enhanced grid of 100 individually selcectable image
with a scrollable list on the right side of the grid containing individually
selectable descriptive word for each of the images...selecting a word from the
list should produce a popup window for the image with additional selection for
related headline storiew.....this doe not occur with either Firefox or Netscape.

Actual Results:
A web page containing this info appears:
"10x10
100 Words and Pictures that Define the Time.

The first and third line above are linked....clicking the first line link
"10x10" return you to http://www.tenbyten.org/now.html from whence you
originated....the process never launches.

a scrollable list on the right side of the grid containing individually
selectable descriptive word for each of the images...selecting a word from the
scrollable list should produce a popup window for the image with additional

Until I can access all site with Firefox, I must keep IE on my PC.......:(
