Firefox 3.0.6 for Windows retains old page data, and error check javascript code there, instead of the updated page data, while the browser actually display the correct updated page.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.View the Webpage
2.Click one of the floating Elements with red background
3.Click HideTag Button
4.Now it should have happened
5.If not, update the javascript in the page
6.Reload the page
7.Continue with step 1 until it happens
Actual Results:
After a little doctoring around with the javascript part, and successfully working with the changes, javascript error checking suddenly occurs on a far from recent version of the page( older source code of page, about 7 to 8 or even more update back ). The browser window however display the updated page ( updated source code can be viewed ).

Expected Results:
Check the actual code for error instead of the cached one.

Currently the only remedy that work for a while is rebooting window (probably clearing the RAM). Problem reproduced twice up to now. Problem also confirmed on external site.
