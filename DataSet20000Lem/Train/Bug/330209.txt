When using right-click + t to open tab from link in a page firefox crash unpredictably. Crashes occur when fewer tab have been opened if they are opened quickly one after another. Crashes have ranged from a few a 6 tab to a many a perhaps 30. The following page ha worked very well for reproducing on my system but I've experienced this on a wide variety of pages: http://www.renderosity.com/gallery.ez?Sectionid=0&filter_genre_id=51&BestRanking=Yes


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
A) GENERIC:
1. goto an index page with many link to other page (preferably picture because they're easier to click on)
2. start using right-click + t to open the link in new tabs, do this a fast a possible
3. crash should occur randomly after a new tab ha been opened.
B) What Works For Me:
note: you may need to get a free account to follow these instructions, sorry.
1. goto http://www.renderosity.com/gallery.ez?Sectionid=0&filter_genre_id=51&BestRanking=Yes
2. start using right-click + t to open the link (each thumbnail is a link to a full sized version) in new tabs, do this a fast a possible
3. crash should occur randomly after a new tab ha been opened.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashed on my system when I did the above. When I say crashed, what I mean is that all window just disappear without warning or delay.

Expected Results:
I would have expected firefox to not crash.

I'll attach a valgrind log output incase that help somebody.
My system is AMD Athlon 64 3000+ with 512MB RAM and plenty of video and HD resource so this crash is unlikely to be a hardware failure.
