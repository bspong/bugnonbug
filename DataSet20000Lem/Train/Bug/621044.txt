The website set some cookies. Don't mind that it ha adult content only. It is a serious site.
A user can add a model to his "Poppliste" by choosing a model and clicking on "POPPLISTE" at the upper edge of the girl's pic. When a user go to the website in another session he can open his list by clicking "Meine Poppliste" at the end of the navigation bar. That worked fine with the old FF. The list contained about 20 entries.
Two day ago I installed FF 4.0 Beta 7. FF 3.6.3 is still present luckily. When a user open the list it contains no entries. The cookie "poppliste" wa replaced by calling the page using this cookie. The bug appears in the old FF version a well in the Beta version. So I visited other website of which I have stored login data. The login do work so the cooky are okay.
It is highly curious that the installation of the Beta change the previous installation.
