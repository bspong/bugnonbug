Suddenly, I have lost my previous level of resolution on the webpages, dropping them to a lower content in available option and resolution. The problem is ongoing after refreshing the webpages, reloading Firefox 3.6, shutting down the computer and reloading Firefox 3.6.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.After this began, it now is re-occuring across all webpage which have any higher resolution and additional content.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
I have no idea how or why web page content and information suddenly dropped out, it happened suddenly during a web session, Firefox 3.6 suddenly dropped 1/3 of the content on the webpage being searched. Since I am totally aware of the total content on those web pages, I immediately noticed it. Refreshing the page had no effect. Reloading Firefox 3.6 had no effect. Shutting down the computer and reloading Firefox 3.6 had no effect. Using Google's Chrome Browser is my temporary answer and that work PERFECTLY at this time.


Expected Results:
I expected Firefox 3.6 to not be filled with serious problems, I wa wrong. Probably won't be the last time I am wrong.


Perhaps the rendering software took a dump, or a serious curve. Not sure, the Java machine in Firefox 3.6 doesn't appear to be stable enough to be entirely reliable? 1/3 of the content not being shown, displayed or perhaps not understood now by Firefox 3.6. It wa fine earlier today, and gone 3 hour of surfing later?
I'll use Chrome until Firefox 3.6 is seriously updated.
