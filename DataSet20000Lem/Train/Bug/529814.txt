I just upgraded to Windows 7 and V 3.5.5. Most everything is OK but when I open and input my location information for the TV guide website sometimes it remembers and sometimes it reverts back to the default which is the east coast. Sometimes I can click on the icon when it show the East coast and it will go to my area. Yahoo finance https://login.yahoo.com/config/login_verify2?.src=quote&.done=http%3a%2f%2ffinance.yahoo.com%2fp%3fk%3dtpf_pEVk.528iLJ3Mtw- also forgets my log in information and I have to constantly input my log in information. I have tried every fix I can fin on the internet from deleting the sqlite file to allowing cooky and reinstalling Firefox. Prior to my computer upgrade I wa running Vista and didn't have this problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:
Since it happens about 90% of the time the only way to reproduce is to close FF then reopen. However sometimes it go to where I want it to go


remembered my website settings. In my search on the internet I see other people with the same problem. Some get it fixed others don't.
