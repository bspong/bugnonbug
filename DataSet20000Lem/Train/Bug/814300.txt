Steps to reproduce:

This appears to be a new problem with the FF 17 stable release. I am including a couple of file for testing.

I have overflow-y:scroll on an element, in this case an iframe. First I applied overflow:hidden and display:none to the element. Next, I remove the display:none property and the element reappears with no scrollbars. If overflow:hidden is then removed, the vertical scrollbar doe not come back.

However. If I remove overflow:hidden first, THEN remove display:none, I get the scrollbar back. This did not happen with the last three version of FF.

The problem is that the JQuery library, possibly among other things, add and remove this particular cs in this particular order if you call certain animations, such a when someone us .toggle().

I noticed that there were similar bug reported (and then resolved) quite a long time ago, so I apologize if I should have added this to one of them. I figure this is a new instance, so a new report wa in order.
