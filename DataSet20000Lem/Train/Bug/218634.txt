Several time my linux system ha frozen when I have had several tab open and
then I click on one, decide I don't want to go to that tab and while the button
is still in I drag the pointer away. The pointer change to an "L" shape (like
the edge of a square) and I can't do anything after that - the whole system
need to be reset causing a serious loss of data.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on a tab and keep the button in
2. move the pointer away from the tab


Actual Results:
Linux freeze and nothing can be done.

Expected Results:
Given back control of the system.

At this time I unfortuantely can't afford to intentionally reproduce the bug,
though based on the link mentioned above
(http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=23406) others have experienced
the same problem.
