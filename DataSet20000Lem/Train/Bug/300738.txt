When upgrading from an old version of firefox to a new one I've noticed that the
search plugin list is filled with the plugins that I deleted the last time I
upgraded, while they are useful, Firefox should probabally check to see if there
are already searchplugins in the target folder and not add new one if there are
(or at least have an option under the custom fork in the installer).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install (an outdated version of) Firefox.
2. Delete some search plugins manually.
3. Upgrade Firefox, they WILL come back (at least on my computer(s) it ha
happened every time)

Actual Results:
The search plugins I deleted came back.

Expected Results:
Realised the search plugins had been customized and left them a they were
(instead of adding new ones).

This problem is very minor, incredibly easy to work around, and occured in every
upgrade of firefox since 1.0 I believe (or whenever search plugins were bundled
I wanted to delete (i always delete ebay, amazon, creative commons, and yahoo).
