When loading the above URL, the site load for a moment but then disappears. When trying to report the website a broken, the menu item to do so is greyed out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to dabs.com
2. Site fails to load properly
3. "Report Broken Web Site..." is greyed out
Actual Results:
"Report Broken Web Site..." is greyed out once the page ha finished (on what look like a blank page) and the website cannot be reported.

Expected Results:
Report Broken Web Site should be able to report a site even if it failed to load completely. It should probably remember the last page that it could have reported rather than blanking it out, since the current page is likely to be related to it.

Going to the site load for a second before resulting in a blank page.

Further detail of the page issue (as opposed to the issue with not being able to report the issue) are available in bug 461555 and bug 457679.
