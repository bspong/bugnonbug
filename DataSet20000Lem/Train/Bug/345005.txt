Where the underlying window system support it, the equivalent of XGrabKeyboard
should be run when a security-sensitive data such a a password field is being
filled in. This is intended to reduce the likelihood of ordinary
keyboard-sniffing software getting at the most valuable data. While it's
unlikely to be anything close to a complete solution to the problem, it
sound like a simple, low-cost enhancement.

This could occur automatically whenever a <input type=password ...> field get
focus, plus for any other explicit password prompt hard-coded into the gui.

Actual Results:
2. Notice that keyboard event come in, regardless of the type of field

Expected Results:
2. Notice that no keyboard event are broadcast when a password-type field is filled.
