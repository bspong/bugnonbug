Beginning with the 2008-03-21 nightly, I can no longer open mail in my Google Apps version 2 gmail account. The error console ha a handful of warning about "Error in parsing value for property 'display'. Declaration dropped." but there are no additional warning or error when I click on the message.

Other thing work, like keyboard navigation, making message a read, and archiving them. It only appears to be opening message that doesn't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
From the main mail view, click on any message. Doesn't matter if it's the recipient or the subject.
Actual Results:
It display the yellow banner "Loading..." at the top of the page, but instead of ultimately (and usually quickly) displaying the message, it just sits there forever.

Expected Results:
After briefly displaying "Loading...", display the message.

Using the proto 0.14.1 theme. I had the "Better Gmail" extension enabled, but the behavior persists with it off.
