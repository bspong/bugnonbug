User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; GTB6.3; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; yie8)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/Firefox/3.5.4

McAfee Swears it's not a virus. This problem just started a few day ago. The small box will not maximize nor will it minimize. It will not shut down unless I use the task manager. I also found a site which McAfee said Firefox 3.5.5 wa a Trojan site. I found it through a google search. I have uninstalled Firefox 3.5.4 and reinstalled it a couple of time and the same thing happens each time. I try to either open Firefox or access my mail at yahoo through Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Yahoo Messenger
2.Click on Mail emblem
3.Firefox appears a a small box in upper left of desktop screen.
Actual Results:
Firefox appears a a small box in upper left of desktop screen. It doe not maximize nor minimize or shut down with out the use of the task manager.
I prefer Firefox a my browser. If this is caused by a virus I need help in finding it so I can tell McAfee what a bunch of IDIOTS the are.

Expected Results:
Untill just recently Firefox worked wonderfully and with no problem what so ever. I did download what I thought wa the Firefox 3.5.5 . I uninstalled it and when I tried to reinstall it through a link on Google, I got a message saying the program ( Firefox3.5.5 ) wa infected with a trojan called artimus (?) So that may be a part of the problem.

I have Win XP Pro and 3.5.4 Firefox and latest yahoo messenger.
