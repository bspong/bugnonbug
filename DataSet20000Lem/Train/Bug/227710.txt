Context menu "Search _engine_ for _selection_" open in new tab rather than in a new window, despite preference setting

There is a context menu entry "Web Search for ..." whenever text is selected.
This executes a search against the preferred search engine. The result always
open in a tab regardless of my preference settings. I don't use tab (so shoot
me :)) and would like this to open in a new window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn off all tab setting in preference
2. Select text and right-click
3. Select "Web Search for ..."


Actual Results:
Search result appear in a new tab.

Expected Results:
Open the search result in a new window.

The relevant code in browser.js contains the comment "//XXXnoririty I don't want
any prefs switching open by tab to window". I don't know if this wa because
of a morbid fear of new windows, or because of some problem related to the
preference or to the search in a new window. My own rather brutal change to
this file show that, at least on my platform, opening search in a new window
work fine.
