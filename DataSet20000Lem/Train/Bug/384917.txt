Excessive CPU and real time use converting between bookmarks.html and sqlite format

It take nearly 30 minute to get into and exit from Firefox 3.0a6pre when it is used with an old 13MB bookmarks.html file. On a 2.8 GHz Pentium IV, the CPU usage is pegged at 70+% for the better part of 20 minutes. It appears to be ~12+ minute getting in (the initial conversion of bookmarks.html) to the new database format and at least 8+ minute exiting.

The initial conversion time from the old bookmark format to the new database format only seems to be required on the 1st time conversion. Subsequent Firefox start are immediate. There should be some kind of progress meter during the conversion so people will know their system isn't hung or in some infinite loop. The conversion time is *extremely* excessive a it take second to copy a 13MB file -- I am wondering the conversion process is being done with index on the column in the database. The proper way to do a conversion is to insert all of the data from bookmarks.html into the database and then add the index only *after* all the insertion have been done. If that isn't the problem then you have a *significant* problem using sqlite for large bookmark/history databases.

The Firefox exit time doe *not* go away after the database conversion process. It always take 8+ minute for Firefox to completely exit (the window is closed immediately but Firefox sits around sucking up CPU time for a very long time). It would appear that this may be due to converting the database back into a bookmarks.html file. (If it take 8 CPU minute to read ~25,000 row and convert them to HTML you have serious efficiency problems.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find an old (large -- > 10MB) bookmarks.html file, perhaps a big history file a well.
2. Install them in a firefox 2.0 profile directory.
3. Startup firefox 3.0a6pre.
Actual Results:
Extremely slow startup and shutdown times.
Excessive CPU usage.

Expected Results:
Many minute of CPU time should not be required to convert, index and deconvert 10+MB of data from a database. If Firefox cannot manage it efficiently, then external standalone utility should be provided which can convert to *and* from the new database formats. (This is highly desirable in *any* case.)

It would be desirable for a general purpose database interface for bookmark and history record be provided which could interface to system database (e.g. mysql) which may be active, reside in memory and be much more efficient than standalone database library (e.g. sqlite) are.
