In window XP, i have only these parameter : Tabs on top and the navigation toolbar. The site url above is only an example but i have this issue on many other site. Open the URL and click on "Test the html code". A new window open and the minefield button is over the disabled navigation bar. I include an image for you to check it out : http://img293.imageshack.us/img293/1690/littledisplaybug.png
