Environment: Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop running Fedora 8 Linux

The touchpad on the 1501 ha special area on the right and bottom to simulate the scroll wheel function of a mouse. The scroll area on the right come into the program a X button press event for button 4 and 5. These result in vertical scrolling a expected. The scroll area on the bottom come into the program a X button press event for button 6 and 7. Moving left in the horizontal scroll area of the touchpad result in a PAGE BACK operation; moving right result in a PAGE FORWARD operation. This is quite frustrating because a slightly misplaced finger can cause it. I assume the idea wa that these would trigger a horizontal scroll operation, although I have never seen a real mouse with a horizontal scroll wheel. Making these event to a horizontal scroll would be great, but just ignoring them would be a big improvement over the current situation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch firefox
2.Move finger in the horizontal scroll area
3.
Actual Results:
PAGE BACK or PAGE FORWARD operation depending on direction of finger movement.

Expected Results:
No action.

Horizontal scrolling would be even better than no action.
