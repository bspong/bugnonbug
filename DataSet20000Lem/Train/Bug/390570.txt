Live feed display article date instead of title (in debug build only)
With recent trunk build of firefox, all of my live feed display article date instead of article titles. When I click on a live feed bookmark to display an article list, the list is just a series of date with no article titles.

I subscribe to about 25 live feed in all, including slashdot's main feed (see the sample URL) and planet mozilla. I have a FF build from July 8, 2007 which work correctly; live feed display article titles. When I shut down this build of FF and start a newer one (e.g. from July 28) my live feed initially display article titles, but after a couple of minutes--presumably after the feed is reloaded--the article list switch to showing dates. When I switch back to my July 8 build, it display article date until the feed are reloaded, then switch back to titles.

I also produced this with a new profile. Using the July 28 build, I created a new profile and waited for the "latest headlines" live feed to load. All entry in the menu were date instead of titles.

My July 28 build is a debug build, and it print many copy of the following message which may be relevant:
