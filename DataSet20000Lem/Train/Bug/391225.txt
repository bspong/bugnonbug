On Yahoo news pages, for example, http://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20070807/sc_space/marsmeteoritescreatewatermystery

graphic are being rendered too large such that on the example page, the graphic, "This week in photos," cover up part of the text column.

This doesn't happen in Safari or IE. Even if those browser are not complying with some standard, I don't really care; all I want is to be able to read the news.

I think this started happening today, just after plugins NoScript and maybe GooglePreview were updated, but I haven't restarted Firefox for several day prior.

I don't know how to easily send you a summary of all the plug-in I have installed, and there are too many to make me want to manually transcribe the information, so go fix it, please.
