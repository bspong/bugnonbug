It started with yesterday's Nightly (2017-06-23) but the problem continued with today's one (2017-06-24). Maybe 2017-06-22 is affected too, but I'm not sure about that one.

After restarting the browser when it got the update, I couldn't load any tab anymore, all of them were crashing all the time (see screenshot):

- It wa not possible to navigate to a new tab entering a new URL.

- Changing to old tab that were already in the tab strip, wa crashing them a well.

If affect both, online website and localhost, but not about: pages. 'Safe mode' and 'Refreshing Firefox' don't fix the issue.

This is what the terminal display when trying to load a tab:

> [Parent 8119] WARNING: pipe error (67): Connection reset by peer: file /home/worker/workspace/build/src/ipc/chromium/src/chrome/common/ipc_channel_posix.cc, line 353

In addition, when trying to attach more data to this report, I noticed that loading about:support crash the entire browser:

> Redirecting call to abort() to mozalloc_abort
>
> Segmentation fault (core dumped)

I can't see any relevant crash report in ~/.mozilla/firefox/Crash Reports/ neither about:crashes.

My system is Linux 4.11.5-200.fc25.x86_64 (Fedora Linux with GNOME).
