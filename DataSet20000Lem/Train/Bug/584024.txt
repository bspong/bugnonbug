Firefox doe not rename PDF invoice file downloaded from ebuyer.com

For some reason when downloading an invoice PDF from ebuyer.com the downloaded file ha the .part appended to the file name. (that only seems to occur when downloading an invoice from ebuyer.com through Firefox)

Since Fx appends the .part to a file when it's downloading I can only assume this is a problem with Firefox failing to rename the file to remove the .part at the end of the file name when it ha finished downloading. (downloads fine in Google Chrome)

See http://imgur.com/3tHQS.png for an example. This occurs in 3.6.8, 4.0 beta 2 and the latest nightly. (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:2.0b3pre) Gecko/20100802 Minefield/4.0b3pre)

To my knowledge this bug ha existed in Firefox for a very long time. (memory is a bit weak at this point, but I think it may have worked fine in Fx2.. I can download and test in that if requested)

File in explorer to show it hasn't been rename to remove the ".part" appended to the file name: http://imgur.com/u7DHK.png
