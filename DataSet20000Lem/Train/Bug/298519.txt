This site is only fully compatible with IBM version of internet explorer
version 5 or greater. Please consider downloading the latest version.
If I ignore this and Once I've logged in
https://www.orderkleeneze.co.uk/ordering/login_uk.asp
and try to place an order I get the text 'Cannot locate proxy which support
remote scripting. Was RSEnabledRemotescripting method invoked?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to www.kleeneze.net
2.Log in to distributor login page https://www.orderkleeneze.co.uk/ordering/login_
3. Try to place order in 'Order Products'

Actual Results:
Page appears a normal, input code and press enter but nothing happens.

Expected Results:
Box on right should come up with description of item ordered and quantity.

The only way this problem at the moment is for me to use internet explorer
instead. But I don't want to use it a it is very slow despite my 3mb bandwidth.
