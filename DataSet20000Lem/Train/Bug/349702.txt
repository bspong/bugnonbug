Hey guys,

I am a first time Fire Fox User. I think I just installed the latest yesterday, and permitted Fire Fox to interface with JaJah. This is only my second day. Please have I reached the right place to report the above bug. If not, where shall I go?

The easy work-around is to use Microsoft's Internet Explorer rather than Mozilla's Fire Fox.

Thanking you in advance for the courtesy of a reply
