Race condition browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_markupview_search_01.js
Working through the test ' browser/devtools/markupview/test/browser_markupview_search_01.js', it seems pretty clear that the test ha some inbuilt race conditions.

The test itself doe a bunch of 'searchUsingSelectorSearch' invocations, wait for an 'inspector-updated' event, and then ensures that the correct element wa selected. This fails due to race where some unrelated 'inspector-updated' fire (sometimes a 'delayed' one from an earlier set of actions), causing the wait to terminate early, and the check to fail.

The test can be made to succeed reliably by inserting delay in the appropriate place (in between invoking change and checking for them).

The test fail reliably on a linux 64-bit debug build of tip (tried on several different revision over the course of 2 weeks):

This is blocking landing of patch in bug 1167409, because those patch cause these test to orange on try, but that's incidental (they're just triggering pre-existing races).

Could you look into fixing them?
