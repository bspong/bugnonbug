Mitigate clickjacking of about:certerror
A site colluding with a MITM attacker can show a fake about:certerror page with the "Add Exception" button of a real about:certerror page for another site showing through an iframe. If the user judge the front site unimportant and fails to recheck the hostname in the "Add Security Exception" dialog, his/her communication with the back site are compromised.

I have linked a demo for Firefox 3.6 and 4 that target www.cacert.org (so it will not work if you have the CAcert root enabled or already have a cert override for this site). The demo assumes browser.xul.error_pages.expert_bad_cert is enabled. In a real attack, I think one could avoid this assumption by supplying a cert with a related hostname so that the "Technical Details" section of the back page expands and then letting the entire "I Understand the Risks" section (including the toggle) show through. The only problem is that the width of the errorPageContainer may change when this section opens, and I'm not sure how to make it change on both the front and back pages.

Please consider mitigating this attack. One possibility: when about:certerror load in a frame, it could say in place of the button, "To add an exception, you need to <a>open this page in a new tab</a>."

I'm marking the bug private a a precaution. Please feel free to open it if you judge that it doe not need this protection.
