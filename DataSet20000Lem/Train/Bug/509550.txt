When the Save Link As ... dialog come up and a folder is highlighted (selected) you cannot unselect it. Because of this, clicking "Save" take you into that directory instead of saving to the directory you were in. The only way I can see to remedy this is to go one directory higher than where you want and navigating to that directory (though I can't see this working if you're saving to, say, /).

Note that the breadcrumb button do help. Selecting the folder you want from there will semi-highlight the directory you were in with grey and allow you to save to the current directory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click, Save Link As...
2. In the dialog box, navigate to where a directory can be seen. Click once on it.
3. Try clicking in the dialog where there is no directory (e.g., underneath it). The selected directory will stay selected.
4. Click the Save button. The dialog will take you into the selected directory instead of saving to the current directory.
Actual Results:
Save did not occur, taken into the selected directory.

Expected Results:
After clicking away from the directory, it should become unselected (but still semi-highlighted -- in grey). This would allow you to save to the current directory if, say, you accidentally clicked on a folder but wanted to save to the current directory.
