I only happens on some images, and I've only used the function on a couple of site so I don't know if it's limited to certain domain. However, it happens quite frequently, or most of the time, when dragging highres cover from discogs.com.

For example:
http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?what=R&obid=215883

or trying to drag the image from (first might work, 2nd will not)
http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?what=R&obid=75924


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?what=R&obid=75924
2. drag and drop 1st image, then a 2nd image
Actual Results:
The error wa reproduced

Expected Results:
the temporary file copied to temp directory, should be unlocked and allowed to be copied. if the name of file existed already (??) it should rename it and used that filepath for copying to the selected drap & drop folder in explorer.
