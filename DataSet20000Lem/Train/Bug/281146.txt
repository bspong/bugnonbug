History remains empty, back/foward button remain empty. Location bar doe not accept an "enter" ! (UI really not working)

I would have put this under a UI component rather than History, but a large portion of the problem
seems to have to do with data never being filled in the right place (History, and the Back/Forward
buttons).

The only page I can go to is the Home page, or whatever is input via prefs for the home page. If I type
any URL into the location bar, and hit enter, it doe not respond.

After going to the home page and clicking through several links, the back and forward button remain
grayed out (nothing ha populated the back button) and the history remains empty a if I'd not clicked
through those links.

So, this is a major bug that make the 1.0 and later unusable. I had used some pre 1.0 version and
seem to remember that they did not have this problem. Currently running system 10.3.7
