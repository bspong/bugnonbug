Pressing the Tab key give focus to the tag with CSS property 'overflow:auto'

Whenever a page contains a form and one or more tag with the CSS property 'overflow:auto', you expect a press on the Tab key to switch between the form's elements.

In FF4, the focus move from form element to overflowed block in their order of appearance in the flow of the document.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the example code above in your browser
2. Click on the first form field
3. Press Tab

Actual Results:
That overflow:auto block will gain focus instead of the second input field

Expected Results:
The second input field should get focus

The behavior is the same in every OS I've put my hand on (Win Vista, Ubuntu 10.04, OSX 10.6)

The workaround provided at http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Pressing%20Tab%20key%20does%20not%20select%20menus%20or%20buttons
did not work (tried only under Ubuntu 10.04)


Sample code to reproduce:
-------------------------

<input type="text" name="test"/>
<div style="overflow:auto">
<p style="overflow:auto"><input type="text" name="test"/></p>
</div>
