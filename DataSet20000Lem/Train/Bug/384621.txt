Why do you keep sending out your stupid popup survey, which for a company that claim to pride it self on having the best anti popup and spam block is a bit of a joke, everytime it pop up and I click on cancel it close Firefox, not only without giving me an option to save a blog entry I wa working in Wordpress but out of what can only be pure spit it, deletes the content of the post which force Wordpress to do an autosave so when I restore seesion the next time I open Firefox my Wordpress post open up with a blank post and only the title.

This is not the first time your survey ha done this, it ha now done this to me onn Vista, XP and OSX 10.4. If you want to do a survey about Firefox then use email like everybody else. Next time your popup survey come up on my screen I will complete it, but will give you the lowest mark on each question, so stop wasting my time. I have missed my deadline because of this survey so stop sending them to me.

I will report your company a a spammer if this happens again.

If I got this email because you think I am on a mailing list then please take me off it.
