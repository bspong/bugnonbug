get a "Cannot open clipboard" while trying to have text read from Read Please.

Today I decided to get Firefox 3.5.3, only to discover that it doe not "like" my ReadPlese 2003(http://www.readplease.com/) full version! Every time I cut text from the clipboard the text is read but an error message is displayed in the background(behind all my window and the "alert" sound is played). The error message say " "Cannot open clipboard". I have had this error with other products(like acrobat reader) but not the preview version of Firefox. The error stack in the background if I don't close them and this is very annoying.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Read Please 2003.(Pulse vestion)
2. In Vistia you must run the program a an administrator(with UAC on) and in XP compatity mode a long a it is unregistered, I don't know if this happens in the unorganized version since I have a license for the program.
3. Make shur you turn on "clipboard reading", I am using "ON - Clear Document Past and Play"
4. Copy a short amount of text from Firefox, including text in the address bar, "source view" or actually text on an actually page. This sometimes doe not happend usually with larger pesase of text.
Actual Results:
nope

Expected Results:
An error will apear on you desktop.

No error should occur, like in preview version of Firefox, where I can use ReadPlese with it just fine. Something ha changed in the way Firefox handle the Vista clipboard PLEASE NOT: I am know to the bug reporting thing so don't get to angry with me if I filled this out wrong, also this is only a miner problem since I can go back to a preview vestion of Firefox and this is only a minor problem(besides the stacking dilog boxas). You could blame ReadPlese but y did this not happen in every other vesstioni of Firefox I have used.
