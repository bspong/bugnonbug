Links to local file in svg's can't be opened via java applet -- "Macintosh HD" is added to path.

I'm using mac OSX with firefox 3.0.3.
I have an .svg file --- let's call it "file.svg" -- with a hyperlink in it. The svg is embedded in a java applet in the file, say, "file.html". (The specific java applet is zgrviewer, for viewing graph represented a svgs, but this may or may not be important.)

If pointing to a local file, the link doe not load properly because firefox either preprends "Macintosh HD/' to the the path in the link, or weirdly modifies/screw up the end of the path.

For example, the link in "File.svg" pointing to the file "File2.html" is translated to 'file:///Macintosh HD/Users/[my user name]/Desktop/File2.html" This path doe not exist: the proper path would be 'file:///Users/[my user name]/Desktop/File2.html".

This is _still_ a problem when I replace the relative path reference in the .svg file with an absolute path, e.g. if I type make the link path "file:///Users/[username/Desktop/File2.html", Firefox still look for "file:///Macintosh HD/Users/[username]/Desktop/File2.html"

It seems to happen only the the specific circumstance that the path is being accessed from the .svg file via the zgrviewer applet. If I open the .svg file in firefox directly, the link work (i.e. go to the right path, without prepending "Macintosh HD/").

And, it is only a problem for local links, i.e. if I replace "File2.html" in the .svg's link with, for example, 'www.nytimes.com', the link is fine, i.e. can be opened from the applet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just make any svg file with a hyper link in it to some file on the local machin (in OSX)
2. Embed the svg file in a java applet (if you know how, make the svg file represent a graphm and use the zgrviewer applet).
3. Try to open the hyperlink in the svg file via the java applet.
Actual Results:
The link didn't open.

Expected Results:
The link should have opened. (it does, for example, in Safari or Opera -- however, the same problem occurs in Camino.)
