- open a website and then another website (to make sure that that the "Go back
one page"-button is enabled)

- open the history sidebar or the bookmark sidebar

- click one sidebar item (so the sidebar item is focused. if you have opened the
boomarks sidebar please select a folder or separator because link open on
single click)

- press BACKSPACE

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:
Although the sidebar is focused, go back to the last visited site. After this,
the website area is focused, not the sidebar anymore.

This also work for SHIFT+BACKSPACE.


(I think I remember (but I'm not sure anymore) that 0.92 final also ha had a
similar problem that FastFind ha worked if a sidebar item wa focused. But I
can't reproduced this with current nightlies anymore.)

Expected Results:
(SHIFT+) BACKSPACE should do nothing if a sidebar is focused and the sidebar
should keep it focus.
