If we have a some bookmarked URLs with same "Basic Authentication Scheme" (by simple word a some URLs from a pair a an one domain + a same basic folder from a site) and we didn't fill a pasword before then if we will open all these URLs in same time (for example from a Bookmarks through the "Open All in Tabs") we will get a many not focused modal window with basic auth for an each Tab. This bug i see only in Firefox 3.x, the Firefox 2.x showed to me only one modal window and i got after an entering username & password an all loaded a document under this basic auth. Now i got many modal window where i should enter same username & password for each tab. Many window showed to me one under one. And i have many trouble with Roboform extension because this bug to be.
