Steps to reproduce:

Lastly I installed the beta version of the Vivaldi browser. When I load a page it show a progress bar in the url bar. On the right hand side it also display the already loaded and the entire page size.


Actual results:

I think, this information wa present in Firefox long ago, too. Sadly I couldn’t find any information about why the progress bar and loading size wa dismissed. Was it, to make Firefox seem faster? Was it due problem with the animation timing? Was it, because the “cool” Chrome did it this way? Was it, to make the ui simpler, slicker, easier to use for newbies?


Expected results:

What I find great about this feature in Vivaldi is, that it really give you a feeling for page size. I visited a page last week and wa horrified to see that it started with 300 kB but then sprung to over 10 MB in total size. It spell out: Not the browser or my internet connection is slow but the page itself.

Making the page size visible help to remind everyone on the web how we are wasting bandwidth (with scripts, plugins, advertising). This could encourage u to make website smaller and faster.

BTW: The article http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm inspired me to file this bug.
