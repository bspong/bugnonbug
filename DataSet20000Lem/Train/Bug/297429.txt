Page loses a td width or CSS width attribute after many refreshes

In the link attached to this bug the page should have some white space on both
side of the main text. However, sometimes when you load it, the text is
touching the left-hand menu bar and the right-hand edge of the screen. To see
this, start refreshing a lot. It validates with W3's CSS and XHTML 1.1
validator, so it's not a problem with my hypertext. As near a I can figure,
it's not loading the CSS width attribute of (XPATH
/html/body/table/tbody/tr/td[2]/table) that is inside the 'style' tag attribute.
This just happens occasionally. I tested it in IE, but I didn't see the same
effect after 50+ refreshes.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://68.103.43.67:8570/tutorial/index.php?tutorial=1
2. The tutorial is in an 80% centered table inside of a <td>. There should be
some space between the edge of the tutorial text and the edge of the <td>
3. Keep refreshing the page and more than likely you'll see it within the first
15-20 refreshes. The text will touch the edge of it containing <td>, making it
much wider than it should be. When you refresh again, it will return to normal.

Actual Results:
The text widens and touch the edge of it's containing <td>

Expected Results:
Firefox should have read the attribute in the hypertext correctly. I assume
that's the problem.
