I deleted a set of cooky from google.com by deleting it folder in the cookiie manager. Firefox then started blocking all cooky from google.com.

I unchecked the box for blocking cooky from domain where were deleted and deleted google from the "exceptions" page underneath, that it wa placed on (next to gator). Firefox will still not accept cooky from google.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delete a folder in cookie manager with Options/Cookies/Allow site to set cookies/unless I have removed cooky set my the site checked.
2. Uncheck the above box.
3. Go to allow site to set cookies/exceptions and delete the relevant entry.

Actual Results:
Although the entry no longer appears on the exception list, Firefox still act a though it wa still there.

Expected Results:
Firefox should allow that site's cookies, since I told it to stop blocking them by deleting it blocking entry.

No themes. I'm running XP SP2, although Firefox appears to believe it is running under NT. I don't know if that's deliberate on the part of firefox.
