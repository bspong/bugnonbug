This may be a helper application problem (I'm using Adobe Reader 8.1.1), but IE doe not exhibit the same symptoms.

When I try the above url, I am unable to view the pdf. However, if I insert the "index.php" that is unnecessary due to apache directive (and go to the url http://kani.ookami.net/fileserv/index.php?id=MTEzMDQxNDQ0Mw&ord=4), the file is opened in browser without problem. I have also set up a file (on the same server) at the following location that is not using php, and it open without problem (http://kani.ookami.net/pdftest/?id=MTEzMDQxNDQ0Mw&ord=4). It also open properly if I add the filename (test.pdf), remove the query string (which is ignored), or do both. The pdf file themseves are identical (the php script is just a passthrough script, it doe not generate the pdf on the fly).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://kani.ookami.net/fileserv/?id=MTEzMDQxNDQ0Mw&ord=4
Actual Results:
The tab freeze but is closable

Expected Results:
the pdf file should be displayed
