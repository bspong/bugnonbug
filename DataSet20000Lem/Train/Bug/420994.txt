offsetTop calculated incorrectly for empty span in Firefox 2 and 3b3 (broken differently in both)

Using the Transitional doctype, using offsetTop (or getBoundingClientRect or getBoxObjectFor) to determine the vertical position of an empty span tag is broken. IE6 and Safari 3 handle this correctly. This is broken in both Firefox 2 and 3: Firefox 2 is completely wrong whereas Firefox 3 is only off by one pixel.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://bolinfest.com/mozilla/looseVsStrict.html on Firefox 2 or Firefox 3 on any platform.

Actual Results:
In Firefox 2, calculated vertical offset is 23 when it should be 8 in Transitional mode.
In Firefox 3b3, calculated vertical offset is 24 when it should be 8 in Transitional mode.
In Firefox 3b3, calculated vertical offset is 9 when it should be 8 in Strict mode.

Expected Results:
In Firefox 2, calculated vertical offset is 23 when it should be 8 in Transitional mode.
In Firefox 3b3, calculated vertical offset is 24 when it should be 8 in Transitional mode.
In Firefox 3b3, calculated vertical offset is 9 when it should be 8 in Strict mode.

Performed on a fresh install of Firefox 3 beta 3.
