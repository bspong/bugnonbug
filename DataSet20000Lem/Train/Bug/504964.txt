Firefox keep hanging- 'Not Responding' error
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have a serious problem with Firefox 3.5. It keep jamming with a 'Not Responding' message. I can eventually get Windows Task Manager to force it to close, but when I open it up again, it jam again with the 'Well, this is embarrassing. Firefox is having trouble recovering your window and tabs. This is usually caused by a recently opened web page'. I can stop it if I open the browser in safe mode and elect not to restore the session.

This problem began with 3.5 and ha not been fixed with 3.5.1. It did not happen with Firefox 3.0. It also only seems to happen with Windows Vista. I have Firefox running on other computer with Windows XP and this problem is not happening with them. It doesn't seem to be happening with any particular sites.

I am using:

Firefox 3.5.1
Windows Vista Home Premium SP1
RAM: 2Gb
Processor: Intel(R) Pentium 4 CPU 3.20GHz
Add-ons: Adobe DLM 1.5.2.35, ColorZilla 2.0.2, Firebug 1.4.0, Flashblock 1.5.11.2, Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant 1.0 (Not compatible with Firefoxx 3.5.1), Norton IPS 1.0 (not compatible), Norton Toolbar (not compatible), NoScript 1.9.5, Screengrab 0.96.1, Skype Extension for Firefox 3.3.0.3493, StyleSheet Chooser Plus 1.2.0, Web Developer 1.1.8

Are you able to fix this or let me know if there's anything I can do to fix it?

Many thanks,

Paul
