Contextual Menu item "Open Link in a New Window" sometimes open a new window reduced to the size of an icon [32x32 pixel or 48x48 pixels]. In an 8 hour browsing session this happened about 10 time out of approximately 500 "Open Link" operations.

Most of the link were from a "Google Products" page.

3. scroll down to the google product comparison link and "Open Link in a New Window"
4. sort by total price
5. select the best [trustworthy] link and "Open Link in a New Window"
6. some link open normally and some open reduced to the size of an Icon


Actual Results:
