I think there must be a bug in command line argument taking effect. Because I've been trying to test directly like bug 471997 comment 49 I got the same result over and over again, didn't wfm, about:privatebrowsing asks if I want to start private browsing, everything look the same a normal mode, with latest nightly trunk.

I just started testing -private. no PB mode, didn't wfm.
So then I decided to see if -P worked, no profilemanager, didn't wfm. hmm.
Then I went back to -private it worked and always work now. double hmm.
Then I tried -profilemanager, the profilemanager popped up. ok, works.
Then I tried -profilemanager -private, ok, works.
Then I tried -p, got the profilemanager
Then I tried -P, got the profilemanager

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
STR seems based on whether the profilemanager ha been used.
Actual Results:
Seems if you never used the feature it doesn't become active until the profilemanager get used.

Expected Results:
upon downloading a new build, command line argument should be recognized and take effect immediately with current profile..

I wa tried to verify bug 471997 and ran into this.
