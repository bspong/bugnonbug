failure to reload tab when restarted with numerous open tab
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130409194949

Steps to reproduce:

I opened numerous tab in several windows, then I exited FF, then restarted it.



Actual results:

There were several tab which were 'stuck' - the reload operation got the 'tab' icon correctly populated, but the page did not load. An F5 refresh clear the URL from the address bar. Selecting the address bar, putting the cursor at end of URL, and hitting 'enter' cause the page to load. The tab is in 'limbo'...
The <tab-order> selection is that tab itself in this case (at least in version 20). The <tab-order> selection of a correctly reloaded tab is the body of the page... That may provide a simple method of detecting such a 'stuck tab' condition.


Expected results:

When FF is configured with "show my tab and window from last time", and the option "don't load tab until selected" is not selected, then when FF is restarted, it should load all the tab from the prior session. If you have numerous tabs, whether with one window or multiple windows, and 'file->exit' is selected (or FF crashes, or is killed) then when the browser is restarted, and either begin reloading (or offer the reload dialog and you select reload selected) - there will be tab which do not correctly load. This problem ha been present since version 3.x
