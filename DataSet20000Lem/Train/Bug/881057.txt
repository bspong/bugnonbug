Improve wording in the appcache command
When localizing the string for the new appcache command, I found two string that I think are difficult to understand:

asteriskInWrongSection=Asterisk used a a wildcard in the %S section at line %S. A single line containing an asterisk is called the online whitelist wildcard flag and is only valid in the NETWORK section. Other us of the * character are prohibited. The presence of this flag indicates that any URI not listed a cached is to be implicitly treated a being in the online whitelist namespaces. If the flag is not present then the blocking state indicates that URIs not listed explicitly in the manifest are to be treated a unavailable.

fallbackAsterisk=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used a a wildcard in a fallback namespace at line %S. Namespaces simply need to match a path prefix.

Both string use the term "namespace". I have only found this term in the HTML spec on how to parse a cache manifest. I have not found any tutorial or other documentation on appcache, that us this term. I believe the spec language is targeted at browser developer and not web developers. The string refer to term defined in the spec, but not used anywhere else, such a "the online whitelist wildcard flag", "online whitelist namespaces", "blocking state" and "fallback namespace". I therefore think these two string may be easy to understand for browser developers, but not for web developers.

Also, when I tried out the validator on http://html5demos.com/offlineapp the asteriskInWrongSection message wa shown (because the manifest contains NETWORK: http://*). It did not seem to me like the message signaled an error, but after reading up on it, it doe seem to me like an error.

I suggest these alternative strings:

asteriskInWrongSection2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the %S section at line %S. If a line i the NETWORK section contains only a singler asteisk character, then any URI not listed in the manifest will be treated a if the URI wa listed in the NETWORK section. Otherwice such URI will be treated a unavailable. Other us of the * character are prohibited.

fallbackAsterisk2=Asterisk (*) incorrectly used in the FALLBACK section at line %S. URIs in the FALLBACK section simply need to match a prefix of the request URI.

PS: Please always use %1$S, %2$S, ... instead of %S, %S, ... in string when there are multiple replacements. It make it much easier for localizers to know how to do it if they need to change the order of the replacements.
