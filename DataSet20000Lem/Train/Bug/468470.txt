in <embed src="whatever.mp3" hidden="false" />

the mp3 will be hidden regardless of true/false setting of hidden.

havent tested it with any other type of embedded type. probly should have before i report a bug thats most likely already here, but what are you gonna do.

IE 6 responds to hidden="false" in the expected way, showing the proper plugin when false and hiding when true.

the default and expected plugin wa quicktime 7.5.5 (by way of quicktime alternative 2.70), but wa tested with vlc and medium player plugins

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.<embed src="whatever.mp3" hidden="false" />
2.
3.
Actual Results:
the proper player/plugin wa not displayed.

Expected Results:
corresponding plugin should have been displayed i.e. quicktime minitoolbar

using aquatint redone theme 3.0.1 but thats not likely to affect this.

easily fixed by excluding the hidden attribute from the embed tag but still a pain in the as if you didin't know what wa preventing the quicktime plugin from displaying.
