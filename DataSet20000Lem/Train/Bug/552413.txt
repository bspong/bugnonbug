Since upgrading to FF 3.6 on the Mac, we have noticed that all Flash video are 1 pixel le wide than they should be. It only seems the affect the width and not the height. We first noticed this on our own websites, and then I ran a test on youtube and Yahoo! video and noticed it happening on those site a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to youtube or yahoo! video (or another site that ha Flash video)
2. Note the width of the Flash video and the containing box (they should be the same). For example, say the <embed> is 385px wide, and the containing box is also 385px wide.
3. In Firebug, set the background color of the containing box to red (or some other high-contrast color).
Actual Results:
You will notice a red line 1 pixel wide on the left side of the video.

Expected Results:
The red line should not show up because the Flash video should fill the entire containing box if it's the same size a the box.

We're noticing this on every site. It's particularly noticeable on site that have a containing box with a background color/image different from the parent containing box.
