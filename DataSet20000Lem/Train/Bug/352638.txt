The bug is not a serious one, but a bug nonetheless, and it ha to do with tabbed browsing. When the loading tab is not active.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to hotmail.com, check if you can see your email address in the login page - if yes, then go to step 2. If not, then enter the email address, enable "remember username" option and login. After this, simple log out.
2. Close the browse, reopen it and open an extra tab.
3. Type the hotmail.com address in the 1st tab, press enter and immediately switch to the other tab, watch the hotmail tab for download activity (it can be seen in the tab itself a a circular icon).
4. Once the hotmail activity indicator stop (i.e., hotmail login page ha loaded) switch to the hotmail tab.
Actual Results:
You will see that your email address is selected in the text box - it appears a if the box ha focus (which it indeed is after loading). When you use tab key then the focus is on the first tab of the page.


Expected Results:
Ideally, pressing the "Tab" key should take the cursor to the password box - but it doesn't.

Try the above without tabbing. Hotmail login page loads, and when you see the username selected pressing the tab key will take the cursor to the password box.
