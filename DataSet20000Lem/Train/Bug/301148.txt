Lately, last 2 days, I click on Yahoo Mail from MyYahoo home page in FIREFOX
browser. It is supposed to query me for only my password but last 2 day it
doe not hold my username and I am unsucessful accessing email through FIREFOX
when it asks me for these. The fact that it is asking me for my user name is a
clue but I can not seem to figure out what's up. I do not have this problem in
IE6 or in Mozilla browser at work.

However just now after several un-successful attempt to sign-in, I could
access my email from MY YAHOO after I received the password for my BUGZILLA
account verification email thing.

Occurs seemingly everytime.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to My Yahoo...signs in automatically.

2. Click on MAIL YAHOO.
3. Sign in using BOTH Username and password. 3 day ago, it would prompt me for
ONLY my password and I would sign in. NOW, I can not seemingly sign in.

Actual Results:
I signed out but now I can sign in.

Expected Results:
I don't know

I will try again tomorrow.
