Tab Groups wording could be slightly better
Summary: "Open in Tabs" and "Bookmark all tab in a folder" should be reworded
to make it more obvious what they do.

When I encountered "Open in Tabs" for the first time, it wasn't all that obvious
what it does. If someone can figure out a wording that better describes what
happens when you click on it, I think that would be a good improvement since any
user who come across it will wonder about it till he try it out. "Open every
tab in folder a tabs" is too verbose, but I think the important thing is to
emphasize the idea that it open every bookmark in the folder rather than how it
doe it. So maybe something like "Open all bookmark in (this) folder" or
something similar.

"Bookmark all tab in a folder" could also be phrased a bit better. I think it
should be "Bookmark all open tabs". The "in a folder" bit is redundant because
the user always ha to select a folder regardless of whether he is bookmarking 1
site or a set of tabs, it just add more confusion for the user; if you're going
to keep it "to a folder" make more sense. "all tabs" is vague - the context is
not immediately obvious, to me at least.

I know this is a bit nitpicky, but Phoenix doe so well in other part of the UI
that I felt this should be of equivalent caliber. The "Open in Tabs" feature
appears any time you browse bookmarks, so it should be a good a possible.
