Youtube flash video pause periodically in Firefox 36.

Steps to reproduce:

While watching embedded flash youtube videos, the video keep pausing, frezzing or lagging every few second while the audio continues normally. It happens le while in full screen mode. It is worse in an embedded video window, which make no sense.

I usually have a lot of tab open. I set the browser.sessionstore.interval to -1 in the hope that this would prevent the SessionManager add-on from doing too many session saves. This did not fix the problem. I have tried different setting for this value, none of which have fixed the issue. This ha been a long-standing issue going back many version of FF. It is not new to FF 36.


Actual results:

Expected results:

The video should play smoothly in sync with the audio with no visible pause or freezes. Instead, it keep freezing and then continuing.
