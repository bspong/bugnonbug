If Firefox crash or is closed when sessionstore.js is too large, it crash almost immediately on startup. This appears to be triggered when sessionstore.js is 128K in size or greater. I'm regularly near this line due to having many (approximately 100) tab open at once, each contributing it own cooky and history to the session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Verify that "When Firefox starts" is set to "Show my window and tab from last time" in the Main tab of Firefox Preferences.
3. Open many tab and navigate to several page in them, watching the size of the profile's sessionstore.js file.
4. When sessionstore.js reach 128K, exit Firefox via File|Quit.
5. Restart Firefox.
Actual Results:
Firefox attempt to reopen all of the tabs, then crashes.

Expected Results:
All tab in the previous session should be restored, and the browser shouldn't crash.

Removing sessionstore.js allows Firefox to start. Alternatively, the file can be trimmed to le than the maximum size in a text editor, although it's not easy. Both involve data loss to some extent.
