When opening local file and saving file from firefox, you get asked for the
respective place, and they usually remember which directory you have accessed
last time.
However, if you load a file from a directory (say /tmp/A), save a webpage to a
different one (say /tmp/B), the next time you try to open a local file you will
start out in the last directory where you saved a file instead of the last place
you openend a file from (/tmp/B instead of the expected /tmp/A).
This is sort of inconsistent: For one, you can specify a default save-to
directory where you will always end up when saving a file. Since this is
consistent for save-as or download operations, I wouldn't expect this to affect
the File->open File dialogue.
Also, since you can have multiple tab open and hence multiple task going on at
the same time, it is rather reasonable to have some tab where you might open
different file from time to time (all from the same or similar directory) while
you might to the odd save-operation in another tab. Now I wouldn't want per-tab
file->openFile directory to be remembered, but distinguishing between save and
open directory would (at least for me) help.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open an arbitrary html file using File->open File on your harddrive
2.save a webpage or a download to a directory different from the one in step 1
3.try to open another file via File->open File

Actual Results:
The directory from step 2 is being used

Expected Results:
the directory from step 1 is being used.
