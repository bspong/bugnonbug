Based on bug 462041 comment 64 "There already exists a limit (in days) for the remembered browsing history, but not for downloads or search/forms"
...
"next to the number-of-days(or items) limiting control there should be a
'Exceptions...' button for each one of the browsing, downloads and search/forms
history. This should be following the idea of the mechanism used by the
'Exceptions...' button for the cookies, white/blacklisting domains."

Now that expiring item in the clear recent history dialog is available for downloads (bug 462964), cooky (bug 411952), and there no exists a hidden pref browser.formfill.expire_days (bug 243136), would it not make sense to have separate control of the retention period and exception of browsing history, downloads, form history and cooky exposed in the custom privacy pref pane?
