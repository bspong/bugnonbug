After logging out of gmail account for a blog then logging back in with a yahoo account, I can't log out of the blog

I have two gmail account that are tied to Blogs. They have master password. If I log into either gmail account to check for comment to the associated Blog (I modereate all comments) and then log out normally I sometimes get an error message that say "You have been logged out automatically...". The problem is that when I get this message and then log into one of my yahoo mail accounts, I am unable to log out normally. I have to kill Firefox. It doesn't happen all of the time, but it happens enough to be annoying.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in master password.
2.Select gmail account.
3.Read mail and then log out normally.
Actual Results:
Sometimes I get the error message, sometimes I don't.

Expected Results:
What I do in Gmail should not affect what I do in Yahoo mail.

If something is wrong in Gmail and I am logged out automatically (why I don't know) that tie should be severed and what I do in Yahoo should not be affected.
