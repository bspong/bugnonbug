I have checked the box for Firefox to remember passwords. I have checked the box telling Firefox to always clear private data, but I have UNCHECKED the "saved passwords" box under settings. When I maneuver to site requiring a username/password, Firefox will not ask whether to remember the information. Website say this wa fixed in version 3.0.3, but apparently not for Macs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.0.5 on OSX
2. Tell Firefox to remember passwords.
3. Tell Firefox to clear private data, but not passwords.
4. Go to site that requires account name/password to enter.
5. Type information where required. Firefox will not respond with proper box. Information will not be saved.
Actual Results:
Firefox would not respond with box asking if it wanted me to remember the password and did not remember the passwords.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have asked me if I wanted to save the username/password information and saved it if I said "okay" or "yes."
