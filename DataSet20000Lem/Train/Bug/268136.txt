Upgraded Firefox RC2 doesn't update the statusbar text on user
interaction but only for internal action such as; hover over
a link or stop page loading where text remains same, unchanged.
But during site loading etc., statusbar text update itself
showing action like; waiting / transferring / ...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open your preferred site with link
2.Move your mouse over a link of your choice
&
1.Open a site
2.Stop operation while waiting / transfering / ...
3.Switch tab
Actual Results:
Link's URL doe not show in the statusbar field
&
Statusbar doesn't update, just show last
operation 'Stopped' although you switched tab

Expected Results:
Link's URL should have been displayed in the
statusbar a it is used to be in RC1 & PR
&
Statusbar text should be updated on switching
tab to a text related to the switched tab.

Since I do first install Firefox RC1 + extensions,
then upgrade it to RC2, the problem can be due to
these. I'll appreciate if anyone with RC2 can
confirm or deny this so that I know where to look.
