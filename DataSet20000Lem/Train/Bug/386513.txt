After using 7-12 tab and leaving open overnight, Firefox became unresponsive. I could open new tab but they would indicate "Loading" and never change after that. I could get drop down menu and make selection but they did not produce any action. In Windows Task manager, FF show about 115MB memory in use when it became unresponsive. I could right click on tab to close them but no red X wa usable because tab did not display red X when selected. After closing all tab except one, Taks Manager show 112MB memory still in use and browser unresponsive a before. I started 2nd instance of FF to compare memory usage but it would not start & did not appear in Task Manager. IE work normally under same conditions.
