Add option to group similar entry in web console
It would be nice if there is an option to group similar entry (like fallbacks) in the console. This would improove debugging on Firefox a lot.


Example:

1 .one {
2 background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, gold, orange);
3 background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, gold, orange);
4 background: -o-linear-gradient(top, gold, orange);
5 background: linear-gradient(to bottom, gold, orange);
6 [...]
7 }
8 .two {
9 background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, gold, orange);
10 background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, gold, orange);
11 background: -o-linear-gradient(top, gold, orange);
12 background: linear-gradient(to bottom, gold, orange);
13 [...]
13 }


The Web Console find an error on line 2, 4, 9 and 11. So I see two way to group them:
A) Grouping by error: The Console make a group "backgroud: -webkit[...]" line 2 and 9 and a group "background: -o[...]" with the line 4 and 11.
B) Grouping by rule and properties: The Console make a group ".one background" with line 2 and 4 and another group ".two background" with line 9 and 11.

I think scenario A would be helful if you made the same mistake in the whole document. The seccond one would be helpful to ignore fallbacks.
It's like the idea I described in #870487, there is also an exaple with the old error console (see https://bug870487.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=747548).
