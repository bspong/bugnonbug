I wa searching using the google search box "mayfair bemis 1b5109622" which is a brand/model of toilet seat. The search result (zero) showed up in hawaiian. The only reason I know it wa hawaiian and not jibberish, wa I copied some of the text and went to google.com/translate and pasted it into the translate box. It said it wa hawaiian. Weird. And the only way to fix the problem wa to go to google translate's page. That somehow fix the bug. Clearing the cache, all of it, even site preference did not do anything to fix it. The only fix I could find wa to go directly to google translate.

I'm using Linux Mint 10's version of firefox 3.6.16. The search box is a custom google search (why? I do not know.) I have installed all updates, level 1-3, firefox wa included in the update.
