SELinux bug or real security issue?
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Build ID: 20161130084405

Steps to reproduce:

A few month ago, I enabled e10s in Firefox (48, I think), on a number of Fedora 23 & 24 installations. Pretty soon, I started seeing SELinux alert stating "SELinux is preventing 57656220436F6E74656E74 from 'create' access on the rawip_socket Unknown.".
(see bug
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1275961
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1230052
)
As I've mentioned in RHBZ#1275961, these warning appeared almost on every visit to www.merriam-webster.com and on a few other site with ad rotators, such a Ars Technica. In the latter cases, the warning popped up a soon a a particular ad came into view. I haven't been able to pinpoint the ad in question, though.

The latest selinux-policy update (selinux-policy-3.13.1-225.3.fc25) doe not audit the creation of rawip socket any more, so the message are gone:
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/selinux-policy.git/commit/?id=6319c499e49abffa7520a40a11c30851eab9425f

I couldn't find a similar issue in BMO so I had to ask: wa this indeed a SELinux bug or could it be something else?
