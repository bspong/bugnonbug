Restart trigger blank warning box, freeze browser

After installing a new extension (I cannot remember which one, unfortunately) and selecting "restart," I encountered an empty dialogue box which I assume wa supposed to contain a warning or error notice, freezing up the browser (preventing the restart and not allowing closure of the window)

A screenshot is attached, indicating which page I wa using. Note that I wa logged into Meebo at the time, which traditionally display a warning whenever that tab is closed, encouraging user to officially disconnect from the Meebo site first. It is possible that this wa a site-specific problem, but a blank error box may be better handled.

I wish I could provide better details, and hope that this issue can be replicated and identified.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a few tab of Ajaxy service open (might want to especially try Meebo)
2.Try to install a new extension
3.Select restart after the extension is added
Actual Results:
Blank error message and a frozen Firefox.

Expected Results:
Browser window to shut down and re-open. Perhaps encounter a brief delay for some dialogue box from certain site (such a the Meebo warning).
