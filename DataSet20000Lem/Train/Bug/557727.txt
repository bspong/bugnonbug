High CPU consumption and memory usage with Yahoo home pag

It look like the advertising on the Yahoo mail page is still running after I close that tab. I run with the initial Yahoo page (not MyYahoo) in one tab, and Yahoo mail in another tab. The both tab are running moving advertising. If I open an e-mail, download an attached file, the CPU usage go up to and stay at about 50%. The memory usage go from about 90000KB to 160000KB and stay in that region. I can close the mail tab, and there is no change in the usage statistics. Another effect is that the menu pull-downs are only visible by the right-hand and lower shadows. I sometimes have to jump between tab and do a couple of downloads, but the issue occurs within minute of my trying to reproduce it. Firefox doesn't respond to the window close button in the upper right, won't move to the foreground if I click on it when something is on top of it, and ha to be killed by either Alt-F4 or by killing it in the Task Manager.

I'm running Windows 32-bit, my virus scanner is AVG, my machine is a dual-core with 3GB of RAM. Right now, I have two tab open and my machine is oscillating between 110000 and 160000 KB of memory and 15 to 50% CPU usage, the menu pull-downs are visible, and life is ok.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a tab at the Yahoo home page, and a tab in Yahoo mail. Switch between tab a few time quickly.
2.Open a couple of e-mails, download an attachment (mine are virus scanned by Norton [from Yahoo?] in the process) and open it.
3.Return to the home page tab, and the badness should have happened by now. If it hasn't try the sequence again.
