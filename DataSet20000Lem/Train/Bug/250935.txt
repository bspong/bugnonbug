Accept cookie dialogue: too easy to accidentally allow cooky

If I navigate to a site which try to store/modify a cookie, with "Ask for each
cookie" enabled, then, a that site is still loading, open a new tab and proceed
to enter a URL (not looking at the screen); then when I press Enter to enter the
URL, I inadvertently dismiss the Accept Cookie dialogue and allow the cookie.

Two proposed solutions: (1) change the default button of the dialogue to
something other than Allow; or, better, (2) the dialogue only appears when
viewing the applicable tab.

Not an important bug, but it's bloody annoying having to go into Options and
search through lot of stored cooky to correct the mistake.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set "Ask for each cookie" to true
2. Clear Exceptions list
3. Visit a site that request a cookie
4. While the page is loading, switch to another tab and type a URL into the
location bar (blindly - looking at the keyboard)
5. Enter the URL

Actual Results:
Cookie dialogue had popped up; pressing Enter allowed cooky from the first site.

Expected Results:
Cookie dialogue shouldn't have popped up, or the default button should have been
different, so that blindly pressing Enter would not cause cooky to be accepted.
