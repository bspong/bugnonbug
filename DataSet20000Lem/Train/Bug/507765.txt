Please put back the progress indicator on the mouse cursor during pageload. In fact, please fix progress indicator in general - there are none available by default!

It is very frustrating being unable to discern whether a page is loading or the browser ha crashed, a the behavior is the same for both conditions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page
2. Navigate to another page, preferably one with a long load time, either by clicking a link typing a URL into the address bar and pressing enter
3. Observe the confusion that ensues.
Actual Results:
I had no idea whether the browser had crashed, a I could not click any other link on the page after navigating elsewhere and my current page wa still visible, or if the page wa just loading and the browser wa working fine.

Expected Results:
I expected some kind of default progress indicator, preferably in the footer bar a well a on the mouse cursor.
