I am a seller on eBay. Since the 2.0.0.16 update to Firefox two day ago on 7/14 I cannot see the image I uploaded into my eBay lot descriptions. I know they are there because I can see them if I switch to Internet Explorer rendering (via the IE Tab add-on). I can also see the image in other peoples' lots, just not my own.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an eBay lot description that includes a JPG image uploaded from a remote image hosting web site.
2. After the auction ha started, open the lot description and view the image both in normal Firefox and via the IE Tab add-on.
Actual Results:
I cannot see my uploaded JPGs. I don't even get a space marker or an empty spot. It is a if there is nothing there at all. If I use the IE Tab add-on, the JPGs appear a normal. This problem surfaced with the update to version 2.0.0.16.

Expected Results:
All JPGs should appear a normal without having to use the IE Tab add-on.
