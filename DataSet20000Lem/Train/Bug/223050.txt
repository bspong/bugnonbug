Cookies on some site are not being saved after Firebird session ends.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

The above url example is just one of many site that require login user id and
passwords. It happens a lot of forums. But it also happens on Slashdot's site
a well. The only site that seem to keep their cooky are Yahoo and
Amazon.com. Just about every other site forgets the cookie after the Firebird
session end -- that is, I close Firebird.

When I reopen Firebird and visit the forum websites, for example, I have to
re-enter my user id and password.

Under Tools->Options->Privacy, I have Cookies Enabled. I have experienced this
problem with previous build of Firebird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a forum website or Slashdot.
2. Close Firebird.
3. Reopen Firebird and visit the site again.

Actual Results:
My login wa not remembered. I had to re-enter my user id and password all over
again.

Expected Results:
It should have remembered my cookie from my previous session where I already
logged in. I should not have to log in again.
