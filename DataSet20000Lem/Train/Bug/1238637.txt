It's too easy to click unwanted toolbarbutton when clicking on dropmarker which is Always located in urlbar unlike other toolbarbuttons
>>> My Info: Win7_64, Nightly 46, 32bit, ID 20160110030214
STR:
1. Open the following "data:" url. This is emulation of the situation when a long article load
> data:text/html,<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="4; url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/a06mp7io7mnby9u/unload%20tab.htm?dl=0"/>
2. Hover mouse over the dropmarker (don't move mouse after this step)
[You must perform Steps 1-2 in le than 4 seconds]
3. Wait 4 second
4. Wait until the dropbox page is loaded
5. CLICK!

Result:
After Step 5 Reader view button is clicked, and that take you to unwanted about:reader page
User is forced to move mouse to the back button in urlbar (across all screen), click it,
then move mouse to the dropmarker, but don't click it until the page is fully loaded.
As said in Step 1, this is emulation of the situation when a long article loads. That mean that
user doesn't know when reader view (or any other unwanted icon) appears, so he click it accidentally
instead of the dropmarker.

Expectations:
Dropmarker is _Always_ located in urlbar, therefore it shouldn't move on page load.
There wa 2 options: either to keep the dropmarker untouched, or remove it.
I don't know how the 3rd option "twitch the dropmarker a often a possible" wa chosen, but it's not
a good option. It's like the idea to twitch reload button a often a possible.
As I underlined in bug 1231025, the more twitching, the harder it is to use the browser.
