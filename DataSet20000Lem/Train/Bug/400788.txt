This is most likely a custom theme issue, but in case it's not:

If you apply a background image to the main browser window with the following CSS:

window[windowtype="navigator:browser"][theme="nasanightlaunch"] {
background: url("chrome://global/skin/subskins/window-picture-4/sts116-s-021.png") top right no-repeat #232323 !important;
}

the background image doesn't show up until the place edit bookmark popup/panel/dialog opens. It's not the operation of the toolbarbutton that doe it; it's the opening of the panel. Also not triggered by opening the Options window, a menubar menu, or a context menu in the page content area. So far, only the place dialog make the window background image show up.

The CSS is in a CSS file @imported in userChrome.css.

I can provide detail if this is worth pursuing.
