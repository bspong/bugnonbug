If you create a new profile at SeattleJobs.com on the given web site, you can
select an 'Industry Focus' on one menu, and javascript will then fill in a lower
menu with subcategories. At the same time, it try to resize that window. So,
doing a 'view selection source', the menu start off:

<font size="1">Positions: (Select 10 Maximum)</font><br>
<select disabled="disabled" width="30" name="positions"
onchange="javascript:changeSkills(document.F);" multiple="multiple"
size="5"></select>

Then, after I select "Science/Biotech" from the 'Industry Focus' list above,
this change to:

Categories: (Select 7 Maximum)</font><br>
<select width="50" name="categories"
onchange="javascript:changeJobs(document.F);" multiple="multiple"
size="5"><option value="874">Life Sciences</option><option
value="896">Pharmaceutical</option><option value="898">Physical
Sciences</option><option value="915">Science/Biotech Technicians</option><option
value="917">Social Sciences</option></select>

The menu is successfully updated, and the new item appear in the list.
However, the list is still just a wide a it wa originally, when there wa
nothing in it, and all I can read is, "Life S", "Phar", "Phys", etc. This
problem is compounded on a later updated menu, when all I can then see is the
first letter of the new content.
