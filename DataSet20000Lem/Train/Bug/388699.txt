If Firefox is SIGINTed or something to that effect, it spawn a tab of it welcome page on every window that is reopened with the internal session saver framework. This is unnecessary and gunk up my many window upon restoration.

Moreover, when Firefox restores in this welcome mode, all installed plugins treat the Firefox restore a the first start with the plugin enabled; hence a plethora of welcome and introductory screen are shown. This is annoying.

It appears the problem lie in Firefox with it welcome mode or whatever it is.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Delicious and FireGPG extensions;
2. Start multiple windows, each with a couple of tab open;
3. Give Firefox SIGINT;
4. Restart Firefox; and
5. Inform Firefox to restore the session.
Actual Results:
Behold a variety of extension welcome screen that normally do not appear when Firefox is routinely started. Behold a tab of Firefox's welcome screen on all windows.

Expected Results:
My session should be restored without all of this extraneous crap.
