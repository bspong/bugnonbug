Firefox hang when you close it when browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML is enabled

If set browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML to true and have a large bookmark file, Firefox hang - the process doe NOT exist after a reasonable time required to export bookamrks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a very large bookmark library
2. set browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML to true
3. Close Firefox (from the File menu, select 'Exit')
Actual Results:
After several minute if you start Firefox, it cannot start properly since the previous process wa not terminated.

Expected Results:
You get an error message "Firefox is already running"

Use the task manager to verify that Firefox process doe NOT exit after you close Firefox, even after a long delay!
The only way to recover is to kill an old Firefox process manually, and then start Firefox. I had to disable browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML to preclude this problem. This very inconvenient, since I have to export bookmark manually.
