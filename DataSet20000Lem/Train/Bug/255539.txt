Reload doe not fetch againg http (server provided) header parameter
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

I realized that my web page, which used to validate in the w3c page, doe not
validate anymore and it stopped to display non ascii character correctly. I
investigated the problem and I discovered that in order to determine the
charset, a browser should look first in the HTTP header (whatever it means),
then in the <meta> field in the header of the html file. Please see
http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/charset.html#h-5.2.2
to find

To sum up, conforming user agent must observe the following priority when
determining a document's character encoding (from highest priority to lowest):

1. An HTTP "charset" parameter in a "Content-Type" field.
2. A META declaration with "http-equiv" set to "Content-Type" and a value
set for "charset".
3. The charset attribute set on an element that designates an external
resource.

I discovered that I could change the default charset that my server sends by
adding a file .htaccess containing
AddDefaultCharset iso-8859-1

When I did it, my page wa not reloading correctly (same charset problem), but
it started validate correctly again. Them I cleaned the cache, and it started to
display correctly. So, "reload" doe not reload everything :-(

I removed the file and repeated the process with my Mozilla version
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4.1) Gecko/20031114
and it reloads *correctly*. Strange, isn't it?

This behaviour is allways reproduced in firefox .9.3

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure that your HTTP server sends some charset on page request, and that
you can *change* that (or on server seettings or via .htaccess file)
2. Put a page in a different encoding so that it doe not display well and open
firefox in this page. (To know what should change, please see the w3c page given
above.)
3. Change server setting
4. Reload and see if the page is now correctly displayed (not in my case)
5. Close Firefox and visit again the page (here still not correct)
6. Clean cache and visit page again (now ok for me)
Actual Results:
Reload doe not get the new server setting (charset in my case).

Expected Results:
All page related content should be reload, not only the content of accessed files.
