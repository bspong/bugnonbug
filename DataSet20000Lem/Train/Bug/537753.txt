When browser.search.openintab is set to TRUE, performing a search from the location bar using a search engine's keyword (e.g. "y" for yahoo!) result in loading the search result in the current tab instead of a new one.

I think that the important thing here is that when you are using a search engine shortcut you want to do a search, no matter if you are typing the query in the location bar.
Thus the behaviour should be consequent, i.e. equivalent to the one you get when searching from the search bar, i.e. open the result in a new tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set browser.search.openintab to TRUE
2.assign a shortcut to a search engine, e.g. "y" for Yahoo!
3.load an URL in a tab, e.g. www.url.com in tab "A"
4.search FROM THE SEARCH BAR using Yahoo, e.g. the query "query"
5.search FROM THE LOCATION BAR using the shortcut associated to Yahoo, i.e. typing "y query"
Actual Results:
At step 4, search result are correctly opened in a new tab.
At step 5, search result are wrongly opened in tab "A"

Expected Results:
If browser.search.openintab is set to TRUE, search result should be opened in a new tab in both cases, whether you are searching from the location bar or from the search bar, i.e. at step 5 a new tab displaying the search result should be opened, instead of showing them in tab "A"
