This is kind of hard to explain without a screenshot, so I'm going to follow up with a few in a second. What seems to be happening is that the window, chrome and all, try to expand into an area beyond the right-hand window boundary. Ducks out from under your cursor and hide in the bushes, sort of. It's a fabulous prank, but I feel like that's not what you were going for.

This doesn't happen when you drag to the left. It doesn't happen when the sidebar isn't open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open enough tab to cause the tab bar to overflow.
2. Open the bookmark sidebar. (The viewable area of the tab bar will shrink.)
3. Scroll the tab bar to the far left.
4. Grab and drag a tab, and try to hover over the scrollbox arrow on the right-hand side of the window. (Try to scroll the tab bar to the right while dragging a tab.)
Actual Results:
Entirety of window content overflow the window boundary by about half an inch (well, half an inch on my iBook screen), which make the scroll box inaccessible.

Expected Results:
Tab bar scrolls.
