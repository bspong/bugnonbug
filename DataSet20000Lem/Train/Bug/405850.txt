Using window.open() in a link fails when the web page is served from a subdomain. If the target filename doe not contain a blank, instead of a new window being opened, the file is displayed in the original window. When the filename contains a blank, the second parameter is used a the filename instead of the first one. When the same page is accessed through a top-level domain, everything is ok.

This wa tested in 2.0.0.5, 2.0.010 and 3.0ß1

Example:

- Go to http://myjumplog.net
- Click on link '1533' at the top of the right frame.
- A chart will open in a new window
- Close this window
- Click on link '6' at the bottom of the right frame.
- A chart will open in a new window
- Close this window

Repeat the same procedure, this time on http://my.jumplog.net

- For the first link (1533) an error message is returned that file /totals is not found. This is the name of the target window from the second parameter.

Link behind '1533': javascript:void(window.open("ParalogBarChart_Date [Year]_Jumps.png","totals","width=660,height=500,toolbar=no,dependent=yes"))

- For the second link, instead of a new window opening, the chart is displayed in the right frame.

Link behind '6': javascript:void(window.open("ParalogPieChart_Place.png","totals","width=660,height=500,toolbar=no,dependent=yes"))
