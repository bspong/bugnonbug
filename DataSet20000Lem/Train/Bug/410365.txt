Whenever I zoom with ctrl+mousewheel in firefox, the system hangs. If I zoom say 4 or 5 click on the wheel, the window will gray out and it take about 20 second to catch up. Same problem if I hit ctrl++ or ctrl+- more than 3 time in a row. No other significant speed problem on the whole system. It just slows down when zooming in firefox. The amount of text on a page affect the problem, i.e. zooming www.google.com is faster than en.wikipedia.org, however google is also very slow. No problem on same system with window firefox. Same problem on other PC with ubuntu 7.10.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Zoom with mouse wheel to a much larger or smaller size than default to cause heavy slowdown.
2. Zoom with ctrl++ or ctrl-- 1 time to cause minor slowdown
3. Zoom with ctrl++ or ctrl-- 3 time or more to cause increasingly drastic slowdown.
Actual Results:
Depending on the amount of zoom, system slows down more and more.

Expected Results:
The zoom should be very quick, anything le than 4 or 5 zoom increment quickly should not be noticably slower. Should work the same a window firefox.
