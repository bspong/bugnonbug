I created two screenshots for you: you can see Safari in MacOs on the left, Firefox in MacOs on the middle and Firefox in Vista on the right.

---------------------------------------------------------
1. Showing English page:

a you can see - there's no problem at all - all font look similar and the positioning is a correct a it should be
----------------------------------------------------------
2. Showing localized (Russian) page:

and here you may notice that Firefox in MacOS ha some serious trouble with font looking "squeezy and smaller" and the possitioning go to hell. At the same time Safari and Firefox in Vista show the page the way it should be.
----------------------------------------------------------

Also I would like to point out that
1. I never changed any font setting for Firefox in MacOS from it default
2. As you may see Safari in Mac Os show the page exactly a Firefox in Vista so all font needed are present and fine
3. Problems with font and positioning for localized page in FireFox for Mac go way further while surfing more complex page which make it almost impossible for comfortable browsing

Reproducible: Always

1. just navigate to any russian site
2.
3.
Actual Results:
font look squezed and smaller resulting corrupted view and layout problem

FF for Mac should show the page the way it doe in Windows
