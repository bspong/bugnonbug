The new Firefox 4.0 is causing fatal hang when going to the Tools -> Add-Ons page (i.e. "Manage Add-Ons"). Specifically, the screen start to flicker and, after a few seconds, will hang completely. Logging in via shell show that Xorg is taking up 100% CPU, and the only way to recover is to kill it (which kill the entire desktop session). Occasionally, Xorg will simply kill itself, again causing an abrupt logout.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox 4.0 on CentOS 5.x
2. Visit Tools -> Add-Ons
3. Hang and die!
Actual Results:
The screen will flicker horribly for a few seconds, then the display will hang entirely. Xorg may kill itself, or may hang forever.

Expected Results:
No flickering should occur, and browsing should continue normally.

I'm on CentOS 5.x (5.2 specifically). Since FF 4.0 requires GLIBCXX_3.4.9, which is not part of CentOS 5.x, I have a manually-compiled libstdc++.so.6.0.10 installed, which allows FF4 to launch just fine. The problem isn't with that library.

When the flickering occurs, I get this repeated dozen of time in /var/log/Xorg.0.log:
(II) NVIDIA(0): Initialized GPU GART.

This basically fill the log until Xorg dies.

I'm running NVIDIA driver 180.29, using a Quadro FX 370, for whatever that's worth.

FF4 is the only thing that cause problems... everything else on the system work just fine, and this error only occurs with FF4, which is why I think it's an FF4 problem.

Advice is most welcome.
