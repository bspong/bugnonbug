QuickTime content fails to load other QT content when viewed form a server requiring authentication. All work a expected when placed on an unsecured area.

The content to load is gotten via an XML/PHP file external to the QT movie. The page loads, the movie opens, and poll the server for what else it's supposed to load. When on an unsecure server, all work OK.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL: http://www.grooveboxmusic.com/amember/memberarea/test/index.html
2. Let page load
3. See nothing happen. :(

1a. Go to URL: http://www.grooveboxmusic.com/test/index.html
2a. Let page load
3a. See thing happen. :)
Actual Results:
1-3: Shell movie loads, but not the external file

1a-3a: Shell movie loads, then load external movies.

Expected Results:
Shell movie loads, then load external movies.

This occurs on Mac, MacIntel, and Win, in various flavor of Firefox.
