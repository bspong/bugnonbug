I've been making admin page on a site, and at first thought my computer wa badly setup, for the upload worked on the other 3 computer running on the same network, except this freshly installed one. I have not updated the others to ff 2.0.0.5, but before re-installing the prog on this machine i checked and found the post to work in ie6.

after downgrading to ff 2.0.0.4, the problem vanished.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use ff 2.0.0.5 to post a file using the form element "file"
2. read the request object at the server, or
3. observe the failed file upload.
Actual Results:
Failed uploads. I dont know how many site are affected by this, but any site i tried using standard form component and then server processing failed.

Expected Results:
Processed the file and completed the upload, a happens correctly in ff 2.0.0.4, or the grotty version of ie6 i have to use to test compatability with the unwashed.

no theme, Machine is a 3.2 64 bit machine running xp 32, 1 gig ram, fresh install xp service pack 2. ( i repeat, this worked fine with ie 6 and after downgrading to 2.0.0.4 it work again. )
