Browser becomes unresponsive after lot of uploads
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009070611 Firefox/3.0.12 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

As part of my job, I have to upload short video clip (75-100MB each) to about 10-14 websites, about 3-4 time a time.

The website have various type of upload forms, from the basic html form to html with javascript progress bar to flash upload forms.

So I just have the 10-14 website opened, each in it own tab, click on "Uploa new video" or whatever, fill the form, select video, click on the Upload button, and then leave the browser untouched until the next time I have to upload a clip.

After about 7-12 days, all of the sudden when I try to click on any tab on any link in the pages, the browser becomes unresponsive:

The first time a link is clicked the text "Waiting for ..." appears in the status bar and the small rotating circle on the left of the tab start spinning but nothing happens.
After this, no matter what I do nothing happens, just that rotating circle animation on the left of the tab start spinning.
The browser is otherwise not frozen, I can browse menus, access history, whatever, but no page are loaded even if I use new tab and type manually an address.
If I close Firefox, it close almost instantly, but it remains active in background and it doe not close until I end the process with Task Manager. However, if I do this, next time Firefox start there's no session restore popup, tab are not reopened, I don't see the page saved in history so I have to re-open the page manually.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a basic form that accepts file uploads, upload form on a webserver and make it accessible through several subdomains or domain to simulate the 10-14 website
2. open each for in a tab
2. upload large file to each form lot of time (probably at least 4x 7-14 a I usually upload 4 clip a day and Firefox stop responding between 1 and 2 weeks)
3. click on some link on the form to reset the form / upload another file and see Firefox stop responding
Actual Results:
Firefox stop responding, is no longer usable, must be closed using Task Manager, session restore is lost, history is lost, tab are not re-opened

Expected Results:
Firefox should work normally and should not freeze.

I realize it's a weird report and maybe hard to test, but it already happened to me two time during the course of the previous month so in my opinion it's definitely an issue.

I'm reporting it a minor because it's kind of hard to trigger - I don't think there's many people keeping the browser open with the same tab for 1-2 weeks...
