Bookmarks panel open in unexpected place in window.open()
>>> My Info: Win7_64, Nightly 49, 32bit, ID 20160526082509
STR_1:
1. Open the following "data:" url or click URL in the form above
> data:text/html,<html ondblclick='window.open("http://example.org","","resizable,width="+window.screen.width+",height="+(window.screen.height-180))'>
2. Doubleclick on the page
3. Press Ctrl+D in window opened in Step 2

AR: Bookmarks panel open at the bottom of the window, so I can't change name/keyword
ER: No bug, i.e. X or Y or something else
X) Bookmarks panel should open in normal place
Y) Bookmarks panel should be restricted in that window


Notes:
Somebody may say that it's unlikely for window.open() to open a window that show bookmark panel at
the bottom: (1) it happens for any height le or equal to "screen height - 180"
(2) There's also STR_2 showing trouble of bookmark panel opened at the top of the window.
So, all bookmark panel experience is broken anyway, and therefore arguement above is useless.

Actually STR_2 look like a XUL bug, but I don't want to report it separately, because the only known
testcase will be fixed with STR_1 (by setting an appropriate target for bookmark panel ofc).

STR_2:
1. Open data:text/html,<html ondblclick='window.open("http://example.org","","resizable")'>
2. Doubleclick on the page
3. Press Ctrl+D in window opened in Step 2
4. Click twice on the dropmarker to the right from the field "Separate tag with commas"
5. Click on the page, ~30px below the bookmark panel

AR: Bookmarks panel is still opened
ER: There should be no bookmark panel after Step 5
