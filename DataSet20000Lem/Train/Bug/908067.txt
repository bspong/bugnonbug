The profile in question wa on Windows 7 with Aero Glass. This would likely point to the full-width box-shadow for the Aero Glass fog behind the tabstrip being a large portion of the box-shadow cost.

I'll do a quick test of the cost of commenting out the glass fog to see how much of an improvement it gives. We can figure out how to make this faster afterwards.
