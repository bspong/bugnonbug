After downloading the most recent version, I noticed if have firefox open all day, by the end of the day (or faster if I'm using the computer alot that day), the response time of my computer, usually noticeable most in gmail, is UBER-slow. We're talking -- I'll type in a sentence, get up from my chair, go heat my tea up and maybe the computer ha caught up with what I've typed. If I close firefox, restart, and get back into firefox, the issue is gone -- at least for another couple of hours.

I don't have the problem with internet explorer (But I don't LIKE IE, I like Firefox!)

I have an HP Pavillion dv2000 (64-bit).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. sign on to firefox after restarting
2. use firefox (usually with gmail open in one of the tabs)
3. by the end of the day I'm crawling in email, and movement on website is hindered.


Expected Results:
let me move the mouse, click, type and respond immediately!!!
