If you open a listbox ("select" form elements) in a web page by clicking on it, then move the mouse away from it while leaving it open, and then scroll the page up or down using the mouse wheel, the listbox stay still, not following the page during scrolling, or even go crazy and jump out of the window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit any web page containing a form which includes a listbox, e.g. http://www.cnet.com/
2. Click on the listbox (showing "All CNET" in my example) to make it open; the example one will show 2 items.
3. Move the mouse pointer away from the listbox.
4. Scroll the page down/up with the mouse wheel.

Actual Results:
The listbox more or le stay in the same place where it was, while the page scroll under it. It's "more or less" because it also seems to try to catch up late with the page, but this cause even stranger effects: if you scroll down fast then the listbox can temporarily appear outside the page area, or even over the OSX menu bar!

Expected Results:
The open listbox should scroll smoothly together with other page elements.
