AJAX ASP.NET special character displayed/saved incorrectly
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/4.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.5.21022; .NET CLR 3.0.30729)

using Telerik's RadEditor for AJAX ASP.NET
http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax/editor.aspx
the form will incorrectly save and incorrectly redisplay any special (non alphabetical or numerical) character causing incorrect displaying of the saved document.

For example:

<br> is saved and redisplayed a ~3cbr~3e, &nbsp; is displayed a ~26nbsp~3b and ! is displayed a ~21

essentially breaking any HTML saved in the form. This is true of both the wysiwyg and code version of the program.

This form worked perfectly in firefox 3.0.7 on the same system

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open an article with radeditor
2. save the article with any type of html in it
3. view the saved article
Actual Results:
all html is broken causing the page to display all code in ASP/AJAX 'safe' code mode (added slashes) a stated above. breaking all html/css image and formatting.

Expected Results:
html character should be saved and displayed correctly and a validated code snipped should appear correctly

this wa tested on the same system immediately before and after upgrading to firefox 3.1b3 from 3.0.7
