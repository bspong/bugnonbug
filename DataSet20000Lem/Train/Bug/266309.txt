Windows localized installers don't honor CHARSET/FONTSIZE/FONTNAME for the main dialog.
The Windows localized installers are not honoring the CHARSET/FONTSIZE/FONTNAME
directive from install.ini. This mean that in many case improper font are
being used to display the installer dialogs.

The directive can be found here:

However, they don't affect anything useful. Instead, the font are taken from
the setup resource DLL

The Japanese team ha been hacking around this problem by using a resource
editor to change the font name prior to release. But this obviously suck for
automated releases.

I *think* that a simple solution involves sending a WM_SETFONT message when we
initialize each dialog, but I'm not sure exactly where this call should be made;
I feel like I'm wandering through a spaghetti of win32 API, so if anyone else
understands this code better than I, please step forward.

An alternative hack is to rebuild setuprsrc.dll for each locale, and use
preprocessor defines to hardcode the font setting into the resource DLL. It
might be easier, but it kinda sucks.

As a sidenote that might also need fixing, the title font is hardcoded to

This should be configurable a well.
