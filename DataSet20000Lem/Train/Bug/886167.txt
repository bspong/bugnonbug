restore ability to install addons centralized
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:19.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/19.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130307023931

Steps to reproduce:

Upgrade from Firefox 19 to any version from 20 upwards.



Actual results:

Local user profile Addon database get erased during the upgrade.
Addons installed to the program install folder do not get registered any more in any user profile.

Every user is forced to register and upgrade addons on his own. There is no more possibility to provide user with predefined set of addons without grabbing into the user profile by the admin.

What means: Breaking of rule of responsible behavior from the viewpoint of an admin. Multiplying workload on the admin. Multiplying dataload on the network.

Extremely blatant in environments, where an admin ha to provide hundred of workstation with upgrades.


Expected results:

As it wa up to version 19, Addons installed under the program install folder should be implicitly loaded under each and every user profile. So to provide a bunch of addons by the admin at a centralized place, doing a one time installation or upgrade, taking effect for each and every user profile from that moment on.

Instead of having to poke around a dozent of time at least each and every month at each and every upgrade of firefox and additionally at each and every update of each and every addon on it own. Gelle?! That's simply stupid.

Up to version 19, it wa possible to do provide installs of and upgrade to addons at a centralized place, with very little workload and even very little load to LAN network in case those addons needed upgrades. From version 20 on that became forced to decentralize. The latter should NOT happen!
