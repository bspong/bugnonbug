'file could not be saved because an unknown error occurred. Sorry about that ' while saving a file

Our intranet application allows one to download files. When doing that using
firefox I get this message:

--- snip ---
<made up filename> could not be saved because an unknown error occurred.

Sorry about that. Try saving to a different location.
--- snip ---
The filename in my case is:
"c:\docume~1\userna~1\locals~1\temp\6fquz3o0-9999.doc" with my real username
instead of userna~1.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a file using our intranet application :) I will include header
captured using the 'Live HTTP headers' extension.

Actual Results:
I got an error dialog.

Expected Results:
The file should have been saved.

This could be connected to the fact that the server is using https, so perhaps
the file is not saved because of some 'don't save secure pages' policy or something.

I can readily imagine something being wrong with the header the server is
sending; Please let me know what it should send so I can fix it. Obviously these
header work for internet explorer.

The error message make no sense though, especially the stupid 'Sorry about
that' apology and the suggestion to save it somewhere else when I wasn't even
offered a chance to save it somewhere. I also do not understand where the file
name in the dialog come from.
