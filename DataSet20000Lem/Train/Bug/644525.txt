Session Restore doe not work after cold boot or reboot: homepage format changed back to default
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

For years, I routinely will leave 6-12 separate FF window open to 'keep my place' on project so I do not have to recreate them. I do not use tabs. Now with 4.0, Session Restore 'seems' to work if I close FF and restart but only if I don't shut down and cold boot or reboot the system. Frustrating to lose my work each time. that is hwy I am so digital to not have lot of paper.

Separate but perhaps related issue: my homepage format changes. I use Google news for my homepage. I only customize by closing the "News for you" by clicking the close 'x' in upper right hand corner of the section just below 'Two column'. Then I also click on two column. Prior to 4.0 update, this would be maintained every time I opened a new FF window. I do not have a Goggle account of any kind, so I am guessing it is a FF cookie problem.

Please advise if hardware configuration also needed.

Best, 4GR

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Reboot system or cold boot after normal shut down
2.Start FF 4.0

Actual Results:
Homepage is changed to default; doe not maintain personal config of closing news for you and maintaining two column

Only FF window opens, no restoration of multiple FF window whatsoever.

Expected Results:
Prior to FF 4.0, for years, I leave many,frequently 6-12 window (not tab - not my style) to 'save my place' from online projects. whenever I rebooted or did a system start and started FF, my last FF window left open would open or at least I would get the 'embarrassing' page with the restore button and then off I would I go with FF where I left off from my last session.
