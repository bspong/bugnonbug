While this may be related to 181456, I don't think that it is exactly the same.

The Save Page As... [Web Page, complete] function turn a series of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into a series of &Acirc;/#194 character (the actual
character, not the ampersand entity) separated by spaces. Consequently the page
look bad when it is loaded back up in Firefox.

I think that this may be a consequence of an encoding scheme mismatch (the local
filesystem come up with ISO-8859-1, whereas the W3 website us UTF-8).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a webpage that ha a long sequence of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the URL
provided is a case where I noticed the problem)
2. File -> Save Page As...
3. Choose Web Page, complete a the file type
4. Save the file.
5. Load the file back in the browser and observe the ickyness.

Actual Results:
The sequence of "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"
look like "A A A A A" (except the Acirc character instead).

Expected Results:
I don't mind that the save a function loses the &xxx; character sequence when
it save the file, a long a it save the correct character. Ideally though,
any unusual character should be saved using the &#xxx; sequence to
opportunitythe chance for such error to occur.

Now this could be a critical bug for two reasons, but I'll let someone else
decide that.
1. It cause data loss (but it doe have a workaround, albeit a painful and
tedious one.
2. It should just work - this is not an advanced feature and the impact on user
who see such a bug is fairly negative.
