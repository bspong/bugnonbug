If a message is sent by a pdf (on pdf object a messageHandler with function "onMessage" is set) to it host container only a part of the message is received. After which amount of character the message is cut depends on the length of the original message. Special about that is that the message is very large, because it is the whole pdf a a base64 coded string, so the message could consist of more than 10000 characters. With short message this proplem did not occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add message handler to an embedded pdf (pdfObject.messageHandler = {};)
2. register function (pdfObject.messageHandler.onMessage = myFunction;)
3. define function "myFunction" with array parameter
4. send message from pdf to host container --> myFunction should be called
Actual Results:
The passed parameter is cut after some character

Expected Results:
The message should be the same a the original message which wa sent and not only a part of it.
