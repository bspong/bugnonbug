Bookmarks file truncated in a full hard drive

After a rogue program completely filled my system partition, my bookmark file
got truncated.

Couldn't say exactly when, I just suddenly saw half my bookmark had
dissapeared. Immediately browsed to my profile folder, just to find that the
autobackup wa also truncated: I restarted Firefox after the file truncation, it
seems.

I supose this problem could also affect other file saving routines, too, not
only bookmarks. Strangely, I didn't notice any other odd behavior, I could
browse unhindered. Maybee Firefox doe check free space when caching pages, and
deletes old one if needed?

You will excuse me if I don't fill my system partition again to reproduce it,
but I got enough weird error already. ;-)

It seems not a single program I use actually check for free space: I got plenty
of weird error because of the filled drive (mostly when program tried to
create temp files), but no one actually correctly described the actual problem,
had to discover it for myself.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill your profile drive.
2. Modify your bookmarks.
3. Cry

Actual Results:
My bookmark file wa truncated.

Expected Results:
It should leave the bookmark file untouched and cry about full drive.
