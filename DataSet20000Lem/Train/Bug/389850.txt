Since the recent 2.0.0.5 release, I've noticed that certain page do not display properly or in some case are missing content. As one would assume, these page are most likely the very same one that are best viewed with IE and not designed to work with firefox. I have tried loading an identical page in both. The IE display is proper, the firefox is not. One example is when I log into my Facebook account. The tab at the profile page simply do not show up in firefox. However, if I hover my mouse of where they should appear, they do.

The second thing I noticed is that on certain page where you have the option of clicking a link that simply open a small non-resize able window such a a "help" window, doe not display the content in full. By that, I mean if it is simply a few paragraph of text (which is usually the case), you can only read about the first 4 or 5 word of each line because the rest of the text run beyond the border of the window and there is no scroll bar or any other option to view the content in whole.

I don't exactly mind using my IE View extension, but a problem is a problem worth reporting.
