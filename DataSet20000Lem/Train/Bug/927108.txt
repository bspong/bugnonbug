Pushing certified apps doe not work
Using Gecko from a nightly build for "latest-hamachi-eng-mozilla-central" on Oct 15, and Gaia master from Oct 15.

I tried the step here to enable debugging and pushing of certified apps via the app manager:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager#Debugging_Certified_Apps

But I still get a "installationFailed: Installing certified apps is not allowed." message when trying to push the app.

Something that could indicate the core problem: webapps.js check for a DOMApplicationRegistry.allowSideloadingCertified to allow installation:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/webapps.js#391

but there are no other "allowSideloadingCertified" reference found in the code.

jryans on IRC pointed to this code change a when that section last changed:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=805062&action=diff

Perhaps that allowSideloadingCertified use need to check something that check the devtools.debugger.forbid-certified-apps pref.

Getting this to work is very useful for UX review for Gaia. Previously I worked out this process for them to do easier review of dev app snapshots:

https://github.com/jrburke/gaia-dev-zip#for-the-ux-person

but that simulator pathway no longer work with Gaia 1.2 and greater, and I wa hoping to switch that process over to the app manager.
