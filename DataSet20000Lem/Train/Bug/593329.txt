Firefox 3.6.8 - Mac OS X 10.5.8 - No PDF print output

With Firefox 3.6.8 on my PowerPC-based eMac running Mac OS X 10.5.8, I can no longer produce PDFs from within Firefox.

This problem appears to be limited to just Firefox. Others apps (Mail, Safari, etc) still allow me to print document to the PDF format.

When I create a PDF with Firefox and then try to open it with Adobe Acrobat, I get the following error message:

"There wa an error opening this document. The file is damaged and could not be repaired."

Thanks,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any web page (banking, travel reservations, Google, etc).
2. Select "file/print" and attempt to print a PDF using Mac OS X PDF creation.
3. Try and open newly created PDF file which will report back a damaged.
Actual Results:
Firefox produce unusable PDF documents.

Expected Results:
Firefox should produce a PDF file that is readable by Adobe Acrobat and other PDF viewer (e.g. Mac OS X Preview).

Current work-around is to use Apple's Safari (yuck!) instead of Firefox if I need to create a PDF while web-browsing.
