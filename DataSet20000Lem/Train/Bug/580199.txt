>20 active downloads cause Firefox to freeze

I can consistently cause Firefox to crash with 21-22 active downloads. I have not been able to get beyond 22. I have tried this with downloads from the same host or multiple host with the same result. The main window and the download window both freeze. I can monitor network traffic and see that the transfer stop at the same time. If I terminate the process and reopen Firefox, I can resume the downloads. I have tried waiting up 1 hour to see if Firefox will unfreeze with no success. After long waits, I cannot resume the downloads. I have not determined what that threshold is though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Initiate multiple downloads large enough to accumulate more than 20 active ones.
Actual Results:
Firefox freeze

Expected Results:
The downloads should eventually complete utilizing the available bandwidth.

I don't use any add-on that affect the download functionality. I use the built-in download manager. The computer I have done this testing with should be more than capable of handling this task. It is a Core i7 machine with 8GiB RAM. My internet connection is Comcast's Speedtier Extreme which typically benchmark at 25Mbps down/5Mbps up for me.
