I hope this information helps. The browser seems to perform normally in other
respects. The web site where the problem above occurs also seems to perform
normally, including radar time loop and other areas. The page that malfunction
is one that convert weather information to graphical form, so one can track
various parameter by the hour with a simple line graph. This page function
normally on my other systems, and did function normally when I wa using
microsoft explorer.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.download Firefox 9.0 for the first time using window 98 SE
2.go to noaa.gov
3.go to the local forecast page
4. in lower right see under "additional forecast and information" the link to
"Hourly weather graphs"
5. before the page will load be redirected to a Java site to download the
plug-in called j2re-1_4_2_04-windows-i586-p-iftw
6. Reload web page.
7.See error massage
8. Respond to error message - program will crash

Actual Results:
Program crashed, every time. I then deleted the plug in, then realoaed teh same
page, which requested the same plug in then re-downloaded the plug in which
prodceeded normally , then reloaded the webpage and the same error message and
subsequent crash occurs.

Expected Results:
The software should have used the plug-in and loaded the web page.
