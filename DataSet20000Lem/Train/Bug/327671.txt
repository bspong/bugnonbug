Google's "I'm feeling lucky" search in location bar with keyword "support" brings up different content, with a warning. I have seen this warning before, but this is a strange case.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "support" in the location bar.
2. Press enter/return.

Actual Results:
Location bar ha "http://support/enterprise/login?dest=%2Fenterprise%2Fwelcome"
Warning pop up saying I making a secure connection with "support", but security certificate wa for "support.google.com".
Web Content seems to be at "support.google.com"

Expected Results:
'Lucky' search performed, go to first result.

Doing a google search on "support, the first result is not "support.google.com".

Is this considered a security problem?
The security policy doesn't say what would be a security problem.

This reminds me of a IE flaw that could allow a site to change the content in the address bar.

I did this a few times, and sometimes I would get my ISP's terrible 'support' page.
