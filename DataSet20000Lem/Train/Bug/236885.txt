Default Plugin dialog contains OK, Cancel: cancel doe nothing.

That's it, really - I've got a dialog here that ha OK and Cancel on it, OK
make it go away and Cancel make it do nothing.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use Firefox w/Linux, without installing the crappy mplayer plugin.
2. Open the URL I gave on you.
3. Click on the spot where the quicktime movie would be, if you were using a
civilized operating system.
4. Read the lie about how you can only view quicktime in a plugin.
5. Click cancel
6. Watch nothing happen.
7. Click it again.
8. Repeat 6, 7 until you get angry.
9. Click OK.

Actual Results:
Nothing of any interest.

Expected Results:
That plugin window should have one of three thing in it:

1) Just OK, no Cancel.

2) A note saying "No plugin is registered for content of type foo. Click
Download" if you would like to download it for later viewing, or cancel." A
download button that let you do that should be there, and pop up a save-as
dialog that let me download the thing, so that I can look at it later in, well,
God know what, mplayer or xine or some other skinned monstrosity I'm sure, but
I'd still like to be able to do that.

3) An option to download, install and configure the plugin that correctly
handle that type of data. One that work the way plugins on all my friend
computer have worked since the invention of fire. God, wouldn't that be great.
While I'm wishing for that, I'd also a button that brings me a pony.

Well, this is either a trivial cosmetic bug or one more dead canary to throw on
the pile down here in the linux-on-the-desktop coal mine. Depends on your mood,
I guess.
