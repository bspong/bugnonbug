I am using R statistical software (http://www.r-project.org/index.html). They
have a help system based on html pages. They include an "applet" to search
inside their help "index" system and the result of the "submit" page is a list
of clickeable links. The url for each link point to a local file in the form
href="../../dir/file.html" where the result of your query is found. From this
link list, after you use a link the next page/file is loaded perfectly; however,
is you use the "back" button, the link appears now disabled.

It is very annoying becase you have to do the search again or open the link in
different tab/window.

I hope you can help.

Thanks
