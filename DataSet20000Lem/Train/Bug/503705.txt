Clicking a checkbox or dropdown (which are part of a passive form), result in a whole 'recompile' of the page. For large, complex pages, this cause the app to become non-responsive while it churn away at 100% cpu. Once this processing is complete, everything return to normal.

This occurs with passive form element (i.e. one without 'onclick' property or similar) where there is no dynamic page content.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a complex page with checkbox and/or dropdown elements.
2. Change the status of an element (check a box or change the drop-down selection)
3. Attempt to scroll, interact with other element or wait a couple hundred m
4. Continue attempting to interact with the page; after one or more change the page will hang a it recompiles
Actual Results:
Firefox hang while recompiling the page after interacting with passive form elements.

Expected Results:
Since it is a passive form, no recompile/rendering of the page should be necessary.

This appears to be a new bug a this wa not occurring on previous version a far back a I can remember. I assume it ha to do with the new rendering engine a the scrolling is very smooth for these complex page once it finish the render, but to have it freeze for a minute when the check box should only matter with the form submission is crazy.

Note that this is on an Athlon XP+ at 1.7GHz with 1.5GB of RAM. Viewing process detail it is clearly processor-bound not RAM bound.

The recompile of the page seems to take longer than the initial time to load.
