DOC TYPE page header inhibits IFRAME functionality
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

If I have a DOC TYPE (as required by the HTML 4.0+ standard) header on my web
page then Firefox fails to correctly display IFRAME's set with with
height="100%". If I remove the DOC TYPE the IFRAME height is correctly rendered.
Since the DOCTYPE is a part of the HTML 4.0 standard it should not inhibit other
portion of the HTML 4.0 standard, e.g. IFRAMEs.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set DOC TYPE a either loose or strict HTML 4.0
2. Insert an IFRAME with height="100%" and content that is at several 100
pixel high.
3. Load the page in Firefox. Scroll bar will appear but frame will not be full
height.

Actual Results:
My content appears but it doe not expand to the height of the content rather
seems to limit itself to ~ 100 pixel in height (guess estimate) with a scroll
bar on the IFRAME. If I remove the DOCTYPE header the full IFRAME display at
the height of it content.

Expected Results:
The IFRAME should be 100% the height of it content.
