I recently created an app in Rails and encountered a strange behavior of browser: every time I modify my application all content shift up, and after reloading of page everything is displayed a intended. When researching, I noticed (with Firebug) that
a) the construction that is rendered wrongly is <body><h1 class="title">..., and error is absence of top margin (20px) that is not specified in my CSS (default maybe).
b) on first request server reply with 200 OK to both HTML and CSS, and on second -- 304 Not Modified also for both
Also I can say that my document is XHTML 1.0 compliant (and all dtd's are specified) and app is hosted with fcgi (development mode) over lighttpd.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Sorry, I wa unable to reproduce it with fresh Rails installation within 15 minutes. I hope that the information I provided in 'details' will be enough to solve; if it won't, I'll try to strip buggy(?) application to minimum, but that will take too much time for me to do it straight now.
