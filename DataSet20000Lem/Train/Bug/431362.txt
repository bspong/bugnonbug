In Firefox 3b5, if I have just one tab open, and press Cmd-W, the window closes.

Firefox 2 behaviour wa to always leave a blank tab when Cmd-W wa pressed; Shift-Cmd-W closed the window.

Firefox 3 behaviour is closing the window immediately upon pressing Cmd-W with one tab open. This happens regardless of whether that tab is blank or not, so I don't think this ha anything to do with #358573.

There's no longer any way to close the last tab via keyboard shortcut without closing the window a well. Clicking the close button on the final tab doe work a intended, leaving a blank tab.

It strike me this would be a common source of complaint if it were the new standard behaviour, so I wonder if it ha to do with my settings. I'm not aware of anything non-standard in my about:config, but would be happy to share.

My tab preference are a follows.

New page should be opened in:
( ) a new window
(X) a new tab

[X] Warn me when closing multiple tab
[X] Warn me when opening multiple tab might slow down Firefox
[X] Always show the tab bar
[ ] When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window with just one tab.
2. Press Cmd-W.
Actual Results:
The window closes.

Expected Results:
The tab should close, leaving a blank tab.
