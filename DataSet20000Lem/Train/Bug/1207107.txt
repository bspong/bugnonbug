Modernize the UI of aboutCertError.xhtml
aboutCertError.xhtml still contains Larry and is in dire need of a fresh coat of paint. Bram ha an updated UI spec that can be found here:

Slight alteration for different error type can be found here:

http://brampitoyo.github.io/fx-untrusted-connection/severe.xhtml
http://brampitoyo.github.io/fx-untrusted-connection/rc4.xhtml

This bug is about applying the common set of change to the markup and stylesheets of aboutCertError.xhtml. Followup bug will take care of the particular detail of each error. This bug need to implement the following:

- Display the broken lock icon instead of Larry
- Use the headline: “Your connection is not secure”
- Use the following copy for the main message: “The owner of expired.badssl.com ha configured their website improperly. To protect your information from being stolen, Firefox ha not connected to this website.”
- Add a “Learn more…” link that take the user to the SUMO page: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tls-error-reports
- Add a “Return to Previous Page” button that doe "history.back()" or go to "about:home"
- Add an “Advanced” button that reveals technical detail about the error that are currently under the "Technical Details" section.
