I start with a video that may explain it better visually than I can verbally:

On 4b5, 4b6, if I get enough tab open, usually six to eight tabs, enough to cause the edge of one tab to be scrolled off normally in older versions...
The tab on the bar start contracting and expanding rapidly, and usually won't stop unless I close enough tabs, or until I select anything but one of the endmost tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tabs.
2. Make sure that the last tab to load any content is the leftmost or rightmost tab.
3. While loading, the tab should start spasming, causing the others around it to quake and quiver. Stopping loading on the tab will not affect it.
Actual Results:
I watched the tab expand and contract.

Expected Results:
Tabs load and sit still, or left/rightmost tab scroll offscreen a needed.
