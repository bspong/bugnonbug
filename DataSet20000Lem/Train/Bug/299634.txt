Firefox asks for logged in user's credential multiple time when logging on to a Microsoft SharePoint Server

When logging on to a local intranet site that is located on a Microsoft
SharePoint server, Firefox asks for login detail to the server twice (the first
time, it says: give username and password for http://infonet [the server's
address on the intranet]; the second time, it says: give username and password
for 192.19.4.17 [the proxy server on the intranet that is physically connected
to the Internet]). In each case, entering the user name and password of the user
already logged into the intranet via Windows Networking will allow the server to
be accessed and go to it home page, so these prompt don't seem to be
necessary. Also, it is interesting to note that clicking 'cancel' when presented
with the user name/password request make Firefox load an error page that
state access is denied. Another interesting point is that when loading the site
in IE, there are no unnecessary user/password request and the home page of the
site load immediately. I suspect this is due to the locking in of one MS
product to another (SharePoint to IE).
