Page redraws unnecessarily if select tag contains more option than are visible

If I insert (via Ajax) a select tag on a page, which select tag 1) allows for multiple select, 2) display three item (size="3"), and 3) ha more than three total options, so that the vertical scroll is active, the entire page repaints (an ugly flash). The page is fairly complex, and the select is inside a table cell. The html in question (the table and a couple of wrapper divs) is also being loaded into a div via Ajax.

Removing the select eliminates the redraw. If the select ha all option visible, that eliminates the redraw.

My ugly workaround is to hide the outermost div on load and use setTimeout to fade it in after 300ms. It work and isn't noticeable to the user. Would be nice if it weren't necessary.
