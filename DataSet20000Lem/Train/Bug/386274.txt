After watching several video (about after 10 videos), the next video will not load up. After clicking on the next video, source code of the page show up and the download completes with the source code on the screen.
It is not possible to watch any video after that instance unless firefox is completely exited and restarted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.youtube.com
2.Start watching (any)videos
3.After about the 10th video, only the source code of the next video page will load after clicking on the next video (link) to watch.
Actual Results:
No special steps. The step I described above are exactly the step to reproduce the bug.

Expected Results:
What do you mean by expected result here in this form field? I don't get it.
After I perform the step above, the source code load up (is downloaded). I can only watch Youtube video after this point by ONLY restarting Firefox.

This happens always and on any/all Youtube page after the step I described above.
To me it is a major bug to be fixed. I don't like using the stupid Internet Explorer, but only with Internet Explorer I can watch Youtube video without problem I described here. (I'm sure If I used that pathetic IExploerer, other problem would arise but I wouldn't know since I only use it with Youtube and certain Firefox incompatible site such a banking and other official sites.)
