After going through numerous iteration of bug #262748, I wa asked by Peter
Vanderwoude to open this bug.

I recently discovered (unintentionally) that I had hundred - maybe thousand -
of entry in my Mozilla Download Manager. When I imported everything onto
Firefox, the Download Manager effectively broke. It continually tried to
access my A: drive for no reason and took up the entire CPU when I tried to
clear the download list.

The question therefore come down to: why is the download information even being
imported anyway? I can find no logical reason for doing this and a I just
found out can be a cause for crashing Firefox. Please remove the functionality
for importing Download Manager information from Mozilla/Seamonkey into Firefox.
