User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier:

pop yp blocker will not launch by default, "Firefox ha encountered a problem and must be shut down". When I click on "rstore previous session", ikt doe the same thing about 85% of the time whwen it open to the same page it encountered the problem on.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch Firefox and wait for it to happen. Again, pop up blocker must be checked manually, and a far a reproducing the shutdown goes, there's no pattern
2.
3.
Actual Results:
launch firefox, and pop uop blocker must be activated manually. Firefox frequently encounter error and must be shut down. When I click on restore "session", and it open to whatever page it happens on, it happens over and over. I always have to start new session, which sometimes cause me to lose data.

Expected Results:
pop up blocker works, but it's supposed to launch by default. As far a "Firefox ha encountered a problem" goes, I'm clueless a to why. There's no pattern to it. It happens on many sites, and happens very frequently.

i have done numerous spyware/adware scan and turn up nothing but trcaking cookies, which can easily be cleared by clearing cooky beforehand.

pop up blocker should havelaunched by default every time (as it doe on my other computer), but it never does. Must be done manually 100% of the time.
