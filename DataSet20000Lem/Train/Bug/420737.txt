The Firefox navigation button glyph are not the native one for navigation. Instead, they are the glyph recommended by the Windows User Experience Guidelines for progressive disclosure.

See Windows Search in Vista (or our own Places Library) for an example of both control used in the same window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Open a Windows application that us navigation icon (e.g. Windows Explorer or Help and Support) application and Firefox (which should be set to use large icon without text).

Actual Results:
Firefox us the progressive disclosure (single chevron) glyph while the builtin Vista app us the navigation (open arrowhead with tail) glyph.

Expected Results:
Both glyph to be similar if not identical.

The same problem exists on Windows XP, but I do not have an installation to screenshot.
