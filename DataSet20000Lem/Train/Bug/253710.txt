middle-clicking to remove the icon.

a the site hasn't loaded yet.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark any bogus/nonexistant site.
2. Go to the bookmark menu, and Middle-click to open the bogus page.
3. You should get the themed background, not the white background, a the page
loads.
4. Middle-click, to make the scroll icon appear.
5. Click on another tab. The icon should be still there.

Actual Results:
Icons galore! I can get a many middle-click icon a I like.

Expected Results:
Not drawn those extra icons.

may be a contributing factor.
