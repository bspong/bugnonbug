Working in multi-display environment with 2nd display set a primary and FireFox set to open in secondary display upon launch. When launching in single display environment, FireFox open a completely shrunken window just wide enough to display close/minimize/maximize controls. It is displayed in the upper right hand corner of the screen and cannot be moved. I have to maximize to do anything. I believe it is displaying in the right hand side because in the multi-display environment the secondary display, which it normally open in, is set to the right. It seems that firefox is not detecting display environment properly and trying to use it initial environment.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start up in multi-display environment with FF3 opening in secondary display.
2.close down
3.start up in single display environment and launch FF3
Actual Results:
FF3 open a minimized window in the upper right hand corner and cannot be moved.

Expected Results:
FF3 should open normally in single display mode.
