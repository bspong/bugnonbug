By browsing the url www.revolvermaps.com, the Java Applet will still be loaded with the following setting defined in about:config
- javascript.enabled = false
- security.enable_java = false

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open about:config, set
- javascript.enabled = false
- security.enable_java = false
2. Browse http://www.revolvermaps.com
Actual Results:
The Java applet with the revolving earth is being started.

Expected Results:
No Java applet should be allowed to be running, a it ha been forbidden by the security.enable_java preference.

Code look like:
<noscript><applet codebase="http://ra.revolvermaps.com/j"code="core.RE"archive="r.jar">...</applet></noscript>
This is the very reason I had to disable JavaScript to see this bug appearing.

Enclosing an applet in a <noscript> tag could be a potential security issue a anyone could force Java applet execution, even if disabled.

BTW it would be nice to add an option to configure the "Java enabled" setting from within the GUI (Firefox>Preferences>Content) a there is none so far (only about:config let u configure it)
