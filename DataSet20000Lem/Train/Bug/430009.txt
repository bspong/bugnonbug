onclick="window.open( - - - crash the latest release of firefox completely.

Go to the example URL (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/default.stm) On the right hand side is an image labeled "The Big Picture". If you click on this (or any other image that launch a new window via "onclick="window.open") the browser crashes.

If I right click and select 'Open link in new tab' there is no problem.

Perhaps this is linked to anti 'pop-up' functionality. I do have 'block pop-ups' checked in options/content.

I also run adblock plus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the example URL (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/default.stm)

Actual Results:
firefox.exe bomb completely. XP display the "firefox .exe ha encountered a problem and need to close" message and asks if I want to send an error report. See below for report content.
