button in navbar seems to have "customizableui-anchorid" attribute set even if they're not in a panel
As explained here https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=880458#c7, when a SDK Widget is added to the nav-bar, the attribute "customizableui-anchorid" is present, and set to "nav-bar-overflow-button" even if the widget itself is not "overflowed", and there is no overflow menu / chevron displayed.

The SDK Widget is added in this way, from add-on sdk environment:

require('sdk/widget').Widget({
id: 'foo',
label: 'foo',
content: 'X'
});

Notice however, than it's not related to SDK widget only. It seems that all the button in the navbar, when I start the UX build with a fresh profile, have all the attribute "customizableui-anchorid" set to "nav-bar-overflow-button":

[12:57:52.559] "urlbar-container" "nav-bar-overflow-button"
[12:57:52.559] "search-container" "nav-bar-overflow-button"
[12:57:52.560] "webrtc-status-button" "nav-bar-overflow-button"
[12:57:52.560] "bookmarks-menu-button" "nav-bar-overflow-button"
[12:57:52.560] "downloads-button" "nav-bar-overflow-button"
[12:57:52.560] "home-button" "nav-bar-overflow-button"
[12:57:52.561] "social-share-button" "nav-bar-overflow-button"
[12:57:52.561] "social-toolbar-item" "nav-bar-overflow-button"

This log is generated running in Scratchpad the following code:

let node document.querySelectorAll('[customizableui-anchorid]');

Array.forEach(nodes, node => console.log(node.id, node.getAttribute('customizableui-anchorid')));

I think is a bug because, when the button are moved and we're not in a fresh profile, they seems not having any "customizableui-anchorid". And it seems reasonable to do not have this attribute, if the button are not in any panel – so there is no "anchor" to refer – but at least, I would assume the value won't be pointing at "nav-bar-overflow-button".
