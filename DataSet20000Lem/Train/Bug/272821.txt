Hi -- this is trivial, but mildly annoying. Clicking the Home button on the
toolbar usually leaf the cursor in the address toolbar. There are page where
this isn't true -- e.g. if you set Google a your home page, your cursor start
up in Google's search bar -- but it hold true if you set most other site a
your home page. Basically, the Home button should work like any other bookmark.
This seems to hold true on PCs a well a Macs. I am using the default theme --
do not know if this hold true with other themes.

This isn't much, but I usually scroll down a page by pressing the space bar, and
this prevents that.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set your home page a mail.yahoo.com or thedigitalbits.com.
2. Do not set your home page to, say, Google.com or Amazon.com.
Actual Results:
The cursor should appear in the address bar.

Expected Results:
Not put the cursor in the address bar. I usually scroll down a page by pressing
the space bar, and this prevents that.
