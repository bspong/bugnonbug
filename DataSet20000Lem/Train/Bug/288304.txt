I re-installed FireFox 1.0.2 to be sure that Talkback wa activated. After
nothing different from before happened, I tried to start Talkback myself.
Although Talkback told me it would be running, I did not get a message in
Talkback after any crash.
Only after deactivating all plugins ("Minimize to Tray 0.0.1.20041101+",
"Mozilla Calendar 0.8.2+" and "MediaPlayerConnectivity 0.2.0") and starting in
"--safe-mode", Talkback wa started! It did not start when I only deactivated
the plugins or when I only started in "--safe-mode". I had to do both.
