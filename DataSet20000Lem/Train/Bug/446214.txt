hi,

i've an idea, how can be the browsing experience with firefox could be improved a bit :)
simple observation in my browsing style:
* i open lot's of search page - and i open 3-10 result
* when i press 'ctrl' the following formula is true:
( "next/prev tab" || "new tab" || "go back/fwrd" || "close this tab" )
=> in any of these cases, the browsing area is not important for me after
i've pressed 'ctrl' => it can be used for other purpose
* from time to time i close firefox, because i don't want to close all tab
( i've tried to use the 'close all other tabs' feature, but if i miss,
and i hit the "reload all tabs" ... i've to wait a while... ;)
=> how this could be better?
I've concluded that the 'ctrl' button could mean something without causing any
trouble, and in any case when the 'ctrl' is down, the browsing area is not
important anymore.

navgraph:
The idea is to show a spring-system based simulation about the page that are
open - the parental link should be the page where they are opened from ->
this way, every time i hit control i could get an 'overview' of my browsing,
and closing could done by doing a recursive close on a subtree.
Node's should labeled using the page's icon, and the title of the page,
or the request which wa entered into the titlebar (i start search using
'g querystring')
Current page history functionality could be moved here to, because going back
on a page, is just another 'dimension', the timeline of the tab.

This could be an alternate to the 'tabs' at the top, and this way the user can have more control on his/her browsing session i think this could be very useful

Reproducible: Always

i think that i could create this feature a some kind of extension, but i'm not really familiar with the architecture of firefox - and i think that this should be built-in.
