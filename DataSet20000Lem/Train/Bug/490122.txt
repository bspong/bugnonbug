While using Firefox 3.0.x continuously, it periodically becomes irresponsive: video jerk and/or pause; link in web page don't work; cannot switch to other open tabs; menu don't work; toolbars don't work; mouse pointer doesn't change shape while hovering links, forms, etc... This last for a few seconds, then everything come back to normal. The issue repeat again every few minutes. This seems more prone to happen when playing embedded video and/or with multiple tab open, specially with many images/flash. It also seems to occur more frecuently the more time Firefox keep running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few site in different tab --at least one of them with embedded video.
2. Notice that Fx periodically becomes irresponsive after being running for a while (jerky/paused video, scroll not responding, cannot switch to other tabs, etc.)
3.
Actual Results:
Fx periodically becomes irresponsive (jerky/paused video, scroll not responding, cannot switch to other tabs, etc.) while the rest of the system remains responsive.

Expected Results:
Fx should always run smoothly.

I started noticing this kind of problem since version 3.0.2/3. I checked browsing the same sites, same open tab with other browsers, but they didn't show this issue.
