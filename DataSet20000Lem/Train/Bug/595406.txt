The Google Voice gadget is broken for the 3.6.9 release and all of the Pre's beyond the 3.5.x's!

This image is from 4.0b6pre. It is the same in 3.6.9 Release, 3.6.9pre from about August 10th, and all of the 4.0bxpre's.

I have re-verified with -safe-mode, and with a profile with no extensions, no alternate themes, and vanilla CSS files.

This one taken with 3.6.8, and is also the same in the 3.5.xpre's.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to my Google home page

Expected Results:
I expect the released version to work correctly, and NOT to have broken something that worked in the previous released version(3.6.8)
