This seems to be commonly reported with the exception list disappearing "bug" which seems to have a "resolution," but it is a separate issue.

When I add a cookie to the exception list a "blocked" and delete that cookie from the list of cookies, the next time that cookie is sent it reappears in the cookie list even though it is "blocked" in the exceptions" list.

Luckily my anti-virus software catch the bad one when they "reappear" but I would expect the blocked cookie never to even make it to the cookie list. In addition in trying different things, it appears that some cooky still get through even when I uncheck the "accept cooky from sites" button. Could these problem be related?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add cookie to the exception list a blocked. Delete that cookie from the list of cookies.
2.Go to a site with that cookie
3.Blocked cookie show up again in cooky
Actual Results:
a above

Expected Results:
Blocked cooky in exception list should not be accepted.

This would seem to be a fairlysevere security issue a there are some notorious cooies out there.
