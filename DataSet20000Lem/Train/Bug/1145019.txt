User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20150305021524

Steps to reproduce:

Browse normally opening multiple tabs. Around a 100 tab are opened from a session restore. None are active. Normal browsing continues. Around when 10 tab are active (new or session restored) suddenly firefox hang unkillable. Cant kill with any task manager


Actual results:

Around when 10 tab are active (new or session restored) suddenly firefox hang unkillable. Cant kill with any task manager. Happened only with Firefox 36 after recent window update. Never happened before.

Can open new tabs. But progress indicator just keep circling. No other progress happens in loading the page. Crash reporter eventually report a crash. But cant kill process.


Expected results:

The page should load. At least firefox should be killable. I strongly suspect the latest window update is responsible. However am not able to figure it out. Only McAfee antivirus is running. There is no firewall. A lot of people have reported earlier issue with various other firewalls/antivirii here in this thread http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2882597&sid=faba613d10654b368efa8d7a32721f56&start=15 and some people are experiencing problem with the latest update to 36. Maybe this is a regression bug.
