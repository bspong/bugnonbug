no flash (player 9) content display on Firefox 2.0.0.1 (works on Safari and earlier Firefox)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

I'm using a PowerPC Mac, OS 10.3.9, Flash player plugin 9,0,28,0.

After upgrading to:
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1)
Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
...the Flash player stopped showing Flash animations.

It's worked fine for year through many Firefox upgrade without needing any
attention. It still work fine in Safari. Haven't tried IE.

See the Adobe Flash test page at
http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/about/index.html
...this display fine in Safari, telling me my Flash plugin is installed fine.
Nothing rendered in Firefox 2.0.0.1.

Interestingly, after using the Flash plugin uninstaller, then the installer, a
root, Firefox started, and showed me the above page fine.

Re-running Firefox a a normal user doe not display the Flash.

I don't think it can be permissions-related, a running Safari a a normal user
work fine.

Hope this helps,
kind regards,
Matthias Grunwalde

p I've mentioned this under bug 358143, but that relates to "pictures" not displaying - this is definitely flash that's not being displayed

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.visit any flash site
2.
3.
Actual Results:
no flash content is rendered

Expected Results:
you should see the 'flash player correctly installed' message (or word to that effect) - and it also show the player version

I've set this a 'Major' a Flash is the primary animation format on the web.
