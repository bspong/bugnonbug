I have uninstalled FireFox, restarted my system and redownloaded/installed FireFox 2.0. Upon launching the app, from the application menu, the application opens. However, the main body window apears to be split in two parts. The most visable show only white, to the left is a thin (apx 20px) window that I can see show data, yet this is not expandable. Beyond that, everything apears to be functioning.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart computer.
2. Uninstal FireFox, restart computer, redownload and reinstall FireFox using Safari, restart computer after reinstall.
3. Reopen FireFox & then close, uninstal, reinstal, reopen. Check for online support

Actual Results:
