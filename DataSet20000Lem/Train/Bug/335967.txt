Preferences dialog ha no way to configure plugin directories. Plugins are typically installed to a variety of locations, and the same plugin can be installed to different location on different operating systems, and even different distribution of the same operating system. This make it important to be able to configure a list of directory to search for plugins.

This vital functionality is missing. In my specific case, Flash7 wa installed to /usr/X11R6/lib/linux-flashplugin7/libflashplayer.so, but Firefox only search for plugins in /usr/X11R6/lib/firefox/plugins. I have not been able to find any Firefox interface to add additional search paths.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details.

Actual Results:
Cannot add or modify plugin directories.

Expected Results:
User should be able to add or modify plugin directory locations.

As a comparison, look at the Konqueror configuration dialog. Undocumented "gconf-style" key are unacceptable. Usability isn't about making the interface stupid, it's about making it usable. If there is no way to configure plugins, then plugins are not usable.
