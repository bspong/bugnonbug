Confirmed on two separate installation of Firefox 3.5.5 (One on XP Professional, the other on XP Home).

Upon browser launch (after history ha been purged during the previous session - all item except Cache and Site preferences) and then pressing the 'Most Visited' folder button on the bookmark toolbar, a single menu item appears labeled 'Empty' in grayed out font below the button. As long a no webpage ha been loaded, subsequent history clearing action properly result in no change (the 'Empty' menu item is still displayed). However, once one webpage ha been visited and after the history ha been cleared again, pressing the 'Most Visited' folder button on the bookmark toolbar then display a small square below it instead of the 'Empty'menu item. The only way for the 'Empty' menu item to display again is to close and relaunch the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. purge history (all but cache and site preferences)
2. close browser
3. launch browser
4. load any webpage
5. purge history
6. press 'Most Visited' folder button on the bookmark toolbar
Actual Results:
'Empty' menu item is gone and replaced with small square below the left side of the button.

Expected Results:
'Empty' should reappear each time history ha been purged.

I don't remember noticing this behavior before today, but it's consistent at this time. The theme on both machine is MozXP.
