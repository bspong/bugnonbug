When I start Firefox( v1.5.0.4 ) and it begin loading my home page, I can be typing a URL into the address field or search text into the Google bar and the field I'm typing in will lose focus after 1-x characters, keystroke no longer work, and clicking into the field doesn't return the focus. I have to click into another field first before the original field will accept the focus.

This occurs regardless of what website's page I'm loading or what text field I'm typing in and it ha always been present in Mozilla since I began using it year ago. Sometimes I remember to hit the Stop button before typing but that doesn't always bring thing to an immediate halt. Waiting for complicated page like The Weather Channel to fully load before I can go anywhere else is a considerable nuisance.
