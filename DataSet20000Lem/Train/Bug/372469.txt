Firefox get stuck (blocks, need to close window to continue) on a digg.con Java script on www.littlegreenfootballs.com but only at certain hour (around 05am swiss time).

I'm sure it's digg.com script a I use NoScript module and could isolate the culprit.

Safari work with no problem when Firefox get stuck !

Several digg / littlegreenfootballs.com user have reported the problem that's only affecting Firefox on Mac OS X

Even stranger, next morning everything work again without changing / rebooting etc... How can a script block at some specific time (some day it doesn't block) and work perfect at different hour without ANY change ?
I just put my main computer at sleep during my night (days...), wake it up when I wake up, allow digg script again, reload the LGF main page and all is fine... till 05 am...
