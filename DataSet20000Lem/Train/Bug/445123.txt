When I click on the star to edit the bookmark all information is blank. I can't move or place the affected link anywhere. After repeatedly trying to add a particular bookmark back into my toolbar that I managed to remove using a synchronization program the bookmark did not appear. Upon restarting restarting browser all attempt that appeared to have done nothing appear a several clone with correct titles. Attempting to delete any of those clone will not do anything a the delete function appears to not have any affect with these certain bookmarks. Checking the property in order to fix the link show that there is no information for the bookmark, not even the title which is clearly visible within my Bookmarks Toolbar. Dragging is bookmark doesn't do anything. I've been using Firefox 3 for awhile now and I'm not sure what could be causing it. I've run Firefox in Safe Mode with all form of combination of the different options, including disabling all add-on and still the bookmark in question remain dead block within my bookmark toolbar. Trying to delete bookmark in the Organize Bookmarks area also is impossible.
