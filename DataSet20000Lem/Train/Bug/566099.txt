This issue crop up intermittently while surfing this site only, link work for a while and then without warning link appear to jump and then halt on the original page. Manually entering web address in the address bar also doe not work. I cannot recreate this problem at will, merely by accident. All other tab are responsive and no system performance degradation is observed. I have used my secondary browser and have been unable to recreate the problem ever.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I am unable to specifically describe step to reproduce the problem. It randomly occurs while navigating link at that web address.
Actual Results:
If I were to reproduce it, the loading icon would appear in the tab and then halt immediately, no jump would occur.

Expected Results:
The software should have navigated to the selected link.

I am using Windows 7 x64 on two system which have produced this result. One is using the Aero theme, the other is using the basic theme. One is Intel based, the other AMD. Both are using the same version of the Firefox Browser. Also Right-Clicking on the desired link and using 'Open Link in New Tab' provides an easy solution.
