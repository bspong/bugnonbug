In Windows, FF will not load page at address ending .103
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140506152807

Steps to reproduce:

Attempt to load web page from local IP address ending in .103 (specifically, 192.168.1.103 in test case).

Specific FF Version 29.0.1 in Windows 7 64 Bit


Actual results:

Firefox doe not display the page and remains in the "loading" state until eventual timeout.

Wireshark trace show that the page is successfully retrieved in full with no difference to "working" case at other addresses. HTTP request completes fully.

No adblockers etc. active.

When the server IP is moved away from .103 & page load OK we can re-enable all installed plugins and there is nothing on the page/server that is blocked - page load correctly.

We have tried this with several different configurations:

PC1: Dual boot Windows 7 64-Bit / Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64-Bit
Results:
In Windows the bug occurs reliably, switching the serving device to address .102 or other address the page load correctly every time. Using other browser the page load correctly.

Booting to Ubuntu and loading Firefox (29.0) the page load correctly from address .103 or any other.

PC2: Windows 7 32-Bit, FF 29.0.1
Results:
Bug occurs reliably, switching the serving device to address .102 or other address the page load correctly every time.

PC3: Windows XP 32-Bit, FF 29.0.1
Results:
Bug occurs reliably, switching the serving device to address .102 or other address the page load correctly every time. Using other browser the page load correctly.

PC4: Not a PC but an IP video streaming controller
Results:
Can communicate with the server at .103 and successfully execute HTTP request to the same web server.

Pages from the server can be loaded by other device (smartphones etc.) with no problems, whatever address we set it to.


Expected results:

Page should display!
