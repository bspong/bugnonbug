Firefox stop responding when visiting <http://www.style36.co.za/>
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140127004003

Steps to reproduce:

1. Visit <http://www.style36.co.za/>. (I tried safe mode too.)



Actual results:

At some point in the page load (the page load at least partially) the browser stop responding entirely.


Expected results:

The page should have loaded and the browser should have continued functioning.

The frustrating part about this is that there is no obvious way for a mortal to inspect the state of the browser at this point, the entire application is unresponsive (using 100% of a CPU core). Since the browser doesn't actually crash, no crash report is submitted or generated. So what's left is for someone to file a legitimate bug that say "It's not working" but nobody else can reproduce or extract the necessary information from.

It seems likely (based on previous experience of similar issues) that restarting the computer will seemingly cause this problem to go away, and though that might seem like a hardware issue there are no other problem with any other software on the same computer (try a I might.)
