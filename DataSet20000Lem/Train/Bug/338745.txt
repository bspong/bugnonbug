Summary - After siting idle all nite, Firefox wouldn't quit, System became extremely slow (minutes between mouse clicks), BUT system seemed to have enough memory and CPU Monitor didn't show excessive load!).

Details:

Firefox on overnight - 5 tab open in 1 window. Also open were Garage Band, Activity Monitor (I keep CPU monitor always open and also Memory Usage a my Dock Icon) and a finder window. When awakened from sleep, Activity Monitor Memory indicator showed lot of available (Green) memory and CPU Monitor showed relatively low CPU load.

First tried to quit Firefox - after click yes to dialog about closing tabs, nothing happened. Then tried to bring up Garage Band so I could quit. Finder took minute to display window. Quit Garage Band (which also took minutes) and then tried to bring open Finder window to front so I could close it. That took minutes. Closed Finder window and then tried to open activity monitor main window. Again minutes.

Firefox remained running all this time dispite my previous attempt to quit it. When Activity Monitor opened, first looked at open files: window wa blank (possibly due to display slowness??) - then ran process sample function (see attached). This took about 1/2 an hour to complete. Force quit from Activity monitor had no effect on Firefox. Finally opened Terminal window (again taking minute to open) - and issued kill command. This caused Firefox to terminate - however system remained extremely sluggish - took about 5 minute to shutdown.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have several apps open.
2. Have FireFox window open, with several tab
3. Leave system inactive in this state for 12 hours. Let system go to sleep and power down.
4. Wake system (using space bar).
5. Attempt to quit FireFox




Have attached Activity Monitor Sample report. No crash report available (Firefox didn't crash).

Have no idea if this is related, but found this entry in my console log - seems to be from work session before this happened - It is curious because I do not have application 'Opera 7' on my machine that I know of.
