Recently downloaded Firefox 4 is crashing erratically
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/10.0.648.204 Safari/534.16
Build Identifier: Firefox 4

My previous Firefox version notified me of an update. I obtained that update to Firefox 4 and Firefox began acting worse than Gates' IE ever did. The revamnped layout sucks. I immediately lost all my add-on including my treasured ability to bookmark all tab and then quit. Worse, Firefox 4 keep crashing on me...I'm having to send this message from Google Chrome. The crashing seems worse if I attempt to refresh a page or conduct a Google search. Beats me what's wrong, but please hammer out a Firefox 4.1 that is up to former standards. This Firefox 4 doesn't even reach Microsoft standards...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Can't do it or anything else with any reliability.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
I've told you all I can about how the crash seems to happen. Oh, my operating system is Windows Vista. It came stock on my HP laptop a couple of year back. It's an ACPI x86 based PC laptop, ST9320320 ATA disk device, Pentium dual core CPU T4200 running at 2.00 GHz.

Expected Results:
N/A

Not crash! All I get is a pop-up notifying me of the crash--no other significant intel. Dozens of times, I've tried to come back up with a new session. Neither that tactic, nor dropping a few URL's and attempting works. I've never had such a problem updating Firefox since I began using it several year back.
