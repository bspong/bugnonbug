focus problem between tab

This regressed a quite while ago.
I couldn't find a dupe.

3 testcases (probably 1 and the same cause)

repro:

1.Open FF
2.Open 2 tab
3.Open this bug in a tab and press ctrl+A (select all), everything but textareas
are selected
4.Open Mozilla Forums in the other
5.Create or edit a post in the forum
5a.Submit the post and immediately switch to the bugzilla tab
5b.Wait and notice the blue selection turn gray (no focus on the page despite
the tab having focus)

6.We're in the bugzilla tab, now type some text in the "Additional Comments:"
textarea
7.Rightclick in the textarea and choose select all
7a.Switch to the forum tab and edit the post you created, press submit and
immediately switch to the bugzilla tab
7b.Wait and notice the blue selection disappears (no focus in the textarea
despite the tab having focus)

8.We're in the bugzilla tab. Rightclick in the textarea and choose select all
(again)
9a.Switch to the forum tab and edit the post you created, press submit and
immediately switch to the bugzilla tab
9b.Wait and notice the blue selection disappears, now immediately rightclick in
the textarea and choose select all
9c.Nothing happens, no selection is highlighted (if you did it quick enough)
9d.Switch to the forum tab and notice the whole page is selected

expected:
Don't switch focus to content of non-focussed tab
