I've made page that is scrolling using javascript scrollTo function. Page is taking around 0-2% of cpu time when it is opened by typing in URL directly into navigation textbox, and then entering fullscreen mode using F11.

However, if I open that exact same page using this win.open function:
---
win = window.open('content.htm', '123', 'scrollbar=0,status=0,toolbar=0,resizable=0,fullscreen=1');
win.focus();
--
it take over 90% of cpu time

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page at http://zm2400.zmsystems.com/pedja/firefox/opener.htm
2. It will open page at http://zm2400.zmsystems.com/pedja/firefox/content.htm using win.open javascript function
3. Press F11 to enter fullscreen mode
4. Start task manager (CTRL+ALT+DEL, task manager, processes, and look at CPU usage)

Optional:
1. Open page at http://zm2400.zmsystems.com/pedja/firefox/content.htm by typing in address into navigation textbox and press F11... it will take 0-2% of CPU time


Actual Results:
Page is loaded and take majority of system resource for diplaying

Expected Results:
It should load page and take exact amount of system resource a if page is opened by going directly to page at -> http://zm2400.zmsystems.com/pedja/firefox/content.htm

It happens also in Firefox 2.0b2
