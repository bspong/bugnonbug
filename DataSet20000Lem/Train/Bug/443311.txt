Hey I have a problem. After I downloaded the new browser, on download day, I have had trouble every since. It happends when I click keep me signed into yahoo mail for 2 week button. It then crashes. Any progress, I have sent the data when it asks me to like 50 time already. I now have to sign in everytime. I don't want to switch to another browser but I hate signing in to my mail all the time. Let me know. Thanks,
