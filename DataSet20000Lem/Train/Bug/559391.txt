ebay ha a new antispam feature, now when you send a message to a seller or any other member via my-ebay you have to fill a captcha-like code, I have tried unistalling every addons but the result is the same, when you try to send a message the site always give you an error reporting to enter the correct code.

I'm on window 7 64 bit, but I have decided to fill this report because the same is happening on my friend who I asked to try, they are runningh window 7 and XP with the same result.

tried with chrome and internet explorer and it work so maybe it could be a firefox problem.

tried on ebay.it and ebay.com with similar result

4. enter the message
5. enter the numeric code shown in the picture
6. click send
