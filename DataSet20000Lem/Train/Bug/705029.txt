FF 8.0.1 -no-remote no longer work for multiple profile in Windows XP
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1
Build ID: 20111120135848

Steps to reproduce:

Have been using 2 different profile (CBE and Fred) concurrently using the following command line options: "-P Fred" and "-no-remote -P CBE". Fred is the default profile. Up until the upgrade to FF 8.0.1, this worked flawlessly, no matter which profile I started first.


Actual results:

When I open the first instance of FF using one of the profiles, it open and operates fine (I'm using it now). When I open the second profile, the correct home tab are qued up and FF sends the GET requests. But the connection either "time out" or fail with "The connection wa interrupted." It's a if the second instance is not able to access the network. The actual second instance of FF is not hung. The menu still work and I can verify that the correct profile is loaded with the help/troubleshooting information->Open profile directory button.


Expected results:

The second profile instance of FF should have gotten valid response to the GET requests. I have made no other change to my system other than upgrading to FF 8.0.1. I created another profile and it ha the same issue. If I don't use the -no-remote option, it load up the first instance profile (as expected, kind of. See bug #31746). If I use the -no-remote option, it can't access the network.

I need multiple profile in order to use both my work Google account and my personal Google account at the same time. When Google changed the ability to have two account active at the same time is when I started using multiple profile in FF. It ha worked flawlessly up until now.
