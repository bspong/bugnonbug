multiple popups, when site is listed with more then one subdomain

In my allowed popup list I have banking.1822direkt.com and www.1822direkt.com,
now when I open the above mentioned link, the popup appears wtice instead of one
time. Using 1822direkt.com would be the solution, but it look like the pop-up
blocker is not correctly using the subdomain information.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have more then one entry of the same site, but different subdomain
2. go back to the site that open the popup,
3. now x window will appear instead of one...

(you may be restarting the browser / machine in between, a when I last time
tried to reproduce without restarting, the behaviour wa correct. It the
appeared again today.)

Actual Results:
2 pop-up window instead of one...

Expected Results:
open still one pop-up, because www.1822direkt.com doesn't even match
banking.1822direkt.com

I'm not sure, whether this could be a potential security problem, a why doe it
open the popup for a nonmatching subdomain from the allowed list?
