this happens every time this particular banner is on the webpage, but since
banner change with each new page opened, it's also a random problem. on
www.imdb.com they have this banner called "Next Generation of IM Smilies" and
when i'm unlucky enough to get this banner on my page, my cursor just spin and
i have to force quit Firefox. if i click my mouse, the banner's "Smilies" start
animating. if i hold down the mouse, the banner fully animates the "Smilies" but
the page still never functions... my cursor just keep spinning and i never get
control of the webpage! other website have this banner, too, and it happens on
those page a well, so i know it is this banner that is causing the problem! i
have 768MB of RAM.

i've tried turning off Java and all of that but then i can't navigate anywhere
since the entire web is java now.
