This Bookmarklet is broken in Firefox 16.0.0 and 16.0.1.

The Bookmarklet work in Firefox 15.x and work in Firefox 17 Beta and the Firefox 19 Nightly, so this is a regression specific to Firefox 16.x. The bookmarklet itself ha not changed it text. Instead, it appears to be related to some specific handling of JavaScript in 16.x.

One user report that he "get message java script not enabled, but it is." (https://getsatisfaction.com/printwhatyoulike/topics/printwhatyoulike_does_not_work_in_firefox_16)

When testing on a clean installation and new profile of Firefox 16.0.1 with no Add-ons or Plugins enabled, and all setting at default, the bookmarklet doe NOT work. However, when restarting the Browser in safe mode the bookmarklet work properly (Help menu --> Restart with Add-ons disabled).
