I receive "The folder content could not be displayed. Error opening directory '/': Permission denied." when I tried to save a file outside of my home directory or opening a file outside of my home directory. For all of the directories, I'm trying to reach, I either own the directory, or I have, at least, read/execute permissions.

I tried "CTRL-L" and typing in the full path name and received the same error.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. File->Open File
2. Press back key twice (reaches / directory)
3. Error message display

or
1. File->Open File
2. Press "home" directory button (This is /home directory. Not my personal "home" directory
3. Error message display

For saving files:
1. File->Save Page As or Right-Click->Save Link As
2. Press back key twice (reaches / directory)
3. Error message display

or
1. File->Save Page As or Right-Click->Save Link As
2. Press "home" directory button (This is /home directory. Not my personal "home" directory
3. Error message display
Actual Results:
Error popup message stating "The folder content could not be displayed. Error opening directory '/': Permission denied."

The only place I can save a file or read a file is within my home directory.

Expected Results:
Being able to open directory I have permission to so I can either open an HTML file or save a file.
