Resizing the browser window while loading a heavy frame based tab in the background screw up the innerheight value for that tab's frames.

The newly created window space isn't being used.
You might need a few try to reproduce this a it only happens when the frame page is being rendered, And you resize the browser on a different tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a hefty (frames) page
2.while this load / render go to an other tab, and resize the window
3.notice the new window size isn't being used, and there appears a white border where the new usable window space is.
4.The scrollbars aren't extended either, and scrolling to the end of the page doe what it should a if the window would still be small.
Actual Results:
A white bar is rendered in the new free space, instead of the document being stretched.

Expected Results:
firefox 2 behavior would be nice,

This build run on linux, with no extentions.
