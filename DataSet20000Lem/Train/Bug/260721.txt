Firefox randomly stop downloading the content of a web-page, image, download, etc.
Seems to only occour when setup to use a proxy (i have tried different proxies).
Sometimes firefox will complete loading of the page correctly, other time it
stop at a random position.
Viewing page source code show incomplete page source (cuts end of file off).

Happens on all web sites, servers, etc.
But most commonly on big page with lot of content (image galleries, forums, etc).

When a download ha this problem, the download manager will indicate the
download wa completed succesfully, but the downloaded file will not be full size.

This is occouring with all latest version of official release and unofficial
build of trunk and branch over the last few month (cant remeber exactly when
it started).

Reproducible: Sometimes

1. Load a web page, or start a download.

Actual Results:
Randomly a random amount of content is downloaded, and if is a web page, is
displayed.


Expected Results:
Displayed the full webpage/image or completed the downloaded file.

All said above.
