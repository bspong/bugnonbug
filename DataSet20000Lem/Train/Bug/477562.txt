Can no longer browse the internet if clicking 'stop' after 1/2 second of beginning to load a page

Once I begin to load a page, but decide to stop the loading, and then click back, I am no longer able to use the current window/tab.

Not sure if it happens on all websites, but I quite often make mistake when typing my password into hotmail.com, and press Stop and back (before the page loads) and retype my password I can no longer continue on.

If I stop a page after it ha been loading for a few seconds, I can still browse the internet... it only seems to happen if I immediately stop the browser.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load any webpage (or hotmail)
2. Type anything in, and hit enter
3. Immediately stop the page from loading, you should be presented with a white screen with nothing on it
4. Press back, then type something else in, you will not be able to continue.
Actual Results:
Can not continue browsing the internet in the tab/window you are in.

Expected Results:
You should be able to continue using the current tab/window
