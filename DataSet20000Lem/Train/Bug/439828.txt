Lost bookmark and RSS feed
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SV1; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 3

During past installation and update of Firefox, the installer would normally ask if you want to import files, bookmarks, extensions, etc. Firefox 3 didn't do it. Tried to uninstall it. No luck. Opted for System Restore. Now I get a Windows error message every time I try to start Firefox stating the following: "Firefox ha stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start Firefox.
2. error message immediately appears.
3. forced to close program.
Actual Results:
Same a above.

Expected Results:
Since I did a System Restore back to before I downloaded and installed Firefox 3, my older version should have be available to use

Currently, I've lost everything that I would normally access daily through a Firefox web browser and am forced to use IE or Safari until this is resolved. Even then, I will have to recreate each bookmark and RSS feed and possibly reset passwords.
