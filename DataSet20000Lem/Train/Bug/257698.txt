The content of the privacy tab in the preference dialog are partially hidden
from view on the right side of the dialog when viewing "Download Manager
History", "Cookies" or "Cache".

This seems to be a MacOS X specific issue. I have verified that the Windows
Firefox behavior is correct, but I'm unable to verify on Unix/Linux.




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox on MacOS X
2. Open Preferences dialog
3. Select Privacy tab
3. Click on "Download Manager History", "Cookies" or "Cache"
Actual Results:
The expander element are opened and the content of the window are resized such
that part of the content are now hidden from view.

Expected Results:
The XUl element should be laid out in such a way a to properly wrap so that no
part of the window is unintentionally hidden from view.

It look like either the dialog need to be resized to fit the layout inside the
expander elements, or the layout need to be reworked to take into account the
size of the Mac UI.
