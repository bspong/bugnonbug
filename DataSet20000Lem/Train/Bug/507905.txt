Laptop screen are generally getting more pixel while remaining 13 - 15 inches. Additionally, we are seeing 10 - 12 inch screen size in netbooks, with increasing pixel counts. Also - more and more, laptop are becoming most of the computer market.

Firefox icon are raster images, so they look smaller a screen resolution increase. In fact, the 24-pixel "large" icon can be inscrutable for some users.

I would like to request that Firefox enable additional icon sizes. IIRC, the capacity wa built in a few year ago. Having this capacity would allow the default and third-party theme to provide small, medium and large icon to allow for greater flexibility in user experience. At the least, three sizes.

Reproducible: Always




As an example of a theme that use 24-pixel icon for "small" and 32-pixel icon for "large," see the Aeon theme. To see a theme that us 32-pixel and 48-pixel icon for "small" and "large," see Aeon Big. Of course, there is also Aeon Jumbo, with it 48px and 64px icons.

I would recommend the following label for icon sizes:

16px - x-small
24px - small
32px - medium
48px - large
64px - x-large

Even if the default theme doe not make use of the additional icon sizes, third-party themers could do so.

Of course, svg icon would obviate the need for this, but I believe what I propose could be done now, where any svg icon capacity would lie sometime in the indefinite future.
