When text is copied from Firefox and pasted into Outlook (NOT Outlook Express), it creates an ATTACHMENT to the email msg instead of pasting the text into the msg.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

I am running
Firefox 1.5.0.6
WinXP Pro SP-2
Outlook 2000 SP-3

If I highlight a text selection from a website in Firefox 1.5 and COPY it,
when I attempt to PASTE the selection into Outlook, it creates
an ATTACHMENT to the email msg instead of pasting the text into the msg.

However, If I open the same page in IE or Mozilla and COPY the SAME selection,
when I paste into Outlook, it act normally, pasting the copied text, without creating the attachment.

However, I can paste the Firefox copy into something else (like a text editor and Word 2000), just not into Outlook.

Here is a key factor:
This happens if Outlook is set to send PLAIN TEXT messages.
This doe not happen if Outlook is set to send HTML messages.”

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Outlook (NOT Outlook express), set the mail format to plain text. (Tools, Options, Mail Format, Send in this mail format... Plain Text)
2. In Outlook, compose a new mail message.
3. In Firefox, copy text from any website.
4. In Outlook, try to paste the text into the new mail message.


Actual Results:
An attachment appears rather than the text.

Expected Results:
The text should appear in the text area of the new message.
