In the page http://www.hhs.fuhsd.org/ the menu located on the left column
appears fine until the mouse is brought over the top of the menu. The submenu
don't appear. This doe not occur using the MS Explorer browser.

The page is from Homestead High School, a public school. Perhaps they have not
used standard coding. I am no expert so I could not tell.

Here is some code where the problem occurs:

mymenu.addMenu("information","<b>information ></b>", "")
mymenu.addMenu("classes","<b>classes ></b>", "")
mymenu.addMenu("activities","<b>activities ></b>", "")
mymenu.addMenu("athletics","<b>athletics ></b>", "../../../groups/sports/")
mymenu.addMenu("services","<b>services ></b>", "")
mymenu.addMenu("staff","<b>staff ></b>", "")
mymenu.addMenu("library","<b>library</b>", "../../../groups/library/")
mymenu.addMenu("boosters", "<b>boosters></b>", "")
mymenu.addMenu("ptsa", "<b>ptsa></b>", "")
mymenu.addMenu("alumni","<b>alumni</b>", "/alumni/")
mymenu.addMenu("help desk","<b>help desk</b>", "../helpdesk/")

****** more details******
"library, alumni, & help desk" don't garble and behave correctly
and "athletic" doesn't garble but doesn't allow for sub menu




Reproducible: Always

1.Go to the website http://www.hhs.fuhsd.org/
2.Slide mouse over the menu in the left column
3.Compare result using MS Explorer

Problem ha been around since the beginning of the school year. It happens on
my desktop and laptop computers, both running XP.
