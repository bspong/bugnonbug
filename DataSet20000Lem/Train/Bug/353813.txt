in most java window [particularly at http://chat.deviantart.com/ - any chat room in there] i now develope a kind of lag, but not from other people, only from my own typing. sometimes it take up to 30 second for 20 word to appear, and i am not that slow of a typist. it quite irritating, because i use java chat to help people with thing i work with. [the chat is only accessable if you are registered to http://www.deviantart.com/ from what i know of.]
it probably take up to 5 - 10 minute before the text lag in the writing box happens. [sorry for putting it in general, i wasnt sure where it belonged]
i've updated my java script and nothing changed. i reformatted my computer, but it only happened since the last two update of firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log into deviant art.
2.go to deviantart message network: http://chat.deviantart.com/ and click a chat room that ha a fair number of chatters. [i had installed damn.extend, but that wa installed before this problem had occured.. a long time before it]
3. chat, and wait for the problem to occure - apx 5 - 10 minutes.

Actual Results:
The text in the text box for the chat room would take at least 2 - 3 second per letter to enter into the box, causing long sentence such a this one to take anywhere up to 30 seconds, possibly longer, to be finished writing.

Expected Results:
it shouldnt be lagging at all, it should be a smooth entry.

i'm not sure if this is classified a a bug or something that should be enhanced
