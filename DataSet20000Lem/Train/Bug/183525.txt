Phoenix crash trying to display the demo page.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20021204 Phoenix/0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20021204 Phoenix/0.4

The demo page is a cut down version of a page that originally gave this crash.
What's left that could be related to the problem is the following:

* A CSS setting of "p { max-width: 45em; }"

* Use of the UTF-8 encoding.

Actually the number of character in the single text paragraph seems to be
critical a well. If I take out the _first two characters_, the crash doe not
occur. Also removing other characters, or the "em" tags, or the asterisks, can help.

If I remove the "meta" element for UTF-8, Phoenix doe not crash, but the page
initally take surprisingly long to render.

This bug seems to depend on a lot of small details, and it probably appears only
once in a very blue moon.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:




Mozilla doe not crash on this page.

Possibly this is related to bug 175558, who knows...

Since this seems to be related to the text width ("max-with: 45em") it wouldn't
surprise me if this bug only occurs with certain font size settings, certain
font families, etc.
