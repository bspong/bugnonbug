relative link in input type=button attempt to use chrome:// instead of http://

Attempting to use salesforce.com, clicking on any of the bottons cause a
javascript exception because it's trying to access chrome instead of http. I
realize that perhaps salesforce isn't exhibiting 100% compliant behavior, but I
can't imagine that anyone coding a button served from any doctype that isn't XUL
or XBL is targeting anything but a resource from the webserver. Salesforce is
basically unusable in firefox until I can work around this (perhaps with CSS,
but I'm not really sure how. More likely I'll write a javascript bookmarklet in
the meantime that merely rewrite button into links.)

I had to snip the URLs somewhat for privacy reasons...

<input type="button" name="email" value="Send An Email" class="button"
onclick="window.location='/email/author/emailauthor.jsp?retURL=[SNIPPED]'">


Security Error: Content at https://na1.salesforce.com/[SNIPPED]
may not load or link to
chrome://browser/email/author/emailauthor.jsp?retURL=[SNIPPED]

Error: Access to
'chrome://browser/email/author/emailauthor.jsp?retURL=[SNIPPED[' from script denied

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Access to restricted URI denied"
code: "1012" nsresult: "0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)" location: "<unknown>"]


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Attempt to use salesforce in firefox. Click on one of the buttons.
Actual Results:
Appears to do nothing. Errors are in the javascript console, above

Expected Results:
Used <current-protocol>://<current-host>/<path> instead of chrome://<path>
