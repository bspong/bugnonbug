Resizing grip / gripper broken in FF4 when viewing Gmail

Using Firefox 4.0 on Windows (haven't tested Mac), when i log into Gmail, the resizing grip in the lower right corner breaks. Specifically, the grip widget is over-laid on top of the down-arrow scroll button. Not only is this aesthetically unattractive, but it also break the functionality of the down-arrow button (it can only be used to resize the window).

I am not sure if this is dependent on how one ha their Gmail set up, but i have tested this with extension disabled and it doe the same thing on two different machine (one with Vista and one with XP), both when viewing the Inbox (and other folders) and when viewing individual e-mail threads.

I also happen to have Gmail pinned a an app tab, but i've tried unpinning and it doe the same thing. Problem also persists across restarts. The problem doe NOT manifest when i am on the Gmail log-in page — only when i am actually signed in. It also doe occur when the window is small enough to have a horizontal scroll bar (whether i'm logged in or not).

Please see attached screenshot showing the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into Gmail
2. Boom
Actual Results:
Gripper overlaid onto scroll button

Expected Results:
Gripper should appear below and independent of scroll button
