right click a link while new page loading but old page still displayed
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

Before 0.9 release I used to read a web page, left-click a link, then,
continuing to read the page (while the new page being fetched from the server,
but the current page still being displayed), to right click onto another link on
the same page, and from the contextual menu to choose 'open in new tab'

After 0.9 ha been released, I cannot longer use this feature, and firefox
started to behave like internet explorer: once i left clicked a link, the
contextual menu doe no longer appears, even if there is still enough time to
right click -> 'open in new tab' before the new page is loaded completely and
displayed. Sometimes it wa sooo cool that the contextual menu appeared even
after the new page already loaded, ie: click a link, the new page is being
fetched, i notice another link and i want to right click onto it -> open in new
tab, in the meantime the new page is done fetched and already displayed, the
contextual menu for old link appears - this wa so cool, because i didn't have
to hit the back button and re-right click -> 'open in new tab' ;) (all these
step - click, right click, open in new tab - happen within one second or less)

After already left clicked on a link, right click on another link doe not open
a menu anymore since 0.9

note that i am always having these setting changed from the default ones:
config.trim_on_minimize = false
advanced.system.supportDDEExec = false

the feature wa present in 0.7 and 0.8 (i have no idea about previous version
since i am new to firefox), no matter if the window theme service wa started
and used or not, or the application's menu font size is the one from window
standard scheme or another one (like mine, trebuchet m 12 bold), or dependant
on display resolution and color depth (1024x768/16@home, 1600x1200/32@work)
