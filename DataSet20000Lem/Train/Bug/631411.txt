Title say it all - saw in the news today that this problem affect Firefox 4 so I wanted to mention that I have had the same exact issue with the last three or four release of Firefox 3 and with Internet Explorer 9 Beta, a well.

Details:

In the last three or four release of Firefox 3, and in Internet Explorer 9 Beta, clicking on an email subject to open email result in new page continually reloading. Most of the time text of email doe not load at all even after page stop reloading (which often never happens).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign into Hotmail account, click on Inbox, click Subject of email to open it, watch email fail to open and/or display text a page reloads continually.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Page never stop loading and/or text of email never load even if page doe stop loading.

Expected Results:
Text of email doe not load and page reloads continually.

Software should load text of email and page should not keep reloading.

I'm reporting this because I strongly believe it's a bug also currently present in Firefox 3 and exists in Internet Explorer 9 Beta, a well - which could mean it might be Hotmail's fault, or at least a defect common to both browsers, in which case a different solution than expected might be needed.

For what it's worth, I have a slow/ extremely unpredictable wireless Internet connection, which might mean the problem is originating from how Hotmail load up emails.
