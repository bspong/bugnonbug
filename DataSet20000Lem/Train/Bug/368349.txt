When renaming a batch of bookmark to reflect numbered name list in my particular case, i use CTRL+I the up-down arrows, and the num-pad to ease the process along. When i go to fast, it seems that the buffer or thread loose sync with the bookmark currently selected, and pressing ctrl+i after the usual sequence after renaming (enter, up/down, ctrl+i) it will rename the previous one, tho behind it, the window show the next one in line selected.

Try it with a list of 3 or 4 bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have list of bookmars
2. Rename in order by scroling down list using CTRL+I to rename,
3. enter when renamed,
4. scroll down using arrows,
5. Press Ctrl+I without waiting for window to catch up.

note: this may only manifest on my puter, due to speed and restriction that way, but just bringing to your attention a a subtle result that could lead to other issue down the road with similar functions.
Actual Results:
Renames previously selected bookmark.

Expected Results:
Generally buffered keyboard commands, and mouse click are processed FIFO... it seems perhaps a multi-threaded handling of the two windows, "Bookmark Manager" and "Bookmark Properties" allow it to de-sync...

This could have something to do with my bluetooth Logitech MX5000 keyboard, but i doubt it.
