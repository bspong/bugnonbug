should drop indicator always be shown when scroll dragging a tab, even if the tab can't be dropped?

to do this, I think all we have to do is:

ib.setAttribute('dragging',
- aDragSession.canDrop ? 'true' : 'false');

ib.setAttribute('dragging',
+ (aDragSession.canDrop || pixelsToScroll) ? 'true' : 'false');

a pixelsToScroll will have a non-zero value when the original target of the
onDragOver event is the scrollbutton-down or scrollbutton-up.

beltzner/ben/mconnor, do you prefer the current UI (where the drop indicator will not be shown) or wayne's suggestion, where it will be shown?
