Forced Upgrade to New Version of Firefox Browser
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

Absolutely Nothing, in fact, I expressly turned automatic update OFF.


Actual results:

Firefox would not let me open a new window and insisted that I reboot my computer before allowing me to use the browser. This ha happened numerous time lately and it is becoming a deal breaker.

I wa in the middle of working on some web publishing and I needed to check my updates. instead of being able to continue my work I wa forced to close all my open application that I wa not finished using so I could shutdown my computer and get Firefox working again. This happened at a critical time each time it ha happened and I cannot be forced to do this anymore.



Expected results:

I disabled automatic updates, in fact, I set it to "NEVER CHECK FOR UPDATES", so why is it updating at all.

I am seriously pissed off over this and if it happens again I WILL stop recommending Firefox and remove it from my computer. Fortunately, there are many other good browser out there today and I am not forced back to Internet Explorer.

To make me stop what I am doing and force a reboot IMMEDIATELY is absolutely insane.
