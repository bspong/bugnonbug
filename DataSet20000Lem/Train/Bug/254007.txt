I usually browse with cooky set to ‘Accept for current Session’ a I do not
like site tracking be between visits, however on all site where I deliberately
created an account I obviously do not mind this and would benefit from the
connivance of them using a cookie. Whilst the ‘Ask’ preference allows for this
scenario, it leaf you to manually block thousand of cooky a you are just
browsing around.
It would be helpful under the cookie privacy setting to have separate setting
for cooky set when you follow a link, and cooky set when you submit a form.
If you are browsing the web then any page that set a cookie before you give it
any information is obviously just tracking your browsing, however if you have
submitted a form then it is a genuine chance you may wish to allow the site to
use a cross-session cookie so you do not have to fill in the form again.
This would have to check that you had actually entered something onto the form
to prevent page just auto-submitting forms.
