Shims affect performance in non-e10s user profile

Mike did ask me to describe how I'm hitting it, but the c#0 wa the best way to describe it.

I do have lot of tabs, and a few app tabs. But most of them are not even loaded into memory.

Following is a slight excerpt from the bug where we found this.

+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #1167615 +++

So, when I switch tab I get a 2 to 3 full second delay before the active tab UI switch and before the content area switches.

This is with today's Dev-Edition (5-22) and I updated from at least Monday 5-11 a the oldest possible, where I didn't experience this issue. (If you can't reproduce a similar issue, I'm happy to help bisect)

In between that last build and this one I did an update (that wa staged earlier) and then got the doorhanger prompt about e10s "is coming soon" I selected "NOT NOW". incase that matters.

If you need more info from me, it is best to use a needinfo for a fast turnaround.
