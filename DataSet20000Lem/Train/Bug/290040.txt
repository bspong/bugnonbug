Using Flah Player version 7.0.19.0

Whenever I call a JavaScript function using getURL() from a Flash Movie, the
argument of the JavaScript function get UUDECODED automatically, breaking the
JavaScript function if special character (such a '"иат etc.) are present in
the function arguments.






Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Flash Movie with a getURL("javascript:alert('pippo%27s%20room')");
2. Drag the generated movie in a Firefox window

Actual Results:
NOTHING!!! The function doe not get executed, and nothing is reported in the
JavaScript console


Expected Results:
An alert window with the text "pippo's room"

I guess the problem is thet the embed uudecodes the javascript function BEFORE
executing it. This cause javascript to work incorrectly because special
character are placed in the function.

No JavaScript function will work!!! I found a solution endoding the text twice,
so that the first decode doe not affect content, but this is tricky...

Many flash website will malfunction because of this.
