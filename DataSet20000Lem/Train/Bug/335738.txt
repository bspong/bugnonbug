I wa trying one of the installation smoketests which involes removing the Firefox folder from Application Support, which remove the profile, and relaunching the application to see whether the Migration Wizard come up and prompt you to migrated from Safari or another browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the UB from the source above and install it.
2. Launch one first time and quit.
3. Remove the folder Application Support/Firefox from the current user's folder
4. Re-Launch Firefox

Actual Results:
It just load a default profile and the migration wizard never show up.

Expected Results:
Upon launch Migration Wizard should appear prompting you to migrate data (bookmarks, feeds, etc..) from Safari or any other browser you have installed.

I tried it on new macbook pro and iMac. On the iMac I also tried the latest version from the website 1.5.0.2, and a smilar thing happened.
