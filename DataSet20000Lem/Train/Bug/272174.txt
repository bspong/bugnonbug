In building firefox from either the CVS code (Aviary Branch) or the Firefox 1.0
source code tarball, there is an issue with http://www.usatoday.com when the
software is build with gtk2 a the default toolkit and the flash player plugin
is installed (version 7). If the software is compiled against gtk1 a the
default toolkit and the flash player plugin is installed (version 7), there are
no issues.

If firefox is compiled against gtk1, and installed, no issue with flash player

If firefox is compiled against gtk2 (only changed in the ./configure option by
changing --enable-toolkit-gtk to --enagle-toolkit-gtk2 and setting the default
toolkit to gtk2., Sites such a http://www.usatoday.com will cause a SEGFAULT.
Not all site are effected. http://www.lycoris.com/ doe not create any
issue with either gtk1 or gtk2 and flash plugins are enabled.

On gtk2 build, if the flash plugin file are removed from the plugin directory,
and the browser is restarted, there are no issue on http://www.usatoday.com.

When building from the Mozilla SeaMonkey tree, mozilla 1.7 branch or the 1.7.x
minibranches, there are no issue in this area with either gtk1 or gtk2 builds.
