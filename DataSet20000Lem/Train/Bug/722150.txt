New Google home page window after initial startup window have two blinking cursors; expect search box cursor to be the active cursor; address box cursor is active; have to erase & activate search box cursor with my mouse; I have FF 9.0.3
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

Click on '+' to bring up a new google home page window after Firefox ha brought up my initial Google home page window. Start to type what I'm searching for. It type at the end of the address line not in the search box which appears to be active.


Actual results:

Appear to be two active cursors, but the bigger is in the search box; type what I'm searching for and it type at the end of the address line. I have to erase what I typed because it's appended to the address. Then I usee my mouse to manually activate the cursor in the google search box. I should not have to do this. Is this a Google or a Firefox bug? The initial google home page window when I activate Firefox is fine; it's just the subsequent window when I have multiple windows.


Expected results:

Should on have one cursor on the screen and it should be in the Google search box in the middle of the screen. I should not have to manually activate a cursor in the search box. Most annoying but in the scheme of thing a minor bug
