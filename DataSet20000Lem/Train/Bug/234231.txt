Display problem when the page's size is bigger than the screen's page

There is a display problem when the page is bigger that the size it can display.
This is a problem with, for exemple: phpInfo (the PHP function which can tell
how Apache+PHP+others wa built)
At the end of the page ('Environment' and 'PHP Variables' parts), if the table
is bigger than the size page: scroll to see the end of the cell => the right
marge of others tables, which are smaller, will stay on screen...

The field whitch is very big is 'LS_COLORS'
=> if you search on google, other site in which there is this parameter you,
maybe like me, will see the same thing.

The problem is: in this exemple (http://phpinfo.hostultra.com/) I have the
problem .... but not in this: http://portal.portland.co.uk/phpinfo.php

I do not understand at all :)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Call to the function phpInfo(); in any PHP script, in some webserver
2. If the size of one of the table is bigger than your screen
3. Scroll to see the right of the cell
4. You will see the marge of other table...

Actual Results:
I see the marge of others cell and tables...

Expected Results:
It should not do so.
It should, off course, display anything.

I've tried to do the same thing with IE in all the exemple and counter-exemple:
it doe not reproduce this bug.
