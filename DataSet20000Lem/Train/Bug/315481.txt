Graphics get blanked out
This site show picture of coin and doe a PTM (Polynomial Texture Map) with the. The page initially show the front and back of a coin. When you click on one of the faces, a pop-up window show a larger view with control where you can change the lighting of the object. After a few second of clicking on the window and adjusting the lighting, either the picture of the coin in the main browser window or the larger picture of the coin in the pop-up winder will go blank. re-sizing the pop-up window or re-loading the page temporarily clear up the problem.

This is another Java plug-in. FireFox ha trouble with these, but the CHI website seems to see problem with the applet PTM view a lot. The picture of the coin is displayed briefly and then the go to white frame. IE ha trouble with this also. Clicking on a picture normally result in a pop-up set of window that display and allow control of the relief view. This initially works, but quickly becomes grayed out.
