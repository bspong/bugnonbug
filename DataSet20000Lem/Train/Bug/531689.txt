Expected Results:
I expected that after bookmarking a file (using the star in the URL line at the top of the page) that I could drag and drop the new bookmark (or even one that's week old) into one of my organized folder to keep it organized, and them delete it from the "Recently bookmarked" file without losing it from BOTH places.`

nothing special that I can think of
