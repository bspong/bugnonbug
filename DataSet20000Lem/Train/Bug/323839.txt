When I use the GoogleBar with the search term highlighting turned on, it print each word of the search query a a button on the toolbar. As these button extend beyond the edge of the viewable screen, the UI extends in an attempt to fit the extended length. However, when the window is maximized, this cause the scrollbar to move past the edge of the viewable screen. It also cause problem with divs that have relative placement. They start to bounce between their normal position and the position they would be if the screen were wide enough to hold the entire UI.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using a toolbar extension, cause the item on the toolbar to overflow
2. Observe how the UI extends past the end of the viewable screen.
3. Watch certain divs begin to "bounce".

Actual Results:
Bad Webpage and UI rendering

Expected Results:
Toolbar button cut off gracefully, The UI doesn't extend past the edge of the viewable screen, and relatively placed divs don't bounce.
