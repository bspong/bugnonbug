Double-click no longer allows text select - highlight flash on then quits.

Firefox 1.0 handled text-select-by-double-click ok - like IE and other MS apps
still do. Current Firefox update do not allow select highlight to remain - on
second click the highlight flash on then stay off, preventing text-drag. Have
to use IE now for that or use cut-and-paste. Same on all URLs. The reference URL
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi is exception in it email address
and password field - select work ok in those field but not for any ordinary
text outside those boxes. Disabled all Firefox extension to be sure - no change.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Double-click or click-drag-click over any text.
2.Text is highligted momentarily then disappears on second click.
3.

Actual Results:
Text highligting went away after second click

Expected Results:
Highlighting should have stayed.

Perhaps related to 265398 or 266561? I notice that text select work ok in the
text box of this form just a with the reference URL cited above, but again
not on the text ouside the text boxes. Environment is XP Pro, Version 5.1.2600
Service Pack 2 Build 2600. Current XP build wa before Firefox 1.0, I think.
Noticed problem after first Firefox update but waited 'til after second update
to see if the bug were noticed and fixed. Could there be some Windows setting I
don't know about? For what it is worth, File Folders setting is for double-click
rather than single (again to allow dragable selection). Works the same with
touchpad and with PS-2 mouse.
