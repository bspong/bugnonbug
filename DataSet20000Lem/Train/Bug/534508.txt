I am running a Dell Dimensions E310 system (6 year old) and have d/l'd and ran, a well a tried to run from the website, and each time I get a DOS window loaded for 3-5 seconds, and then nothing. The software doesn't load and no message sent. The website ha NO technical support for "so new we're not yet customers" group. I have been told by lot of people how your browser software is so much better than the window product in preventing bug and that is why I am looking to your product. PLEASE HELP ASAP a this system is frustrating the HE|| out of me. Thanks, Kent

Worked would be great! When it didn't work, having a "trouble installing" web page that may provide me with help in fixing it so I wouldn't have to bug you guys. That would have been great!
