Tab doe not load on start up with two window and minimum two tab per window
This is similar, or possibly the same, a bug 1090430, but mconley indicated that I should file a new bug.

I reproduced this in a fresh profile, which is how I wa able to isolate it to a very precise set of circumstances. With a new profile,

1. Open two windows.
2. Open two tab per window and load page in all four tabs.
3. Close Firefox.
4. Open Firefox.

Expected:

Visible tab in both window load and display content normally.

Actual:

One window (background, I believe) appears to load content but doe not display it. Instead there is just a throbber, usually frozen (I think I saw it continue to spin once in my testing). Switching to the other tab and back cause the content to display. The other window display content a normal.

The condition have to be very specific for this to happen. It *only* happens with two or more windows, and at least two window must have two or more open tabs. I verified that the problem doe not occur with two window and only one open tab in one or both windows. With three windows, at least two must have two open tab to reproduce; the third window can only have one open tab and even be in the foreground to continue to reproduce the error, a long a the other two window have two or more open tabs.
