Suddenly the browser won't allow me to to save anything be it a image to a file. I am allowed to right click and get the option but after I click on "save image as" nothing happens. No confirmation where you want your file sent box come up. Going into View Page Info to just get the url to a specific image doe not allow it to be save either. No matter the site it won't allow me to save anything from any webpage. Yet I can get on Internet Explorer (which hardly work on my system) and it will allow me to save something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find Image you'd like to save.
2. Right click on the selected Image.
3. Click on "save image as" or "save link as".
Actual Results:
Nothing happens the page report "done" after it ha done nothing.

Expected Results:
I should have received the image or file I had intended to save into my files.

Everything wa working correctly to my knowledge until afternoon of September 8th. I signed on and opened up Firefox like normal but wa not allowed to save anything I clicked. I tried anything and all that wa savable to check it if wa the site. Nothing will save from my Mozilla Firefox Browser.
