Firefox give an error message if you try and change keywords in the search engine manager to thing that were changed earlier in the session. For instance if youtube ha a related keyword of "y", and yahoo ha no related keyword, and the user want to change that so youtube's keyword is "yt", and then try to change yahoo's keyword to "y", an error message occurs stating that the "y" keyword is already taken, even though it wa changed earlier in the session. Upon making one change, closing out, coming back in, and changing the second part no error occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change search engine #1's keyword
2. Attempt to change search engine #2's keyword, which wa not set previously, to what #1 just was.
Actual Results:
An error message pop up stating that #1's keyword is already in use, and therefore #2 is unable to use it.

Expected Results:
#2 should be allowed to change to what #1 wa without exiting halfway.
