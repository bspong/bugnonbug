When a session containing one or more window that require HTTP baisc authentication is restored, the resulting window open with the modal dialog asking for username/password. This is a expected.

However, these window are listed a a blank line in the "Window" menu. Furthermore, selecting this line cause the "Window" menu title to remain highlighted, and the desired window doe not gain focus. One ha to uncover the offending window and click on it to give it focus.

IMHO, the lack of focus should be fixed, and a default title should be created for the Window menu so that multiple window of this type can be distinguished from one another.

This bug may be related to #460395, but seemed different enough to merit it own report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window to a site that requires basic auth. Log-into the site.
2. Open a new window to a different site that doe not require basic auth.
3. Make sure the preference to "show my window and tab from last time" is turned on.
4. Quit Firefox.
5. Restart Firefox.
6. After both window have reopened, click on the blank line in the "Window" menu.
Actual Results:
Clicking on the blank window title doe not give the appropriate window focus. Instead, the menu title remains highlighted.

Expected Results:
The window should gain focus.
