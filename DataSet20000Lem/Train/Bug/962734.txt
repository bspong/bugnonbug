Firefox UI processing slow menu not clipped correctly unless in safe mode
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

I don't have any idea what happened. I wa browsing and Firefox's GUI became slow. Menus would not drop down or would be badly clipped. Menu item highlighting would no follow the cursor.


Actual results:

I don't have any idea what happened. I wa browsing and Firefox's GUI became slow. Menus would not drop down or would be badly clipped. Menu item highlighting would no follow the cursor. Only able to restore good behavior in safe mode. I have since removed all extension but avast. Avast is disabled but I haven't been able to remove it. Since that didn't help I have reset Firefox--no joy. I then attempt to remove all Firefox directory from system after uninstall (User directory a well). Reinstalled. Reset Firefox. Still no joy. Good behavior only in safe mode. What I need is direction or a tool that will completely clean the clock of all firefox related files, directories, extensions, plugins, bookmarks, everything back to square zero. I have lost a large amount of time and effort on this problem. I could not save the bookmark information so I lost my most recent bookmarks. I could not save the session information so I lost save session that included ongoing work. I need to recover soon or I'll have to abandon Firefox after using it since it's first release after Mosaic. That would only add to the suck. I would appreciate any assistance.


Expected results:

At the very least there need to be able to uninstall everything back to a clean initial state. I have already given up salvaging anything with respect to previous Firefox usage. I just need the mean to start over from zero.
