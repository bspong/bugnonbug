At least some of this used to work before... (before 3.6...? before some IIS/ASP server change...?)

HTML is:
<select name="JobsSummary1:Area_DropDownList" onchange="__doPostBack('JobsSummary1$Area_DropDownList','')" id="JobsSummary1_Area_DropDownList">
<option selected="selected" value="All">All</option>
<option value="Badenoch and Strathspey">Badenoch and Strathspey</option>
...
</select>
<input type="submit" name="JobsSummary1:btnArea" value="GO" id="JobsSummary1_btnArea" class="button" />

I don't know ASP, but I'm presuming this is fairly normal code generation.

Problem at client or server? Web page work with Safari Version 4.0.4 (5531.21.10)

First box Has some AJAX behind it (which doesn't work); if you proceed and click on "Search" result are pretty much a before. Once again, website work in Safari.

Previously I had been running with NoScript and Firebug, but I re-installed from the downloaded disk image so that the above result should come from a vanilla installation (no extras) so long a I correctly removed all trace of previous installation.
