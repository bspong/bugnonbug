ctrl+click should be the same a middle click in all contexts. the only one it is different in that I have found is in the bookmark drop down. I cant ctrl click a folder and cause that to open all of the item inthe folder to open up in separate tabs. middle click doe accomplish this though.

This is important because most laptop have only 2 button and not the middle button.
