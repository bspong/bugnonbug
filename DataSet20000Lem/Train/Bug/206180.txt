This is not really a "bug" per se but a "missing feature;" the Extensions panel
of Options ha no indication of whether an extension is enabled or disabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools, Options, Extensions.
2. Select an extension and click Disable Extension.
3. Select an extension and click Enable Extension.
Actual Results:
Nothing visibly changed IN THE DIALOG BOX. The extension turn on and off, but
there is no visible indication in the Options dialog box of which are turned on
and which are turned off.

Expected Results:
I would think it should either place check mark and/or X's next to the item in
the list to show which are enabled, or cross out or gray (dim) the disabled
ones. Another possibility is two side-by-side enabled and disabled lists, but
the former is easier. Also a " (Disabled)" appended to the title in the bottom
box would be good too, but the list itself really need some indicator.
