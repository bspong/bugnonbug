At http://www.gmx.net/ I use two login accounts. If I work only with one of them the stored account with the password is written into the login field.

But when I try to login with the second account the new e-mail name is overwritten with the first e-mail name. When I write it very fast I can put the e-mail name and the password in the field without the change. The password manage store the new account but I cannot login because at least the new e-mail address is overwritten bei the old one.

When I start this url again none of the stored account are submitted.

When I kill the new account the password management still works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make two account with different password
2. Login with the first account. There the password run automaticcally. After this logout.
3. Login with the second account. (I could not)
4. Check: is the new account in the password list?
5. Login at the same url: Is the a list shown with both of the account (like in Mozilla)?
Actual Results:
No list appears. The login field is empty.

Expected Results:
Choice between the two account appearing in a list. That one I choose is written into the login field.

It doe not work with Firefox 3.1.0, 3.1_Beta_3 and 3.5_Beta_4. But it work with Mozilla 1.8b
