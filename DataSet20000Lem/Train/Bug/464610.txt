I download Mozilla 3.0 (latest version) ,2-3 week ago. My issue is with "either
the "brower security" or with my "wireless security"

I need to know if there a "bug" or "issue" with the "autofill".
All of my "setting" from Internet Explorer were transfered without trouble ."But"
it seems that the autofill button will ask for a "credit card" number and being that Iam on a wireless laptop,it (CC#)is being "intercepted".
Is there no way ,that when the "autofill is "clicked,that you can be"directed or "promtped "to secure area of "firefox brower".That way when you enter your ID and credit card info , it will be is a "secured" area of "either memory" or you will be directed to a secure "page"were this "info can be entered???

Is this at all possable? Second , I find at time (not always), that after I leave or exit from "firefox3 "the brower crashes.
Firefox ha sent out the "error codes" , when this happens. Weather or not they have been received and how I go about finding them ,I have no idea. Help!!!

In touch with "microsoft to see if this is a vista issue" or if the problem ha to do with Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Crashes after "ninth time online or if the "laptop a been on for "a hour.
