File menu and Filter field in about:config have same accesskey

The File menu and the Filter field in the about:config window both have F a their accesskey, thus preventing use of the accesskey combo to access the latter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open about:config.
2. Press Alt+F (in windows. Don't know if this conflict exists in Mac or Linux).
Actual Results:
File menu opens.

Expected Results:
This is, I suppose, expected behavior for typing Alt+F. Menu key combo should probably have priority over any lower-level conflicting key combos. The overall expected behavior would be the Filter field having a different accesskey that doesn't conflict with any other default browser accesskeys (I, L, and R would appear to work sans conflict).

The Filter field should be assigned a different accesskey so that it too can be accessed from the keyboard. If no such available letter can be found, the accesskey indicator (i.e. the underlined F) should be removed from the about:config Filter field.

As it is, the Filter field is still available via keyboard through the use of the Tab key, and most user won't encounter this problem, so I'm classifying this a Minor. But menu accesskeys are a pretty basic aspect of program functionality and accessibility, and this should be an easy fix, so I hope this is resolved.
