Hi ,
In my usual surfing , I find that Firefox hang whenever I open a URL or when the web page is loading (during AJAX calls). I find this happening whenever the Proxy is setup and having credential to pas through. It's quite annoying since the entire browser freeze for a couple of seconds.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
To replicate this , you may try:
1. Setup a Web Proxy (Which should accept Username/Password for user connecting through it)
2. Setup Firefox to use the Proxy. I have setup using the "Auto-detect proxy setting for this Network" option.
2. When the first time Username/Password is requested, enter the credential and check the option to remember it so that we don't need to enter it later.
3. Normally surf the web and you should find that Firefox freeze every 2-3mins esp during page loads.
Actual Results:
Firefox freeze every 2-3mins esp during page loads.

Expected Results:
Firefox SHOULD NOT freeze (as compared to popular browser like Chrome. Even IE doe not freeze !! )
