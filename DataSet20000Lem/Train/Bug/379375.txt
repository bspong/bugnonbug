when i have opened firefox and it ha gone to my start page 'google'(sometimes i have to hit the home button a few time to et that far), clicking on link and bookmark work le than 50% of the time and i have to click multiple time on occasions. Very irritating and slow when browsing and doing research. i have installed the latest firefox and the problem still persists. I have even closed ALL other program to see if that helped to no avail. I have NO idea why this should be happening. Can you help?
