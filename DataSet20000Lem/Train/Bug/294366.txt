Hi,

When I start streaming radio, after 10minutes, I start to get typing error when
typing fast. If I type slow (1letter a second) I do not get problems.
example of error:
I want to type 'abcdefg'
but I get: 'abcefgd' because the cursor jumped back after typing the 'd'

When I close firefox and look in my window taskmanager I mostly of the time can
see that firefox is taking more then 40MB of RAM.
After "end proces" of firefox, and a restart of firefox and restart streaming,
all typing issue are solved. But after 10 minutes, problem is back...





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start streaming(radio) http://www.stubru.be
2.wait 10-30minutes
3.start typing in your browser (fast enough)
4.

Actual Results:
cursor start jumping after typing +/-20 caracters when typing fast enough(normal)

example: abcefgd (cursor jumped backwards after typing d)

Expected Results:
example: abcdefg

knowing that this problem happens when RAM memory use is very high (due to
streaming?) this is causing indirectly those typîng problem when typing fast
enough. When typing slow (1caracter/second) it is not happening
