apparently a couple of day ago google introduced a change in the code of the google-image search.

this change trigger a bug in FireFox, causing the document to scroll in the lower frame of the image search result.

this can cause very significant advertising revenue loss (e.g. adsense) for people who have a banner at the top of their page and get most of their traffic for image search, since the banner is not visible anymore in the image search result (when viewed with FF 3.6.3). the problem doe not seem to happen with IE and Chrome.

it also reduces the usability of many site (the page navigation menu is hidden unless the user scroll the page to see it top). this is a serious issue, and it must be corrected. either google must implement a workaround and/or FF must fix the scrolling bug.

to reproduce the bug:

1) do any google image search with firefox.
2) click on a thumbnail image to bring the split frame
3) the page loaded in the bottom frame will scroll (i.e. the top of the page will be hidden by the google top frame)

(unless the page ha a frame-breaker, in which case the frame will disappear of course)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.do any google image search with firefox
2.click on a thumbnail image to bring the split frame
3.the page loaded in the bottom frame will scroll (i.e. the top of the page will be hidden by the google top frame)

(unless the page ha a frame-breaker, in which case the frame will disappear of course)
Actual Results:
the page loaded in the bottom frame will scroll (i.e. the top of the page will be hidden by the google top frame)

(unless the page ha a frame-breaker, in which case the frame will disappear of course)

Expected Results:
the page in the lower frame should NOT be scrolled, i.e. it top should be visible.

this scrolling bug doe not happens with IE7 and Chrome (i have not tested other browsers)

i have posted this report in the google forums:
