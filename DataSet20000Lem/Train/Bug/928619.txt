When find bar closes, current match selection is lost
Steps to reproduce:
1) Enable FAYT.
2) Search for something; I searched for "event" in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events
3) Let the quick find bar close by itself, or close it by hitting Esc.
(all this can be done from the normal find bar a well, by clicking the x button)

The match selection will be lost. At this point, the first time I hit F3 to keep scrolling through the results, it will select the match I wa at before; I would expect it to continue from the next one instead.

This is sort of a regression from bug 921308. Before (without Finder.jsm), the same happens but only when the current match is found in a link; the current match is kept if on normal text. I wa just about to create a bug to suggest to change that behavior so that the match selection is kept even on links. Good thing I tried the same thing in Nightly, a that lead me to change my suggestion: it should always keep the match selection when closing the find bar.

Obviously, if the match is found on a link, it should still be given focus, but it should also keep the text selection so that when I hit F3, it doesn't start at that very same place I wa at, but at the next match.

Is this possible? Maybe by just doing a findAgain() operation right after the focus is set, but I don't know if that'd be a bit too band-aid-hacky...
