The "Open with" dialog that you get when selecting a link. Will change between different opening in the same session. Also it will happend even after I have selected "Do this automatically for file like this from now on".
In my specific case it's a link to a tiff file that generate this behaviour.
I.E it either select the "display (default)" or opening with Gimp.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page witch ha a link to an tiff file (you should also ha gimp installed)
2. When selecting the link the "Open with" is displayed. If no association ha been given in Preferences. It suggest "display", now press cancel. And click the link again, will give you Gimp instead (you might need to cancel a few time, for me it wa random. But usually 50% of the cases).
3. Now if the "display (default)" is presented, check the box "Do this automatically for file like this from now on". The image is correctly displayed via Firefox, but close the window. And repeat a few times, and suddenly the Gimp is selected instead.

In my preference I can see that TIF is associated with display.
Actual Results:
The opening of a file with extension tiff will sometimes be open with an application I have not selected.

Expected Results:
The display should open the tiff file.
