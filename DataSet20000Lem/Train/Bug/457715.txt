Conversion of byte to unicode prevents page from being retrieved

If you browse to http://toshio.fedorapeople.org/u/ you'll see a directory listing from apache with two files. They are both named ½ñ.html (one-half lowercase n with tilde .html). However, one filename is encoded in iso8859-1 and the other in utf-8. You can see this by toggling the character encoding for the page (View:Character encoding) between Western (iso-8859-1) to utf-8.

The filename encoded a iso8859-1 ha text inside that say "A latin-1 filename". The utf-8 encoded filename contians text that say "A utf-8 filename".

The problem is that firefox is converting both of the file into the unicode byte the first time you attempt to load the files. ie: clicking on either one of them take you to the same file. (The utf-8 file for me... I have a utf-8 locale under linux). If I specifically load both of the file using their hex escape in the location bar, I can then click and firefox take me to the correct place (I have to then move the file to a new directory to repeat the problem).

If you view source of the web page that apache generate you'll see that apache is creating the link with hex escaping. However firefox seems to be converting both of the hex string to unicode and then submitting that to the server. When I mouseover the links, the url shown in the statusbar is the converted URL (ie: ½ñ.html).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to http://toshio.fedorapeople.org/u/
2. click on both of the link
3.
Actual Results:
Receive a page that say "A utf-8 filename" for each.


Expected Results:
Receive different page -- one with: "A latin-1 filename" and the other with "A utf-8 filename".

Remember that once you've accessed both page manually with the hex strings, firefox will then know about the separate pages. (possibly ha something to do with when firefox look up the URL in the cache?)
