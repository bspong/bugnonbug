My team ha a fairly rich Ajax application, and recently some user have observed that if they don't close Firefox for several day (which is actually quite common), Firefox consumes > 300 MB of RAM, even with only one open tab pointing to the blank page.

My guess is that this is caused by Firefox maintaining a cache of all open page over the life of the firefox process in order to support the "Recently Closed Tab" feature.

I think "Recently Closed Tab" is a good useful feature, but it's my experience that most people (like 75%) don't know about it, and le use it regularly. *If* this is the cause of the large memory consumption for long-lived but otherwise empty browsers, I would suggest that it be possible to disable/enable the feature and that by default this feature should be disabled.

The people who don't know / don't use the feature will be unaffected, other than that they consume much le memory. People who know about the feature just need to enable it, and perhaps you can even be tricky and detect whether or not someone ha used it and if so, make it default to 'enabled' during an upgrade.
