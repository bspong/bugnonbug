FF3 cache is worst than IE7 cache...

I noticed that FF3 caching is much WORSE that FF2 caching... F5 is not the same reload button and they have not the same behaviour a click on url bar and ENTER.

I get caching on server side change and much WORSE the javascript caching... Seems more a proxy behaviour than a correct cache manager... (I'm not using a proxy!)...

Cleaning cache feature are not working correctly... I develop with JS and often that function doesn't clean Javascript caching... the only way to avoid the problem is clean all the cache on exit, close and reopen firefox...

Many colleague downgrade to FF2 or go to Safari a primary browser due to all these annoying inconveniences.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open browser
2.load a page (PHP, JSP, ...) with or without JS
3.try to change server side code and/or j code
4.F5 or refresh button or click on url bar and press enter
Actual Results:
cache is not refreshed or only partially refreshed (new page, old scripts)
usually form are not reset on F5 (like select default value, etc)

Expected Results:
cache correctly refreshed... all the caches!

correctly refresh caches... and have the save behaviour with all the refresh methods.

clean the cached a supposed with the menu function to clear all the cache (javascript cache seems refreshed often only on browser close...)
