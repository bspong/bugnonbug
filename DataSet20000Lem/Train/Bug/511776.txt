Large image turn blank when zoomed in.
If I go to
http://images.csntm.org/Manuscripts/GA_0311/GA_0311_0001.jpg
The image is fine in the 'unexpanded' mode. Mouse over and click to expand, it
give a properly sized blank. click again and the image reduces in size
properly, but stay blank. <shift>-reload cause the image to reload and
display correctly (but still not expand).

Save a save the image just fine, even if the image is blank on the screen.

If I look in the cache, the cached image is correct.

I see this problem consistantly on Linux (Fedora 11, x86_64, FF 3.5.2). I don't see the problem on Windows XP (32-bit) with the same version of FF.

The following bug may be related. I include why I think this one doesn't necessarily apply:

Bug 492992 - Black block or painting error about halfway down very large page
-- this describes page in general. Not just images. In the case I see, the image draw correctly the first time, and only blank when expanded.

Bug 420479 - JPEG image is getting cached twice, one being a large-sized zombie
-- this is a FF 2.0 problem. The cache look correct (cached image seems ok).

Bug 395259 - Large image disappear when scaled down
-- could be related, image in description work properly for me, however.
