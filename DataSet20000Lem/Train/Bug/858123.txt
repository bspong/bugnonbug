Suggested Improvements for Adding Bookmarks
When I: click the 'yellow star' (Bookmark this page) icon

Nothing happens the first time. I usually have to click this twice to get the "Edit this bookmark" dialog to appear. When the dialog doe appear, it is ineffective for large number of bookmark and could benefit from a few SIMPLE enhancements.

1) The problem of having to click the icon twice should be resolved a this is really distracting and frustrating. No other control in the Firefox UI seems to suffer from this problem.

2) This dialog should be resizeable. The standard size is simply too small, especially when you have a large collection of bookmarks. As a UI designer/developer, I cannot imagine any reason why this is not resizeable. After the dialog is resized, Firefox should remember the size and make that the new default size.

3) In the tree of bookmarks, there should be control to collapse/expand all.

4) When there are a large number of bookmarks, the "New Folder" feature ha abysmal performance. It take dozen of second for the action to complete after clicking the button. Is this a simple implementation problem or are you using O(n^2) or worse algorithms?

5) It should be easier to figure out what "Tags" mean from the dialog. For example, a tool-tip could help enormously. A link to a help page would also be useful.

6) A search filter could be useful - or is that what tag are supposed to do?
