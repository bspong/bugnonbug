I am testing an asp.net page on my local server, the page contains shadowbox (http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/) which i have set up to open an external page with (therefore in effect an Iframe). when the shadow box open and i click on a link within the Iframe which i have set to open in the parent page (page that i initialised the shadow box from)Firefox crashed completely and i have to start it up again. Tested it in ie6 and ie7 and it is fine if that is any help

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use a page that ha shadowbox on it (http://mjijackson.com/shadowbox/)the example to use would be under the heading "Web" then "External site" from the above link, we'll call this page 1.
2.Set one of the link in the page that will be the "External" page (we'll call this page 2) to open in the parent frame (page 1).
3.Initialise the first link on page 1 to open the External page (page 2)with shadowbox)
Actual Results:
Firefox crash (didn't hang just closed) with no bug report dialog coming up afterwards and neither did windows. Asks me if i want to restore the previous session

Expected Results:
What should have happened is that the link that i clicked on in page 2 should have opened a new page in page 1. To see what should have happened, try the above step in ie6 or ie7 :-)

I wa using the default firefox theme. All the page were built in asp.net vb and being tested at the time on the localhost. The link on page 1 wa passing parameter to page 2 (but no problem with that) and then the link on page 2 wa passing parameter to the page that should have opened in the parent (page 1)
