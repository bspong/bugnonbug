I'm working on a community site at worldofryzom.com and it vBulletin. Browswer
work fine surfing the site, but freeze quite often when working in the
administration section. vBulletin is Javascript based in Frames.

Firefox freeze meaning no button work, tab can still be cycled but are stuck
on the page they were at. Quiteing is nescesary and sometimes I need to
ForceQuite the App.

It varies a to how long i can work before FireFox crashes, but it always doe
in the end(eventually). This usually happens in the 'add page' dialog frame.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.I log into the admin panel of vBulletin
2.start working, adding web page etc.
3.eventually FireFox freeze needing to be quite or forced-quite
3.5. -usually in the 'add page' dialog frame
Actual Results:
Froze

Expected Results:
not froze

this may be a javascript issue, when i tried Safari it so far ha not had this
problem(more testing needed)
