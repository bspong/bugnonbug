I have two monitor on my system tied to a nVidia Geforce 8800 GTS. Once is a Samsung SyncMaster 2343BWX hooked up via DVI, The other is a Samsung SyncMaster 914v via vga with a DVI-vga adapter. If I move a firefox window to the 914v, the second monitor, when I click on a folder on the bookmark toolbar, it briefly appears, then disappears leaving behind an outline. If I move the mouse down the list of links, it reappears and disappears when I stop the mouse again. If I click, it doe open up the selected bookmark even though it is not displayed.

If I split the window between the two monitors, it is semi-random if it doe it on the 914v, but it always work fine on the 2343BWX.

Reproducible: Always

1.open firefox
