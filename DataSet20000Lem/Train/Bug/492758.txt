Firefox allows website to install Trojan just by visiting a particular webpage
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.9) Gecko/2009040821 Firefox/3.0.9

NOTE: I understand that I am using a slightly older version of Firefox, however, for obvious reason I don't want to upgrade Firefox just to try to visit the site again and see if I get infected again!

I visited the website: http://knowfree.net/2006/10/21/memory-optimizer-paul-sheele-paraliminals-full-9cds.kf and shortly thereafter I saw sign that I wa being infected by a Trojan or virus: my anti-virus program wa disabled, my Windows firewall wa turned off, IE wa opened with marketing site popping up (had to close them via task manager), a well a an "incosnet.tmp" process taking up a lot of the processing cycles.

I also tried to download http://rapidshare.de/files/37281199/RapidUp_CD_1.rar on that page, but the request timed out (or maybe gave me a 404, I don't remember) so I don't think it wa that -- it seems to be the knowfree site I visited which installed the Trojan.

The thing that stick out to me now is that the extension on the page is not htm or html, but rather kf


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Note: don't try these step unless you are in a controlled environment and are willing to be infected by a Trojan!

1. Visit http://knowfree.net/2006/10/21/memory-optimizer-paul-sheele-paraliminals-full-9cds.kf
2. Get infected by Trojan.

Note: I am not set up to have the luxury of being infected by a Trojan again, so I wa not actually able to try these step again.
Actual Results:
Got infected by the "incosnet.tmp" Trojan (perhaps also known a Virtumonde) - installed several other file (including startup files) on my computer a well

Expected Results:
Firefox should not allow a site to infect a user with a Trojan merely by visiting the site.
