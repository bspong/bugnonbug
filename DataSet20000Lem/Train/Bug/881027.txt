100% cpu when on new maps.google.com (may be unable to kill, requiring reboot)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:23.0) Gecko/20130506 Firefox/23.0 (Nightly/Aurora)
Build ID: 20130506030925

Steps to reproduce:

wa starting to use new version of maps.google.com. This wa slow, so I tried to file a report via google dropdown at top-right of page.


Actual results:

KDE, mouse, keyboard all locked up. Accessing the system from another laptop, Linux is still running fine.

top reports:
PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND

4058 root 20 0 1446m 1.0g 416m D 0 12.7 1585:19 X

So it appears X is hung on I/O. Attempting to attach gdb give startup messages, including:
This GDB wa configured a "x86_64-mageia-linux-gnu".
For bug reporting instructions, please see:

Reading symbol from /home/usrlocal/bin/firefox24.0a1/firefox...(no debugging symbol found)...done.
Attaching to program: /home/usrlocal/bin/firefox24.0a1/firefox, process 8250
[but no prompt]

It's possible to remotely kill gdb (not via Ctrl+c); but never FF or X.

Tried killing FF via every possible signal, to no avail. After over 3 hour trying different options, giving up and will reboot... :(


Expected results:

No super-tight loop that can't be kill'd, gdb'd, strace'd...
