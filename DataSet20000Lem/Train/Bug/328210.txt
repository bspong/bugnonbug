Password-protected page with big javascript app invariably crash Firefox on Intel iMac OSX 10.4.5.

The web statistic page for Intermedia.net invariably crash Mac OSX Firefox ("Firefox quit unexpectedly" dialog box appears); Safari is fine with it on the same machine. Microsoft version of Firefox and IE on laptop PC have no problems. The page is password-protected, us frames, and seems to have a large javascript application to display result within the initial page.

I just tried using Firefox on my kid's eMac to access the same page - no problem with displaying the page using Firefox (installed within the past month) on eMac.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to access page - page never come up.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Firefox quits

Expected Results:
Displayed page, a it doe in Safari and all PC browsers.

Firefox installed yesterday (02/21/2006) on 20" iMac Intel 2 Gb 256 Mb VRAM. The fact that the page load fine on Firefox on an eMac (also with OSX 10.4.5) is suspicious...

You may want to collect any other Intel iMac bug to send to Apple; I'm going to bring it up on their forum.
