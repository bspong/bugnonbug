On Firefox start page on Google preferences, the interface language selected (english) change suddenly to unknown language

At first I thought that by mistake I unknowingly changed the interface language under Google global preferences. Since I wa unable to change it back to the English language, due to the fact that it wa all in a language which seems to be Japanese, I proceed to uninstall and reinstall Firefox from my computer. When I first reopen Firefox everything seemed to be OK, I wa back in the English language. However, after three hour of using my pc, while I wa browsing result on Google, suddenly it all went back to this unknown, to me at least, language. Consequently, when viewing my search result on Google instead of reading under each result the option “cached” and “similar pages” all I see is what seems to be Japanese or Chinese characters. Similarly to what wa reported on bug ID 401803, on one occasion all I could see where ???? character (however mine is a pc, not a Mac).

Reproducible: Always

2.open firefox start page
3.start using Google Search
Actual Results:
Suddenly the language interface change from english to something with character like chinese or japanese. On one occasion, it changed to ??? marks.

keep the selected language interface, i.e. english
