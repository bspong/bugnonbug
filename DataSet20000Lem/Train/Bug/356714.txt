Sometimes on loss of power on my laptop I restart Mozilla without pressing the Wireless antenna connect button. Then after reconnecting to the internet, I reload all tab in some of the windows. If the power go down again the active tab in window I haven't gotten to retains the url, but the other tab don't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
First Session:
1. Load several tab up with url in several windows.
2. Kill the power to the computer
Seccond Session:
3. Choose "Restore session" without restoring internet connection.
4. Restore internet connection, Choose "Reload all tabs" for some of the windows.
5. Kill power again
Third Session:
6. Restore the internet connection.
7. Choose "Restore Session" again. Windows that were not reloaded in 4 will remember the url for the unloaded active tab, but not for the other tab in the same window.


Actual Results:
Url data for unreloaded tab in the second session are gone in the third.

Expected Results:
Url data for all tab are retained.
