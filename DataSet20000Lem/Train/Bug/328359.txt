On certain pages, the use of middle-button autoscrolling cause text corruption to appear. I can reliably reproduce it by randomly middle-clicking and moving the mouse around over the main text.

The attached screenshot show how the circular autoscrolling icon cause the text distortion. I can see around the circle, the underlying square used a the icon. The top of the square is positioned halfway up the "got plenty" text, and the part it cover is horizontally shifted by a couple pixels. Normally if I scroll up and down, the text re-aligns properly; however, it can remain corrupted at the point where the autoscroll is stopped and the icon removed (i.e. click the middle button around a lot). The text return to normal when it is selected, or scrolled off the window, etc.

I have seen this problem ever since I used Firefox but never did anything about it. I can't seem to find a duplicate. It may be related to bug 278442 or bug 273029 which are vague.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the above URL (for example) with autoscrolling enabled
2. click the middle button to turn autoscroll on and off while moving the cursor around the main text


Actual Results:
the text get horizontally smeared

Expected Results:
normal text

I think everything is default... I don't think it's relevant but my video card is an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro, and Windows GUI is set to 125% DPI, 1024x768@32.
