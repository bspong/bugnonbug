Have been running Firefox 3.6.x nightlies for several months. Approx 4 time per week I get spinning wheel. Always happens while downloading but might be 10th or 20th download of session. Can't reproduce on demand.

Application Monitor report Namoroka not responding. Usually this is followed by Finder reaching not responding status leaving me no option but to request restart of Mac. Mac can't complete shutting down far enough to restart--displays spinning gear. Only resort is push the button.

Because Finder wa also hung, I don't get anything in log and no crash report generated from Firefox.

Today build hung minute after I installed new build on first download before anything more than name of file being downloaded saved to disk. Was able to restart Mac successfully so this is my first log of any kind on this.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Can't give step to reproduce. Happens about 4 time a week, usually after many hour session. Always while downloading but I do a lot of file downloads.

Now at OS X 10.6.6 but started under 10.6.5 or maybe 10.6.4.


Actual Results:
Firefox hangs, Finder hangs, download partially completed, have to push button on hardware to restart Mac. Loss of any data not saved in any open application, directory repair to disk required.

Expected Results:
File download completes, Mac left fully functional.

Default theme

MacPro early 2008, 12 GB RAM, over 500 GB free space each on boot drive and download destination drive. Cable modem. Dowloads from various sites, usually file over 100 MB, often two file downloading at once, many Firefox window open. Wish I had log to file.
