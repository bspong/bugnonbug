I first encountered this problem Wednesday morning after an update for Mozilla Firefox wa installed. Immediately after installation I wa unable to access any website from the Firefox browser or form Internet Explorer. I got help in trying to fix this problem through my server (Time Warner) and it wa determine that the connection wa good and I wa able to access the internet if I entered the website IP address for example for Yahoo I had to enter 209.131.36.158. Since the problem started after up Mozilla Firefox download I decided to restore the system to a previous date. The result wa that I wa now able to access the internet through Mozilla Firefox but still no luck for Internet Explorer.

A few minute later a pop up wa displayed indicating that there wa an update for Mozilla Firefox I clicked on Okay the update wa downloaded and just like the day before the internet wa inaccessible. I once again restored the system to the date I had previously restored it too and once again I have internet access through Mozilla Firefox but not internet explorer.

The pop up for the update just displayed itself for the 3rd time but this time I declined the update. Any suggestion on what I should do for the next request to update the software?
