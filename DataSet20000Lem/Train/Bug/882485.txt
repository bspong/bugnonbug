Add API key support for Google Location Service API.
+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #835890 +++

Folks at Google have asked u to investigate using specific API key for making request to Google APIs from Firefox release builds. The goal is to allow them to put further restriction on non-Firefox us of those APIs.

Some preliminary information about how this work in Chrome:
> This is the link for contributor outside of Google:
> http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys
>
> The key implementation file in the Chromium source tree are:
>
> a) A central point for retrieving the API key and OAuth2 token that
> are set on the build. This pick up the key and token that are baked
> in via preprocessor defines or in an internal-only header file, and
> bakes them into the binary. It also allows overriding value at
> runtime via environment variable and command-line switches. See
> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=google_api_keys.h
> and it associated .cc file.
>
> b) A build configuration that detects whether the
> google_chrome_api_keys.h file is available and us it automatically
> if it is, depending on configuration. See
> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=common%5C.gypi+google_api
> (top result) and a Python script it depends on,

This is a requirement of the current GLS contract -- without sending keys, we can not do Geolocation.
