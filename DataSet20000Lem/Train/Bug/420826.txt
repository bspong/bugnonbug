loading-image.gif Browser consideration for display
------- IMPORTANT FOR VISIBILITY --------
( This result I got extensive navigation after )
During extensive navigation with the Firefox I noticed that the visibility of the image is more comfortable if in the deep one of the image before it having been completed the navigation is well more interesting will have suppressed the image of deep ----- loading-image.gif -----
---------
In special when a page with some photo is had.... In special when if this sailing for great amount of pages...
---------
The IMAGE OF DEEP VISUAL CAUSE ESTRESSE --- for extense navigation
--------
I think...... extensive navigation after.... THAT the IMAGE OF DEEP --- loading-image.gif --- Is UNNECESSARY
--------
The image is visually well more interesting only to appear...... without the image of deep --- loading-image.gif ---
--------
A time that the deep image of ja is known of the user the fact of it to be continuously appearing is bother the navigation
--------
A LOGICAL FACT
The FACT OF IMAGE JA TO HAVE BEEN STIPULATED IN SIZE And POSITION; JA IF KNOWS THAT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE PLACE; IT IS REDUNDANT TO HAVE AN IMAGE INFORMING
-------
I sail extensively with the Firefox; it is with experience that I noticed this fact Only the image must appear while this occurring appearing of the photo; without it I bother persistent icon --- loading-image.gif ---
-------

I think that the Mozilla must suppress this image in special
