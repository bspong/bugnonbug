High CPU when viewing flash content

Firefox will randomly start consuming excessive CPU cycle when view flash content from my personal website. In this case, I have a music jukebox for listening to some of my MP3 music content. The music content is delivered using JW FLA Media Player (http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_FLV_Media_Player). Typically when this occurs, the CPU peak at 100%. I cannot say that I have noticed a significant increase in memory useage (my system run 2.5gig of DDR).

I have noticed that this appears to be a common problem with Firefox. I have seen it occur in various release of the 2.0 mainline (including the 3.0 RC). For comparison sake, I loaded Safari 3.1.1 and let it play music content for my website for more than an hour (on several occasions) and I never saw the high cpu issue surface. I can let Firefox run and within about 30-90 minutes, the problem will usually occur and I will be forced to kill the process.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fire up Firefox and select an online playlist or album of choice.
2. Let Firefox run for a while checking for slow response or instability.
3. When it occurs, usually within 30-90 minutes, verify CPU usage via Windows Task Manager.
Actual Results:
Firefox would consume 100% of the CPU cycle until the process wa force ended. Killing the Firefox process usually clear the problem in the short term.

Expected Results:
CPU usage remain in the 15% to 30% range with about 650MB PF memory usage is typical normal behavior.
