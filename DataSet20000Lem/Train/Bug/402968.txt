Move throbber to where the URL bar site icon (favicon) is.
Alex, beltzner, and mconnor designed this, I'm summarizing:

* Remove the throbber from it current location on the toolbar.
* Add throbber to where the favicon is in the URL bar.
* The throbber, like the favicon and the URL, is tied to the tab being shown.
* While the page is loading, you see the throbber, and when it finish you get the favicon. [Just like how the throbber/icon on tab currently works.]

Why:

* Brings load activity closer to the UI that affect throbbing (eg Stop, enter a URL, forward/back/reload).
* A throbber here is useful for indicating activity a a Places search run (as you're typing in the field)
* One le icon in the primary UI (favicon is now overloaded, no standalone throbber)

Known nits:

* The "inactive throbber" state cease to exist. [More precisely, a favicon is shown when the throbber is inactive.] This is highly desirable for integration consistency on OS X.
* The throbber is no longer global, so if the only tab loading is hidden in tab overflow, there's no at-a-glance activity indication.
* The favicon can load before the page is finished loading, but won't be shown until the page finish loading and the throbber stops. Stalled load would be the worst example of this.
* This could be perceived a a flashing effect, where navigating within a site cause icon --> throbber --> icon --> throbber --> icon, etc. We already flash a little between the site icon and generic icon, although it can be subtle.
