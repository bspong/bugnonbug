FF display additional Services & Features cost $2.99 per month but IE doe not.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 1.0.6 a well a 1.0.4

When I login to my account through Cingular wireless web site
(www.cingular.com) to upgrade phone, the shopping cart automatically add a
undesired "FastForward Unlimited Call Forwarding" feature which cost $2.99
per month along with the phone chosen. There wa no way to removal the
feature. If customer simply check out, the additional payment request will
appear on next month's bill.
Cingular customer service on phone traced the same procedure after logging in
to my account and reported a no problem. He used IE instead of FF.
Then, I have verified the fact using IE and FF. FF 1.0.6 a well a 1.0.4
exhibited the undesired "FastForward Unlimited Call Forwarding" feature.
Cingular homepage programmer may know the functional hole existing on FireFox.
The display difference wa copied a Microsoft Word document which can be
distributed.
