After installing a newer version of Firefox, 2.0.0.3 (from 1.5.0.10)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; iebar)
Build Identifier: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-2.0.0.3&os=win&lang=nl

The software updater in version 1.5.0.10 doesn't work (it doesn't appear to do anything at all), so I manually downloaded the new version from:
http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-2.0.0.3&os=win&lang=nl

On startup I got two error messages, both without title bar, they are included below. For your convenience "XML-parsefout: ongedefinieerde entiteit" mean "XML parse error: undefined entity". After closing these message Firefox didn't start. When trying to start Firefox again only the second error appears, but still won't start. The problem doesn't seem to go away by itself.

XML-parsefout: ongedefinieerde entiteit
Locatie: chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/update.xul
Regelnummer 33, kolom 3:
<wizardpage id="offline" pageid="offline" next="versioninfo"

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
(reproducability based on other people's experience)
1. Install old pre-1.5.0.10 version of Firefox. Use it normally.
The update to 1.5.0.10 killed the updater. When you notice this:
2. Install 2.0.0.3.
The two error message appear when the installer try to start Firefox.
3. Try to start Firefox.
The second error message appears.
Actual Results:
The error message appeared, and Firefox did not start, a detailed in "Details".

Expected Results:
Either it should have started normally, or if there wa a really pressing technical reason this isn't possible, it should have shown a dialog box detailing how to fix the problem.

Set "Severity" to Critical because Firefox doesn't start at all.
