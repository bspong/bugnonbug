The preference dialog, dialog started from inside the preference dialog and other dialog for example the about dialog open on the wrong screen.

That is I have a two screen setup and these dialog are always opened on the primary screen althoug Firefox is open on the other screen. Further more a window manager I use KWin and KWin is configured to place new window always on the active screen. Of course when I open the preference in Firefox on the left screen it is the active screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use two screen
2. Place Firefox on the not primary screen
3. Open the preference dialog or the about dialog
Actual Results:
Preferences are opened on primary screen

Expected Results:
Preferences window is not placed manually by Firefox but by the window manager

Dialogs provided by the toolkit such a the File Open dialog are displayed correctly on the primary screen. As a kwin developer I must say that it is a bad idea to overrule the window manager's placing decision. This result in a very inconstent behaviour and unexpected behaviour and for the user broken behaviour. For a tiling window manager such a behaviour is even more a problem a the window manager ha to decide if the window should be floating or tiled. In general window requesting an own geometry should be floating (e.g. application launcher started from the panel) while a preference window should be tiled.
