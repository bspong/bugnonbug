A Mac application (application bundle) ha been registered a supporting a custom protocol (e.g., foo://). In Safari and Chrome, clicking a URL with this protocol either run the app or provides an appropriate way to select/confirm the app. This work similarly in FireFox 3.5. However this no longer work in FireFox 3.6.x.

In 3.6, clicking a custom protocol link only ever display the message "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (foo) isn't associated with any program.". The custom protocol never appears in Applications pane of FireFox's preferences.

Manually adding the association in about:config by setting network.protocol-handler.app.foo and network.protocol-handler.external.foo also did not work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a Mac OS X application that support a custom protocol (e.g., foo://)
2. Open FireFox and navigate to a page that contains a URL link using the protocol.
3. Click the URL link.
Actual Results:
FireFox display message "Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (foo) isn't associated with any program."

Expected Results:
FireFox either automatically recognizes the application associated with the custom protocol and launch it or allows the user to select the application or confirm this action. This is the behavior Safari and Chrome.
