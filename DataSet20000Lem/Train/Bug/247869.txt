Install a Administrator, run a User: can't change default browser
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040616
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9

I installed Firefox 0.9 a a member of Administrators, but I run Firefox under a
regular user account (not even member of Power Users). Whenever I launch it a a
regular user, Firefox asks at startup whether to make it the default browser. I
say "Yes". Next time I launch, it asks again. And again.... until I tell it to
just stop checking at startup.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in a member of Administrators.
2. Install Firefox 0.9.
3. Log out, and log in a a regular user.
4. Launch Firefox. Tell it to become the default browser.
5. Quit and re-launch.
Actual Results:
It never made itself the default browser, and asks again each time it is launched.

Expected Results:
Either make itself the default browser, or, if it cannot (due to permissions,
because Firefox wa installed by an Administrator), put up a message such as,
"Firefox is not your default browser. But Firefox wa not installed by you. It
wa installed by the account "such-and-such". If you would like to make Firefox
the default browser, please log in a "such-and-such" and launch Firefox."
