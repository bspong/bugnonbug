Access Denied error when I use http going to port 448 with virtual host subdomain of site

I'm on a team that look after the website at www.adelaide.edu.au. We have several virtual host on our server, such a commerce.adelaide.edu.au. Our secure certificate is a wildcard one, for *.adelaide.edu.au, so it *should* cover subdomains such a www or commerce or anything really.
However, when I try to view any page on one of the virtual host subdomains in firefox (on linux) over https, it get an Access Denied error. I've tried it in IE (on window and a Mac), Epiphany (on linux) and Firefox (on a Mac) and it worked fine.
So the common theme for it not working seem to be:
1. firefox
2. linux
3. virtual host subdomain
4. http (it doe redirect to port 448 when going to https, so that may actually be the issue)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to https://commerce.adelaide.edu.au/ in linux firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:
ERROR
The requested URL could not be retrieved

While trying to retrieve the URL: www.commerce.adelaide.edu.au:448

The following error wa encountered:

* Access Denied.
