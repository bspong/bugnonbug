Steps to perform:
1. Open up enough tab to enable tab scrolling.
2. Drag a tab over one of the scroll buttons.

Expected Results:

The tab strip should scroll when a tab is dragged over it.

It should stop scrolling when it reach the end and the scroll button should look disabled.

Actual results:
The scroll button don't look disabled until after you drop the tab

If you start to drag from either end, the disabled look of the scroll button is maintained even though you now can go back or forward, if you grab a tab from the middle of the scrollable area it's fine - both scroll button look enabled.

Reproducible: Always
