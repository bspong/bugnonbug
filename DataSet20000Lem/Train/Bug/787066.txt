Bookmarks Duplicating or Deleting on their own
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0
Build ID: 20120824154833

Steps to reproduce:

Nothing. Normal use of the browser.


Actual results:

Yesterday, a particular bookmark folder had a set of bookmark in it. Today, all of those bookmark are duplicated. This follows a couple of month of nothing but problem where bookmark are concerned. At first I noticed that a LOT of bookmark had gone missing. As I had previously imported Firefox bookmark into Google Chrome, I went the other way to try to get the missing one back, and then have been using the bookmark "Library" to try to clean up and reorganize my bookmarks. But stuff just seems to randomly duplicate, and maybe stuff is still randomly deleting. It's really messed up. BUT - between yesterday and today, I didn't touch my bookmark at all, yet in that particular bookmark folder, I now have a full set of duplicates. I have sought a SQLLite repair utility, or something I can use to check the bookmark database for damage, but cannot find any such tool. Something is messed up here. It all started about 3 - 4 month ago, and I always allow Firefox to update itself with each new release. This system is clean of any virus and protection software (MSE) is kept current at all times. System is Win7-64.


Expected results:

Bookmarks should never randomly duplicate or delete themselves.
