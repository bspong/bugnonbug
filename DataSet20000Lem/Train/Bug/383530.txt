Hey! This is a great browser, and I'm enjoying it a a replacement of MSIE 6.
One thing I noticed, when you display this page, two frame (tables in this case) are overlapping, and it result in a strange presentation of top-frame background; but still the bottom-frame text is visible behind it. This may be the intended rendering, but when I opened the same page in MSIE it wa smart enough to shift the bottom table 1" or so down, so they do not overlap anymore. Looks like interesting idea of laying thing out, a an opposite of letting them overlap. Hope this make sense. You should see difference in 1280x1024 resolution, or please email me if you have any questions.
Thanks for this browser - it's great!
