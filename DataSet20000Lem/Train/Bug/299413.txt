Javascript history.back() when used with a CGI script doe not retain form input element data

This one is pretty heavy duty so stick with me on this:

XHTML document/form (verify.html) is submitted to (redirect.py) for processing
and return (redirect.html). The action attribute of the "form" element in
(redirect.html) is
conditionally set by (a.py) to point to various CGI script URL's or (x.py ||
y.py). (redirect.html) load an external javascript file (redirect.js) which
sumbits (redirect.html) to the CGI script (x.py || y.py) when the onload event
of (redirect.html) occurs. This action only occurs if the value of the
"submitted" form field in (redirect.html) is set to "unsubmitted". The
"submitted" field value is then set to "submitted". (x.py || y.py) then return
document/form (result.html) which is the end of the chain.

(verify.html) -> (redirect.py) -> (redirect.html (form "action" = (x.py))
("submitted" = "unsubmitted") + (redirect.js)) -> (x.py || y.py) -> (result.html)

If the browser back button is selected when viewing document/form (result.html)
the onload event of (redirect.html) is fired again and (redirect.js) check the
value of the "submitted" field of (redirect.html). If the value is "submitted"
the script call the history.back() function and return to (verify.html)

(verify.html) <- (redirect.html ("submitted" = "submitted") + (redirect.js)) <-
(result.html)

In this way (redirect.html) in combination with (redirect.js) act an automatic
conditional redirector when stepping forward through the form submission
sequence. However, the same script when stepping through the sequence backwards
allows the user to return to (verify.html) without being automatically
redirected again by (redirect.html) to (x.html). In addition the user is now
prevented from using the forward button to proceed to (result.html) without
submitting the document/form (verify.html) again.

In other words:

one -> many
many -> one

The problem that is occuring is that the form element of (verify.html) is not
retaining the previously selected form input element value when it is returned
to using the back button which trigger the history.back() function call.

I have set up an example at http://66.88.142.60:86/verify.html for your review.

The code for all the file can be seen at http://66.88.142.60:86/code.txt



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select y.py from select input
2. Submit verify.html
3. Use the browser back button to return to verify.html

Actual Results:
The select input ha reset to x.py.

Expected Results:
The select input should still indicate y.py
