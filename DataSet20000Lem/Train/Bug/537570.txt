MS Dot net assistant crashing FireFox, re-installing itself.

The Microsoft Dot net assistant extension is causing Firefox to hang after a random amount of time usually a few minutes. The extension isn't present in my extension tab and the WPF add-on is disabled by default but the file are still causing Firefox to crash. I can fix the problem by deleting the content of "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\Windows Presentation Foundation\DotNetAssistantExtension" and removing it reg key, this stop the crashing.
However the file will reinstall themselves (whenever I boot the computer I believe) and the problem return until I remove them again.
I've tried reinstalling Firefox and searched for the source of the reinstall with no success so far.
I have another computer that isn't having this problem and doe have the file installed but it is running on Win7.

Reproducible: Always




The error in the log I get after a hang.

"Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED) nsIPrefBranch.clearUserPref" nsresult: "0x8000ffff (NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED)" location: "JS frame
