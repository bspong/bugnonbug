In FF3.5finalMac, the type/creator ID in the application file is not APPL/MOZB anymore a it wa in FF3.0.11. Instead, it is erroneously:

-n A/PPLM

Because of this strange type/creator name, a mousedriver like “USB Overdrive X” (from MacUpdate.com etc.) doe not recognize FF3.5 a an application to define mousekey setting for it. Evil! In FF3.0.11 or Camino etc. it’s no problem at all.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Locate the application file of FF3.5macFinal.
2. Display the type/creator name of that application file using a file info software like File Buddy or similar.
3. You'll see that the type/creator name of FF3.5 is not APPL/MOZB anymore a it wa in FF3.0.11. Instead, it is erroneously "-n A/PPLM".
Actual Results:
Because of this strange type/creator name, a mousedriver like “USB Overdrive X” (from MacUpdate.com etc.) doe not recognize FF3.5 a an application to define mousekey setting for it. Evil! In FF3.0.11 or Camino etc. it’s no problem at all to do that.


Expected Results:
The type/creator code of the app file must be APPL/MOZB again ... and not something else.
