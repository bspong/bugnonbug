First, I think I see that Fx3 is trying to prevent duplicate with a system that actively discourages their initial creation, via Ctrl-D or the Star button which both force you to edit an existing bookmark. But I don't think they are completely un-useful and are desirable in certain situations. For example, "Bug 450437 – duplicate URLs dropped when bookmarking all tabs" (sorry, not sure how to insert a link here). There are way to still create duplicate intentionally, via dragging or copy&paste, but Fx3 is not very accommodating to them. Here are some request/problems/observations:

1. Request: Re-allow adding bm via Ctrl-D or Star button. Thankfully, someone ha already written an extension to do this:

2. Problem: Removing a bm (using the star dialog) will REMOVE ALL duplicate too (careful), even if other field (title, tags, keywords, description) differ.

3. Minor: The awesome bar will NOT match on a bm's "Name" (Title) if it url exists in a more recent bm. So if you are wondering why you are not getting a match, you probably have a duplicate, with a different title, that is more recent.

4. Minor: The star button will always pick the last modified copy of the bm to edit. Since I think they should be treated uniquely, it should somehow let you choose among the matching candidates.

Reproducible: Always
