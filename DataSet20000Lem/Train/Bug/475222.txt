This is the log into my account at Amazon.com page. If you see this the way I do it doesn't allow u to see the background image, the center of the page is blank, all the option are either on the left or right to choose from but they are all in black text and white background no visual button to see. Links do light up in blue but trying to log in is impossible. I've reported this problem to Amazon.com but they said they are operating just fine. Its been four month now nothing ha changed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to amazon.com
2. click on my account
3. the page appears just a described. try logging in the log in button doesn't recognize user account.
Actual Results:
loop. Doesn't recognize user. Page keep re-appearing a log in failed.


should have read the my account page properly with the actual background of the Amazon.com logo and page information in color, the log in button and the picture and advertisement on their log in page. The log in button should connect with their server and recognize my log in information and connect me to my account page so I can proceed with order and purchases.
