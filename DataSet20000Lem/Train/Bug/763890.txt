Actual behavior:
With the fix for bug 731047, when a user reset Firefox, the file and folder in his old profile are moved to the newly created "Old Firefox Data" folder (located on the Desktop).

When the user reset Firefox a second time, a new folder is created "Old Firefox Data-1".

When the user reset Firefox for the N-th time, a new folder is created "Old Firefox Data-N-1".

The profile name are not recorded anywhere.

Expected behavior:
When a user reset Firefox, the folder with his old profile is moved to the newly created "Old Firefox Data" folder (located on the Desktop), not only the folder's content. This way, the profile name is kept too.

When the user reset Firefox a second time, the folder with the profile he reset from is added to the "Old Firefox Data" folder. This way, all the old data is added to the same folder creating le mess.
