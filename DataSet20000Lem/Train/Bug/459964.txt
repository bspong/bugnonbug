Vital browser and window control hidden in full screen mode with certain gui configuration

My menu bar contains my menu, toolbar buttons, and Awesome Bar, a I feel that any other way of doing it is both a screen real estate travesty and a painful lack of elegance. The only other bar displayed in my firefox is the tab bar.

When using fullscreen mode, it's entirely hidden, making this mode unusable for me. The URL is a screen shot of what I see in fullscreen mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.customize
2.move everything into the menu bar and uncheck the others
3.enter full screen mode
Actual Results:
Firefox rendered itself unusable by mouse.
The first time wa worse, I didn't know that F11 wa the way to exit full screen mode and I wa stuck, had to kill firefox.

Expected Results:
I should be able to set firefox to display the menu bar in full screen mode, and I should be able to put the minimize/restore/close button into the menu bar like anything else in customize.

Also, I don't use title bars, I use maximus and window-picker-applet, so if I could have it display it own minimize/restore/close button all the time, that would be nice too... but it's not necessary I guess.
