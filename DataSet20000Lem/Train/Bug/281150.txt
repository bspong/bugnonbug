My website ha no favicon.ico, so I wa surprised to find that Firefox would
display one that seemed to match my site. I realized that it wa a shrunk down
version of my 404 image. My webserver generates and sends image instead of
standard HTML error page if the browser's accept header tell the webserver
that it prefers an image. I added that feature precisely because I noticed that
gecko wa smart and would send more appropriate accept header for inline
images, and I thought that my webserver should be just a smart and satisfy it
request. Yes, it doe send these image with 404 status codes.

To see what the 404 image look like at full size, see the example on this page:
http://tautology.org/software/woolweb/
Or just link to a non-existent file on my domain in an img element.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://tautology.org/
2. Look at the tab image

Actual Results:
The 404 image appears.

Expected Results:
It should act a if no favicon.ico were found.
