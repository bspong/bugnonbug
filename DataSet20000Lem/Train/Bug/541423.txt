After upgrading to Firefox 3.6, I first went into nsloginmanager.js, and I commented out:
// if (element && element.hasAttribute("autocomplete") &&
// element.getAttribute("autocomplete").toLowerCase() == "off")
// return false;
Then, saved. Then, I checked password manager, I deleted entry for my bank of america account. restarted browser, nav'd to page, entered my passcode, and wa prompted to save. So far so good. Restart browser. When I head to this page (sitekey.bankofamerica.com/sas/signonSetup.do), the input box is empty. But, if I hit RELOAD, the password appears. This is new to Firefox 3.6. Not sure why password isnt filling in when i first nav to this page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.First, I go to https://www.bankofamerica.com/index.jsp, and I sign in (my acct# is stored by BOA in this case.
2. Next page: https://sitekey.bankofamerica.com/sas/signonSetup.do. Passcode box is blank.
3. I hit RELOAD.
4. The passcode appears, and now, I can log in. Why did I have to hit reload?
Actual Results:
I can only get the password to fill in if I hit reload after navigating to the
https://sitekey.bankofamerica.com/sas/signonSetup.do. With firefox 3.5, never had this problem. As soon a I arrived at https://sitekey.bankofamerica.com/sas/signonSetup.do, the passcode wa filled in the box, and I could log in. Now, I have to hit reload to get the passcode to appear. It's a hiccup.

Expected Results:
As said above, with Firefox 3.5, after I'd 'customized' the autocomplete portion of nsloginmanager.js, I always wa able to view my password on bank site such a this with no hiccup. Now, something is causing me to have to hit reload after loading the page.
