I propose that there be an option available to the user to choose which tab they would like to restore after a Firefox crash. The main reason being that when a certain tab crash the browser, restoring the session will cause the browser-crashing tab to also be restored which can cause the browser to crash all over again putting you in a never ending loop if you wanted to restore the other tab you were working in. Which force you to start a new session and lose any tab you had open whether you wanted them restored or not. I personally have come across this situation and I'm sure many other user have too.

I have brought up this idea in the forum and it ha been received well and backed by multiple posters. You can see the thread here:

A few of the idea that have been proposed are a follows:

Option 1: On the box that pop up asking you if you want to "Restore previous session" or "Start New Session", add a checkbox underneath these button that say something like "Let me choose which tab to restore". This checkbox would be unchecked by default in which case the function of the 2 session option button would be unchanged from their current functions. However, if the user did check the box and click "Restore previous session", then a second box would come up with the list of tab that were open when the crash occured and there would be a checkbox next to each tab title. All box would be checked by default. They could then uncheck any they do not want to restore and click OK.


Option 2: Instead of checkbox a proposed above in Option 1, you have a "Show Details..." button that ha a list of the tab that were opened when the crash occured which are all checked by default. The user can then uncheck any they wish to uncheck and then restore the session.


Option 3: Eliminate the "Restore from previous session" and "Start new session" dialog box completely and change it to an error page that come up after the browser ha been restarted following a crash. This error page would look similar to other Firefox error page and have a message saying the browser ha crashed and have a list of tab that were open when the crash occured and allow them to reopen any of these they wish. I may be posting a mockup of this a an attachment.

This is obviously way too late to make Firefox 3.0, but I hope it is considered for a future release.

Reproducible: Always
