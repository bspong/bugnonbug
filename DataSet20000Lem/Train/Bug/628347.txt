Page loading issue in version 3.6 on all platform (fixed with Beta 4.09)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; InfoPath.2)
Build Identifier: Version 3.6.13

This ha been tested with version 3.6.13 on Windows (7 and XP) Mac and Linux and is consistant accross all platforms. On large site (like the one I supplied above) page (and images) take forever to fully load and the status bar at the bottom is screaming between wait/transfer for a ages. We have found through page counter that each visit to a page with 3.6 can add up to 30 or more tic to the counter where it should be just one. This is causing multiple query instance to run causing the page to load slowely and the pipeline to the SQL server to become clogged.

We can easily recreate this with a clean fresh install of 3.6 with no add-ons, etc. on any platform in different location throughout the US. The new beta 4.09 doesn't have this issue (nice browser by the way).

We've noticed a lot of people complaining about 3.6's speed on various forum and we think this is the real issue. In the meantime this issue is working our server harder and is an anoyance for users.

We have yet to find a reason why this is happening. It happens on other site a well, generally larger sites. We think this is an major issue that should be fixed asap. The site that have the most noticable issue with Firefox 3.6 load great in other browsers. Again your beta 4.09 ha fixed the issue - whatever is causing it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.yogisinc.com
2. Click on the Wheels icon and watch the status bar and image while the page load
3. follow the link through to get to a product page and watch the staus and speed. This will not happen with Firefox 4.09
Actual Results:
The alt image tag display, the status bar go crazy and everything load like a snail.

Expected Results:
It will load the page quickly with one call on other browser and Firefox 4.09

Feel free to contact me by phone. Happy to help in any way. I feel this is critical because of the load on server similar to a mini denial of service attack. For instance, if a page normally run 10 query to populate the page and someone is running v3.6, it multiplies the thread by the number of time it reloads the page (in the background) so 10 thread can easily becoms 300 threads. Multiply that by the number of Firefox user and we have a big problem.
