For the last several minefield builds, most recently the one listed above (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; rv:2.0b5pre) Gecko/20100827 Minefield/4.0b5pre) the software ha been unusable on my PowerMac G5. URLs typed into the URL field do not attempt to load. Reload icon stay grayed out. Built-in Google search field doe nothing when word are entered. Home page is reset to http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/, which is not my home page. None of the remembered page from the last load are loaded, however they are there when I return to the latest Firefox release. The history show the proper history, and page accessed through the History menu do load. The Bookmarks Tool Bar is not displayed, however the bookmark are visible in the Bookmark menu. "Check for Updates" just search and appears to never connect. When loading the Bugzilla page through the history, the page is loaded, but clicking Login doe nothing (no access apparent). When returning to Firefox, all functionality is retained, with history, bookmark and home page all exhibiting proper behavior. I have manually downloaded three or four nightly build over the last two week and all of them have exhibited these problems. Nightly build prior to a few week ago gave none of thesis problems.
