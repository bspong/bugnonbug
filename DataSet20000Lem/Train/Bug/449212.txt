Often, usually after the page is finished or almost finished loading, it will disappear and show the message:

Connection Interrupted
The connection to the server wa reset while the page wa loading.
The network link wa interrupted while negotiating a connection. Please try again.

Sometimes I have to hit reload 2 or 3 time before it will load the whole page. It happens frequently (about 1/3 of the time) when viewing the comment section at slashdot.org. It also happened while loading the the embedded "top 100" frame on this (the firefox bug-reporting) page. It also happens on other sites, but much le frequently.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to slashdot.org
2. click on a story
3. watch while the comment are loading
Actual Results:
The page loaded and displayed (but the status bar still said "Transmitting data") and then it disappeared and showed the error message

Expected Results:
Expected page to remain after finished loading.

I am on a satellite internet connection, and the max downstream varies from 2KB/s to about 40KB/s, depending on weather. It seems the problem occurs much more frequently when the downstream is < 6KB/s. I've been experiencing this bug on 3.0 and 3.0.1, but not on any version 2 releases.
