Home button lack styling for the disabled state, breaking compatibility with the UsableHomeButton extension

Icons for disabled state of home button (chrome element id is 'home-button') are missing a of Firefox 3.6 (including current nightlies—Gecko/20091115 Namoroka/3.6b3pre and Gecko/20091115 Minefield/3.7a1pre). Firefox 3.5 (current stable branch) *has* this icons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Firefox (Windows version) installation directory.
2. Open "chrome\classic.jar\skin\classic\browser\Toolbar.png" or "chrome\classic.jar\skin\aero\browser\Toolbar.png". (Toolbar-small.png is affected too.)

Or just open provided testcase URL where sprite from 3.5 is compared with one from 3.6 side by side.
Actual Results:
In Firefox 3.5, there is icon for disabled state of home button. But a of Fx 3.6, such icon are missing (in both Toolbar.png and Toolbar-small.png).

Expected Results:
Icons for all state of home button, *including disabled* (missing in current 3.6/3.7 nightlies), should exist.

Currently affected version of Firefox are both (3.6 and 3.7) trunk branches. Latest tested version are Gecko/20091115 Namoroka/3.6b3pre and Gecko/20091115 Minefield/3.7a1pre.

Disabled state icon are important for extension that use them. For example, UsableHomeButton (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10315) disables home button if user is already on the home page of the current site. In current Fx 3.6/3.7 build such navigational effect is unachievable, and therefore appropriate usability aspect is broken.

Besides, disabled state icon are missing not only for home button, but for adjucent icon in the same sprite too. May be all these missing icon are subject to be added soon, but this is uncertain, so here is bug report. Thanks.
