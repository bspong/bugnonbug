http proxy setting allows newlines (characters; doesn't check erroneous long input)

I used to copy and paste searched proxy server list to http proxy setting in
preference. One time I mistakenly paste something more than the proxy ip address
into the blank and after that proxy browsing alway fails, reporting "The proxy
server can't be found" error. The strange thing is that no matter whatever new
working proxy server ip typed in, same error always repeat. I didn't understand
until I opened prefs.js. There wa a long line "user_pref("network.proxy.http",
"210.9.188.5\n...garbage....");" in it and those garbage wa the content of the
web page I mistakenly selected. Manually edit prefs.js and delete extra stuff
solved the problem.
Firefox should check user input data validity there before proceeding.
