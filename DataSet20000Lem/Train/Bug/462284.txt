It seems like some code somewhere is assuming there is only one browser window to close. The other close eventually but the delay is significant and the content of the window are frozen a it sits there for this extra time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two browser window
2. Select File->Quit in menu
Actual Results:
One browser window quickly disappears, but the other close after a significant delay (multiple seconds).

Expected Results:
Both should disappear quickly and at the same time.

I have a reasonably fast system (Core Duo, 2GB ram, 7200rpm drive). I do use the browser a lot, with lot of tab etc (about 3-10 tab per window on average).

I've started hunting around the Firefox code (I never have before) and I'm sure I could fix this if I could just track down where it's happening. Of course the Mozilla codebase isn't something you can jump into quickly... if anyone could just give pointer to where I might want to look, it could help.
