Bookmark favicons were not transferred with update and are absent in Firefox 3.5.2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

Following updating Mozella Firefox from 3.5.1 to 3.5.2 (file version 1.9.1.3497), my bookmark favicons disappeared. So then I downloaded the Firefox add-on Favicon Picker 3.0.5 with the option "Prevent page from setting and replacing their own favicons" and "Prevent Firefox from searching for and replacing favicons" UNCHECKED. When I right click on the bookmark and click on property and left click on icon "reset", the correct icon appears in the icon box. But when I click on "save", the favicon is apparently not saved because it doe not appear in the bookmark. Copying the URL for the favicon also doe not work. Uninstalling Firefox and downloading it again doe not resolve the problem. Even when I add new bookmark after re-downloading, no favicon appears or can be copied to the bookmark. The favicons are very useful and allow for more rapid selection of the bookmark. Can this be fixed?
