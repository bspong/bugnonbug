Ctrl-clicking on one of the root bookmark folder (Bookmarks Toolbar, Bookmarks Menu, etc.) in the bookmark sidebar allows you to edit the properties. After altering the name of one of those root folders, the name change is not reflected in the sidebar until it is closed and reopened.

I stumbled across this bug after accidently clicking on one of the wrong language when downloading the beta. After opening Firefox in the wrong language, I replaced it with the English language version. All of the regional language were changed correctly, with the exception of the Firefox-generated bookmark folders. I discovered this bug while trying to change them back to their correct names. The folder changing name and not changing them back may also be a bug, but I'm not sure how frequently people will make dumb mistake like mine.
