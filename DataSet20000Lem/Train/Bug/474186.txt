After placing, an order online with pizzahut.com, the Printer Friendly link doesn't operate within Firefox 3.0. The function work correctly in Firefox 2.x, and Internet Explorer 7.x. This behavior is also in other website that use the "Printer Friendly" type of link. One example is Capital One credit card payment feature.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On any website that us a link to produce a "Printer Friendly" version.
2. Click "Printer Friendly" button and/or URL.
3.
Actual Results:
Browser print interface attempt to launch, but hang indefinitely. Waited for 10 minute for pizza hut order to print, but wa unable to get it to print. Tried the File/Print menu feature, still wouldn't print, but wa different.

Expected Results:
Printer Friendly version of website should have opened in a popup window, and printer driver dialog box should have opened.

I wa able to get a text only web page to print. Pizza Hut's order confirmation, and Capital One's payment confirmation are heavy on graphic and/or other medium content.
