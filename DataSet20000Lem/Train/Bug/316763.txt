I sign on to AOL via the web and try to listen to AOL radio (xm) it required a plugin (which I downloaded and installed) and I now get the error, "We're sorry, but we are unable to connect to the station you've selected. Please verify that you are connected to the internet, and check your firewall software to make sure it is not blocking radio" Before installing Firefox, I wa able to listen to AOL Radio on IE6. After installing, I cannot listen on either IE6 or Firefox. I contacted AOL and they were unable to help, suggesting I contact you to see why the installation would have caused this error. I have read that there are certain port that are blocked by default in firefox, maybe this is related?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log in to AOL
2.Go to XM radio and let the XM Radio Popup open and connect to radio
3.Try to listen to any station

Actual Results:
I get the error, "We're sorry, but we are unable to connect to the station you've selected. Please verify that you are connected to the internet, and check your firewall software to make sure it is not blocking radio"

Expected Results:
It should have just started playing the station I chose
