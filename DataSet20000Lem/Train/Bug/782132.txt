The page cache save the page content including textarea content and JavaScript state when navigating away from a page (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching). This page caching break (i.e. the page cache is invalidated for this page) when moving a dynamically created textarea before an already existing textarea.

Please open the the attached testcase and follow the instruction to replicate this bug:

1. Change content of original textarea
2. Click the Google link
3. Come back to the testcase page by using the left arrow button
4. The changed content of the original textarea is preserved, i.e. the page cache ha not been invalidated
5. Click the button to move the dynamically created textarea before the original textarea
6. Click the Google link and come back a before
7. The changed content of the original textarea is not preserved, i.e. the page cache ha been invalidated

This is a major problem for rich text editor such a the Wikipedia editor wikEd because edits get lost when navigating away from the editing page.
