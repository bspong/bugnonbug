This is not so much a bug a a wish list item. When, for example, changing user
setting or sorting of bookmark siblings, it would greatly enhance the
functionality of Firefox if there were a method to quickly revert to the
previous state. I suppose you could say I should be more careful. I can only
respond that everyone make mistakes. It would, also, with regard to bookmarks,
be nice to be able to sort the bookmark within a folder by right clicking on
the folder and sorting by the criterion wanted, and reserve sibling sorting to
right clicking between folder or book mark or both.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I accidently sorted the bookmark bar folder and bookmark instead of sorting
within the folder over which I right clicked the menu.
2. I have to rectify the mistake by painstakingly moving the bookmark one by one.
3.

Actual Results:
The bookmark sorted properly but couldn't be automatically reverted to the
previous state.

Expected Results:
Permitted me to revert to the previous state.

It would be nice to be able to step back through some number of change and
revert them individually or in group to a previous state.
