This problem exists in Firefox 0.10 with Mozilla 1.7.3. It did not exists in the
previous version of Firefox that I used (I think it wa 0.09 with Mizilla 1.6.8.)

Since Firefox doe not contain a composer, when you set Firefax a the default
browser it doe not list Edit (to edit HTMP pages) a a menu item in Windows
Explorer's. So I created one and set Mozilla in composer mode a the application
for this menu item. I also created "Edit with Netscape" a another menu item
with the corresponding Netscape's composer a the application.

Some time later I changed the default browser to Mozilla. The two editing menu
item were present and usable following this change.

When I reset Firefox a the default browser both menu item for editing HTML
page were removed.

such a "Edit" or "Edit with Mozilla" or "EDit with netscape" are present and
functional.

3. Set the default browser to Firefox.

3.1. Verify that the editing action on right click are gone.

Actual Results:

menu.
