Legitimate ebay customer who use Mozilla FireFox are unable to log in with
there user ID. The above message block Mozilla FireFox user from entering. I
am an ebay buyer/seller and can only log on by using Internet Explorer. I have
been using Mozilla FireFox for over a year buying and selling on ebay for over a
year and am very frustrated that I cannot access ebay any longer via Mozilla
FireFox a I much prefer Mozilla FireFox over any other browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://www.ebay.com/
2.click on my ebay to log on
3.one of two error message will keep reappearing and you cannot log in

Actual Results:
denied access to log into ebay account

Expected Results:
log into my ebay account a I have using Mozilla Firefox for the last year now

The only additional information is that I don't see how eBay can force user to
use Internet Explorer or Netscape and that the user doe not have a choice to
use the browser Mozilla FireFox if they want to.
