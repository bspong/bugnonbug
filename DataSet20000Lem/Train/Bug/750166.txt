Steps to reproduce:

I have a clean install of Firefox.

I listed the case by clicking on "Responses & Statistics" item on the "Responses" menu of LimeSurvey Version 1.92+ Build 120405. Then clicked "Display Responses" button on the menu (of the new page).


Actual results:

It list the cases. There are many case default is 50. But it doe not scroll.

Page Up/Page Down button do not work. Arrow key do not work. F7 show the cursor and cursor go down with the arrow key. But screen is still. The interactive stuff on the visible part like drop down box etc. work. But I can not go down. There is no scroll bar at the right but there is one at the bottom. I can go left and right. But can not go up/down.

I can see the remaining data in the source file. But when I "inspect 3D", it show a if there is nothing in the unseen (bottom) part of the page.

Interestingly, I can zoom the screen by the touchpad. After that, I can see the remaining case (lines of data like in spreadsheet) and rest of the page normal but of course character are very small in this resolution. On the other hand, when I resize back, problem persists.


Expected results:

It should have let me scroll.
