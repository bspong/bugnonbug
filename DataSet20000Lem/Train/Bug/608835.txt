A security and stability update for Firefox 3.6.12 cannot be applied because the licence file cannot be found.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.2b4) Gecko/20091124 Firefox/3.6b4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9.2b4) Gecko/20091124 Firefox/3.6b4

Every time that I open Mozilla Firefox a software update window pop up telling me of said update and that it is strongly recommended that I update. And yet it can never find the appropriate licence file. It wa the same with Firefox 3.6.12. I reported that one, too, and a yet have still not had any useful suggestion presented to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Update window open before internet start page
3. Click "update firefox"
4. Get told "licence file could not be found, go to Firefox homepage for more
information"
5. Meanwhile internet is allowing me to browse and stream without issue
Actual Results:
One is not presented with an obvious solution when one go to the homepage for the "more information" that is said to be held there, which is why one is taking the trouble to write all this

Expected Results:
Nothing. I am still awaiting answer from the previous version of this problem.

Found the licence and updated itself!
