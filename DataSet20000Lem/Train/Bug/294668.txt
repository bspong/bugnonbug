Clicking on a link from a Web site doe not always work; I often get no response at all.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.7.8

Response from a link is totally unreliable. For example, I may have gotten to a
NYTimes article by clicking on a link in an e-mail, but then get no response if
I click on "E-mail this." Or I can get almost all the way through a Buy.com
order (since the link _do_ work sometimes!) and then be unable to activate the
"Checkout" button. I have had to copy the address from the address bar and
paste it into Internet Explorer in order to continue. Since this works, it is
not the site that is at fault. This problem started when I updated Foxfire with
the latest build--1.7.8, although loading Web page wa getting increasingly
slow with the previous version.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Web site
2. Click on some kind of link on the page, a on a picture when shopping.
3. Keep clicking.

Actual Results:
Nothing. I am stuck where I am.

Expected Results:
Get to the next step; go somewhere; get me to the site on time.
