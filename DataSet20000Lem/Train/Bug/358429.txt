Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

To reproduce:
- Open a web page that automatically refreshes in Tab #1
- Open a second website in Tab #2
- In Tab #2 begin to enter text into a form field (tested on multi-line and single line text form fields)
- User doe NOT navigate outside of that text field in Tab #2

When the auto-refresh process occurs in Tab #1 the focus in the text field in Tab #2 is lost, requiring the user to use their mouse to put the cursor back into the text field they were working in. I experienced this a few time just filling out this form field a website I have open in other tab auto-refresh their data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a web page that automatically refreshes in Tab #1
2.Open a second website in Tab #2
3.In Tab #2 begin to enter text into a form field (tested on multi-line and single line text form fields)
4.Do NOT navigate outside of that text field in Tab #2



Expected Results:
The text field remains the focus and I can continue to type in it without interference. It's highly irritating to work around.
