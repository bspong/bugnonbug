Steps to reproduce:

Using 25.0a1 (2013-07-02)

1. Unizip the attached zip to a standard apache http server public folder
2. Open the debugger and check the Show original source in the debugger's configuration menu
2. With the browser navigate to http://localhost/~{$user}/path/to/dev-tools-tests5/
3. Everything is working a expected. The .ts file is displayed in the source list etc.
4. Rename the file dev-tools-tests5/ts/Greeter.ts to dev-tools-tests5/ts/Greeter2.ts
5. Recompile tsc ts/* --sourcemap --out ./all.js
6. Refresh the test case

If you do not have the TypeScript compiler at hand I guess you can:

4. Rename the file dev-tools-tests5/ts/Greeter.ts to dev-tools-tests5/ts/Greeter2.ts
5. Manually manipulate the source property in all.js.map

I guess this also applies to eg. Coffee Script




Actual results:

After the renaming and re-compiling, the debugger try to load ts/Greeter.ts resulting with a 404 response in the source code view


Expected results:

The debugger should have loaded ts/Greeter2.ts
