Fix source note for lazy script
Copy paste from IRC because I'm too lazy to paraphrase:

04:53 < shu> past: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/server/actors/script.js#l1373 should be innermost: true
04:53 < shu> past: this ha never surfaced because the full gc every debug mode toggle ha been concealing it
04:54 < shu> past: but if you look at http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/debugger/test/code_script-switching-02.js
04:54 < shu> past: there are 4 (!) script in that file
04:54 < shu> past: the top-level script, the script for secondCall, the script for eval, and the script for foo
04:55 < shu> past: the test request a breakpoint at line 4
04:55 < shu> past: it so happens the top-level script's bytecode consists of a sole JSOP_RETRVAL, which source note say is at line 4
04:55 < shu> past: before my patch to get rid of the massive GC, this top script just got swept by that GC and so didn't get iterated over
04:56 < past> shu: I think we didn't want the innermost script on purpose at that point, but I can't remember why at the moment
04:56 < past> shu: could it be that the test is wrong, but not the code?
04:57 < shu> past: possible, but i can't imagine the usefulness of setting a breakpoint at the retrval of the toplevel script
04:58 < past> shu: yes, I don't think line 4 is particularly important here
04:58 < past> line 5 would be sufficient, too
04:59 < shu> past: setting a breakpoint at the line of the fundef is a very real use case though
04:59 < past> that's true
04:59 < shu> past: intuitively we would break at the first pc of the function
