In the creation and testing of a internal website of my company. I have noticed
that firefox is not handling session variable correctly. In adding the first
item to a cart the session variable are correct if i add an additional instance
of that same item the amount go up by 2 not just one. If I then add a
diferent object to the list it add one instance of the item that wa add right
before and one of the item it should. Again if I add another instance of that
same item it go back to adding two instance instead of one. I have check
this application in both IE6 & NN7.1 and they both acted correctly. I am using
a coldfusion mx 6.1 server.
