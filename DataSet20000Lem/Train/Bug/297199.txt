All internet related operation with latest version of Firefox 1.04 have become deathly slow.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

From the time I installed the upgrade to 1.04, my entire internet experience
with Firefox ha become very slow, begining when Firefox is simply starting up.
This wa not the case with previous version of Firefox.

It seems that from that same day, other internet related operations, such a my
MS-Outlook Email have also become much slower.

Are there MS-Windows internet-related component that were changed in the
Firefox 1.04 upgrade??

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox 1.04 in Win-98
2.Wait, Wait, Wait
3.Finally get Firefox up;
4. Change/Select a url, wait, wait

Actual Results:
Results happen, eventually, without a bomb, but very, very slowly

Expected Results:
Respond faster. Have switched back to old MS-IE Explorer and it doe not have
the wait time that the new Firefox has.

It is almost a if my Win-98 environment ha been changed by the Firefox 1.04
upgrade; and changed in a way that everything run slower.
