Intermittantly, when using cmd-tab to switch apps (or when an app steal focus), and the app now focused is on a different "Space" from Firefox, hovering the mouse at the location on the screen where the tab bar would be show the tooltip of the tab which would be under the mouse.

I.e. if iTunes on "space 3" steal focus from Firefox on "space 1", and I move my mouse to the "play" button, but that's the physical place on the screen where Firefox's tab bar was, I get the tooltip "Slashdot - News for Nerds" showing up a if it were a tooltip for the iTunes play button.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have some tab open
2. Switch apps with cmd-tab to another space
3. Move the mouse to where the tab bar physically showed
Actual Results:
Tooltip with tab name show up

Expected Results:
Firefox would in no way be the frontmost app, nor respond to mouse or keyboard.

This is a holdover from Firefox 2 - I've seen it there and wa surprised to see it in FF3
