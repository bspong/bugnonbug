My Bookmark Toolbar Folder contains a lot of different bookmarks.
If I open a new window, the new window inizializes with empty Bookmark Toolbar and doe not navigate to any URL.
If I move the majority of my Bookmark Toolbar Folder bookmark to the normal bookmarks, a newly opened window will be perfectly working.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Populate the Bookmark Toolbar Folder with a huge number of bookmark (around 60, also counting a RSS feed of "America Votes 2008" from the CNN website) (http://rss.cnn.com/services/podcasting/raceto08/rss.xml)

2. Open a new window with File -> New Window

Actual Results:
the newly opened window will open up with nothing on the Bookmark Toolbar and will not navigate to any site , i.e. no URL will work.

Expected Results:
the newly opened window should work like the parent one.

If I move most of my Bookmark Toolbar folder bookmark to the normal bookmark manager, the newly opened window are working.
