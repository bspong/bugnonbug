This bug is inconsitent. I've been able to reproduce it many times, but not always. Seems to appear after a while, after deleting several bookmark from the yellow icon in location bar.

Deleting bookmark from the yellow icon in chrome with extension such a Brief reproduces the same bug.


Deleting bookmark the bookmark sidebar doesn't reproduce the bug.
