mozilla.org build of firefox.

Go to
http://comment.independent.co.uk/letters/
and click on a link to a letter page. They start

Letters:.....

The user interface then freeze for 15 second before the page come up.
The effect is particularly easy to see when using tab since the
"loading tab" animation freeze too after about 5 seconds.

I am reporting this on a G3 powerbook using a cable modem,
but the same thing occurs
to me on Linux too (Suse rpm build from ftp.suse.com) on a high end
biprocessor, 64 bit xeon- Thus it seems to be a more general than just mac o x.
Despite the great difference in performance of the machine the freeze
is still about 15 seconds. "Top" doe /not/ show firefox using large
amount of CPU.

This is a major UK web site which is very difficult to navigate with
firefox.

Cross checking with Safari (to see that network is OK) lead to
rapid loading of page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://comment.independent.co.uk/letters/

2. Click on a "Letters:..." link

3. Try to switch tab or open a menu

Actual Results:
Browser freeze 15 second every time

Expected Results:
Link should open rapidly

I see this on very high level linux workstations,
a well a under mac os. (Suse 10)
