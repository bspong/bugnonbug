Firefox Linux nightlies starting May 11 crash on startup on Red Hat Linux 8.0
STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1) rm -r ~/.firefox; rm -r ~/.mozilla/firefox
2) Download any nightly Firefox Linux .tar.gz from 2005-05-11-11 or later.
3) Untar it in /tmp
4) /tmp/firefox/firefox

EXPECTED RESULTS: Firefox window appers

ACTUAL RESULTS:

(Gecko:9162): Gdk-WARNING **: gdkdrawable-x11.c:787 drawable is not a pixmap or
window
/tmp/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 423: 9162 Segmentation fault (core
dumped) "$prog" ${1+"$@"}

Sometimes a window with a title of "Wizard title" will be left behind when this
happens.

Sometimes I get talkback to come up. Incident sent in through that:

(ccing pavlov based on that stack).

NOTES: This doe NOT occur with build from 2005-05-10-11 or earlier. I can't
reproduce this problem with seamonkey build (GTK1 or GTK2). I can't reproduce
the problem with my local debug Firefox build either.

Bonsai query for the regression range (plus a few hour in each direction):

http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=all&branch=HEAD&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=2&date=explicit&mindate=2005-05-10+08%3A00%3A00&maxdate=2005-05-11+14%3A00%3A00&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot

I see no obvious checkins in that range that would cause this. Was there some
sort of build config change for nightlies?
