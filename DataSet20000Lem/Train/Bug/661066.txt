For a while after starting up Firefox, CPU usage is normal. But after about a minute of browsing (or idle time) with several tab open (e.g. Gmail, Google Calendar) CPU shoot to 100% and never come down even after several hour (or days) of idle time. Logging off requires a Force Quit a Firefox won't exit normally. Normal browsing is not affected by the high cpu use but other program sometimes are.

I've also noticed that during these period of high CPU use the location bar doe not return any results, but immediately after startup the location bar work properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Browse/idle a few minute
3. Watch activity monitor / top

Actual Results:
CPU use go to 100% and stay there

Expected Results:
CPU use should probably come down at some point

I am on an older 10.4-era white iMac. This doe not occur on the newer 10.5-era iMacs that I've tested on with the same profile.
