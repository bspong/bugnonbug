Bad AppleScript "get version" output: "<unknown>"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-US) AppleWebKit/125.4 (KHTML, like Gecko, Safari) OmniWeb/v563.66
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

No AppleScript version, or some goofy number

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Launch app
Script Editor: run this AppleScript:

tell application "Firefox" to get version
Actual Results:
tell application "Firefox"
get version
current application
get version
"<unknown>"
end tell

tell application "Firefox"
get version
"9.0 r28" -- expected: 2.0.0.1
end tell

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

Also:
tell application "Firefox"
get version
"<unknown>" -- expected: 1.5.0.3
end tell

Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.3) Gecko/20060426 Firefox/1.5.0.3

Expected Results:
Actual version is returned

I feel that version info from AppleScript is quite helpful for bug reporting, even for apps that don't (or hardly) support AppleScript, e.g. when combined with GUI scripting. Example:

tell application "Firefox"
get version
activate
tell application "System Events"
tell process "Firefox"
keystroke "," using command down -- open prefs
delay 1
keystroke "w" using command down -- close prefs
end tell
end tell
end tell
