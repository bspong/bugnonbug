Combination firefox+ebay+proxy try to download dll file
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

Recently I made the proxy server from my provider (proxy.arnhem.chello.nl) active for both Firefox and Internet Explorer.
Proxy Server IP address: 212.142.33.100.
On both our PCs we noticed only for the ebay.nl site a difference. Some how Firefox download manager try to download DLL file like eBayISAPI.dll. The site cannot be visited. It doe not happen when I use Internet Explorer (what I don't want) to visit eBay.
As mentioned when I remove the proxy in the setting everything go well. And I did not notice it when I visited non-eBay sites.
I realize that this is not necessarily a firefox bug, the error can also be in the ebay page a in the chello proxy server (but: see below). But it ha to be reported somewhere.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.activate proxy (maybe problem if error is located there)
2.visit ebay site and login
3.click My eBay


Actual Results:
download manager pops-up with file eBayISAPI.dll

Expected Results:
Display My ebay

When I remove the proxy setting from Firefox everything go well. For Internet Exporer with the proxy server set visiting eBay go well. I tested that I really use the proxy; either Firefox and Internet Exporer report an proxy server when I use internet site to detect my IP_address. This must exclude the proxy server from being the cause of the problem.
