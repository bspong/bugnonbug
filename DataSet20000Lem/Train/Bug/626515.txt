firefox crash - both on main pc and now on laptop. in fact no having to retype this bug a the original ha frozen within firefox! having to use the laptop a frequent firefox crash have corrupted user profile on main pc. doe not seem to be affected by the number of tab or length of time browser ha been open. this problem seems to have developed recently (since the New Year).

after opening at least one tab, when trying to open another - especially if it is a pop up from a previously open tab - then firefox struggle to do this quickly, eventually freeze and either crash or fails to unfreeze therefore requiring closure via task manager.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. try to open multiple tab
3. firefox freeze requiring close down


Expected Results:
opened the tab without freezing

usually when a number of tab have been opened and therefore information is being accessed or input - freezing is therefore occurring at critical and annoying point in use
