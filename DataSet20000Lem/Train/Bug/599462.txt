I'm Using Firefox 3.6.10 on Windows 7 x64 Ultimate. I am trying to save file to a remote Windows 2008 R2 x64 Server File Share. On larger file a few MB... For example i downloaded the June DirectX SDK ( http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/E/7/AE743F1F-632B-4809-87A9-AA1BB3458E31/DXSDK_Jun10.exe ) and not only wa the file cut off (missing almost 1MB) it wa also corrupt (different to valid local download) after 2.81 MB. I know the local download wa OK since the signature wa verified (file is signed by Microsoft). I know this is not a problem with the share because i then copied a ~5GB ISO File that i had a SH256 Hash of to that share and the hash matched when verified there. To make absolutely certain that it wa not a problem from either my computer, the server, or the download provider, i created my own little VB.Net Console download client that downloads and save directly to the remote server destination in 4kb chunk and it worked perfectly!

I first posted this at:

But didn't get any help :(

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pick any large download (>15MB)
2. Directly Save to a File Share on a Remote Window Server
3.
Actual Results:
File is corrupt / truncated. Firefox act a if download finished normally (no error / warning)

Expected Results:
File to be ok. Save locally or saved to remote share via direct download by self made client work flawlessly (also tried IE and it worked, but IE save file locally and then move them to the destination when finished, so can't be used to compare)

Using the following code i get a perfectly working download:
Sub Main()
Try
Dim oRequest As Net.HttpWebRequest = Net.HttpWebRequest.Create("http://download.microsoft.com/download/A/E/7/AE743F1F-632B-4809-87A9-AA1BB3458E31/DXSDK_Jun10.exe")
Dim oResponse As Net.HttpWebResponse = oRequest.GetResponse
Dim oStream As IO.Stream = oResponse.GetResponseStream
Dim byData(4095) As Byte, iRead As Integer = oStream.Read(byData, 0, byData.Length)
Dim daInfo As Date = Now
Using oOut As New IO.FileStream("\\192.168.1.33\Data\Downloads\HTTP\DXSDK_Jun10_MyTest.exe", IO.FileMode.Create, IO.FileAccess.Write, IO.FileShare.Read)
While iRead > 0
oOut.Write(byData, 0, iRead) : oOut.Flush()
iRead = oStream.Read(byData, 0, byData.Length)
If Now.Subtract(daInfo).TotalSeconds > 10 Then
daInfo = Now
Console.WriteLine("Downloaded " & (oOut.Position / (1024.0 * 1024.0)).ToString("0.00") & " MB!")
End If
End While
End Using
Catch oEx As Exception
MsgBox(oEx.ToString)
End Try
End Sub

Using FireFox 3.6 to Save to that location horribly fails without ANY error on firefox even though the file is in even complete when firefox finish and the file is totally unusable after just a few MB of data. Switching to Chome and hoping this will get fixed soon.
