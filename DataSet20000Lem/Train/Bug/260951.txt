I've been meaning to report this for some time...
When you start up a Firefox trunk build and click on the Go menu, you don't see
any recently visited web pages, just the Back, Forward, Home and History items.
Close the menu and click on it again, and suddenly the list of page appears.

This only seems to affect trunk build from 20040810 (2004-08-10-15) onwards.
The 20040809 (2004-08-09-09) trunk build is fine. The Aviary branch is fine. I
can't reproduce in Seamonkey either.

I can reproduce in the latest nightly, with a fresh profile. I haven't tested it
in Windows yet, only Mac OS X.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Firefox trunk nightly
2.Click on the Go menu. Observe that no recent page are displayed.
3.Close the menu and click on Go again. Observe that recent page are now displayed.




I tried to use Bonsai to determine which patch checked in during that period
might be relevant, but nothing jumped out to my untrained eye. Plus I have no
idea how to make it bring up Firefox-only checkins or trunk-only checkins (is
this even possible?).
