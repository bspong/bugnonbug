Links that would open in new window can no longer be forced to open in the current tab (same tab) (except through hidden prefs)

In 1.5.0.4, a UI pref existed whereby the user could force [webpage link (within Firefox) that would open in new windows] to open in the current tab. Alpha 3 effectively remove this. In Alpha 3, the only relevant pref is the following:

| Open link that would open new window in:
| o new window
| o new tab in the most recent window

I feel this is a bad move, since, even though there is a benefit in reducing the number of UI prefs, the removed pref is an important one, to the extent that, IMO, it removal is not justified by the aforementioned benefit. I feel this pref should be reinstated.

I propose the following a a replacement:

| Open **webpage** link that would open new window in:
| o new window
| o new tab
| o the same tab a the link
|
| Open link **from other applications** that would open new window in:
| o new window
| o new tab in the most recent window

Reproducible: Always
