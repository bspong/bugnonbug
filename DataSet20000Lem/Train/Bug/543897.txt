Was experiencing bug 538160, so I tried to disable all add-on by loading FF 3.6 in safe mode and selecting the option of disabling them (did not solve the bug). After that, I wa unable to re-enable any of the add-on by clicking the corresponding button -- when I restart FF it's like I had never re-started it. The problem is there whether making a quick loading (selecting restart FF from the add-on menu panel) or first exiting, releasing+defragging free memory, and loading FF again.

Have not been able to check whether I can reproduce the problem since now my FF doesn't accept add-on (either new one or previosuly installed). Will have to either uninstall and reinstall all add-on or, worst yet, reinstall FF.

Happens with default theme
