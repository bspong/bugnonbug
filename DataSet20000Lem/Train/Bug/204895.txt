Phoenix crash directly on startup when it open over my xterm and I wa typing
something while it loaded. This doe not appear to happen if I wa only typing
letter and numbers, but if I type return or an arrow key right when the window
appears. The window then appears, think for a second or two, and then the
whole app crashes, taking down all of the icon from the web page in the
bookmark (which by the way I find _highly_ annoying and it deserves a bug
report in it's own right). This would not bother me if there wa a way to tell
Phoenix to start in the upper right corner, but Phoenix (bug three!) ignores
-geometry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start phoenix
2. keep pressing return or the arrow up key while it load so that the new
window (your window manager need to give it focus for this to work) receives
the event while phoenix is loading


Actual Results:
*boom* *crash* *burn*

Expected Results:
not crash and burn

I am using the default theme.

Please note that I cv updated my phoenix yesterday and rebuilt it a well. The
fact that the user agent string report a version from over a month ago is also
a bug in Phoenix (let's call it bug 4).
