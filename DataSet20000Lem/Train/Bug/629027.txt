Want ability to disable the Aero Glass effect

The chosen default UI (Strata, I believe) provides a glassy selection box on hover and select action to toolbar item (bookmarks, eg). With clear default window this no problem. I you add a Persona, particularly a dark background, this choice result in a very ugly white outline box and detracts visibly from the intent of a custom UI.
Many user are adept CSS stylers. Myself, I make heavy use of the userchrome.css and use opacity setting for hilite. I should be able to turn off this "UI glass feature". Instead I have to go through acrobatics.
Firefox main claim to FAME is customingabilitynessitude. Extensions, addons, etc. By choosing the default UI Firefox look and act like GChrome, at least on the surface. Whoopee! I want more. My solution is to stay with 6.13.
Similarly, the use of XPI extension make it much more inconvenient to modify and improve extension/add-ons. Most developer are unresponsive to suggestions. I can still do it but it ha become a real pain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Customization
2. Customization
3. and again Customization



A simple solution is a setting panel (think Objectdock).
Selection or hover effect might be glassy box (now) or glow or color.
And more important: tab hi-lighting, color and behavior. Again tab behavior!
The UI is YOUR domain. It is what every user look at, constantly, EVERYDAY!
In marketing term IT IS YOUR BRAND.
Take more control of these basic elements.
But make it easier for the community to customize.
If Firefox look like Chrome, act like IE, then it might a well be either.
Looks matter more than speed, encryption, ... to first adopters.
