I just downloaded Firefox 2.0 yesterday, onto the new PC I also acquired yesterday. When browsing Wikipedia (logged-in), I clicked "Watchlist," and up popped a message saying that "Special-Watchlist" wa an "application/octet-stream" and prompting me to save it. I clicked out of that, clicked Watchlist again, and this time it worked. A few minute later, I clicked the Wikipedia logo to go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page...same thing happened. This ha happened four time in the last 15 minute or so just clicking around Wikipedia (mainly to the main page and watchlist while trying to replicate this just now.). This never happened on Wikipedia before in the past year-plus of browsing it with Firefox 1.X on my old computer.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
See above. As I said, though, I had to click around a while to replicate what I suddenly noticed the first time it happened.



OS is "Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005," according to a sticker on it.
