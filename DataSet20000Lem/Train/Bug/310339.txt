onmouseout doe not fire consistently from a div embedded in another div with
a link (href) element. When the mouse is moved off of the embedded div
element containing a link, no mouseout may occur. This seems to happen at
random. Removing the link from within the div seems to alleviate the problem,
a doe having the mouseover event call something which refreshes the screen
graphic (such a writing to a form field).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Move mouse over the top div element
2.Move mouse over the second div element
3.Move mouse quickly off of the second div element. Generally to the left
recreates the bug more often.
4.Note that this may take a few try to get it to reoccur.

Actual Results:
The onmouseout event assigned to the second embedded div did not fire. This
may take a few try to get it to reoccur.

Expected Results:
The onmouseout event should fire consistently every time the mouse leaf the
second embedded div element, regardless of it content.
