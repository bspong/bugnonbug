If you have a XUL page which ha an iframe, and you set the src of that iframe to a XUL page that ha a
reference to a .css file that doesn't exist, the onload handler won't be called on the first visit to the XUL
page in the iframe. If you set the src of the iframe to that XUL page again, onload event will fire.

This ha the effect that if you use an iframe to diplay content in a XUL app, and that page ha a
missing .css file, the page "doesn't work" the first time you try to load it. Easy to fix the XUL, but probably
a real pain for the newbie to find.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Easy to reproduce, the "Details" section should get you there.

Actual Results:
First time you load a XUL page in an iframe, if there is a missing .css file, onload handler doesn't get
called.

Expected Results:
The function referenced in the onload= in the window element should work the first time the XUL page is
loaded in the iframe whether there is a missing .css file or not.
