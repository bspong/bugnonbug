Uploading a large file to MoinMoin such a a zip file of photo result in the computer using 100% CPU and eventually the posting of the "Unresponsive script" dialog. It is possible to implement a workaround with some size file by increasing the setting of max_script_run_time to be larger but there is always a filesize that will fail.

The browser becomes locked up for the duration of the upload. Hitting "Stop script" will unlock and return control. If you have waited long enough for the upload, your file will likely be complete in spite of the non-completion of the script. It appears that Firefox is using up the CPU for no benefit.

Uploading the same file using Internet Explorer work a expected and doesn't utilize 100% of the CPU.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a large zip file, say of photos.
2. Go to the attachment page of a MoinMoin wiki that allows large file uploads.
3. Attach the large file and observe the high cpu utilization and eventual "Unresponsive script" dialog.
Actual Results:
"Unresponsive script" dialog.

Expected Results:
Perform the upload and allow use of other Firefox window during the upload. For the window or tab that wa performing the upload, it should appear busy until done. The CPU utilization should be low.

I can make a private test wiki available by direct communication if needed.
