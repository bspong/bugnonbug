Standardize installer/tarball file names, and tinderbox build automation for localization
Followup to bug 254175 and discussion on npm.l10n, we need to

1) standardize the name of release package (tarballs and installers)

2) Set up build automation so that a tinderbox can show basic green/red for all
the locale in CVS, and produce nightly localized build

The part of this that need to go in the CVS tree (the makefile-fu) is pretty
simple. The part about setting up a tinderbox server shouldn't be hard, I
imagine... the only part that mystifies me is setting up the tinderbox client
(in post-mozilla.pl) to loop through a bunch of locale and send each one a a
separate tinderbox email pair.

Here's what the tinderbox client need to do:

After the regular tinderbox build is complete (in English), and the package are
staged, the tinderbox should loop through all the non-English locale dirs in
CVS, and do the following action (ab-CD is the locale):

send an "I'm starting the tinderbox "ab-CD"
"make -C browser/locales installers-ab-CD"
send an "I finished ab-CD (red/green with a log)

and hopefully stage the resultant langpack+tarball+installer to FTP (or at least
the nightly build machine should do this).
