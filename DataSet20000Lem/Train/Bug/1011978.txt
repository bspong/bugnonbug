Audit us of update-service for guard of MOZ_UPDATER define to avoid exception (which cause "you haven't started Firefox in a while" to show up on every new window because we re-run nsBrowserGlue's _onFirstWindowLoaded)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; FreeBSD i386; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140217071214

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox 27, installed on 2014-02-17, had been running for a couple of weeks, with ~ 20-30 open tabs. I think that all restarts for a year or two have been crash recoveries.


Actual results:

Every couple of hour or so, the status bar appears, containing the message: "It look like you haven't started Firefox in a while. Do you want to clean it up for a fresh, like-new experience? And by the way, welcome back!". In the lower right corner, there's a button labelled "Reset Firefox", and a close button. When I click the close button, sometimes the message immediately repeat for a couple of times, so I need to click the close button multiple time to get rid of the message (and the status bar) for a while.


Expected results:

The message should not appear at all.

The text "welcome back" is nonsense when Firefox ha been running all the time. Checks like this should only be done at Firefox launch, and accordingly, the message should only show up on Firefox launch. It should not repeat until next launch.

Moreover, the check should compare the current date with the latest termination date, no matter if normal of abnormal termination, not with (as it seems) the latest fresh session start date.
