When I navigate to a page any page the address bar stay blank or keep the same URL that I typed into it. While launching Firefox it doe not go to the home page and when clicking link or typing a new address nothing get added to the history a a result the navigation button do not work. Also the page say it is constantly loading.

Reproducible: Always

1. Start Firefox.
2. Navigate to any page and click link change address.
3.
Actual Results:
No browsing history, the navigation button do not change the text on the address bar doe not change.

Expected Results:
When starting it should go to the homepage. While running after typing a new address new entry should have been added to the browsing history and a such the navigation button (back button) should have been activated letting you go back. The URL in the address bar should have of changed a well.

I am using the default theme and have the web developer toolbar. The address and navigation worked before I tried to launch Firefox after playing a game(Falcon 4 : AF) and I got this.
