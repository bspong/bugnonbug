I'm in need of a script that would place "add this site to favorite with tags" button on html page

Hey there,

I'm sure you're all familiar with the "Add this site to your favorites" button that many website have.

Now came along Firefox 3 with this awesome functionality of bookmarking site along with tags.

I'm interested in placing such a "bookmark me" button on my webpage that would automatically add the page to the browser's favorites, but in addition, will bookmark it with a list of predefined tag -- so that when the user writes these tag in the location bar, my site would pop up a a possible suggestion.

For example, if I have a website that feature a real estate business, I want to have a "Add me to Firefox 3's favorites" button on the page itself, that when pressing it, will automatically bookmark that page with the tag "real estate", "buildings", and "house".

Is that possible? Can you develop a script that doe such a thing? And if the script can co-handle other browser a well that is even better.

THANKS A LOT!
