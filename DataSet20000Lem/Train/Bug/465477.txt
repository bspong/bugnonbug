For the past few year I have experienced memory leak in Firefox, that just seem to happen over a period of time surfing.

I have not really documented this, I have just learned to live with it, but when version 3x came out I thought there would be an end to this.

I can't give real specific on this, because it ha not been somethign I have really paid attention to, but I do know for a fact that for the past few year I have had problem with FF locking up and crashing and running at 250MB-300MB.

I have had this happen on three differnt OSs too, BSD, Linux and XP...

XP is all I'm concerned with right now.

All I can say is sooner or later after just some basic surfing, FF just act up, the memory just build over time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf browser with one tab open
2. Java and Flash installed (extensions or addons)
3. Flash and streaming medium seems to effect FF at times, also when opening up another Window of FF then closing it.
Actual Results:
Firefox will run at over 200MB

Expected Results:
Firefox to run at or lower then 100MB
