I am still experiecing this issue. This problem just started for one of our
user about 2-3 week ago according to them. Unfortunately the error is
occuring on a secured site so I cannot give anyone access to it. I verified
this problem and IE7 work fine.

I am using 2.0.0.13 (latest downloadable version) on Windows XP. I attatched a
screenshot just in case that help at all. Since I can't give access to anyone
here, please let me know what information or step I can provide to help fix
the problem.

There is a javascript popup that is opened when a button is clicked on. This window ha a form. Once the user submits the form the window close and a value is passed back to the parent window. Shortly after this (seconds) this problem pop up. This system ha been running for a few year now and this problem just started happening.
