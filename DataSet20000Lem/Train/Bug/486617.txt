Running 'lsof -i' (for a reason unrelated to Ff), I noticed this:
firefox 19988 dle 68u IPv4 6322728 TCP bigstory.local:54194->www163.sedoparking.com:www (ESTABLISHED)

I am not familiar at all with sedoparking.com -- have never visited it.

Since the lsof line looked unusual, I tried browsing www163.sedoparking.com. Firefox responded thus: http://bigstory.homelinux.org/tmp/sedoparking.png This wa reproducible: it happened every time I entered the URL in the URL bar, or dropped it onto the browser window.

I then used the Ff's search bar (with Google), thinking I could see if it wa a known issue. But Ff again responded a above.

When I killed Ff and restarted it, the connection and the problem no longer existed.

Reproducible: Didn't try
