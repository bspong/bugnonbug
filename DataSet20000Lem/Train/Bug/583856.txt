Firefox appears to overheat (the laptop it's running on), slow down, and eventually crash when one or more webpage with non-valid code are open. it would appear that the processing and storage of error filled code is badly handled by firefox, a the longer a bad page is open, more and more RAM and CPU is used by the firefox, eventually causing the program to slow down to a crawl, and if left long enough crash the program entirely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page with invalid code
2. Wait
3. Try to open a new tab
Actual Results:
firefox is running so slowly that open the new tab take a very long time, and over all responsiveness of the computer is diminished

Expected Results:
the tab should open a it would if the error page had not been left open (open quickly and lag free)

i do not recall the bug occurring before firefox 3.6.3 but even downgrading now seems to give the same result on most versions. the laptop's that i can reproduce the bug on have ample resource and can open the same page in other browsers, such a google chrome, without such a bug occurring at all. i have also tested using Windows 7 Vista and Ubuntu all of which give the same results.
