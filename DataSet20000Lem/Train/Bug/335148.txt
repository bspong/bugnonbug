I have created link and folder on my Bookmarks Toolbar. These folder contain subfolders with link and folders. I can drag a Bookmark within a folder to another position in the list of Bookmarks and folders. For example,
Bookmarks Toolbar ha the following items:

NYT (link) Lookup (folder) WP (link) Steps (link) Home (folder)

The Lookup folder contains the following item in the orger shown below:
Myweb.com (Link)
Yourweb.com (Link)
Street (Folder)
USA.com (Link)
Canada (Folder)
MeetMe.com (Link)

I can drag the Link Meetme.com to any position on the pull down bookmark list.

I cannot drag the Folder Street to a different position on the pull down bookmark list.

I can drag elements(folders or links) within folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar using that other browser.

I think Firefox is the best browser that I have ever used.

Thanks for a the effort of of the volunteer who have vreated this very fine product.
