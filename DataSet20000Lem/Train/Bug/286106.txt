When using javascript to generate a large number of child dom node dynamically
(I encountered this error using divs, and have not tested it with other node
types) After generating a large number of node (15+ in my experience) The
browser would hang if I attempted to apply the CSS attribute display: hidden.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a script to generate a large number of dom node in response to user
input, and make each generated node a child of previous nodes.
2. After generating a large number of nodes, attempt to set the hidden CSS
display attribute on the parent node, or one of the earlier node in the tree

Actual Results:
Firefox hung. I did not wait longer than a minute or two to see if it would come
back out of it.

Expected Results:
The software should have simply hidden the affected element, and any child of it.
