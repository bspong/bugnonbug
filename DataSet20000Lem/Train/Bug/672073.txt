Firefox update
While using Firefox 4.1 stable on openSUSE 11.4 or SLED/SLES 11 the browser automatically update to Firefox 5. We have never had anything happen automatically on Linux before!
What should have happened? A notice that an update wa available, only.
Without special attention to Preferences and add-on this event is repeatable.
Reinstalling Firefox 4.0 isn't much of an option, since all bookmarks, password and plugins are lost.
The new Firefox 5 come with a new batch of current plugins. Bookmarks may be re-installed from a *json file saved. Passwords must be re-entered manually.
Firefox 4.1 stable with 5 security plugins, automatically force update to Firefox 5.0 from a user account!
The Mozilla browser is installed in a separate partition, root, which never access the Internet. The root-account ha it's own unique passwords. How doe Mozilla succeed in 'hacking' a Linux machine?!
We consider this a SECURITY BREACH, not because of Firefox 5 which is an improvement over Firefox 4; but because this code or method could be used by evil-doers to "upgrade" a Firefox browser to some rogue version that convert your computer(s) into a zombie spammer or one that relay everything you do to evil-doers. (credit card numbers, on-line banking details, medical subscriptions, confidential employer communications).
