Build Identifier: pdf add on -

I have used the post office for print & click. I Tools- Add ons, Extensions, after I installed the pdf add/on 2.2.0.2"allows you to choose what to do with a pdf file....: that said it would give you the option of how to open pdfs, it removed the .labelgenerationservlet ending, and the resulting file wa corrupted. All other choices: open, download, etc... did NOT work. I spent HOURS trying to figure out what wa wrong - and only by disabling this pdf add/on could I actually open the file again. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND ENERGY!!
