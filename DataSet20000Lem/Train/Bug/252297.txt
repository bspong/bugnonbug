This site (http://www.abrasivemedia.org/kosovoa) is entirely in Flash and is set
to fill 100% of the width and height of the page without scaling. This site
us a 1px jpeg to dynamicly change the amount of scrollable space in the HTML.
However, Firefox doe not reverl any scrollable content unless you reseize the
window. Click the Links button on the site to see what I mean.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.abrasivemedia.org/kosovoa
2. Click the Links button.
3. Scroll down .... it all blank (you should see content here).

Actual Results:
When you scroll down, anything below the bottom of the window doe not appear.

Expected Results:
The content should be viewable. Check the site in Internet Explorer, you'll see.

The image is resized with javascript. This resize method is compliant with
Mozilla. So I'm left to believe this issue may have to deal with Firefox's
handeling of ActiveX element such a Flash.
