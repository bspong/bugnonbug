Some tab-related extension never work, because internal box of tab and the stack for extra tab icon are lost by the patch of Bug 387345.

In Firefox 2, we extension author can extend tab with no/less conflict, because there is internal anonymous box defined by XBL. Moreover, there is a place holder (image.tab-extra-status) which is not used by Firefox default, like:

<xul:stack class="tab-icon">
<xul:image xbl:inherits="validate,src=image" class="tab-icon-image"/>
<xul:image class="tab-extra-status"/>
</xul:stack>

But, by the patch of Bug 387345, they died. This change break Firefox's extendability seriously. Now, to insert extra item to each <tab>, now we extension author MUST use custom binding for <tab>s. However, if multiple extension provide different binding for <tab>s, they will conflict, so we user cannot combine favorite tab-related extension anymore.

If you recommend Firefox because it ha powerful extendability, you shouldn't carelessly make change like this.


Reproducible: Always
