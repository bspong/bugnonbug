"All Bookmarks" doesn't show all bookmarks; left view is not multi-level
From the Library, click "All Bookmarks" in the left treeview.

Actual results:
The right treeview is now restricted to a similar bird's eye view of the bookmark a appears in the left pane.

In fact, the right treeview--the one that's presumably supposed to show great detail--displays an even more restricted view than the left one, because there you can expand, e.g., the Bookmarks Menu to give a rough view of the folder hierarchy therein. As much a my testing shows, when "All Bookmarks" is selected in the left treeview, the right one will only ever show the following items:

*Bookmarks Toolbar
*Bookmarks Menu
*Unsorted Bookmarks

Ever.

Expected results:
Clicking on an "All Bookmarks" item should show a multi-level, expanded-by-default, uncloseable (i.e., no toggleOpenState) treeview with all bookmarks--tagged ("unsorted"), those in the bookmark menu, and those in the toolbar. This would be similar to the Bookmarks Sidebar, but automatically expanded and uncollapsible.

Suggested solution:
Rename "All Bookmarks" to "Bookmarks" (cf. "History" item in left treeview) to eliminate the expectation that result from this misnomer.

Perhaps a more fitting solution would to do rename the item, but also make it behave a outlined in the expected results, because that kind of behavior is genuinely useful. A view that will only show fewer item than it's supposedly le powerful counterpart is not.

This apparently derives from the decision to make the right treeview flat rather than multi-level. If the rationale is something other than ambivalence about how to do sorting on tree column when a container is closed, I'd be interested to hear it.
