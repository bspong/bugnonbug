I use a Logitech 310 MX mouse, there are two special button configured a going
back and going forward in the site navigation.
1.0.4 wa correct, 1.0.6 have changed the functions. Now the back button on the
mouse cause a forward and the forward button cause a back. It would be no
problem to reconfigure the mouse but unfortunately everything else, other
browser, the OS still use back a back and forward a forward.
Firefox Build 1.0.6 seemed to changed the handle for the buttons/functions

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Going onto a site than to another
2.Using back mousebutton ha no effect, using forward mousebutton cause a back
reaction and pressing back mousebutton cause a forward
3.This problem occurs only at 1.0.6 else nowhere

Actual Results:
Pressing back mousebutton caused a forward reaction
Pressing forward mousebutton caused a back reaction

Expected Results:
Pressing back mousebutton should cause a back reaction
Pressing forward mousebutton should cause a forward reaction
