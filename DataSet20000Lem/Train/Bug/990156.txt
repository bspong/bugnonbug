Memory Report Preceding the Crash

This bug wa filed from the Socorro interface and is
report bp-cb2aad25-076a-48d5-8fd5-2ccdc2140331.
=============================================================

The Story...
I'd been getting crash which were frequently preceded by black drawing on the UI. I looked into about:crashes which led me to bp-cb917cc6-e1a2-4cda-ad70-5aa762140325 and bug 805406.
Was instructed to save a memory report when thing started going south.
I did so, but my next crash led me to bp-5cb8e782-9804-432b-acac-132df2140329 and bug 988619 (where I uploaded the memory report).

This most recent crash had no bug associated with it, so here we are.
Things got real hinky yesterday with freezing/unresponsiveness. When prompted to kill Flash I did and thing surprisingly got normal. Here is the hang report from then: hr-20140331-4fa83795-57d0-4080-8b25-f45639e8e8cf

It finally crashed today and I got a memory report 20-30 minute prior.

I'm attaching my memory report, so don't judge my porn fetish (kidding!). I am a heavy tab user, however most of them are unloaded/unrestored.

P.S. I noticed no black drawing on the UI preceding this most recent crash.
