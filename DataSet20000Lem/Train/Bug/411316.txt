In IE, the table render appropriately. In FireFox, the border to the right side, between the 4 text box and the right image, doesn't appear.

If you mouse-drag select that portion of the page, the line will appear. If the table is copied to a second page, where you can scroll it out of sight and back, it will then render the line "somewhat" correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use the URL provided.
2. note the "missing" line between center text and right image in lower part of screen.
3. mouse-drag select the portion of the screen and notice the line appear.
Actual Results:
line that should show in the first place "appear" -- mostly.

Expected Results:
It should render the table correctly in the first place.

The site a wiki so you can copy the code and test it elsewhere to see what happens. IE work fine with the table (I've seen the reverse of that so no big).

No idea what 'severity' it should have so leaving "normal" -- it's an HTML/JavaScript/CSS type issue so that'd be up to you to figure out severity.
