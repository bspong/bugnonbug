browser.tabs.closeButtons is missing an option OR tab-width size should aggregately fill up the entire tab bar

I like having close button on individual tabs, AND I like having a "Close Selected Tab" button the right side.

When my cursor is closer to an individual tab, I like to close it with the close button that is on that tab, but when I have 5 consecutive tab open, that I want to close quickly, I like clicking on the general "Close Selected Tab" button multiple time in row to close those tabs, because I don't have to move the mouse at all knowing confidently that the right-most close tab is in a stationary place.

Ideally, this wouldn't be a problem if tab-widths would resize to aggregately fill up the entire tab bar, because if this were the case, the right-most tab's close button would always be in exactly the same location. I think Eclipse IDE implement tab in this way I'm mentioning, therefore eliminating the general close tab button main usefulness (closing consecutive tab quickly with a stationary the mouse).

Alternatively, you could add additional option to browser.tabs.closeButtons property so that it allows both individual and general close-tab buttons.

Reproducible: Always
