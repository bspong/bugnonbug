It appears to me, that switchting tab doe not always trigger the window.onblur event on the tab you are moving away from. At first I thought this happened only when switching to 'older' tab (which were opened before opening the one you are moving away from), but after some more testing I see that that doesn't always count. But maybe mentioning this is pointing in the right direction anyway.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple HTML file with the following contents:
-----------
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
<title>Test</title>
<script type="text/javascript">
window.onblur = function(){blurWindow()}
window.onfocus = function(){unblurWindow()}
function unblurWindow(){
document.getElementById("blurstatus").innerHTML = "focussed";
document.title = "focussed";
}
function blurWindow(){
document.getElementById("blurstatus").innerHTML = "blurred";
document.title = "blurred";
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<span id="blurstatus">Testing</span>
</body>
</html>
-----------

2. open up some tab in Firefox (be sure to load some website in them a I appear to be inable to reproduce this bug with empty tabs),
3. then open the HTML file you just created,
4. open up some more tab with websites,
5. randomly jump between the test page and the other tabs, keeping an eye on the test page's tab title.
Actual Results:
For me, the title of the test tab stay 'focussed' when switching to some tab and change to 'blurred' (as it should) for the others. The result appear to remain the same for each tab, but only a long a you don't change their pages. Browsing around a bit can sometimes change the result you get by swithcing to that particular tab.

Expected Results:
You'd expect the title of the testing tab to be 'focussed' when it is the active tab (AND the Firefox window is the active window, of course), and 'blurred' in all other cases.

Tested with the same result on a laptop and a PC, both Windows XP Home (Dutch) SP3, running Firefox 3.0.10 (pc) and 3.0.11 (laptop) in Dutch.
