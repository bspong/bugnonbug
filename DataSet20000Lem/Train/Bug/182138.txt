Give a way to browse back to the previous site (like Opera's rewind), not only to the previous page

Very often after exploring a site for some time (bugzilla for example) I'd like
to be able to return to the site I wa just browsing before entering bugzilla.
If I use the drop-down on the back arrow, the previous site is often not
appearing, because I've looked to too many bugs...
Thus what about a 'back site' arrow (it may be implemented by returning in the
history to the first site with a different domain name), whose UI maybe either a
small additional sub-icon on the back-arrow icon, or, the effect of a right
click on the arrow (currently doe nothing), or maybe, also I feel it is much
le useful, a modifier during click.
What do you think?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse many page on the same domain
2. Click the back arrow
3.

Actual Results:
you return to the previous page

Expected Results:
With a proper modifier, I would like him to return to the previous website (not
webpage)
