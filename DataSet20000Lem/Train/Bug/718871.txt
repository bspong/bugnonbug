Screenshot of corrupt flash display

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:12.0a1) Gecko/20120117 Firefox/12.0a1
Build ID: 20120117031056

Steps to reproduce:

For many week now, I have been using 64-bit Firefox Nightly build on 64-bit RHEL6.1. I had 64-bit Flash player 11.1.102.55 (http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_11_for_other_Linux_(.tar.gz)_64-bit). I placed libflashplayer.so from the package into .mozilla/plugins directory and it worked fine.

Firefox Nightly auto-updates almost everyday.


Actual results:

Sometime last week, my flash player broke.

Now when I load a web page that ha flash content, it appears blank. If I switch to a different application and switch back, the flash area is all corrupt (see attached screenshot). Also a seen in the screenshot, some GTK-CRITICAL message show up on console:

-----
(<unknown>:4066): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_get_visual: assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed
(<unknown>:4066): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_colormap_new: assertion `GDK_IS_VISUAL (visual)' failed
(<unknown>:4066): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_colormap_alloc_colors: assertion `GDK_IS_COLORMAP (colormap)' failed
(<unknown>:4066): Gtk-CRITICAL **: gtk_widget_modify_bg: assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed
-----



Expected results:

I ended up using nspluginwrapper to use 32-bit flash in 64-bit Firefox Nightly. This is not ideal. I would expect the native 64-bit flash player to work a beautifully a it wa working few day ago.
