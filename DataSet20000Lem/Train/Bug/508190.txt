well, the thing is that first I tried to watch a youtube video with Close Caption but it froze (reported in another problem). so them when it restarts and I get the page where it say that to either Restore section or to Start new one (that it show the page too), the address bar go like a light-black color and you can't write anything at all.
It is very difficult to work like this.
I have 3 tab open right now, and they all have the non-writing Address bar.
This only happens when it crash and put a Restore ONLY when that page that show the tab opened occurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.make firefox crash (ex:I use the bug that occurs when I press "Translate" in where the Close Captions are in a youtube video)
2.Restart firefox
3.make sure the page that show the info and that it includes the tab oppened before and if you want to "Restore" or Start new"
4.press "Restore Section" in that page.
Actual Results:
the address bar go to a light-black color, and you can't write anything in it.

Expected Results:
the address bar SHOULD work property like others version before 3.5.2

I wa ussing a normal theme. Note that this is the new one that just came out, the 3.5.2
