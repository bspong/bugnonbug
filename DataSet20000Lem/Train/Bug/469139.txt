I'm an avid keyboard user, and this bug ha been plaguing me since the time of Mozilla 1.x, so I've already grew accustomed to clicking on a newly loaded page first to regain the keyboard focus.
But I thought it's time to lose that bad habit so I spent some time today to find a 100% reproducible chain of event leading to the loss of keyboard focus.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new window, load any page, for example http://www.mozilla.org

2. Open a second tab with CTRL-T (focus should be in the location bar), type forums.mozillazine.org and press ENTER, wait for the page to load. Check that the keyboard scrolling works.

3. Click on the "Firefox Support" forum link (we need a slow enough page here, a forum thread list work wonders)

4. Quickly press CTRL-PageUp to switch to the first tab while the "Firefox Support" page still loads.

5. Wait until the "Firefox Support" forum page finish loading in the background tab.

6. Press "CTRL-PageDown" to switch back to the second tab with Firefox Support forum.

Actual Results:
Observe that scrolling with the keyboard doesn't work in the second tab. In particular, the arrow key and Home/End/PageUp/PageDown/Space key do not scroll the page a they should.


Expected Results:
Keyboard scrolling should work.

Other keyboard command such a CTRL-F, CTRL-W, CTRL-Left & CTRL-Right still work.
You can press CTRL-Tab to switch between the tab instead of CTRL-PageUp/Down, the result will be the same.

Note that normally I use Seamonkey but this bug also affect Firefox 3.0.4 so I'm filing it against Firefox.
