In Firefox 3.0 Beta 4 the webpage is reloaded if the homepage button is pressed on a multimedia keyboard, and it doesn't matter whether the setting is set to 'New page should be opened in: a new tab' or 'New page should be opened in: a new window'. It doe not open the home page in a new tab (if set so), and it doe not create a new instance of Firefox and display the homepage in the new window (if set so). Please fix this bug!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox like you normally do.
2. Visit a website other than your home page.
3. Press homepage button on multimedia keyboard.
Actual Results:
The webpage is reloaded with the home page.

Expected Results:
This home page should be opened in a new tab (set in Firefox a the default behaviour). Also, the home page should be opened in a new window (in a new instance of Firefox) if the default setting wa changed to open new page in a new window.

I am running Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3 with no theme other than the default Windows XP theme. All Windows XP's system setting are the default ones.
