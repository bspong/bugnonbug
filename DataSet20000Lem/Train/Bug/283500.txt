It's a frameset that freeze firefox. It wa made with frontpage according to
line 5 which explains a lot.

At a glance there are many thing wrong with the code but I would guess that the
problem is the incredibly funky malformed way the frame are defined. Viewing
source will make it very apparent.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.keithlango.com/
2. watch page never render and browser freeze
3. profit

Actual Results:
The page doesn't render and the browser freezes. You do not have access to any
other tab if you have some open. The frameset on the URL above is badly written
and firefox valiantly try to render it but get stuck...

Expected Results:
Anything but freeze. It's hard to say exactly what should be rendered a the
code on the page exhibit incredible suckitude but it should have rendered
something or delivered a friendly error message such a "Frontpage created
page will not render in this universe in your lifetime" or y'know something
similiar.
