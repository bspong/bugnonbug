Firefox cause cpu to go 100% when java chart is displayed on a separate tab
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1) Gecko/20090715 Firefox/3.5.1

I notice when http://www.prophet.net/analyze/javacharts.jsp is active but idle on a separate page, and then I go to another tab to browse or read, Firefox go to 100% cpu.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
My firefox is 3.5.1
1.one browser navigate to http://www.prophet.net/analyze/javacharts.jsp
2. in http://www.prophet.net/analyze/javacharts.jsp, bring up intc chart
3.in another tab navigate to www.wsj.com
4. in another tab navigate to google and do some search
5. when cpu go to 100%, you come back to java chart and cpu go back down to 10%.
When you go to other tab like yahoo email, cpu go to 100% again. The only way I could resolve is to close java chart tab.
5. toggle tab between #2 and #4 will cause cpu to go 100%
Actual Results:
cpu go to 100%

Expected Results:
cpu not affected by java chart when I navigate to other tab

I didn't remember having this issue in 3.5.
IE 8 doesn't have this issue.
