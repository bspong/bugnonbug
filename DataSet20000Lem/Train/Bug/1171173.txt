After start, Disabling/Enabling uBlock considerably lower page load time with E10s
As reported here:
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/214



1. With Nightly 41's profile manager ("firefox -p"), create a new profile, install uBlock.
2. Disable E10s, restart browser. Load "http://numion.com/stopwatch" and measure "http://spiegel.de" a few times. Note page load times.
3. Enable E10s, restart browser. Redo the test a few times. Note that load time have gone up measurably.
4. Open Firefox' Add-ons-Manager, disable and immediately re-enable uBlock. Redo tests. Page load time are now lower again, about on non-E10s level, but only until next browser restart, after which another disable/enable-sequence is needed to bring load time down again.

The addon developer commented on it and said:

"I am still investigating. It ha something to do with browser launch only, issue disappears if manually enabling the addon after startup, or if disabling/enabling like you found out. All is the same code in both case, so I suspect there is some quirk with e10s API at launch time.

Edit: For example, if I disable uBlock, quit Nightly, launch Nightly and click a fast a possible to enable uBlock, all is fine. It's a if if uBlock is enabled, Nightly will do something bad to uBlock at launch."

Cheers
