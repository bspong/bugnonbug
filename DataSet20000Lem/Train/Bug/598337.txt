Keep bar-style notification for Firefox 4 on Linux instead of doorhanger notification which break consistency on GNOME desktop

I'm running Firefox on GNOME

New Remember Password doorhanger notification (Firefox 4) break consistency
over the GNOME desktop which us GTKInfoBar (GTKInfoBar look like current Firefox 3.6 bar-style notification system) : very bad from my point of view and
regarding user experience.

Until know Firefox made effort to integrate well in each desktop and that is
good if not necessary. Breaking consistency by changing the notification system would be an important regression to me.

I think that, on GNOME, Firefox should keep the current Firefox 3.6 bar-style
notification system.

Thanks

Reproducible: Always




My intial comment wa posted under Bug 567814 "Convert Remember Password notification bar to a doorhanger notification" (see c#45)
It also applies to Bug 588309 "Convert change password to a doorhanger
panel" for the same reason.
I had a brief discussion under Bug 572482 "[Linux] UI Refresh" which seems to be a meta-bug for Linux UI (see c#48 to 52)
