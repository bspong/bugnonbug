Huge download of undefined data
User-Agent: Opera/9.02 (X11; SunOS i86pc; U; en)
Build Identifier:

Despite the fact that I have disabled ALL of the Microsoft-ish behavior in the configuration setting (I.E. autmoatically check for updates, automatically do this and that, etc) I still at time am forced to endure a 4-8MB download of unknown content just after starting FireFox 2.0 and I must tell you that when stuck with 24kbps ( and that's bits, not bytes) analog dialup a the "best I can get", that's killer! When I can't connect via analog dialup, I am stuck with 2400bps ( also "bits" and NOT "bytes ) vi digital packet radio and that is simply unusable.

I have not yet opened the source code nor started a packet sniffer. I am hoping someone who ha been part of the team that created this thing can tell me what this is and how to disable it. Right now, I'm forced to use Opera because FireFox is eating my lunch and I have way to much to do to endure this sort of thing. Did someone from Redmond sneak in to the open-source browser team? Please don't force me to open the source and find out what this is. I have way too many other software project on my plate that I have to complete in order to pay my bill and feed my family.

Happy Holidays.
