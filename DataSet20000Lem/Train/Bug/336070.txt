Hi,

I'm developing a web application in Mozilla Firefox. I haven't been able to find any official documentation on CSS attribute that begin with "-moz". However, I stumbled upon this site:

http://xulplanet.com/references/elemref/ref_StyleProperties.html

It list the "disabled" state of "-moz-user-input" a disabling editing in a textbox. I'm trying to use the "-moz-user-input" attribute on checkboxes, and for most things, it doe exactly what I want it to do. Unfortunately, it also ha a couple of unwanted side effects:

1. Firefox's shortcut key (such a CTRL+T on the PC) do not work when a checkbox with "-moz-user-input" set to "disabled" ha the focus.

2. Events that the checkbox receives do not bubble up if the checkbox ha "-moz-user-input" set to "disabled".

That last effect is pretty peculiar. I understand "-moz-user-input" being "disabled" to mean that a particular input element will not process any events, but shouldn't those event bubble up to containing element anyway?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL: <http://www.trafficofficemanager.com/Firefox/checkbox.html>.
2. Click on the first checkbox to give it the focus. (The checkbox won't change state when you do.)
3. Press CTRL+T (on PC) or APPLE+T (on Mac).
4. Click on the second checkbox to give it the focus.
5. Press CTRL+T (on PC) or APPLE+T (on Mac).
Actual Results:
A capture for a click event (during the bubbling phase) on the <BODY> tag of this page ha been setup. A message box would be displayed if the click event bubbled to the <BODY> tag. Observe that no message box wa displayed in step 2. Also, nothing happens when pressing the appropriate shortcut key for opening a new tab in step 3. In step 4 and 5, the checkbox function like a normal checkbox.

Expected Results:
In my opinion, and I haven't read any documentation to the contrary:
The click on the first checkbox (in step 2) should bubble and fire the code to display a message box that's attached to the click event of the <BODY> tag. Firefox's shortcut key should work in step 3.
