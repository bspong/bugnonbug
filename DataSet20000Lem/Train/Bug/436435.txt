Either crash report popup or firefox vanishes

Expected Results:

Crash also occurs with default theme with my extension loaded.

Very stable computer running Windows 2000 SP4 and XP SP2 and my Firefox normally is VERY stable: this is the first crash I've had in Firefox in a LONG time ...

Extensions I have (all current version a of 5-29-08):

Session Manager (0.6.1.13)
PrefBar (3.3.4)
PDF Download (1.0.1.1)
Nagios Checker (0.12.2)
IE View Lite (1.3.1)
Free Download Manager plugin (1.3)
ForecastFox (0.9.6)
FlashBlock (1.5.6)
DOM Inspector (1.8.1.14)
CustomizeGoogle (0.72)
ColorfulTabs (2.0.11)
AdBlock Plus (0.7.5.4)
AdBlock Filterset.G Updater (0.3.1.3)

Disabling all of them still still crash Firefox, sometimes when loading the http://globe3d.sf.net/ web site, and sometimes after rendering it and closing firefox (i.e. it crash on close after loading this site).

Sorry I don't have time now to track this down further ...

A virgin install of Firefox 2.0.14 on a Win2k computer doe NOT crash on this page ... but what is Firefox without extension <g> ...

Why it crash with the extension disabled I don't know ... Maybe someone else can narrow it further ...

It's been year since I found a web site that would kill my browser like this.
