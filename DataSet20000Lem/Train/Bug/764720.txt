After previewing a tab through the Aero Peak preview from the taskbar, the active tab remains blank

Steps to reproduce:

Related to ticket # 627895

Steps to reproduce:
- open multiple tab and split them in different tab group (all in one Firefox window)
- select a tab which ha a page loaded (not blank)
- hover the window taskbar button
- Aero Peak tab previous will show all the tab opened although only some of the tab belong to the current tab group (this is ticket 627895)
- without actually clicking on any of the tab from the Aero Peak preview list, simply move the mouse over different tab preview and keep it still for a few second - Firefox will bring the corresponding tab to front. Repeat this for different tabs, and (IMPORTANT!) hover your mouse over a preview of a tab from another tab group.
For example, active tab group is called A, and there is another tab group called B. Each ha 2 tabs. In the Aero Peak there will be all 4 tabs. Hover any tab from *hidden* tab group B. Firefox will bring that tab to front.
- Without clicking on any tab preview from Aero Peak, move the mouse away from the taskbar, leaving the same active tab in Firefox -> after the hidden tab wa brought to front due to Aero Peak hovering, when the active tab is brought again to front it content is blank. You need to select another tab then come back in order to see the content again.


Actual results:

When hovering a tab preview corresponding to a hidden tab (from an inactive tab group) through the Windows 7 Aero Peak feature, Firefox will bring that hidden tab to front, even if it is part of an inactive (hidden) tab group. That tab will remain in Firefox tab bar until any other tab is selected.

After moving the mouse away from Aero Peak preview (without clicking on any of it) Firefox will return to the original active tab which wa initially selected, but it content is shown a blank, no matter what page wa loaded. You need to select another tab then come back to see the content again.


Expected results:

Either do not show the tab previous from hidden tab group in the Aero Peak (bug 627895) OR correct the behaviour described above.
