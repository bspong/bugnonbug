Firefox 40.3 accepts no input and fade into gray (FreeBSD10.2)
Created attachment 8662520
Error message shown in my xterm window relating to Firefox.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; FreeBSD amd64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/45.0.2454.85 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

* Running FreeBSD10.2 on VirtualBox environment and this began to happen after

* done upgrade with pkg installed Firefox ( upgraded from 38 -> 40.3 )

After encountered this issue, I also tried installing Firefox with port (I think this could be considered equivalent to I built it from source)

* then launch Firefox on a terminal window (xterm) by command operation

like

% firefox &





Actual results:

* Firefox launch
(I prefer tab to be kept and always start from "restore session" menu to be displayed and press "Restore" button. )

* on "Restore Session" menu screen, until I press "Restore" button, it accept my mouse input (like move cursor to address bar or search menu window)

However,

* after I pressed "Restore" button, it freeze and doesn't accept mouse input

I wonder what cause this...



Expected results:

* launch with previously opened tab and accept mouse input

(Since it doesn't accept mouse input, I can't switch tab or do anything)
