I use a vBulletin board and choose "View New Posts". I then open the new post
in new tabs, by clicking them while holding the control key. There is a quick
reply box near the bottom of the page. Sometimes I cannot type into this box,
and when I try clicking inside it, nothing happens. No blinking cursor.
Strangely, if I refresh the page (clicking the refresh button), it then work
fine. From this, to me it seems to be a problem occurring when the page is rendered.
I have also run into the problem on other misc. page around the web. I don't
think it's specific to the page, just the browser and the way I click around
links, opening page and tabs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page with a multiline textbox.

Actual Results:
1. Attempt to type into the box.
2. If the box is clicked, no cursor appears and it still can't be typed into.

Expected Results:
Allowed text to be entered into the box.
