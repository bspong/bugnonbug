DEP (Data Execution Prevention) is triggered on Vista when I set the extensions.checkCompatibility is set to false and then visit www.ynetnews.com. This is repeatable and wa tested on a clean profile without any addons or other modifications. This occurred on FF3 beta 5 a well a FF3 RC1. The point of submitting this is mainly a a potential help in finding other DEP bug a I know that using about:config void your warranty. It is still a bug and wa pretty easy for me to reproduce. Feedback would be appreciated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create fresh firefox profile on window Vista.
2. Do about:config and create new boolean variable called extensions.checkCompatibility
3. Set it to false
4. Type: www.ynetnews.com into the url bar and hit enter. It should cause DEP protection to kick in. If not on main page then click around a bit.
Actual Results:
DEP kick in and browser closes.

Expected Results:
I don't expect DEP to kick in.

Stayed alive and let me read the news.
