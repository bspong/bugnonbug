When browsing Digg.com, I closed a Digg page accidentally and re-opened it using the Undo Closed Tab feature, when the page wa fully-finished loading all the comment on the page were ruined, e.g. text color changed, size color changed, location wa behind user images, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://digg.com/comedy/Democracy_9 (Not only this page doe it. Any Digg page will.)
2. Close the tab.
3. CTRL+SHIFT+T to undo the closed tab.
4. Wait for page to fully load.
Actual Results:
The comment will look normal while the page re-loads, but after the page is fully loaded it will change from their normal formatting to a broken one.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have kept the formatting the same a it wa when the page wa first opened up.

I am using Firefox 3.7a and using the default theme, my computer configuration is not changed and it is reproducible on other machines, including computer with Vista (have not been able to test any other OS.)
