"alert me when I post unencrypted information" dialog should default to unchecked

After a new install of Firebird, the first time a site with a form is used a
dialog box pop up warning that the information is being submitted unencrypted,
along with a checkbox to turn off the warning in the future. The checkbox
default to being checked, so I have to uncheck it before clicking OK. There is
a similar security warning box cthat come up the first time an http site is
visited with the option to "wrn me when I am about to view an encrypted page",
but the checkbox in that default to being unchecked. I believe that the
"unencrypted information" box should also default to being unchecked, for
consistency reason and because I imagine the vast majority of user would
prefer not to recieve a warning whenever they use a form.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a nightly build of Firbird
2. Visit a site that us a form (like www.google.com )
3. Submit the form

Actual Results:
A warning box pop up aout unencrypted form submissions, with an unchecked
"don't warn me again" option

Expected Results:
The "don't warn me again" option should be checked.
