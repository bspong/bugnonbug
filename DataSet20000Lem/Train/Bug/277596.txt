trying to open a separate tab doe not do a intended at news.google.com

The webpage at news.google.com ha a script that navigates click on link to a
new location. However, the tabbed browsing feature should disable this onclick
event when a user press a modifier key and they click on a link.

The problem with the present behavior is that the following occurs:

1) User press modifer key and click on a link such a "Science/Technology" in
order to open it in a separate tab while retaining a view of the existing page.
2) The tab is opened a desired, containing the new page.
3) The script action, which is now undesired, is performed. Thus, a view of the
existing page is not retained, and both current tab and the new tab show view
of the "Science/Technology" page.

Links which are not true links, but which work only by using a script, should
work the same a they do now. It is the problem of the web designer that the
result will not work with tabs, because they used temperamental designs.
However, link with traditional structure should work with tab even if they
normally would cause a redirection to occur.



Other browsers' behavior:

Safari 1.0.2 doe the same thing a Firefox, so it ha the same problem.
IE on mac doesn't have tabs.
Presumably, Camino doe the same thing a Firefox.
