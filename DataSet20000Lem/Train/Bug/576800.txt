for some reason, firefox shrank the vertical aspect (it wa working fine yesterday and computer wa never rebooted, so still running) for no apparent reason. when trying to expand it either by dragging or maximize button, it stretch and flash the larger screen and then snap back to the 1/3 window height. It will adjust width wise a normal, but not in height.

the only fix I have found wa to uninstall and reinstall the software. reboots nor anything else works.

All other program work fine including Internet Explorer.

This is extremely frustrating.
