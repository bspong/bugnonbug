dde not working on some system and cause unable to open error message
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

every time Firefox 2.x get installed or updated it creates the following registry key:
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\HTTP\shell\open\ddeexec
(same for HTTPS and FTP)
I don't really know what is the advantage of DDE here but it case strange behaviour and error message here!
I use PC-Pine a email software and click on link there (Firefox is my default browser). I always get delay and error message when launching an URL (especially if firefox is not loaded yet).
For now I just kill these registry key after every Firefox bugfix update and everything is working fine thereafter!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
WinXP SP2, PC-Pine mailer (4.64), Firefox 2.0.0.3, PC-Pine set a default mail application (both for current user and machine)

Click on a link in an email.

Firefox is setup so that those external "launched" link will open in a new tab (I use one firefox window with multiple tabs, always.)
Actual Results:
MessageBox which say the browser could not be launched etc. But actually it seems to work (but slower).

Expected Results:
No messagebox.

kill ddeexec key and all is fine (for me).
