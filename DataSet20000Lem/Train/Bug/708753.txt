Firefox Button menu item ha broken keyboard support, and is missing accelerator (underlined letters)
On the normal menus, thing work beautifully. Arrow key work fine to navigate within the menus, and move from menu to menu. There are proper keyboard accelerator (underlined letters), which can activate the menu item by pressing that key on the keyboard.

But on the Firefox Button's menu, thing are completely broken:
* After opening the menu by clicking the Firefox button, there is no response from any keyboard keys, except Alt, Escape, Tab, or Windows Key to close the menu.
* After hovering over a menu items, it display the usual dark blue to indicate the item is selected. Once a menu item is selected, you can use the arrow key to move to some of the other menu items, and press Enter to activate that items. You can not move to any split items, nor move between the left and right half of the menu.
* After hovering over a split menu item (such a the New Tab menu), you can press Right to open the submenu, and navigate within the submenu, but you can not navigate to any other menu item with the keyboard.
* No keyboard letter activate any commands, not even pressing the first letter of the command name.
* There are no keyboard accelerator (underlined letters) on any of the menu items. Not even on any item in the submenus.

On submenu of the Firefox Button Menu, keyboard letter key work to activate the menu item that begin with that letter, but there are still no displayed accelerator (underlined letters).

Yes, I have confirmed the same behavior on a clean profile.

Also, when using the "Personal Menu" add-on, custom menu added to the Firefox Button menu have proper accelerators. Why can't the real menu have them too?
