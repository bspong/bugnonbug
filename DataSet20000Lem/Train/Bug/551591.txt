ASK appeared a a default search engine on Firefox start up page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 2.0.50727)

Suddenly the FireFox search provider changed from Google to ASK. From info on Mozilla support,I tried to change back to Google,by entering "about.config" in the new tab, typing "keyword.url" in the filter text box, double clicking on "keyword.url", selecting change, and typing the default value as: "http://www.google.com/search?q=". The system doe not recognize this change, and when I bring up FireFox,"ASK" still come up a the default search engine. I have checked, and my change still show in keyword.url.
I have tried ASK, and it really stink in comparison to Google. It's almost like ASK is a virus that doe not allow change. Where did ASK come from? Was it contained in one of your updates?
