Display typeName from protocol.js actor in listTabs response
Currently, packet from protocol.js actor are harder to follow in packet log because their actor ID ha no visible name:

DBG-SERVER: Received packet 2: {
"from": "root",
"selected": 0,
"tabs": [...],
"url": "chrome://browser/content/browser.xul",
"consoleActor": "conn0.console2",
"inspectorActor": "conn0.3",
"styleSheetsActor": "conn0.4",
"styleEditorActor": "conn0.5",
"memoryActor": "conn0.6",
"eventLoopLagActor": "conn0.7",
"profilerActor": "conn0.profiler8",
"chromeDebugger": "conn0.chromeDebugger9",
"webappsActor": "conn0.webapps10",
"deviceActor": "conn0.11",
"preferenceActor": "conn0.12"
}

The one above that look like "conn0.12" are all protocol.js based. Since further packet to the actor us these names, it's much harder to follow with just a number.

By exposing the typeName, you get:

DBG-SERVER: Received packet 2: {
"from": "root",
"selected": 0,
"tabs": [...],
"consoleActor": "conn0.console2",
"inspectorActor": "conn0.inspector3",
"styleSheetsActor": "conn0.stylesheets4",
"styleEditorActor": "conn0.styleeditor5",
"memoryActor": "conn0.memory6",
"eventLoopLagActor": "conn0.eventLoopLag7",
"profilerActor": "conn0.profiler8",
"chromeDebugger": "conn0.chromeDebugger9",
"webappsActor": "conn0.webapps10",
"deviceActor": "conn0.device11",
"preferenceActor": "conn0.preference12"
}
