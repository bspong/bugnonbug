Under Bookmarks>Bookmarks toolbar, it doesn't list all
of the folder currently residing on the toolbar. When I bookmarked web page to those folder that I see on the toolbar, I'm allowed to do so, but none of the bookmarked page were actually saved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Left click on personal toolbar
2.Select New Folder
3.Type folder name
4.The first time you put bookmark in the folder, they are saved.
5. Close and re-open firefox
6. Save a page to the same folder.
7. Check to see that the page doesn't actually appear.
8. Go to Bookmarks>Bookmarks toolbar. The name of the folder is not on the list.
Actual Results:
I assumed that the bookmark would be saved. However, when I went to them the next day, the bookmark were not in the folder. I wondered if I had accidentally saved them elsewhere, but did not find them. I looked under Bookmarks>Bookmarks toolbar and found my folder wa not listed.

Expected Results:
It should have saved the bookmark and the folder should have appeared in the Bookmark>Bookmarks toolbar list
