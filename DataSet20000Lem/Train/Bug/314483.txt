Intel P43.06 laptop recently upgraded firefox 1.0.4 to 1.0.7: www.yahoo.com link can not be accessed by clicking on them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.yahoo.com
2.click on any link
3.

Actual Results:
I noticed that when I access www.yahoo.com the link on the homepage can not be accessed by pressing the left mouse button. If I do a right click and select open this link in a new tab the link is accessed.

I tried clearing the cache, and cooky then go back to www.yahoo.com and link could be accessed. But the next time that I open the browser, the problem reappears.

But when I am at mail.yahoo.com or photo.yahoo.com the left mouse click work again.

When surfing at other websites, this problem doe not seem to arise.

Presently I am using a desktop running Firefox 1.06 and the problem with yahoo is non-existent.

Expected Results:
Well after clearing the cache and history, I could access the link in www.yahoo.com but when I close the browser then open a new browser, the problem recurs.

I wa hoping that it wa just a cache or history problem but since it recurs I am a bit lost. At the moment I am resorting to right clicking the link then selecting open in another window, then closing the previous tab. :(

Am using default theme...no change done on the browser.
