Steps to reproduce:

I went to "http://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript" to get a free transcript of prior year's tax return. Entered personal information. Got all the way up to screen requesting mobile number:
http://sa.www4.irs.gov/eauth/pub/registration/id_phone.jsp?actionName=VerifyFinDataProxy

When I start entering mobile number for US "+1", text field auto-formats to (+1.
I next enter ")" to close off the country code. Next, I attempt to enter my 10-digit mobile phone number, with no dashes, starting with area code: ABCDEFGHIJ. A dash is automatically added in the wrong place, after ABCD, not after ABC. Additionally, the last 2 digit of the phone number are lost (field is not long enough).
Text field look like: (+1)ABCD-EFGH

( If I attempt to use (+01) a country code, the text field (with auto-formatting) look like: (+01)ABC-DEFG
The auto formatting is missing "-" between 'F' & 'G' and the last 3 digit are now lost. )




Actual results:

Text field look like: (+1)ABCD-EFGH


Expected results:

Text field (with auto-formatting) should look like: (+1)ABC-DEF-GHIJ
