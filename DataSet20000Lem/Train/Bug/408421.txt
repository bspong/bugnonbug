Firefox Bookmark toolbar item overwritten by IE6 item on migration
Firefox 3 Beta 2 RC1 - Win XP SP2 - build ID 2007121120

When I choose to migrate IE6 bookmark using the first-run migration wizard, it overwrites everything on the Firefox bookmark toolbar except for the "Smart Bookmarks" folder.

Using the File>Import method doe not import the favourite from IE6's toolbar, thus, not overwriting the Firefox Bookmarks toolbar.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox
2. Start Firefox and close it (notice the bookmark item on the toolbar)
3. Open IE6 and save some favourite
4. Close IE6
5. Go to C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application Data and delete the Mozilla folder
6. Start Firefox again and choose to Import Internet Explorer Settings (you can import everything, but only bookmark are needed)

Actual Results:
When Firefox loads, the bookmark toolbar will be overwritten

Expected Results:
Any item on the IE6 bookmark toolbar should be appended to the Firefox one (or maybe have an IE6 Bookmarks folder appear on the Firefox toolbar).

Alternatively, with a new Firefox profile, if you go to File>Import and select Internet Explorer setting this way, the favourite toolbar from IE6 doe not get imported.

I will provide a screenshot of the before and after.
