When attempting to find update for Add-ons there usually are many message logged in the Error Console regarding the attempt to find updates. These message are not cleared when using Clear Private Data even though CPD is configured to clear my history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Launch FF
2) Launch Error Console and "Clear" content
3) Launch Add-ons and click "Find Updates"
4) "Alt-tab" to Error Console and verify you have message logged regarding the attempt to "Find Updates"
5) "Alt-tab to FF and "Clear Private Data"
6) Verify that the message in the Error Console have not been cleared

Actual Results:
Error console contained message previously logged.

Expected Results:
Error console should have been empty.

I've noticed that if there are error (and I believe warnings) present then everything will be cleared. If error are not present and you attempt to reproduce the step above then nothing will be cleared.
