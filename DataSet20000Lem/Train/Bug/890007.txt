Steps to reproduce:

I send attached image from server a base64 datauri.

Then I load it and extract pixel from it using Canvas

var img = new Image();

img.onload = function () {
var imageData;

canvas.width = img.width;
canvas.height = img.height;
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);
imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, img.width, img.height).data;

for (var i = 0; i < imageData.length; i = i + 4) {
//This is where i check pixel
//imageData[i],imageData[i+1],imageData[i+2]
}

};

img.src =...datauri

As you can see picture from attached file ha only required chunk (IHDR, IDATA, IEND), no color correction information or anything like that and no alpha channel.



Actual results:

On a few PCs some pixel from this picture ha R,G or B raised or lowered by 1.
Just for viewing this wouldn't be such a problem, but I have encoded data in this picture so every byte ha to be the same.
We got report from one of our customers.
We have managed to reproduce this issue on one of our laptop and one pc.


Expected results:

On almost every pc I get exactly the same pixel a from the original picture.
This is expected result.
As I could get from specification, image should be rendered (and should return exactly the same data) like the original picture if there is no color correction information embedded into it.

Important notes:
On our pc this wa resolved when we updated graphic driver ???
On other pc this had no efect on result.
We used same version of firefox on few PCs. On some work excellent, on some not.
Even on PCs with problem almost every other picture return same pixel except this one.
Also, every pc with problem ha some low budget graphic card.

We tested it on version 21 because client who reported it ha that version.
I have to say that on those PCs image return correct result on Chrome, but not on IE
