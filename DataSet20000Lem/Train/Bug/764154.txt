Firefox Menu Items Stop Working
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0
Build ID: 20120601173917

Steps to reproduce:

There is a definite problem with Firefox, since I upgraded. It say Firefox 13.0, and also for Ubuntu Canonical 1.0.

It work OK for awhile, but then the menu bar with the FILE, EDIT, etc. cannot be accessed. I also cannot right click in the window to perform functions. Sometimes I see the outline of the menu selection show up a a block for a fraction of a second, while on other occasions, nothing happens at all. When I shut down the browser and reopen it, thing work fine for awhile. It is weird, in that the browser work fine otherwise.

On many occasions, I have at least two browser open in separate windows. I don't think that ha any effect. This cause a problem for me, since I like to copy and paste stuff between browser windows, word processor, etc.

This will not clear up by itself ever, a I need to close ALL open browsers.

This is definitely a Firefox problem, a all other program work fine, including a different name browser. I tried various other program while the offending browser wa open, but they all worked alright. As I said, this started once the new version wa installed.
