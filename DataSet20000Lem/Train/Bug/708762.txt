Verbose about:memory after 1500 click

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.24) Gecko/20111103 Firefox/3.6.24
Build ID: 20111103063747

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a new profile and start Firefox using it. Make sure NO extension are installed.
2. Open about:memory.
3. Open news.yahoo.com in a different window.
4. Click on an active story.
5. Scroll to the comment section of the story by searching for "all comments".
6. Open Process Explorer & locate the Firefox process.
7. Click "minimize memory usage" in the "about:memory" window, noting the resulting value for heap-unclassified and the "private bytes" value in Process Explorer.
8. Click "shared on Facebook", then "all comments", then "shared on Facebook" again, then "all comments", etc., clicking 1500 time total. This will take awhile.
9. Measure the memory size value each 100 clicks. Measure the "about:memory" memory size value by refreshing the "about:memory" window.
10. Click "minimize memory usage" and measure the final value again.



Actual results:

Total private byte grows by ~200 KB/click and heap-unclassified grows by ~100 KB/click:

# click heap-unclassified (MB) private byte (MB)

0 21.1 140.2
100 45.4 184.8
200 50.0 215.9
300 67.4 233.3
400 77.0 249.3
500 89.6 270.4
600 95.7 283.2
700 100.4 293.6
800 111.4 307.5
900 120.4 329.2
1000 125.4 351.3
1100 138.3 365.6
1200 152.9 389.9
1300 155.2 400.2
1400 171.5 423.3
1500 182.1 441.6

1500 172.3 441.9
(after clicking "minimize memory usage")





Expected results:

1. heap-unclassified should not have grown significantly from it initial value.

2. It's unclear whether other contributor to private byte should have grown significantly. Comments by Justin Lebar in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=703952 contend that the news.yahoo.com compartment (see attached verbose about:memory dump) -- which contained 141.4MB after 1500 click -- grew because of an unidentified bug in news.yahoo.com, not a bug in Firefox. He note that Chrome show indication of similar unbounded memory usage growth under testing similar to (but briefer than) the above.
