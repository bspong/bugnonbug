Full Screen Mode: Duplicated Full Screen Buttons
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0b11pre) Gecko/20110129 Firefox/4.0b11pre

I have one full screen mode button in my navigation bar. When I click it (or use the keyboard shortcut), a second identical full screen button show up right after the url bar. It go away when I leave full screen mode, and both button are completely functional.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure the full screen button is in the navigation toolbar.
2. Click it, or hit F11.
3. Notice the second full screen button, and click either one.
Actual Results:
A second full screen button appeared immediately to the right of my URL bar.

Expected Results:
There should be only one full screen button at a time. If there is no full screen button in the toolbar when it is triggered, the full screen button should appear after the URL bar, just not when there is already a full screen button on the toolbar.

This problem occurs in Firefox 3.6.13, 3.0b10, and 4.0b11pre (up to date since January 29, 2011).

I doubt this is an issue with addons, but I can try again in safe mode if it would help. I can also offer screenshots, but I feel I already made my problem pretty obvious.
