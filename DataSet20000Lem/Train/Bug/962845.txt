Sample of Firefox.txt

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

Start Firefox with my very large saved session (probably a hundred or so open tabs.)

Wait a few minutes.

CPU (one of the core of my machine) peg at 100% FOREVER.

Firefox becomes hugely unresponsive.

Memory doesn't seem to be a problem: FF using le than 1gb on a 16gb machine with 6gb free a reported by the OS.

Go back to using Safari, again. Sigh.

Firefox 26.0, MacOS 10.6.8.



Actual results:

It take over a second to echo each character I am typing in this text box.
Laptop fan run continuously.

MacOS "Activity Monitor" application backtrace sample
show 120+ deep nested call to imgLoader::SupportImageWithMimeType

mac_plugin_interposing_child_OnShowCursor often might be implicated somehow

Beats me.

Normal complement of unthreatening extension (Adblock, Cookie Montster, Stylish, DOM Inspector, etc.)

Normal-ish set of MacOS plugins (Flash crapware; Adobe PDF 11.0.6; a couple others.)

Basically, this shouldn't be happening. But is happening every time for me.


Expected results:

Idle CPU. Zero Firefox CPU use when idle.
