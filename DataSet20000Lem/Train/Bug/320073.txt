Every time I restart Firefox the toolbars have changed back to default, no matter how many time I change them (I removed the bookmars toolbar and added the 'add tab' button to the nav bar).

I have uninstalled the extention that I had installed since upgrading and changed the theme (custom) to another custom one and then changed it again to default with no change.
