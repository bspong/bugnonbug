i have been able to reproduce this in two or three way in FF3.5,
1) merely add two image with contenteditable attribute inside the tag, both image can now be clicked then manipulated, follow the sequence of open page,click on one image and then perform a double-click outside of it.

2) with javascript add one image to the doc and set it content editable to true, it work without problems, and then add a second img in the same manner, both image are no longer editable a much a you click, add a third and all are fixed for eternity...

Reproducible: Always
