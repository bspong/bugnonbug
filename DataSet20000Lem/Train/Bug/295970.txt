This happens in pretty much every page I try on my office (desktop) and laptop
computer (both Windows XP machines). The width of the browser window will
occasionally be set to something wider than the true screen width so that I can
no longer see the vertical scroll bar (fortunately the wheel on the mouse still
work for scrolling), for example, certain tab (when many are open) or elemnts
that are flushed right on toolbars. I can't tell what trigger the resize, nor
why it sometimes go back to the right width. This doe not always happen
immediately, but it almost always happens at some point during the browser
session. It also go back to the right width from time to time. It seems
completely random to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page.
2. Wait a bit?
3.

Actual Results:
The page got wider.

Expected Results:
Kept the window the same width.

I occasionally log into my computer using the Windows Remote Desktop service
from computer with different screen sizes, but it happens on the 1280x1024 and
on the higher (I don't have it here) resolution monitor (although on login the
window is properly resized, even though it start to switch later in the session).
