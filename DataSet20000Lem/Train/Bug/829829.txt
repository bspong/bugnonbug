The stub installer fails to download the file when the server redirects to an HTTPS server

Patch (v1)

I wa trying to demo the stub installer today and it failed miserably in that the installer did not manage to download anything, so I tried to understand why. After a lengthy debugging session, this is what I found.

So we fall into this loop in the inetbgdl NSIS plugin: <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/other-licenses/nsis/Contrib/InetBgDL/InetBgDL.cpp#386>. On the first iteration we're on an HTTP connection and everything is fine. Then the server sends a redirect to https://ftp.mozilla.org/... and we close the old connection and open a new connection here <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/other-licenses/nsis/Contrib/InetBgDL/InetBgDL.cpp#441> using port 443, which is fine. then, we loop back and call HttpOpenRequest here <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/other-licenses/nsis/Contrib/InetBgDL/InetBgDL.cpp#393> *without* passing the INTERNET_FLAG_SECURE flag, which mean that we will end up sending plaintext data to a connection on port 443 which expects SSL, so the server just close the connection on u and we continue to try again indefinitely. This match what we observed in Wireshark a well.

The fix is really simple, the patch that I attached doe it. Robert, I don't actually know how to build the stub installer so I did not test this, but could you please apply my patch, create a new inetbgdl.dll, rebuild the stub installer and see if this fix the bug?

Thanks!
