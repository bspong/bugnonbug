There are a couple of site that have form that are not compatible with
Firebird. When you click submit, it just pop up a Javascript alert window with
the name and value of the form that it is supposed to send to the server but
when you click OK, it doesn't do anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Amazon.com and login
2. Go to the Your Store tab and find a recommendation.
3. Click on the "Why wa I recommended this?" link
4. Click on "I Own It"
5. Click on "Save Changes"

Actual Results:
Javascript alert with form information. Clicking OK change the cursor to the
background waiting cursor and the status bar say "Waiting for amazon.com" but
nothing happens.

Expected Results:
No alert should popup and the form information should be sent to the server and
amazon.com should redirect to another page.

There are many other site that this happens on. For example, I cannot log into
the Best Buy credit card management site because when I submit my login
information, it just pop up the alert (with my username and password!) and doe
not do anything.
