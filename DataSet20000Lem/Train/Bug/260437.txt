"Set a Wallpaper" change wallpaper for all user (should not save in window directory)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

Because it appears that Firefox us a single wallpaper file:
C:\Windows\Firefox Wallpaper.bmp

If a PC contains multiplul user accounts, and each user ha used Firefox to
change their wallpaper. When one user change their wallpaper using the "Set a
Wallpaper" option in Firefox, it will change the wallpaper for every other user.

Instead of having every user's wallpaper linked to "C:\Windows\Firefox
Wallpaper.bmp" it would be better to have a single wallpaper file specific to
each user account on the PC.

Occurs only if each user ha used Firefox to set their wallpaper.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to any user account on the system
2. Launch Firefox and use the "Set a Wallpaper" option
3. Use the Windows "Switch User" function to quickly go into another user account
4. Launch Firefox and use the "Set a Wallpaper" option
5. Log out of the second user account and log back into the original user account
6. The wallpaper will now be the same a the one set in the 2nd user account.

Actual Results:
Wallpaper for all user who have used Firefox to set their wallpaper will be
changed.

Expected Results:
Each individual user should retain their own wallpaper.

Would be beneficial to have this fixed by 1.0 because I imagne that it simple
thing like this that would cause user to switch back to IE.
