I'm using an SSH tunnel on Firefox 3.6.12 and I believe that DNS query are being leaked.

I am forwarding my SSH connection using the following command:

ssh -vN -D 3000 <user>@<host>

Under Firefox's connection settings, I have selected "Manual proxy configuration" and I have all of the field blank except for "SOCKS Host" which is set to "localhost" on port 3000 and "No proxy for" which is set to "localhost, 127.0.0.1".

In about:config, the value of network.proxy.socks_remote_dns is set to "true". (I have restarted Firefox a few time since I set this.)

I know that my SSH tunnel is working because when I view network traffic using Wireshark, all web traffic is marked a "TCP" and go between my computer and the remote host. However, DNS query are still leaked to the nameserver defined in /etc/resolv.conf. (The nameserver is my wireless router.)

I have read about this problem happening in Firefox 3.5, but I haven't seen any mention of it in 3.6. E.g.:

http://edge.i-hacked.com/firefox-35-dns-leaks-like-a-waterfall

Basically, my problem is the exact same a the person's on that page.

I'm not using FoxyProxy, fwiw.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open SSH tunnel using at least the "-D" option to SSH
2. Configure Firefox to use the port you are using for the tunnel
3. Sniff traffic using Wireshark and see that DNS query are not sent to your SOCKS host
Actual Results:
DNS query are routed directly to the nameservers defined in /etc/resolv.conf

Expected Results:
DNS query would be directed to the SOCKS host I have defined.

I have filed this under Security because this could be a security problem if someone needed to keep their DNS query secret. If there is a better component to file it under, then feel free to move it.
