Firefox cannot load when built with --enable-js-static-build
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070609 Firefox/2.0.0.4
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0a7pre

When to the call to configure. The final firefox "load" fails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Configuring Mozilla (firefox) with the flag --enable-js-static-build.
2.Compile and attempt to load firefox.

Actual Results:
Many undefined symbol from Firefox load, most of which appear to be associated with Javascript debugging, e.g. JS_CallTracer, JS_IsGCMarkingTracer, JS_SetExtraGCRoots, js_TraceContext, etc.

Suspect that a JS tracing file ha not been included in the load file list.

Expected Results:
Firefox *should* be able to load a many static component a possible, e.g. javascript, netscape portable runtime library, netscape security components, etc. While some of the gtk/gdk/glib library are problematic due to runtime module loading with a little effort a fully static firefox-bin could be produced.

It is difficult to properly profile Linux program (e.g. use gprof effectively) when extensive use of shared library is made. Given the extensive use of javascript and the NSPR library there should be explicit testing of option which would force those into the firefox-bin executable to enable robust profiling.
