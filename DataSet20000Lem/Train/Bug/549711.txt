Impossible to save an image seen on the screen when browsing! Operation : *Right Click on image; *Select Save Image As; ... then Nothing Happens, no pop up window, nothing at all!! This bug wa persistent from the previous version, it may be difficult to find because right after the start it's sometimes working and after a few minute it doe not work anymore! It seems also related to another bug that refuse to display all the file saved inside a directory, in fact it keep saving them a told, but only display the first 2 new files! (( By the way in another post somone wrote about the <img ... alt="..." > that doe not work with Firefox, I know "Title" exists, but it's a pain to care about both of them .. a far a I remember it's like that from the beginning.))
