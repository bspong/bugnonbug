Files loaded into scratchpad should be recognized a “saved”
Currently, when loading a file into Scratchpad, the file is immediately marked a “not saved” (visible by the star prepended to the file name in the title). Thus, when closing Scratchpad without actually changing the file, I still get a prompt to save it.

This is obviously not necessary for file that were just loaded but never changed.

The behavior is triggered by `self.setText(content);` in the `SP_importFromFile` function [1]. Setting the text will raise the `textChanged` event which in turn will put the Scratchpad editor in an unsaved state.

It seems that the `textChanged` event is only being listened to when the file wa saved until the first change. I would suggest solving this similarly to how it’s done in the initialization by calling `onTextSaved` after the text ha been loaded from the file [3]. In addition this would require removing the listener first before starting to load the file.
