Cannot open URLs from other application when Firefox4 is already open

When I click a link in TweetDeck, it want to open in Firefox, but it won't let it since "A copy of Firefox is already open. Only one copy of Firefox can be open at a time." a the dialog says. Instead of denying me, Firefox should simply open a new tab or window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Firefox is set to be your default browser.
2. Open Firefox 4.
2. Open TweetDeck (or some other application that launch URLs).
3. Click on a link.

This also happens when I click "Run on server" in Eclipse (Java EE) a I have Eclipse open my default browser instead of Eclipse's built-in browser.
Actual Results:
An error dialog appears stating "A copy of Firefox is already open. Only one copy of Firefox can be open at a time.".

Expected Results:
The software should have opened a new tab (or window) following my Tab Preferences.

Chrome, for instance, open the link in a new tab. Without this feature, it is unnecessarily more difficult to develop or view link posted by friends.
