Drag indicator (little purple arrow) won't go away, after gradually dragging tab over content area

screenshot: arrow still present after tab's been dropped

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1. Open two (or more) tabs, viewing about:blank
2. Click and drag the first tab to the right of the second one, so the purple indicator arrow appears. **Keep holding on to it -- don't drop it yet**
3. Slowly move the cursor downwards until it's over the page-content area.
4. Release the cursor while it's over the upper region of the page content area.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
- After step 3 (i.e. while the cursor is over the page content area), the purple arrow is still present
- After step 4 (i.e. after we've dropped the tab), the purple arrow is still present
- The arrow will persist (in it current spot) if you close tabs, create new tabs, etc. AFAICT, it stay visible & fixed until the next time you drag tab around.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- As soon a cursor leaf the tabstrip, the purple arrow should disappear.

mozilla-central show broken "ACTUAL RESULTS":

mozilla-1.9.1 show working "EXPECTED RESULTS":
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4pre) Gecko/20090407 Shiretoko/3.5b4pre

Hence, this is a regression in mozilla-central with respect to 1.9.1.
