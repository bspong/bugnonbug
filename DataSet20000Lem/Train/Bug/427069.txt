Only 10 page fit on tabs. The need to scroll left/right is usability problem

The TABs use fixed about of space for the page name. Therefore only
limited number of tab can e visible at a given time. In this screen it is
10.

Hardly a number that is sufficient for serious work, where the normal daily count is between 20-40. (because you open link at page to separate TABs to see if they are interesting, or "group related issues").

Opera condences tab a they are opened, so it's not a problem at all to use
50 tab in same browser and switch between them fast. The use of these tiny tab is possible, because one doesn't need to see the actual *text* to recognize the tab, but only to memorize the relative position of the tab - and click on it accordingly.

The Right hand button to list "ALL TABS" is really no substitute. It can't even
cope with 50 pages, because they don't fit on the pull down menu listing on average screen.


Please offer condenced tab that fit in to the visible browser area.
