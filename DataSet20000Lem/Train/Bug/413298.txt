Organize Bookmarks
Created a new folder to move bookmark too.
Selected several using the ctrl+click
Edit--Cut (assuming the bookmark would be cut from FF and copied to clipboard)
Open the new folder
Edit--Paste....nothing happened
Tried several times. The bookmark are gone.
More weirdness--
Opened Word to see if I could at least paste from there and I can.
The clipboard isn't available from FF but it is from Notepade, Word, etc.

Workaround is to paste to another application and manually add the bookmark to the new folder. But the optimal solution would be to allow the clipboard to fully function like other Windows applications.
