Zooming in devtools should not zoom the "devtools chrome"
When you use the zoom on a web page, the browser chrome doe not zoom, only the page content does.
It would be weird if it did, and not very useful.

In the context of the browser, that's easy because there's a clear separation between what the browser (the chrome) is and what the page (the content) is.

Now, when the devtools toolbox is focused, you can also use the zoom, but when you do, everything get zoomed.

My point is that within the devtools, we almost have the same chrome/content separation only a little bit more blurred.

So, zooming in the inspector should definitely zoom the DOM tree content, and the style rules, but not the breadcrumb widget or search input or sidebar tabs.

Over in the debugger, same thing, when using the zoom, the user probably intended to make the code font-size larger, just like in a code editor, not make the pause/resume/step button bigger.

What's not a clear is: should you consider the scope variable sidebar chrome or content? What about the variablesview in the webconsole? And the request header sidebar in the netmonitor.

So it's not so simple.

At least the very top tabbar (with the list of tool and toolbar buttons) is surely something we shouldn't be zooming with the rest.
