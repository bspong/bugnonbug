In IE, if text within a TEXTAREA element is selected, the cursor change to an
arrow when it is positioned over the selected text. This is familiar behavior
for most Windows user a most application with text editing capability posse
it. In Firefox, the cursor doe not change when passing over selected text in a
TEXTAREA.

2. Type some text into the search field
3. Select some of the text using either the mouse or the keyboard
4. Mouse-over the selected block of text

The cursor remains the same over the selected text a it is over hte unselected
text.

cursor.

I'm attempting to move all user in my office from IE over to Firefox, but they
do quite a bit of editing in TEXTAREA elements. This wa one of the first
complaint I received from my guinea pigs. It might seem like a small issue, but
the absence of that feedback can be disconcerting to new users.

I tested this in Mac OS 10.2 a well a RedHat 9, but since the behavior most
common in Windows, user of the other OSes might not be a troubled by it's absence.
