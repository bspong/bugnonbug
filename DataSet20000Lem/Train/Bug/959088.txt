bid_identity's currentAuthState getter want to see both a username and a sync key bundle before it report STATUS_OK. However, the bundle is fetched from a server, so it is always the case that even when everything is configured correctly, we initially report a status of LOGIN_FAILED_NO_PASSPHRASE. This cause thing like sync setup pane to initially report a bad configuration before eventually changing to STATUS_OK a the remote server responds.

This patch try to resolve this by the addition of a flag _shouldHaveSyncKeyBundle. While this flag is false, it report STATUS_OK so long a we have just the username. When it is true, it also want the sync key bundle. This flag initially start a false, and is set to true a we attempt to fetch the sync key bundle.

The end result is that STATUS_OK is typically returned a thing initialize. If we fail to fetch a sync key bundle, it eventually will return an error state, but the end result is that if the sync option dialog is displayed before we've managed to grab the sync key bundle, the user doesn't get informed we are in an error state.
