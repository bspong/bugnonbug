Firefox fails to unload process (see CTRL+ALT+DEL -> Processes) after long session
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

After a long session in Firefox surfing numerous sites, many with very active Java code and Flash components, I cannot restart Firefox without first ending the process "firefox.exe" using Windows Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del -> Processes). In the past, the Java icon ha appeared in the system tray during the session and disappeared when Firefox is closed. This is not happening in 3.5.6 and 3.5.7. The amount of memory being used when I go to the task manager and when Firefox won't restart usually exceeds 100mb. Ending the process fix the problem and cause no instability in the operating system or with any other program. Firefox can at this time be restarted without incident.

Note that one can also restart one's computer to achieve the result of being able to reload Firefox. That take too long, and having a process resident in memory us system resource and can slow or interfere with other programs.

Yahoo mail may be part of the problem; if there are more than 400 or so message in the IN box and the website script check for new mail, Firefox really slows down and often display a dialog box "Slow or unresponsive script." Could there be a problem handling heavy Java script?

I have not tried any other browser with Yahoo. I do have some add-on installed; Java QuickStarter is one of them.

Thank you.
