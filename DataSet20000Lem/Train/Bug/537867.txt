If clicked on an empty cell within table Firefox will 'lose' focus and will behave like something ('&amp;nbsp;' in this case) ha been selected in that cell, so if you try to copy selection you would actually copy an empty string.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a page with a large table which ha empty cell large enough so you can click on it once
2.right-click and you'll get a Copy/Select All context menu no matter where you right click
3.if you left-click again inside other non-empty cell or outside that table and right click again it will behave a expected again.


Expected Results:
Instead of showing Copy/Select All context menu I would expect to see Back/Forward/Reload/Stop context menu.

I've been having issue with copy/paste not working due to losing focus for a long time and it wa affecting all 3.x version I've been using (less frequent in 3.5.x but is still present including the latest 3.5.6). I wa trying all kind of trick in order to narrow the source of such behavior and even going extreme with using naked installation with brand new profile and out of box setting without any plugins, theme or bookmarks, and for some time after opening browser everything would work fine, but it wa always just a matter of time when it will manifest again and eventually it always did if I waited long enough. Sometimes by clicking on address bar, search bar, input field or switching active window would temporary fix it, but sometimes only restarting Firefox would work.

Sometimes it would be caused by closing and/or moving specific tab, switching to maximized and back to 'normal' window size, but somehow I wasn't able to find a rule which always works, but while trying to find that one I discovered this one.
