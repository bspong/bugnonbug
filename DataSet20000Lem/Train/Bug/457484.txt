Firefox automatically downloaded v3.0.3 and asked me to install. I said sure. It said, software update failed. The same thing happened when I installed v3.0.2, so I knew what to do. I switched from my Limited Access account to Admin and installed it from there. Everything wa dandy, I closed Firefox, switched back to my Limited Account, opened Firefox, and the popup showed up again. I wasn't concerned, I closed the program, started it up again. Same popup. Tried several more times. It keep popping up. When I installed v3.0.2 I don't think it came up even a single time after I'd gotten the software installed through my Admin account.
