This is a Request For Extension:

I am using:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.2pre) Gecko/20100211 Namoroka/3.6.2pre


When a new Update is downloaded (fairly often) I am asked to re-start Firefox.

The Update's "Session Restore" should cache all (possible) page for the re-start so that everything doe not need to be re-downloaded again.

The 'secure pages' and page with password may need to be re-loaded but when I have many PDF file (sometimes many megabyte each) open in a few Tabs it is sad to see that they also need to be re-loaded.

It make sense that since the Browser already ha the Pages, and all their Data (assuming the page is completely loaded), that it should simply restart and present itself promptly without reloading Data that wa valid only moment before.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Wait for an Update.
2. Choose to restart Namoroka.
3. Wait a long time for all your Tabs to re-load.
Actual Results:
Explained above.

Expected Results:
