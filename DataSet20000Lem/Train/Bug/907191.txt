[Downloads.jsm] "Remove from History" context menu option doesn't work anymore
Build identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0, build id: 20130820004003

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 25 (Aurora) with a new profile
2. Go to about:config and set the browser.download.useJSTransfer preference to true and restart the browser
3. Navigate to a page and perform a download
4. After the download is finished, right click on it in the download panel and select "Remove from History"

Expected result: The download is removed from the downloads list both in the downloads panel and in the Library

Actual result: Nothing happens - the download is not removed

Notes:
1. The issue is not reproducible on the latest Nightly build: the result of performing the above step is the expected result: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0, build id: 20130820030206
2. The issue is not reproducible with the old nsIDownloadManager interface (i.e. not running the step 2 from above).
3. The issue is reproducible ever since the Downloads.jsm wa introduced to Firefox 25.0a2 (August the 8th Aurora): Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0, build ID 20130808004004
