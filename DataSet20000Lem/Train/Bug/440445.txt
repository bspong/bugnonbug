Pages from some server with many picture don't show all the pictures, some show up a "broken picture", they can be reloaded by right-clicking on the picture and choosing the first entry "Grafik anzeigen" of the context menu. (The second entry also named "Grafik anzeigen" show the picture on it own. The two menu entry should be named differently.)

The same page show up well in Opera, Safari, MSIE and older Firefox versions. Is Firefox's timeout set too low when loading picture and building up the page?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the above page, or any page from http://railfaneurope.net/ with many pictures.
2. Some picture (different one whenever you load the same page) are not loaded.
3. Right-click on the "broken" graphic and see the duplicate menu entry (probably a translation error).
Actual Results:
The page show up with some graphic replaced by a frame with a "broken page" icon.

Expected Results:
The page should be shown with all graphic (after all the server is sending them all).
