The page is HTML 4.0 Transitional, i have JS disabled. Opening the inedx page immediately make firefox unresponsible (even to the Windowmanager, i.e. a guru crash).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to www.awo-rbk.de

Actual Results:
Immeidate guru crash

Expected Results:
it should listen and talk to me and launch and fly and bring me pizza and coffe while doing my home work :)

Inedx page open a framset. I've never seen such immediate crash since long, usually anything work good enough or otherwise i can see some specific medium content loading. But this page is expected to have no such content.

This is ieweasel 3.5.8 on AMD 64 with 3G RAM and a recent nvidia GForce, running Debian Linux with kernel 2.6.32-3-amd64.

I classified it a major because i have too many crash in tghe last couple of weeks, and i wonder if it's by case that google chrome advertises with independent crash-resistent tabs. I think they analyzed firefox carefully and found a weakness in this respect. And i think it's a general issue then.
