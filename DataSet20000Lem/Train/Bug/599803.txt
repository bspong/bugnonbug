I send WM_PRINTCLIENT message to browser window and expect that it will render itself into a provided device context. On some Windows 7 and Window Vista system it never doe that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. My extension (xpcom component implemented in DLL) have own window,
2. when it is being drawn it sends WM_PRINTCLIENT to main browser window
to force it to draw into provided device context which is a DC of the extension's window.

Actual Results:
browser window is not drawn in responce to WM_PRINTCLIENT message.
It happens on some system only.

Expected Results:
browser window must process WM_PRINTCLIENT message and draw itself into a provided device context

It doe not depend on particual OS version and bit (have tried about 10 different combinations). I do not see any system, but seems that it depends on graphic adapter type.
Everything work fine with Firefox 2 and 3, and with all Firefox version including Firefox 4 beta 6 on Windows XP.
