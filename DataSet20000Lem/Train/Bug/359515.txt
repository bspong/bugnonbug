This is a regression from bug 248612. This bug only occurs when a page with an r feed, or a secure page, is loaded in the background and the icon ha not yet been displayed since firefox started. When switching tab during drag&drop the r icon, or security icon, will not be displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Firefox to start with http://www.squarefree.com/burningedge/|bugzilla.mozilla.org
2. Restart Firefox
3. Select text from the first tab.
4. Drag text and hover over second tab until it becomes active.

Actual Results:
Security icon is not displayed

Expected Results:
It is displayed

After switching to the second tab the urlbar icon are correctly shown during drag&drop events.

Switching the order of the page and restarting show the same effect for the r icon. This is related to bug 358202 but affect both the r and security urlbar icon and only happens once, so I chose to open a new bug.
