Content of Response get lost in combination with flex/flash application.

In my Flash & php architecture i am using a code like this to send an error response to the flash application:

<code type="php">
header("THIS IS NOT TRANSMITTED BY APACHE, WHY? WE DON'T KNOW", true, 500);
echo "Errorcode: 1234\nBogus Error Message.";

exit;
</code>

on the client side something like this normally doe the trick (being put in the regarding error handler...):

<code type="flash">
var event:FaultEvent;

Alert.show(event.message.body.toString(), "Error");
</code>

This work with several different combination of browser and operating systems, but it is definitely not working on window xp & 7 with Firefox 3.6.8 and the latest nightly build i tested it with 10 minute ago. I used wireshark to analyze the network traffic. The body _does_ show up there. Also if i enter the url that is used in the flash code to "GET" the request, i will get the content displayed in the browser window. My first assumption wa that the flash player might loose the content somehow, but a it worked with the latest flash player (10.1.82.76 in debug mode and non-debug mode) and Firefox 3.6.3, i figured that this seems to be a firefox related issue. I also used firebug to trace that behavior and there also the content did not show up in the network pane under response. Again it did show up, using the url that the flash code uses.
This also work with firefox 3.6.8 & flash 10.1.82.76 on an (Intel-) Mac OS X.

Thanks for your support!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

2. Use the functionality in which's scope the error occurs.
3. Be sad that the error message displayed is empty!
Actual Results:
I tried to trace it from the apache to the flash player and found out that the content of the response get lost in firefox (and chrome also btw...)

Expected Results:
Display the content of the response in an error dialogue
