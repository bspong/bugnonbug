1. open a webpage with lot of link to really big file on the same webserver a the html file
2. start downloading a few of the really big file (I used the ogg video here: http://radeonhd.org/?page=fosdem_videos )
3. once you got several file queued up for download and 2 connection to the web server open downloading, kill the firefox process (for me it wa actually a crash but it doesn't matter)
4. launch ff again and select session restore

The download manager will now (possibly pending a race condition) grab two connection to the web server and while loading to the normal html/css/image downloads will be blocked.

Theoretically one could run into this problem by just surfing to the above webpage, starting two downloads and then pressing reload on the HTML page. However, very often ff will establish a keep-alive http session and thus avoiding this problem. During the session restore there is no keep-alive connection established because the download manager is faster to connect than the html page (I had like 50 ff window with like 10 tab each when ff crashed in the first place and a session restores take 2-3 minute to finish on my machine with that much stuff open).

Conceptually one can ask if it's reasonable for stuff in the download manager to starve normal html/css/image downloads like this? A download started by "save file as" is kind of different from an image download that start because an html page is loading.
