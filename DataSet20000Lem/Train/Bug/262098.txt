Links in Outlook Express don't work

After setting Firefox a the default browser, when I click on an underlined link
in an Outlook Express message (OE is the mail program I use), nothing happens.
If I open Internet Explorer and set it back a the default browser, and close
it, the link work just fine -- but in Internet Explorer, of course, which is
what I'm trying to get away from. Now, when I set Firefox a the default
browser, the URL filetype wa still set to open with IE; I changed it to
Firefox, and the link still didn't work with Firefox a the default browser.
So what I have done is set IE a the default browser but I use Firefox for
everything beside email links.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Default browser: Internet Explorer 6; mail client, Outlook Express 6.
2. Install Firefox 1.0PR.
3. In an email message that ha an uderlined link with a URL, click on it.
(Nothing happened.)
4. In Windows Explorer, changed the URL filetype to open with Firefox. Went
back to message, clicked on link. Again, nothing happened.

Actual Results:
After step 3, nothing happened. Opened IE and reset it to the default browser,
and link functioned properly.

Expected Results:
After setting Firefox a the default browser, a link in an OE message should
open the link in Firefox.
