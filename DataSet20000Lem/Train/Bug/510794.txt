An alert box display disables a SELECT tag

I have a simple HTML script that creates a small SELECT tag. This is followed by an empty DIV that is identified to be filled by an AJAX script. There is a javascript function that call the AJAX to LOAD the DIV each time the SELECT changes. If the AJAX script display an ALERT box message, the SELECT tag no longer functions. I have included the code snippet below.

Here is the HTML code to create the SELECT tag, followed by the JAVASCRIPT that is invoked each time the SELECT tag "changes".

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<script type='text/javascript' src='javascript/jquery-1.3.2.min.js'></script>
</head>
<body>
Select an option:
<select id='selection'>
<option value=1>Hello 1</option>
<option value=2>Hello 2</option>
<option value=3>Hello 3</option>
<option value=4>Hello 4</option>
<option value=5>Hello 5</option>
</select>
<div id='ajaxWillFillThis'></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
$("#selection").change
(
function()
{
var selected = $(this).val();
$("#ajaxWillFillThis").load('ajax_FillThis.php?selected=' + selected);
}
);

</script>
</body>
</html>

Here is the AJAX (well, actually, it's PHP code) script that is called each time the SELECT changes. It should be saved in a file named the same a the name in the JAVASCRIPT above (ajax_FillThis.php).

<?php
$id = $_GET['selected'];
if ($id < 5)
{
echo "You selected option number: $id";
}
else
{
$msg = "Sorry - you selected option number $id";
echo "<script type='text/javascript'>alert('$msg');</script>";
}
?>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run the HTML script in FireFox
2.Choose something from the SELECT box
3.If you choose the 5th option, you will see an ALERT box
4.At that point, the SELECT box no longer function until you reload the page.
Actual Results:
This is running on my system with PHP installed, using localhost a the URL server. My development system is Dreamweaver CS4, although that doesn't seem to be related to the problem.

I have 3 file in a directory. The HTML, the AJAX and the javascript referenced in the HTML.

Expected Results:
Obviously, the expected result would be for the SELECT tag to continue functioning.



I have tested this in 7 different browsers. FireFox is the only one with a problem.
