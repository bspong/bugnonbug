Your automatic update ha worked 3 time in the past 2 day to download an update. When the update is done, I cannot connect to the internet because Firefox (3.6 beta 4) cannot find the proxy server. My alternate browser (IE) also can no longer find the proxy server after the update, leaving me dead in the water. In order to access the internet I've had to use the Windows Vista system restore function and restore to a point before Firefox automatically installed the update. I haven't had this problem before with updates. I have unchecked the auto-update and hope this will temporarily resolve the problem.

Note: (separate subject -- Firefox lock up/crashes frequently when I play Zynga's FarmVille on Facebook and I go to full screen mode that us Adobe Flash Player (version 9 or 10 [not sure which].)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just let Firefox automatically update some time after 0001 5/20/2010.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Explained above-- proxy server setting changed or eliminated (removed). Can no longer connect with internet.

Expected Results:
Left the proxy server information unchanged.

I use Yahoo.com a my homepage. Most of my internet activity is through Yahoo (searches, news feeds, weather, eBay and PayPal accounts)and through Facebook for FarmVille and Mafia Wars game playing only (see "Note: separate subject ..." above).
