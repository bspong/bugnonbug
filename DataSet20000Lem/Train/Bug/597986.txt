FF v4b6. This ha been true since b3. Two bug or problems.

NOTE: These bug are in Mac OSX version. I am running FF on a PowerMac G5, running OSX 10.5.8

1. Don't get the 'feedback' button when FF is installed, so can't send feedback. Can't use Hendrix either. The 'submit' button doesn't work. Hence using 'bugzilla' to report this!

2. More importantly, also true since b3. When you enter a web site address in the web address bar and press enter/return, NOTHING happens. FF Just won't go to a website. Also, doe not go to website pressing the 'go to address' button. It happily work fine if I select any bookmark I have, whether from my bookmark or my history, or link in a page. You just cannot MANUALLY enter a web address in the web address bar and go to a web site.

3. Neither 'back' or 'forward' button ha browsing history. They are greyed out even after going to several websites. NO browsing history at all on 'fwd' and 'back' buttons. History ha a 'normal' history, but not 'fwd' and 'back' buttons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF
2. enter web address in web address bar
3. press 'enter' or 'go to address' icon (in rhs). NOTHING happens.
4. ALWAYS repeatable.
Actual Results:
NOTHING happens. zip. nada. FF just sits there with no response and no indication of any activity.

Expected Results:
go to web address entered.

NO themes, plug-ins, etc installed.
