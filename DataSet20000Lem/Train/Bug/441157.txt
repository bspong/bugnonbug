Any .torrent file that you attempt to download in Firefox 3 will not be saved to your hard drive if those file type are associated with a previous installation of BitLord. I had BitLord installed, and then uninstalled it and replaced it with uTorrent. I had to reinstall BitLord in order to get any .torrent file to successfully download. In the file association menu, Firefox describes .torrent file a "BitLord files", and even if you select 'use uTorrent' in the menu, the .torrent file will not be saved to your hard drive when you try to download them. Uninstalling BitLord doe not fix this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 2, and then install BitLord, and successfully download a .torrent file.
2. Upgrade to Firefox 3, and then uninstall BitLord and install uTorrent.
3. Try to download a .torrent file, and fail because Firefox now call '.torrent' file 'BitLord' files. They cannot be opened with uTorrent or even downloaded to your hard drive. They now only work if you install BitLord again.
Actual Results:
An 'unable to save X.torrent, the file is unavailable' error pop up in uTorrent, and the .torrent file I tried to download is not on my desktop. It will not appear in any folder you designate Firefox to download it to, and the 'open' and 'open containing folder' option are greyed out in the Firefox download manager when you right click on the .torrent file.

Expected Results:
I would expect the .torrent file to be stored on my computer, and for Firefox to call .torrent file 'BitTorrent files' in the Applications Tab. I would expect any BitTorrent client to work with .torrent file downloaded using Firefox.
