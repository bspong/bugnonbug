When managing bookmark and choosing command-i (properties) on a bookmark, the
behaviour of the enter/return key is not intuitive. Generally, the enter key
(i.e. not the return key) should be linked to the default button. In the
bookmark property dialog, the enter key work like the return key.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get property of a bookmark
2. Hit enter key to OK change while the cursor is in the description field

Actual Results:
nothing

(a line break is inserted)

Expected Results:
same a clicking on the defaulted button

Hitting return and enter is fine in the single line field (name, location,
keyword). It is in the multiline description field that the return key should be
linked to a line break (new line) and the enter key to the default button. As a
side note, why allow line break in the description field if the bookmark
manager cannot display more than one line of text properly?

Suggestion: treat enter and return key the same, but change behaviour in
description to that of the other fields.
