Select box state improperly reset on Back

In the linked example I have a javascript setup to dynamically disable/enable
form field when radio input receive onFocus events.

The drop-down select box start disabled. If you select the "Group" radio
option it get enabled. However, if you submit the form then press Back it is
disabled again (with the "Group" option still properly selected.)

You can observe the same problem in reverse via:

(In that example the select start enabled but if it is disabled, submitted,
then Back is pressed it start in it's original state - enabled).
