More detailed Add Bookmark form containing all Bookmark Properties field
User-Agent: Opera/7.54 (Windows NT 5.1; U) [en]
Build Identifier:

When creating a bookmark, my only option are to change the name of the bookmark
and the folder which it is saved in. However, once a bookmark is created, in
it property I can change the url, assign keywords, create a definition and
choose to have it open in a sidebar.

All of the option in Properties should be available when initially creating a
bookmark. This would make FireFox bookmark even more efficient since one would
not have to go back through their bookmark just to change these options.

Importantly, the option to assign a keyword should definitely be available when
adding a bookmark.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ctrl+D (Bookmark This Page)
2. Right-click on a Bookmark, select Properties
3.

Actual Results:
Ctrl+D brings up the Add Bookmark window in which I can change the name of my
bookmark, and choose which folder to put it in, along with choosing if I want to
bookmark all tab into this folder.

Viewing a bookmark's property display and allows me to edit/add the bookmark
name, location, keyword, description and to choose if it should be loaded into
the sidebar.

Expected Results:
The "Add Bookmark" window should be a replica of a bookmark's "Properties", with
the addition of choosing which folder to save the bookmark in, and the "bookmark
all tab in this folder" option. Meaning, there should be a Name, Location,
Keyword, Description field and the option to load the bookmark into the sidebar.
