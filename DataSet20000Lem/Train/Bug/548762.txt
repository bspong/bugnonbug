Hi, this is an untypical scenario, but anyway:
I had started Firefox a user with no administrative priviledges when I found out that I should update one plugin. So I started another Firefox ("Run as..." Administrator) and installed the plugin from a local file.
Then I selected "Restart Firefox", and I wa surprised that the other instance of Firefox (with multiple tab open) also had been terminated. Furthrmosre, the newly started instance did no run a Administrator (as expected).
When trying to clean up, I closed the window with the multiple tab first, and to my surprise there wa no prompt whether I's like to save the tab layout (the other window just had one tab with an empty page). When closing the other window a well, my saved tab were all gone (I had this tab setup for several weeks).

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Firefox a non-priviledged user
2. Open another Firefox a priviledged user
3. Install some extension (plugin) for all user (i.e. try to do that)
4. Click on "Restart Firefox" for the instance that run in administrative mode
Actual Results:
All instance of Firefox terminate (restart)
When terminating a window with multiple tabs, the choice to save the tab layout is not presented

Expected Results:
Only the instance that had a new plugin installed should restart
When closing a window with multiple tab (while another window is open), the layout of that window should be savable, even if another window is still open

Excuse for describing two issue in one report, but maybe that are related.
