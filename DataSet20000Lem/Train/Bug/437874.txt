The MesoWest web site open a Java window within the Firefox browser window. The following two problem only occur when using Firefox on a system running Mac OS X 10.5.3. The problem do not occur when running Windows XP or SuSE Linux.

Problem 1: If the content to be displayed cannot fit within the Java window, a vertical slider bar is added to the window. When the Java window is closed, the vertical slider bar remains displayed in the browser window and cannot be removed.

Problem 2: MesoWest allows the user to specify that some Java window not be displayed when the web site is opened. If the content to be displayed exceeds the size of the Java window, the slider bar are displayed although the rest of the window remains hidden.

It appears that the slider bar are being generated in a different "layer" from the Java window. As a result, when the "layer" containing the Java window is closed or hidden, the slider bar remain displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox on a Mac OS X 10.5.3 system.
2. Open the URL cited above to access the MesoWest web site.
3. Close any of the Java window that open with a vertical slider bar.
Actual Results:
The vertical slider bar will remain displayed while the Java window with which it wa associated is closed.

Expected Results:
The vertical slider bar should have been removed with it associated Java window.

I consider this a major problem in that content that is displayed is being hidden by the vertical slider bar that remain displayed. Since the Java window is no longer present, it is impossible to move the slider bar out of the way.
