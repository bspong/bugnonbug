incorrect additional left margin added while printing basic html

Firefox is printing an additional left margin not specified in either the "page setup" or html/style settings. This additional left margin seems to be consistently the same width. So a printed page will always print a "html margin" + "left margin" + "additional left margin".

You can view this error in Print Preview a well a in the generated postscript or on the page printed.

This extra margin is not printed in Internet Explorer 7. This make it hard to use Firefox to print out page that depend on an exact produced width such a auto-generated label or packing slips.

I will attach sample html file and screenshots.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Take an html page with a known left margin (even this bug submission page).
2. View in print preview or print.
3. Compare with the same page printed in Internet Explorer 7.
Actual Results:
html margin + print margin + mysterious left margin

Expected Results:
html margin + print margin
