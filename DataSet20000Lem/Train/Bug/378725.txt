User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.5; Linux) KHTML/3.5.4 (like Gecko)
Build Identifier: 2.0.0.3

If I open two window or two tab and login to the admin console for the application (JIRA - http://localhost:8080/ and BAMBOO - http://localhost:8085/), one of the session log out and I have to login again. I can login only to one of the application and do the administration. If I try to open another window or tab to administer the other application, then I am logged out of the previous application. I tried this with Firefox 1.5.0.7 and later on with 2.0.0.3 . Both the version doe the same thing mentioned above. I used another web browser (Konqueror) and tried the same thing and it work fine (Windowed or Tabbed) i.e. I can use both the admin console and move between them a needed.
