fix react-dev warning
When you set `ac_add_options --enable-debug-js-modules` in mozconfig, the j debugger will pop some warning from react-dev:

Warning: Unknown DOM property readonly. Did you mean readOnly?

The `readOnly` miss spell should be fixed.


There are several `Stateless function component cannot be given refs` warning a well, ex:

Warning: Stateless function component cannot be given ref (See ref "wrappedInstance" in ToggleButton created by Connect(ToggleButton)). Attempts to access this ref will fail.


StateOverflow said it could be fixed by upgrading to react-redux 4, which wont attach ref to the wrapped component by default
