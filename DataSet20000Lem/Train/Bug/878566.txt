Design Captive Portal Login UI
As discussed in bug 562917 and elsewhere, a captive portal us exactly the same technique that a malicious network attacker would use when it attempt to redirect the user to the login/payment page for the captive portal. We don't want to make it easier for a network attacker to trick users, but we *do* want to make it easier for user to log into a "legit" captive portal.

In bug 562917, Peter suggested that the UI be something like:
> popup a window with differently themed chrome (perhaps
> red decoration, or yellow-and-black warning stripes), and
> an explanatory title like "this network is currently
> interfering with your connections" and continue the
> hijack-me.com load in that visible window
>
> Similarly to bsmith's step 3, the hijack-me.com load will
> be hijacked in that window, and the user can click
> "I agree", enter their CC details, or whatever the captive
> portal demand

I agree with Peter that we should have some special indication that, if we navigate automatically to a captive portal login page that we should give the user some warning/indication that we're taking them to a page that they didn't expect to go to.

On February 1, I got an email from Larissa "Captive Portal Detection in FF" saying that some Firefox people were looking into captive portal stuff then. I'm not sure what the current state of thing is.
