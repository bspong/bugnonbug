Everytime I am on Mozilla Firefox, whether actively using it or if Mozilla Firefox is running and I am doing something else, ie., playing a game, checking mail, playing music, my computer quits responding - hang up, lock up. If I am playing music, my music sound like a stuck record. I cannot move the mouse, ctl-alt-delete, or anything for a few seconds. This happens everytime I am on Mozilla Firefox and all the time I have Mozilla Firefox running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla Firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:
My computer lock up. I can do nothing either in Mozilla Firefox or any other application I am using. This situation doe not happen when Microsoft Internet Explorer is being used. It doe not happen when I am logged onto AOL. Only when Mozilla Firefox ha been started.


Never cease responding unless there is a problem. The best I can tell, it happens about every 5 minutes. I have timed it several times. I don't know if it happens after 20 minute and more though.
