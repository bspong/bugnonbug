PHP $_SESSION[' '] variable not passing between page properly

On my website, I allow visitor to contact me through filling out a contact form (which includes a verification field). I generate a random set of number / letter which is collected and assigned to a PHP super global variable ($_SESSION['variablename']). When the user finish filling out the form (and punch in the verification a shown), the contact page is refreshed and checked against the information submitted. In current up-to-date browser (Opera 9.51 [win], IE 7, Safari 3.1.2 [win]) they all correctly store the session variable, which mean assuming the rest of the form is filled out correctly and the user ha entered the correct verification sequence, the PHP mail function is called and the mail is sent to my website. Currently, Firefox 3 doe not contain the proper php session variable (as the other browser do).

To further test this, I have displayed the current PHP $_SESSION super global variable in the resume page (http://www.olsenportfolio.com/v2/resume/resume.php). This variable can be found near the top of the page (just underneath today's date (listed beside the 'home' link which is part of a mini navigation list)).

With all the other major browser I listed, when you visit the contact page, you can take note of the current verification code, then go to the resume tab (right next to contact) and see the same code displayed a described above. But with Firefox, the code displayed doe not match the code [previously generated] in the contact page.. thus sending me an email through my site is currently impossible via Firefox 3. Prior to Firefox 3, Firefox 2.x handled this all correctly.

Cheers,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit http://www.olsenportfolio.com/v2/contact/contact.php and enter bogus yet valid email address and enter some test message.
2. finally, enter the verification code a seen and submit (try this with multiple browser to confirm this is a firefox 3 specific problem). Firefox 3 will not send an email, due to an error in the user's verification input (even though input is in fact correct).
3. You can further test this by visiting the contact page, make note of the verification code, then visit the resume page and compare against the same outputted $SESSION super global variable near top of page (on firefox 3, this will NOT match, but will on all other browsers). Take note that every time you revisit the contact page, a new code is generated.
Actual Results:
the verification code is not correctly matching what PHP ha generated and stored in a $_SESSION superglobal variable.

Expected Results:
no email is sent, due to mismatched user input v assigned codekey generated.

If Firefox 3 store $_SESSION['variablename'] properly (as it doe in Firefox 2.x), the email would be sent to my website.


Current Firefox 3 theme: Qute 3.3.6
