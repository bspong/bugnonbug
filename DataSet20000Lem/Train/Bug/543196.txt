Firefox doe not have any option to disable the name of a bookmark and to show only the symbol/icon within the bookmark toolbar.

If you delete the name-field of a bookmark to simulate the situation described above, on exporting/importing or upgrading firefox you will loose all stored bookmarks.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add a new shortcut to the bookmark toolbar (drag and drop form the url)
2. in order to view only icon (without any name!) edit the newly created bookmark and delete the "name" field. Save it. In the bookmark toolbar apperas the webpage favorite icon only now.

3. export and re-import the bookmark -> import will completely fail
or
4. update your firefox installation (e.g. 3.5.7 to 3.6). after the upgrade all bookmark are missing!
Actual Results:
all bookmark are gone

Expected Results:
bookmark should be the same a before the firefox upgrade (Version 3.5.7 -> 3.6)
