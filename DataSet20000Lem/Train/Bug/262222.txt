If a <link> element in an Atom or RSS feed contains a relative URL, Live
Bookmarks doesn't attempt to resolve the absolute URL, it just try to open the
relative URL as-is.

In Atom, the situation is clear-cut: xml:base processing is required for
relative URLs, so you just walk up the tree, gathering path parts, until you hit
an xml:base attribute with a scheme and host, or until you get to the top
without, when you use the feed URL a a base.

In RSS, it's fuzzier: the spec all predate xml:base, and fail to mention
anything that should be used a a base, so RFC 2396 say you should use the feed
URL, but because most people using <img src="images/me-on-pony.jpg"> mean
/blog/images/ rather than /xml/images/, aggregator traditionally use the
channel/link (the feed "home page") a a base URL, rather than using the feed
URL, for resolving all relative URLs, not just in content. Correct, or work
right? Dunno.
