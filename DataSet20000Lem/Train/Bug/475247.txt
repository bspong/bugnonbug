Browser start loading image before DOMContentLoaded is triggered
User-Agent: Opera/9.63 (Windows NT 6.0; U; en) Presto/2.1.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; fr; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

I'm using a Greasemonkey user script that hide ad on web page on the DOMContentLoaded event. I read the Greasemonkey documentation that state that Greasemonkey script are executed on the DOMContentLoaded event (http://wiki.greasespot.net/DOMContentLoaded), which mean when the HTML document is fully loaded but before the image (https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Gecko-Specific_DOM_Events#DOMContentLoaded). The web browser currently doesn't respect these guideline and trigger DOMContentLoaded when the HTML and some image are loaded. As a result, user script that block ad are executed after the ad are displayed, and this is not the way the application should behave. First, the browser should load the HTML content, then execute the Greasemonkey script (triggering DOMContentLoaded), and then load images.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable user script
2. Install a user script that block ad (e.g. AdSweep)
3. Open a popular web site that ha ad (e.g. TechCrunch)
Actual Results:
Some ad appear for a few second (even with an empty cache).

Expected Results:
Ads should be hidden right away.
