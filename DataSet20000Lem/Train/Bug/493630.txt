When selecting the "Bookmarks -> Bookmark This Page" menu, item in the "Show all the bookmark folders" drop down list fail to expand to display their sub-folders. If the item is already shown a expanded, clicking the "-" icon for that item fails to collapse the tree display for that item.

1. Create a series of bookmark in different sub-folders;
2. Select the "Bookmarks --> Bookmark This Page" menu;
3. Click the "Show all the bookmark folders" drop-down menu;
4. Attempt to expand one of the folder in the bookmark menu by clicking the "+" icon for that folder -OR- for any folder already shown a expanded attempt to collapse the tree display of that folder by clicking the "-" icon for that folder.
Actual Results:
Nothing. The displayed bookmark folder neither expand nor collapse.

Clicking the "+" icon should expand that portion of the tree; clicking the "-" icon should collapse that portion of the tree.

This behavior occurs while using the default theme. It doe *not* occur when displaying bookmark in the sidebar, only when attempting to bookmark a page using the "Bookmarks -> Bookmark this page" menu.
