Since I got the new update tonight, I have multiple tab that just open. I normally use about 6/8 tab at work. For some reason, I will use the pull down menu to show tab and there will multiple duplicates. So far the most I had wa 48! The other issue is that when I open the browser, it try to open all the window I had open before and doe it in duplicates. I have also had issue with it saving my home page. The search I did on Session Saver sound like the issue I am seeing but found this is not a feature in the version I have. Also not in my Tools menu.
I love FireFox but I can no longer use this browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just open the web browser
2.
3.
Actual Results:
I just open the app, try to log into multiple tabs. Have to stop it and then close all the tab it ha opened. And the tab just start duplicating with me doing nothing.


This sucks, how do I fix it? Please note I am PST and work grave yard and not have access to this computer on Thursday, Friday and Sat to assist with trouble shooting.
