dialog box open and hidden behind firefox window can't be accessed (yahoo open one on it own). Closing with taskmanager says: firefox waiting for user response, however I can not get the dialog box where I can respond so Firefox is hung.
Have not tried to reproduce. Happened yesterday and today, and other time in the past but not very often.
This is on a laptop with one screen open at this time. I do go between home with one external monitor, and work with two external monitors.

Reproducible: Sometimes



Expected Results:
dialog never be buried and inaccessable. maybe necessary to list them with the main processes, perhaps with a different label to indicate response needed.

Yahoo chat/IM (which I do not use but have not tried to eliminate) open dialog box saying "logged off because you logged on to a different computer" These can be buried and are opened when I am somewhere else (maybe 100 mile from the computer}. These window are the one that cause me problems, but assume any window buried behind firefox window (have two window with 10-30 open tab each).
No crash message since firefox is waiting for input which seems impossible for me to give.
Rated CRITICAL since this will cause me to stop using firefox if it continues.
