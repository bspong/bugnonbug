Many connection refused's when using "open in tabs" for a bookmark folder
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When I try to open 23 tab at once with the "open in tabs" feature for a
bookmark group I get a number of "The connection wa refused when attempting to
contact ________" errors. If I type the name in however, it work just fine.
This error only started happening with Firefox, and if I choose Open in tab
again, often I will receive le error than the first time. Just a note, it
mostly happens when I first open Firefox and before doing anything else,
immediately choose Open in tabs. I have tried using two different DNS server
and I still get this issue. I am quite certain this is a bug in firefox,
because it doesn't occur in firebird, even when using the exact same bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Click bookmark
3.Select a folder
4.Choose Open in tab

Actual Results:
For some of the bookmark it said "connection refused when attempting to contact
_______. Where _______ is the domain name of the bookmarked website.

Expected Results:
It should have opened them correctly, since there is no DNS error, and firebird
doe this without error of any kind.

Default install, with no plugins that I can recall. Using Firefox 0.8. If you
would like any additional information, or would like me to perform any tests, I
would be happy to oblige.
