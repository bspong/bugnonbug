I wa editing a very large page in the Zen Photo Album when Firefox locked up for 7 seconds. If I continued typing into the comment box(es), it would lock up again for 7 second with le than 5 second of typing.
The html (php) file is 244KB and the thumbnail are a further 833KB.

Opening Task Manager, Firefox showed 99% CPU useage. No typing and Firefox would idle on 1% and sometimes go up to 7%. Start typing and within 5 second it all freezes. When it unfreezes, the text entered is shown but it becomes hard to edit field when it is frozen :(
The actual HTML file (php file actually) is at http://bacchuswood.org/admin.php.html
Note that the file will not show any thumbnails. The page is only accessible through the Zen Admin page sorry.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Zen Photo admin page and log in.
2. Go to "Edit titles, descriptions, and other metadata."
3. Click on GNW_XI photo album and wait til it load (takes a while)
4. try to type info into comment for each photo.
Actual Results:
It freeze for around 7 second whenever I type into any of the comment fields.


Expected Results:
Should not use 99% CPU and therefore should not freeze.

Using a Celeron 2.4, 1GB RAM

Closing apps make no difference however.
