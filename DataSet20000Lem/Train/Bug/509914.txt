Doesn't display "Restore Previous Session" message after Firefox being closed unexpectedly.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

While I wa using Firefox 3.5.1 and 3.5.2, and whenever Firefox close unexpectedly (closing it via process in Task Manager or whenever it crashes), it will not show the dialog box saying if you'd like to restore previous session or start a new session. Instead, Firefox will start a new session automatically, which mean all tab will be lost in the process. And this is a problem that need to be fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Doing any of the following three step will cause Firefox to automatically start a new session without asking you if you'd like to restore previous session or start a new session:

1. Closing Firefox via process in Task Manager.
2. Whenever Firefox crashes.
3. Restarting the computer while you've closed it
Actual Results:
Starts a new session automatically without it asking you if you'd like to restore previous session or start a new session. And you will lose all the tab that you've been using during the session.

Expected Results:
After Firefox being closed unexpectedly, it should prompt if you'd like to restore previous session (restoring all the tab from the session) or start a new session.
