Websites that utilize popup window for further interactive functionality (such a phpbb's popup window to search for usernames) can severely slow performance of the web browser.

Popup window can become unable to be closed easily, to the point of having to force close the window through the Operating System.

Even after forcing closure of the popup window, browser client then becomes unable to use any menu driven function within Firefox. Right-click menu's, pull down menus, etc cease to become visible though the outline of the menu box will sometimes appear.

Other popup dialog window generated by Firefox also become useless at this point a you are unable to see their contents.

Force Closure of Firefox and relaunching of the client is the only solution I've found so far.

Reproducible: Sometimes
