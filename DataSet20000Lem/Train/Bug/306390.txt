In the page at http://www.sanktejo.com/asp/whc.asp (subscription required) a "No
data available" error is returned during a very long (never-ending) page
request. This site impliments a chat room via HTTP by suspending the page
transfer forever, sending data only when someone chats. If nobody chat for more
than 5-10 minute Firefox time out, giving a "No Data Available" error. User
must leave and reenter chat to continue. Possibly a WONT FIX (bad implimentation
of chat by site), but it would be appreciated, a this is the only problem my
mother ha with Firefox, and won't let IE go enless fixed. Also, if there is a
way to extend/disable the timeout period, that would be nice, but I can't find
the option anywhere. Is there something in about:config that will disable time
out messages?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into chat.
2. Find/make a room where nobody is talking.
3. Wait 5-10 minutes.

Actual Results:
Error: No Data Available.

Expected Results:
Waited forever. Err, at least that's what the site designer intended.

Have not tested in Win2k/Xp or other operating systems. Maybe with is a window
networking problem?
