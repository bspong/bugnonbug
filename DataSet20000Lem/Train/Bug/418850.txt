places.frecency.numVisits is ignored, some frecencies are very high

The value of places.frecency.numVisits seems to be ignored, instead the frecency is calculated from all visits.
As far a i understand the frecency calculation process correctly, the maximum achievable frecency is maximum_VisitBonus * (maximum_BucketWeight / 100) * places.frecency.numVisits. With the default value the maximum frecency should be 500 * (100 / 100) * 10 = 5000, but i have over 80 place with a frecency higher then 10000.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set places.frecency.numVisits to 2
2.Clear the browsing history
3.Visit one bookmark four time
4.Check the frecency of the moz_places entry for the bookmark from step 3
Actual Results:
The frecency is 4 * 150 = 600

Expected Results:
The frecency should be 2 * 150 = 300

I don't now if this behavior ha an important performance impact, but it also change the character of the frecency a a combination of frequency and recency towards the frequency.
