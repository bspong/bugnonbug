Browser window paint incorrectly when it's sized too big

My resolution is 1680x1050 pixels. When I size the browser window over approximately 1024x768, the window doesn't paint correctly. If I maximize or resize the window, the content show approximately where they were at the smaller size.

In some cases, while resizing the window by the corner, the corner doesn't stick with the mouse while dragging. This could be related to the painting issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set resolution high (1680x1050)
2.Open Firefox (if already maximized, restore down to <1024x768)
3.Maximize Firefox.
4.Restore Firefox.
5.Try resizing the window.
Actual Results:
When the window is maximized (step 3), the content do not repaint appropriately. This happens on any web page.

When the window is resized larger than about 1024x768, the content of the window seem to freeze, and the status bar and scroll bar image get painted within the window a if it wa a frozen window.

Expected Results:
The content of the window should resize accordingly no matter what size the window is in.
