When a non-HTML document is bookmarked, Firefox sometimes cannot fetch any sort of title for the Properties dialog.

Properties for a bookmark pointing to a text file (reproduction step below) ha the "Name" is correct, and editable, but the dialog's title says:
Properties for "**bm_title**"


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View any text file on the web (eg the above)
2. Drag the small icon from the Location bar to the Personal Bookmarks bar - this creates a bookmark with title equal to the filename (pirates_lib.txt)
3. Right-click the newly-created bookmark and hit Properties.

Actual Results:
**bm_title** in title

Expected Results:
Either the original file name, or the bookmark's Name (which could have been edited)

I've had some occurrence where, after manipulating the bookmark somewhat, the title show the bookmark name instead of **bm_title**. Unfortunately I've been unable to reproduce this _correct_ result reliably.

The precise step listed above are not the only way to trigger the bug, but following those step (with this version, at least) consistently reproduces it.
