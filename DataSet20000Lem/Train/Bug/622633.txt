From the address bar and on random Ctrl + C to copy the address of a site for pasting into Thunderbird from Firefox doesn't work until after restart.

Ctrl + T accessibility option to create new tab fails completely on all tested beta of Firefox 4.0. When will this be returned?



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Cycle into address bar with tab
2. Ctrl + C for copy or
3. Ctrl + T for new tab
4. nothing will happen no copy and no new tab created
Actual Results:
nothing Ctrl + V for paste return nothing unless the machine is rebooted. Ctrl + T combo won't function at all no new tab is created.

Expected Results:
text should be copied to clipboard with Ctrl + C and Ctrl + T should create new tab nothing happens in either case.

Mouse control using right click on address bar also fail to copy text to clipboard for later pasting. Rebooting appears to fix this error every time. No logical reason why it should fail in the first place. Has occurred multiple time since installing the last beta.
