[There's 2 scenarios: (A) and (B). Watch video to see scenario (B) ]

0. Open New Tab, click Gear button, uncheck "Include suggested sites". Adjust the window's height so that only 4 tile in a row were visible, and only 2 or 1 row were fully visible.
1. Fill all visible tile on New Tab +1 tile. If you already have enough site there to cause
overflow, then skip this step.
1.1. Open attached page, click textarea, press Ctrl+A to select all text, press Ctrl+C to copy
1.2. Press Ctrl+B to open bookmarks, click "Bookmarks Menu", press Ctrl+V to create bookmark
1.3. Right-click "Bookmarks Menu", click "Open all in tabs" menuitem.
2. Open New Tab, make sure that there's overflow on New Tab (vertical scrollbar is visible)
3.A) Click Gear button, select "Show blank page"
3.B) Delete extra tiles, so that the existing tab were fully visible (that mean that
there should be no overflow according to bug 1194895)
4. Click "New tab" button/press Ctrl+T to open new tab
5. Repeat Step 4.

Result: After Step 4 scrollbar is still visible. It disappears only after Step 5.
If I set browser.newtab.preload -> true then scrollbar disappears after Step 4.
Expectations: Scrollbar should disappear after Step 3.
