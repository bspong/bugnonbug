Firefox freeze upon starting the program.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_6; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.3 Safari/531.9

The only option to choose from the software menu bar above the browser is "FireFox". You can not close the browser from using the icon in the task bar, the only way to close it is to "force to quit". I have tired to download and reinstall firefox numerous time with the same results. This problem only started after I installed OSX 10.6 and I haven't had this problem with any other browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make sure 10.6 snow leopard is installed
2.Just start Firefox
3.It freezes, and have to "force to quit" because it will not close through normal procedures.
Actual Results:
It freezes. After opening and closing broswer enough time it go to a window that asks me to "restore window" and it ha 3 different option to choose from but is still frozen and won't do anything.

Expected Results:
It should load into the browser and allow me to surf the internet. It should not freeze.

I have tired to delete firefox and reinstall it, I have tired to reinstall OSX 10.6, I have tired to reinstall firefox without first deleting the previous version and nothing work to fix the bug. I have taken it to the Apple store and the Apple people I talked to don't believe it OSX 10.6, they believe it may be something wrong with in FireFox. I don't know what to think, all I know is I want my FireFox browser back. I miss it.
