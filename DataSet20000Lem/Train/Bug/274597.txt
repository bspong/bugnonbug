overflow: auto on tbody tag crash browser
Browser crashed immediately when it tried to render this page.
Removing the "overflow: auto" enabled page to be rendered.
The presence of actual <tbody> tag in the table doe make any
difference, but the presence of a <table> does. The following
message are written to the terminal when the crash occurs:

X Error of failed request: BadValue (integer parameter out of range for operation)
Major opcode of failed request: 12 (X_ConfigureWindow)
Value in failed request: 0x0
Serial number of failed request: 33707
Current serial number in output stream: 33715

This version is unoffically blessed for use here -- I will probably not be
able to load a newer one for a while.

Note: Netscape 7.0 on the same platform crash on this same page,
but w/o any message written to the terminal.

This page wa cut down to the minimum necessary to show the problem,
the original page contained a second, *much* larger table that the
"overflow: auto" style wa intended to apply to.
