GTK+ theme is only option for Linux install (why can't linux installs use the same icon a Windows?)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

When comparing Firefox4 installation between Microsoft Windows and Ubuntu Linux, one notice how the icon are different: the back button, forward button, home button, refresh button, etc. appear differently.

Google Chrome allows user the ability to select between a GTK+ theme and the MS-Windows "Classic" theme for Chrome installations. Opera display the same icon and theme for both Linux and Windows installations.

Why can't Linux Firefox user get the same icon a MS-Windows user get to use?

Firefox need to offer a setting that will allow user to pick either the GTK+ theme or the Firefox theme that is displayed in MS-Windows.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
A setting should exist like Google Chrome ha where user can select for display in Linux the same theme that is default in Windows installations.
