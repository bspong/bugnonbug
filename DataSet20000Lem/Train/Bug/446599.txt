The installer doe not create Desktop and StartMenu shortcut if it is run with unprivileged user and Custom setup is selected (tested with FF 2.0.0.16, 3.0 and 3.0.1). This doe not affect Standard setup.The QuickLaunch shortcut is always created. Additionally no "Add/Remove Programs" entry is created if the user doe not have admin privilege and regardelss of the setup type.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login with a standard user account.
2. Run FF installer for any of the mentioned versions.
3. Choose Custom setup.
4. Finish the installation.
5. Try to un-install FF.
Actual Results:
The browser is successfully installed, but no shortcut are created on the desktop or in the start menu. If the QuickLaunch icon wa selected at install time it is the only way to start FF without browsing the file system. Normal un-installation is not possible

Expected Results:
The shortcut selected during installation should be created in the user's profile. An entry should appear in "Add/Remove Programs" to allow the user to safely un-install FF (this is possible - install any game from www.alawar.com a a normal user; go to "Add/Remove Programs" and you will see an entry and it can be run by the same user or by an administrator; I consider this VERY user-friendly).
