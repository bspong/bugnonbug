browser.tabs.tabMinWidth

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.tabs.tabMinWidth = 80 (default is 100).
2. Open many tab in one window, enough to make the tab get narrower, and add twice again more. In total, maybe 20 tab in a 1400 pixel wide screen.
3. Optionally, close a tab (not the first tab) and notice how it leaf an open gap in the tab bar.
Actual Results:
Once a certain number of tab is reached, new tab become "invisible" or inaccessible - they do not show up on the tab bar. (Even if you close enough tab to get down to a number which would normally fit on the tab bar without shrinkage.) They do not show up in the drop-down list on the right side. You may be able to cycle through to them using Cmd-Tab, but even if you activate an invisible tab, the page is not displayed in the main content area (just a blank gray space) and there is no URI in the Location bar.

Also, if you close a middle tab once this error ha occurred, a "gap" remains in the tab bar, like the smile of someone missing a tooth.

Expected Results:
The browser.tabs.tabMinWidth should behave a expected:

1) As more tab are opened than would fit on the tab bar, tab should gracefully get narrowed down to the browser.tabs.tabMinWidth value.

2) Once more tab open than would fit (even at browser.tabs.tabMinWidth), the overflow should be accessible using side scrolling and the drop down menu.

3) Tabs shouldn't disappear.

4) There shouldn't be gap left in the tab bar.

5) Page content should display properly.

6) The URI should be displayed in the Location bar.

This problem disappeared once I reset browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to it default value (100), even without restarting the browser.

Granted, not a lot of casual user will change the browser.tabs.tabMinWidth value, but I came across it because LifeHacker made it one of their top 10 Firefox hacks.
