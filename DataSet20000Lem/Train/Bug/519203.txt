ever since upgrading to firefox 3.5, it will just decide to close. Sometimes I cannot even type in the website name before the box pop up and say firefox ha to close. Then when I re-run it, it say oops this is embarassing but we cannot restore your tabs. Then I click the info box and it tell me this is my problem:
