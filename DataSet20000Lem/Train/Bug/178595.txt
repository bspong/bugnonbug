The webpage http://www.buy.com/, correctly load up. It however continues to
refresh without stopping. As it is looping, the bottom of the page resizes
sqweezing the formating of the page up then back to the right side. it go
back and forth like a see-saw in this motion continuously. It also make this
same resizing loop efect when viewing an inside link, i.e. cliking on a
category. The effect doe not stop when the stop button is pushed on the
toolbar, it only continues to loop.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open phoenix
2.go to http://www.buy.com/
3.the problem start a the page doe not stop, it continuously loop a page
resize reload.

Actual Results:
the page continuously loops, after hitting the stop button, it start back from
its(phoenix) original static position and begin to loop again. the page will
also continue to loop in the background and will be looping if you come back to
it from another program.

Expected Results:
the end result should be: the webpage should not be allowed by phoenix to
continuously feed a resize if it is not able to recognize it request.

The problem ha not been identified in viewing other webpages, so it may be a
language specific bug. I am using phoenix with the orbit 3+1 theme. I have not
replicated the bug with the classic theme.
