Firefox white-screens with little provocation

(OS is actually Windows XP x64 SP2.)

Periodically — say, three or four time a month . . . though it's been happening more frequently lately — my XP x64 computer abruptly go to a white screen and lock up. The only recovery is power cycling the box. In all of the many instances, save one, I wa doing something innocuous in Firefox. Might have been clicking a button on a page or maybe a combo box. Sometimes I think I have actually been typing into a text box. No pattern to the site on which it occurs; I would venture to say that I have never seen it happen on the same site twice, but wouldn't swear by it. I usually have about five apps open with a gig of memory in the box.

The white screen appearance is just that. Not a BSOD, not a fatal-error dialog box. A few time it ha been a white screen with one-pixel-wide vertical blue line in it. No response to screen or keyboard. After power cycling, all program start normally. Most of the time Firefox brings back the tab I had open. Other time it forgets those tab (which really irritates me).

Problem ha occurred over the several release of Firefox 3.0. I can't recall whether it happened in 2.0 or not.

Glad to provide any other info that will be of help. I've finally grown tired of putting up with this behavior.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Hard to tell. Screen just turn white when I "do something" (click or type) in Firefox.
Actual Results:
White screen and no recovery short of power cycling. Needless to say, any unsaved work in other apps is lost.

Expected Results:
Well . . . it shouldn't white screen.
