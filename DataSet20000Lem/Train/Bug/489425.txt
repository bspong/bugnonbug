When attempting to add a new folder in the "Edit this bookmark" dialogue box the text input hangs.

How I get this bug- I am trying to edit a bookmark by clicking on the book icon in the address bar of Firefox.A "Edit this bookmark" dialogue box then open under the address bar. I then click on the "+" sign to expand this dialogue box to include the "New Folder" button. I click on the "New Folder" button and a new folder appears in the expanded menu a it should with the New Folder text highlighted and ready for your input to change. This is where the bug happens. I start entering a new folder name and the character will not appear changed in the dialogue box for at least 20 second after I am done typing. I can speed this up by taking my mouse pointer and moving it back and forth inside the dialogue box but even with this strange step it requires a second or two for the text to change.
