In the 3.0b1 build the new tab get the keyboard focus when a tab is selected. It mean that the keyboard cannot be used for navigation and scrolling. In the past you had to double-click the tab to put the keyboard foxus on the tab, which I believe is infinitely better. You should ask the question: what is more important, navigating/scrolling in the page, or switching tabs? I think the answer should be obvious.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a window with several tab
2. Select a tab
3. Try to navigate or scroll using the keyboard
Actual Results:
The shortcut for the current page (navigation, scrolling, reload, etc) don't work. You can only switch tabs.

Expected Results:
Shortcuts for the current page should just work.

Navigating in the page I'm reading (which are action to take a lot) is infinitely more important than switching tab (which are action that are used sporadically). Now I need to select the page separately, usually even twice because the first click doesn't stick (which is a bug by itself). It's a definite regression from FF 2.x.
