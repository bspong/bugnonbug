User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040130 Firebird/0.8.0+

After opening the customize navigation toolbar window, regardless of whether
change are made, the right-click context menu for deleting bookmark from the
bookmark toolbar no longer deletes the bookmark.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click navigation toolbar.
2. Select 'customize'.
3. Click 'done'.
4. Right-click any bookmark on the bookmark toolbar.
5. Select 'delete'.

Actual Results:
Context menu will disappear and/or close any open bookmark toolbar menu. The
bookmark is still there, though.

Expected Results:
Bookmark should have been deleted.

I have verified this on the branch build mentioned above a well a the branch
build from 01/28. Each build is installed on a completely separate computer,
with one running Windows 2000 Professional and the other running Windows XP.

Windows 2000 build: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6)
Gecko/20040128 Firebird/0.7+

Windows XP build: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7a)
Gecko/20040130 Firebird/0.8.0+

Both system produce the same results. Closing Firebird and restarting cause
the functionality to work again.
