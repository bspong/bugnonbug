In a GMail message (originally found in GMail message, but might occur on other pages), the scroll bar becomes cut off at the bottom. On scrolling, the bottom of the "pill" never appears no matter how far it is scrolled. On scroll down, it is impossible to view lower section of the page; maximum scroll is to about 7/8 the way down the page. Refresh doesn't solve the problem, nor doe minimizing/maximizing the conversation in GMail. Leaving GMail and then reentering appears to possibly have an effect.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to GMail
2. View a recieved message with length longer than 1 screen height (for best effect, try 2-3 screen heights)
3. Note the lack of a bottom edge of the pill in the up-down scroll bar.

(if 3 is correctly noted)
4. Attempt to scroll all the way down the page. Note that this is impossible.
5. If quick-reply box is visible, attempt to reply. Note that the bottom of reply box is inaccessible (scroll up and down to verify).
6. Refresh page. Note that the bottom of the pill doe appear for a split-second during page load and is then replaced by the buggy scroll bar.
Actual Results:
Actual result described in step to reproduce section.

Expected Results:
Bottom of pill appears, page is able to be scrolled completely up and down.

Default setting were used. Plugins installed and active were NoScript and Rikaichan.
