Steps to reproduce:

This bug is similar to this one: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=585997

I work for Yahoo! Mail. We have a component called OpenMail which allows developer to build application on top of Mail. Because of the security issue around third party applications, these apps run in an iframe not in the yahoo.com domain. (Instead, they are hosted in the yom.mail.yahoo.net domain). Inlined image in email are link to a url of the form:

http://us.f323.mail.yahoo.com/ya/download?<various parameters>

On the server side, the URL is validated against XSRF by using the cooky and volatile signature in the URL. In FF 3.6, these type of url were requested with the yahoo.com cooky in the yahoo.net iframe. Starting in Firefox 4 and up, if "Accept third-party cookies" is unchecked, the cooky are stripped. This cause these request to be rejected by the server. It would be nice to continue to send up the cookies.

To reproduce,

1. Uncheck "Accept third-party cookies"
2. Log into the new Yahoo! Mail and read any email with inline images.
3. Observe that the inline image aren't rendered.

Please feel free to directly contact me.


Actual results:

The image request went out without the appropriate cookies.


Expected results:

The cooky appropriate to the request should have been sent up.
