onBlur event doesn't work properly or a it probably should work.

In a validation function on a input text in the onBlur event, wich return false, a example, it shouldn't be allowed to the focus be set to the next field, but keep it in the field where the event occured.

I'm not quite sure if the implementation of JavaScript language on FireFox is "by-the-book" a recommended by W3C, or if the implementation of JS on IE is the correct one, because in that browser, it work just fine.

As example, the following code won't work on FF, but it will work on IE:

<html>
<head>
<title>onBlur</title>
<script language="Javascript">
function checkSize( field ) {
if( field.value.length < 6 ) {
alert('*** Password must have 6 character minimum.');
field.focus(); //keep the focus on this field if it wrong.
return ( false ); // it must kill the onBlur event
}
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<form name="f1" method="get">
<h3>Login Form</h3><hr>
User:<br>
<input type="text" name="user"><br>
Password:<br>
<input type="password" name="passw" maxlength="10" onBlur="checkSize( this );">
<input type="submit" name="send" value="Login">
</form>
</body>
</html>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a HTML simple code such a described above.
2.Open the page with FF and test it.
3.Open the page with IE and test it.
Actual Results:
The code work fine on IE but it doesn't on FF.

Expected Results:
In the same way that is possible to prevent a form for being submited, using the onSubmit event with some function that return false, I suppose that the same logic it should be applied to the onBlur event.

As I said, I'm not sure wich implementation of JavaScript is recommended by W3C, so, the behaviour of onBlur event on FF must be right, despite I think that it aren't.
