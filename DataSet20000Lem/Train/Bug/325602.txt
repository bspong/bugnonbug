New version of Firefox temporarily freeze Outlook Express when clicking on an email link

I have just downloaded the newest version of Firefox, which you prompted me to do. When I receive an email on Outlook Express, and that email contains a link, if I click on that link, the action freeze OE entirely for a about two minute (sometimes longer) until the linked page is opened in Firefox.

The length of time this action previously took wa le than five seconds, and it did not freeze OE during that time.

This development greatly reduces the effectiveness of your web browser and it interface with OE and significantly slows my ability to work.

Kindly repair this bug

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Went to OE
2. clicked on a link
3. Waited.....

Actual Results:
Page took 1 minute and 40 second to download and OE wa frozen the entire time

Expected Results:
I would expect that page would download nearly instantaneously with no freezing of OE during the downloading process
