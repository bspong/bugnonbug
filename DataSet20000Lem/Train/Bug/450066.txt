When using web capture tool (e.g., Scrapbook, UltraRecall), if I capture an email from Gmail, the URL captured is not the one displayed on the location bar, but rather something ending: qygpcgurkovy, regardless of the actual URL of the relevant email.

I reported this problem to the UltraRecall developers, and they confirmed in an email to me: "the URL that Firefox put on the clipboard with the HTML format doe always end in qygpcgurkovy. I don't know why, but it's a Firefox issue."

This problem also exists under Win XP SP3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a particular email in Gmail.
2. Highlight some text, copy to clipboard, and then capture in Scrapbook or UltraRecall.
3. Click the "Open URL" option - nothing happens, a the URL captured by these utility is wrong (se above).
Actual Results:
Wrong URL captured, see above.

Expected Results:
It should have captured the URL displayed in the FF location bar.
