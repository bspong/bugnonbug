simply FireFox crash

On two different machines, configured similarly, but not exactly the same -- after using Firefox for a few minute -- going forward and backwards, browsing in a rather normal fashion, Firefox crash -- and unfortunately to the degree that it's impossible for me to discover why (it allows no reporting nor bug fix but push -- disappears entirely. Will not then reload without crashing again... Quite frustrating. Has occurred only since installing build .10 and .11 -- not sure at all how/why.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use in normal fashion
2. select link
3. go forward or backward (use webmail, which refreshes page)
Actual Results:
Not entirely clear, sorry. Just pauses, seems to hang, then crash -- wont allow me to select either report or debug -- then disappears and will not come back up. Suprised that it's allowing me to finish this form.

Expected Results:
Same a above

Continue to function normally -- allow forward/back button use; screen refresh while using webmail package...
