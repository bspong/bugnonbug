Launch take Up to 10 Minutes after Install of Firefox 3.0.12
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.12) Gecko/2009071200 SUSE/3.0.12-0.1.2 Firefox/3.0.12

Launch of Firefox became >5 and up to 10 minute with install of 3.0.12. *Different* behavior on same installation depending on which user log in. I run KDE 4.1 / OpenSuSE 11.1, and now Firefox 3.0.12. I speculate that this is some sort of the KDE equivalent of 501605 & related to 479078 & 507162.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in a "Work" user (KDE 4.1 / OpenSuSE 11.1)
2. Launch FireFox 3.0.12




I run OpenSuSE 11.1 w/ KDE (4.1) and Firefox straight from the OpenSuSE main repository & keep up to date with all patch via the distro. Hardware is a Lenovo with Core-2-Duo, 2G RAM, and 150GB drive, w separate system and home partition (+ 2 seldom mounted recovery partitions.)

On install of FireFox 3.0.12 (via SuSE / YAST) launch of Firefox became order-of-magnitude slower *under my main account - call it "Work"* Under a second account - call it "Personal", launch is no different.

- Network is fine. Opera and Thunderbird launch quickly & operate fine.

- Site speed, javascript, bookmarks, seems unlikely. Pages load & render immediately once it starts.

Because they are two different user on the same installation and hardware, gotta be difference between the users. Differences between the two:

1 - I do a lot le under the Personal account. It's essentially for netbook-equivalent browsing and some media. ?KDE or Linus temporary / working file creation not getting cleaned up?

2 - Way more apps installed under Work account.

3 - So "Work" user would have lot more temp & config info in browser, desktop (kde), and user account directories.

4 - Personal wiki off in /opt with *huge* number of files. Takes forever to load or manipulate. *Wiki location is readable by Work user, but not Personal.*
