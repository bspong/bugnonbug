After using Firefox 3.0.1 (issue also exists in Firefox 3.0) on Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit), and closing the browser (all frames), the firefox.exe process will remain and use 100% of one CPU core. (Definitely affect dual-core systems, may affect solo-core)

2. Browse web site (prolonged period of time with various site seems to increase this)
3. Close Firefox
4. Attempt to open Firefox again, and see a dialog indicating that Firefox is already running
5. Open Task Manager and find firefox.exe using 100% of one core.
Actual Results:
Firefox process (firefox.exe) keep running, (stuck in an infinite loop?) and requires a force quit (end process) to be able to use Firefox again.

Expected Results:
Firefox close and open properly every time.
