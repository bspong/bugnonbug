When I go to visit a website such a Google, Reddit, Wikipedia, or any other site that change link color after visiting it, the color doesn't change. In the case that it doe change, refreshing the page just reverts it back to the unvisited color. I have to tell you though, never before have I been so annoyed by a sea of blue links.

In any case, the link I did visit before this problem presented itself about a week ago still remain purple - my choice color for visited links. It is only the new link that I have visited within the past week that remain blue for seemingly no reason.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.google.com
2. Do a search for Mozilla.
3. Click on an unvisited link.
4. Once in the new web page, go back to the previous page. It will appear a unvisited.
5. If the link color show a having been visited, refresh the page. It will revert color back to unvisited.
Actual Results:
Unvisited link color remains unvisited (in this case, blue link remain blue after clicking through).

Expected Results:
Unvisited link color should change color (in this case, link should turn from blue to purple after clicking through, and remain that way even after refreshing the page).

I will offer any additional information when asked. At this point, I do not know what is relevant or not.
