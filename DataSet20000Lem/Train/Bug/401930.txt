Open Firefox and about 55.6K size is shown in Process; open 5 tab and the size grows to 135K; over time, more CPU is used (2 Gigs) and eventually hose the system to the point that Ctl+Alt+Del will not present itself. Shutting down Firefox (if you can; it will go non-responsive) restores the response of the system.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just use Firefox and it eventually will go non-responsive over a few hour use.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
This seems to have started on 29 Oct and ha gotten progressively worse. It appears to be a memory utilization issue and the program seems to be hanging on callbacks. The access to the Internet slows over time (sending an upload command take 3 to 10 seconds, which is abnormal) and it is not the bandwidth to the Internet because the bandwidth test show all is normal.

Expected Results:
When Firefox is shut down, the System restores to a responsive state forcing me to use Internet Explorer or Safari for Windows a a backup.

The current version of Firefox becomes unusable. BTW, Safari is faster under a similar usage configuration (using the same tab to the same websites).
