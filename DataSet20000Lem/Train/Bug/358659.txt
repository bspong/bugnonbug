Preferences UI isn't big enough by default to display all control on all pages; and it ha no scrollbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Edit -> Preferences
2. Select the "Main" page. Notice that the option to have Fx (or BonEcho) check if it is the default browser is not visible.
3. Drag the bottom border of the UI downwards.
4. Notice that more control appear at bottom, above the "Help and "Close" buttons.

Actual Results:
The UI is too small by default (some control are hidden at bottom and/or at right on their respective pages) and it ha no scrollbar.

Expected Results:
a) The UI popup should come up big enough for the largest content page.
b) Even if resized, it should have a vertical and/or a horizontal scrollbar whenever part of it content is hidden.

Additional info:
This may or may not be related to the problem: I see the following in red at the bottom of the Preferences UI, on all it pages, below the "Help" and "Close" buttons:

<prefpane id="paneDownloads" label="&paneDownloads.title;"
----^
