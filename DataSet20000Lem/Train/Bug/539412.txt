I wa happily surfing and watching a video with sound just fine tonight, when Windows Update (I have Vista) decided to take over my computer and shut down and reboot to update. When the system rebooted, Mozilla decided to update itself a well...ah whatever, I thought. So then I restarted and went to finish watching my webpage, and NO sound. Even youtube doesn't give me sound. I updated Flash and updated Java, no love. So, I thought it would be smart to update to your beta, so I'm on build 3.6 a listed above, still doesn't work. I have an HP Laptop, Pavilion DV7-1245DX notebook, Vista. LOVE your product and have for years, hence why I also wanted to give beta a try. Anyways, I truly have no sound in Mozilla but I do with Media Player and other apps. Thanks guy - keep up the great work!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Windows Update
2.Mozilla Update
3.Java Update
Actual Results:
I restarted Mozilla, and have not had sound since inside Mozilla.

Expected Results:
I expected the sound to still work after updates, I guess?

Well, Mozilla could have given me the OPTION of updating instead of just doing it for me. I suppose there's a setting for that I should change?
