Doorhanger layout need to be refreshed/repainted in the background.
The doorhanger notification box in Firefox need to be refreshed/repainted in the background after the tab in use is closed/switched/changed otherwise it flash the last checked (in case of site identity icon) information and icon for approx 1/10 of a second on the next tab that we encounter ie on the next tab, clicking on the site identity icon reveals previously viewed/clicked site identity doorhanger info (the whole layout) for a flash of a second before displaying/repainting the info/encryption icon of the current site and sometimes this visually can be mistaken to be a top to bottom transitional animation with the worst possible fps rate.

I've noticed these irregular repaintings/just in time repaintings/spontaneous repainting in two instance where box size matter too .

1.Site identity block/icon (https <-> http etc. Generally all doorhangers of this size.
2.Geolocation <-> click to play <-> the offline page request (boxes of this doorhanger size).

The rest of doorhangers. Including the download manager initial doorhanger display which apparently (first download after starting Firefox) show it on the left of the screen before getting repainted and displayed in it designated space (right).

Why not get a patch that give a boolean pref or something in about:config that let u alter repainting frequency in Firefox theme elements? That would be neat.
