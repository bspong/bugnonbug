Accessible hierarchy incomplete/incorrect
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/412.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/412.5
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5 Beta 2

When examining the Firefox hierarchy when using AT-POKE, I can only see
the following component (parent first, child next):

Gecko (role=application)
Mozilla Firefox Start Page - Mozilla Firefox Beta2 (role=frame)
<no name> (role=panel)

I should be able to go much deeper than this.

Furthermore, when I get an AT-SPI event from Firefox and examine the
hierarchy upwards from the event source, I cannot get to the top level
application object. Instead, the top level object is one who's role is
"invalid." Here's an example when looking at slashdot (children first,
parent next). In this output, the string in parenthesis is the name of
the object and the trailing string is the accessible role a reported by
the AT-SPI:

--> parent=(Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters) html container
--> parent=() panel
--> parent=() scroll pane
--> parent=() panel
--> parent=(Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matter - Mozilla Firefox Beta 2) frame
--> parent=(Mozilla) invalid
--> obj=(Mozilla) parent=(None)

I should be able to get to the Application object and should also not encounter any
object with invalid role names.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox
2. Run AT-POKE
3. Examine Firefox hierarchy using AT-SPI


Actual Results:
Shown above

Expected Results:
I should be able to get a much more detailed hierarchy when moving down the parent/child relationship
in Firefox using AT-POKE.

When I get an event from Firefox, I should be able to go up the hierarchy and reach the application
object.
