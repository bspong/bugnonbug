I use french firefox 3.0, Alt + left arrow, Alt + right arrow, etc, work on an intermittent basis, on the website I gave earlier it wasn't working, 5 min later it wa working, it did also do it on your website during the f... registration, that is another problem, why should I have to register to let you know that you product is falty and not working properly. It is surely good when you have some dedicated user that search all day for flaw and report them but for an average user just to report some error once. The only 2 reason I took the time to register is first cause I'm in vacation. I wouldn't normally take the time to register to advise you about a error, I would use another browser (and if it would happen to often I would change browser definitly, and it's how I started to use your product). In order to register I had first to create another email address cause I don't want you to have my personnal email addresse to send me junk mail or even just information about other bug for this application, and then we have to follow your registration steps. All this time just to say "It doesn't work" nothing more. The second reason I did register wa to show how dumm this process is, you surely filter prank and false repport but a process like this just refrain people to use it you also restrict yourself from having all the feedback and create frustration toward your company. It may not be worthed to say it but you were my #1 company and I wa recommending your product up till today.
