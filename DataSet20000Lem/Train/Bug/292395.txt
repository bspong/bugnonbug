I have been able to duplicate this problem on many different site but not on my
own volition (including this

submission form, right now). This bug is extremely elusive (and not to mention,
extremely annoying and

counter-productive!) and it show up once every few day for me. More detail
below:

Browser operation work fantastic for an extended period of time, then something
change and this bug rear it's

ugly head for no reason that I can find. I cannot reproduce this bug at will
since I see no pattern to it other

than it occurs on page with text entry form boxes. Here are the individual
problem that occur, which all seem related to the same cause.

1) I notice the problem when I can no longer move the text cursor with the arrow
key whle editing the text box. When

this occurs, the apostraphe (') key doe something really, really odd. When I
press that key (for example, when

typing "can't"), the apostraphe is typed into the text box, but it then invokes
the Find bar at the bottom of the

window and change focus to the find box, a if I had pressed CTRL+F. If I
press the Backspace key while in the Find box, it can either go back to the
previous page (which loses my form data and ton of work time!) or it page up
in the web page.

2) Selecting text inside the text box using the arrow key becomes impossible.
I notice on this form when I hold Shift and press Left, it start to select the
text above this field.

3) Selecting text with the mouse inside the form text entry box works, but
CTRL+C or CTRL+X doesn't do anything at all. Right -clicking the selected text
brings up the context menu, but Undo Cut Copy Paste Delete are all greyed out
with Select All being the only available option.

4) Choosing Select All in the right-click context menu or by pressing CTRL+A
while text focus is inside the text entry box selects all text on the page
outside of the form field rather than selecting the text *inside* the field.

5) Drop-down menu no longer drop down when clicked. The arrow key have to be
used to select the appropriate item in the menu.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
No known reproduction steps. There is no pattern I could find.


Expected Results:
1) The arrow key should always be able to move the text cursor inside a text
box. Focus should never be changed unless the mouse is clicked in another area
of the page

2) Related to item #1, selecting text using the arrow key should always work.

3) When selecting text with the mouse, Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete should
always be available and functional.

4) While focus is inside the text box, Select All should select all text inside
the text box rather than text *outside* the box.

5) Drop down box should always drop down. They should never "refuse" to do so.

Additionally, form data should never be lost.

Using default theme.
Uninstalled all extensions.
Tried uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling, to no avail.
