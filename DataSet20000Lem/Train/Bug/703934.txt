Steps to reproduce:

Go to (http://www.nbc.com/chuck/exclusives/awesome-and-ellie/#item=204487) and look at the photo viewer in the middle of the page. Notice there are duplicate picture on the bottom (small versions) which don't match the larger image. When clicking on these smaller versions, the large version picture are actually all different. The site display correctly in Internet Explorer.

This problem also occurs on the other three section in the middle of the page ("Awesome & Ellie's Photos"):
1) Awesome's Expectant Father's Guide
2) What's In a Baby Name?


Actual results:

Smaller version of the photo don't match the actual larger version or are duplicated on the bottom.


Expected results:

When the smaller image are loaded, they should be all different and match the larger picture being shown. See the side by side comparison with Firefox on the left and Internet Explorer on the right along with note on the image themselves.
