When text is dragged in FF3 it show a preview of the text being dragged. This preview often (almost always when various size of text are involved or when large text is involved) show up incorrectly. The anti-aliasing is wrong (all aliased pixel appear to be black), and it look very messy. In addition, colored text, when dragged get an uneven black border around (again, it appears to be the aliasing)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit Yahoo.com (will work on most website that don't just have basic text)
2. Select, in the featured story section, the title & description of a story
3. Drag it
Actual Results:
The dragged text ha broken anti-aliasing

Expected Results:
The dragged text should look identical to the original (except transparent if that is the effect wanted)

Default theme, running Aero on Vista
Cleartype (anti-aliasing) is turned on (default for all Vista users), although disabling cleartype (without restarting FF) doesn't appear to fix the issue (although the original text loses the aliasing, the dragged version still seems to have black aliased pixels)
