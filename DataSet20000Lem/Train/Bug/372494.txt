Firefox will not let me "allow pop ups" for this website. I have set firefox to not EVER block popups for any page, and STILL, it block popups. I've restarted

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Go to www.AnthonyGoicolea.com
3. Click "Photography"
4. Open any of his album
5. Firefox will likely try to block them, click allow for this website
6. It work for average... 5-10 images? (that is opening in new windows)
7. At some point it will begin blocking them, even though it say it is set to allow popups from the site.
8. Firefox must then be restarted all over again to see open more images. I've set my preference (Tools/Options/Content/uncheck "block popup windows") to not block any popups, still with no change (and after restarting repeatedly).
Actual Results:
Firefox continued to block popup window to said website, after 1) making the site an exception and/or 2) setting firefox popup blocker to not block any website, regardless

Expected Results:
Allowed image window (in http://www.anthonygoicolea.com/NewAnthonySite/pages/watermain.html, for instance) to open.

Each time this happens, I already have multiple image window from this site open, but minimized. It doesn't happen when a certain number of window minimized is reached, but, in my case, I have always had other window open (right now, 13).
