Hi ,

I am having two php page , one first page i have done onsubmit (javascript) validation and in the last field of the same page i.e before the submit button i have simple validation on "Onblur " event both is working fine in IE but in mozilla i am facing some problem i.e it is going to next page eventhough user entered an invalid entry in the last field , the onsubmit javascript function is returning boolean value T/F . Please help me how to proceed further ?

Reproducible: Always




This is very important feature problem , since on submit we have to do some form validation and the same applies to field also when they loos their focus to next element , when you do the combine double validation Mozilla fails to stay in the main page and showing error message. i.e once we have enter the invalid entry in the field and at the same time if you use mouse to submit the false value it will go to next page ? it cannot be happened ? since my function is working fine in IE , if the development team need further code example mean just mail me i will provide that

Thanks
Regards,
Vijay
