At any site where a download is launched, a second copy of Firefox or what appears in what I would call a half-size instance of the browser will pop up covering around half of the original instance immediately a the download button is pressed. (I use IDM an a download manager). This doe not occur with [every] session when downloading, and is easily dismissed but is just a minor annoyance.

Subsequent to this occurence, the download progress normally.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to launch a normal download.
2. A second instance of the browser appears in half size covering approximately 50% of the original browser and always on the left.
3. The second instance of the browser is easily dismissed by pressing the "x".
Actual Results:
The same result a outlined in the detail above on this form,(intermittently).

Expected Results:
Would expect launching a download method to continue normally with no interference by the instance of a second copy of the browser appearing and blocking view of original browser.
