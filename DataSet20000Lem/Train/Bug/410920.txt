When I use a search function or use a submit button within the website, it take me to the results. When I go back after doing so, and search for new result or submit new information, the button will not respond until I refresh the page. This ha happened on several different websites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. For example, I go to http://www.ssynth.co.uk/~gay/anagram.html
2. I put in a scrambled word for it to solve (for example = ldyahoi), and click "go do it" (submit)
3. It take me to the next page with result (holiday, etc).
4. I click "back" and put in a different scrambled word for it to solve (for example = nedihclr), and click "go do it" (submit) again.
5. It doe not respond or go to the results.
6. I click the "reload" button in the toolbar, and click submit again.
7. It finally go to the result (children)
Actual Results:
I had to refresh to get the button to respond.

Expected Results:
I should not have to refresh to get the button to respond, simply going "back" from the page of result should be sufficient.

It doe not have the problem when I use the IE tab. It ha had this problem with just about every website with search functions.
