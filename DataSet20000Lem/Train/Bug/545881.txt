While working within the eBay website and doing a search for another item, an additional tab open in the tab bar with the same parameter a the eBay item.

I am not sure if this is due to an eBay error in programming that effect Firefox or a Firefox error triggered by eBay. It ha occurred multiple time in the past two weeks.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. tried search from general eBay screen with no previous search performed

2. entered specific topic (ruby) enter

3. when result were displayed entered additional sub category (ruby rings)



Actual Results:
After result within eBay displayed an additional web search tab opened. Appears with random search engines. Sometimes Bing, Sometimes Google, Never Yahoo. I use all of them.



Expected Results:
Should have been a website specific search and not opened additional general browser search tab with same data search specifications.

Could also have occurred when opening specific vendor and doing sub category search within vendor.

This only seems to occur on the first category search within a tab. Subsequent search do not open the additional web search. When moving to a different tab and doing a search for the first time, the addition web search tab opens.
