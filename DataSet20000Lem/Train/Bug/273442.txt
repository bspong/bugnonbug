Firefox hang often when running it on KDE
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0 StumbleUpon/1.999

This is a bit of a tricky bug to report, because... well, it's very strange.
Whenever I run Firefox (1.0, but it wa present in earlier version too) under
KDE (3.3.1, haven't tested earlier versions) the browser hang at unpredictable
times. The browser doe not crash though; the hang only last a good five
second or so.

It is extremely annoying though. The complete UI becomes unresponsive, and all
Firefox windows, not just the one I have open, freeze. Other application
continue to behave normally.

Under other window manager such a Fluxbox and other desktop such a GNOME, I
never have this problem. Firefox run perfectly. But under KDE, it happens
quite often.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox 1.0 on KDE 3.3.x (probably any 3.x though) and just start using
it a you normally would.
2. Keep using it until Firefox hang
3. Wait for the browser to hang. When it does, wait it out and it will
eventually go back to normal.

Actual Results:
browser hang at unpredictable time

Expected Results:
browser should behave normally under any desktop and not hang

Using Arch Linux (current) with Firefox 1.0 downloaded from mozilla.org and
vanilla KDE 3.3 a packed by the Arch Linux maintainer
