The web page construction is done by different servlets. Four different component are involved in that.
1.Parent -> <HTML></HEAD><BODY onload = "focusOnForm()">
2.ServletErrorHandler - > IF error present then <SCRITP>alert()</SCRIPT>
3.OnlineServlet -> <FORM></FORM>
4.FooterParent - > </BODY></HTML>

focusOnForm is been defined inside the <FORM> tag.

The problem is when an exception is occur on the page the ServletErrorHandler invoked the method to display the error on screen in alert box, when we clicked on the OK button of the alert box the page get blanked.


Error console of the Firefox display the "focusOnForm() is not defined" and point to the first line of the webpage.
I had used the Firebug to debug and found the scopchain for the error being displayed a :
"Call event=Event load, Window com.x.olb3.process.finance.OnlineServlet?exception=No+Account+has+been+specified.%5Cn%5CnFor+queries%2C+please+contact+our+Client+Support+Centre+=Call 1=window"

Reproducible: Sometimes
