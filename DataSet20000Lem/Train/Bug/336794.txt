using form.submit(); on a file upload form trigger repeated Javascript time out warning
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20060202 Fedora/1.0.7-1.2.fc4 Firefox/1.0.7

When using form.submit() to trigger the uploading of a POST form of a multipart/form-data encoded form post with a file upload cause firefox to bring up a dialog after a few second claiming that "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.".

Clicking continue will only dismiss the first dialog, a shortly after another appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
build a standard HTML 4.0 form upload in HTML except put an onclick handler on a button tag of type button and in the handler do a "form.submit();" and point the "target" of the form to an iframe on the page. (the iframe, however is NOT required a the same thing occurs when doing a normal targetless post).

Actual Results:
On linux, the "slow script" warning appears repeatedly, and the browser appears to freeze while the file is being uploaded. On win32 it doe not appear (nor doe the browser appear to freeze when uploading). Have not tested Mac OS X.

Expected Results:
The file to upload in the background.

This "trick" is being used a lot more in web application to provide asynchronous background file uploads and file upload progress bars, site include gmail.com, ringo.com, and myspace.com, and many more.

And thus far it seems specific to linux build (using stock 1.5.0.x from Mozilla.com and Fedora Builds yeilds same result of 1.0.x and 1.5.0.x)

It seems a though the browser is hanging in the form.submit() call and the javascript watchdog is interpreting it a stuck in js, when it's really stuck in the browser file upload code.
