Hi there. Installed the new Acrobat 7.0 professional. Now when I try to open a
PDF file on the following web page, the software run for a while then say
"stopped." Everything freeze and won't respond to key clicks.

Try to open the PDF to the right of "doc 2105"



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just go to that web site and try to open the PDF file in the left collum
under "curr"
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Had to restart Firefox.

By the way, I then used IE 6.0 and tried the same thing and the PDF opened
without any problem. so this must be a firefox issue with acrobat 7.0 PRO

Expected Results:
Been opeing this file every time until installed Acrobat 7.0 Professional

I also installed Micro trend antivirus and firewall prior to this problem but I
shut it off (I think) and tried to open the pdf file again - same result.
Meanwhile, opened PDF in IE 6.0 with no problem with Micro Trend antivirus and
firewall operating. Pretty sure this is an Acrobat 7.0 issue and not antivirus
or firewall problem.
