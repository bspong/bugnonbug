Firefox will not hide or minimize when a window is open, or if I try to put another program window in front of it. I have to close the window to get rid of it. It happened in the last one a well. I also noticed another bug. Sometimes form and drop down menu on certain site such a a banking site or even myspace do not work. You cannot type anything into the form box or even select the form drop down like for a country or state menu.
