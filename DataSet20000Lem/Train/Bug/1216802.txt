Detect when password element are visible on a page
Should we show degraded UI when a password field is not visible on a page?

For example, go to http://www.nytimes.com/ and you see the degraded UI (lock with strike through). The user may have no intention of logging in and may not ever click on the login button on the top right[1]. So why are we bothering them with this struck through lock?

On the other hand, assume the user see's the globe in the url bar. Then they decide to login and click the login button. They are focused on completing the action of logging in. They see an overlay (not a page reload just the overlay) and focus on that and type their username and password. If we wait to change the globe to a stuck-through lock at that point, we are probably too late.

Is there a way we can tell if a password field is visible? These are the tip I received[2].

[1] The login button on the top right is actually a display:none div on the page.

document.getElementById('password-field').getBoundingClientRect().bottom is 0 when the field isn't visible, and it's some other number when it is (and that number _should_ be <= document.documentElement.clientHeight). Also check visibility, display elements, and opacity.
