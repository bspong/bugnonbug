Our Darwin server stream H.264 and Apple MPEG-4 to Safari Mac and Firefox 3 on Windows with no major problems. Also stream to Firefox 2 on Mac with no problem.

When I open the same stream with Firefox 3, QuickTime 7.6 on Mac OS 10.5, the video play fine for the first 12 second or so and then hangs. From that point there is a total breakdown in the decoder. There are large block artifact with smaller block sliding around the picture. It never fully recovers.

I've seen it on system with QT 7.6 pro and non-pro. With and without the Flip4mac WMV component installed. Since the QT 7.6 plug-in work fine with Firefox 2 and Safari, it would seem to be a problem in Firefox 3 or in the way the plug-in work with Firefox 3.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Stream video to Firefox 3 on Mac OS 10.5 from Darwin streaming server.


Actual Results:
picture always play fine for a few second then freeze and play garbled from that point on.

Expected Results:
The same MPEG-4 and H.264 (.mp4) file play correctly to Firefox 3 on Windows, Firefox 2 on Mac OS 10.5 and Safari on Mac OS 10.5. All environment have QuickTime 7.6 plug-in.
