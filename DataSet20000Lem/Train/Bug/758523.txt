Firefox bookmark corrupted when moving from Ubuntu to Windows
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Build ID: 20120420145725

Steps to reproduce:

Summary: I've been sharing bookmark between Windows and Linux since at least 2008 using Subversion and more recently Git, synchronizing usually every day. After the latest Firefox update the bookmark have become corrupted only on Windows 7.

Exact steps:
1. Logged in to Ubuntu 12.04.
2. Browsed using Firefox 12.
3. Exited Firefox.
4. Ran sqlite3 vacuum <https://github.com/l0b0/tilde/blob/master/scripts/cleanup.sh> to minimize the size of the sqlite file in the top-level profile directory. I always do this before committing the file in Git.
5. cd'ed to the setting directory on the mounted Windows partition.
6. `git checkout .mozilla`, that is, reset the content of the Windows Firefox settings.
7. `git pull`, that is, retrieved the setting from the Linux repository.
8. Rebooted into Windows
9. Started Firefox 12 on Windows


Actual results:

All the bookmark have disappeared, but the bookmark folder are all still visible. In the Library window (Ctrl-Shift-B) it just show three bookmark with no icon and the title "(no title)". The folder are not shown either.


Expected results:

All the bookmark should still be visible, a they still are in Ubuntu.
