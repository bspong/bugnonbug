This occurs with the default theme. Not tested with other themes. It occurs in Normal Mode and Safe Mode. It occurs after uninstalling firefox and then reinstall doing a clean install and with a new profile too. Tested with javascript on and off, normal scroll and smooth scroll. Refreshing with Control+F5 make them disapprear for a while.

Maybe related to bug #376124 or #361768, but i'm not sure.
