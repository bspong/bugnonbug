Firefox page rendering broken when resizing from 1600x1200 to 1024x768
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.9.3

I usually work at a 1600x1200 resolution. However, when I access my computer via
RDP connection, the screen resolution get changed to 1024x768. Firefox itself
seems to be able to handle this change, the window get correctly resized.
However, the renderer still seems to think it's at 1600x1200: the horizontal
scroll bar disappears and table and text will be 1600 pixel wide with no
vertical scrollbar appearing, so the web page content beyond 1024 pixel is not
readable.
I can fix this problem only by closing Firefox and reopening at 1024x768. When I
open Firefox in 1024x768, change the resolution to 1600x1200 and later change
back to 1024x768, the problem doe not occur.
This problem doe also not occur with Mozilla, but ha occurred at least since
Firefox 0.6.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox in 1600x1200
2. Access the computer via MS Remote Desktop Client in 1024x768
3. Try to access a dynamically resizing web page, e.g. www.slashdot.org

Actual Results:
No horizontal scroll bar, no vertical scroll bar, content 1600 pixel wide.

Expected Results:
Horizontal scroll bar, vertical scroll bar appearing, content 1024 pixel wide.
