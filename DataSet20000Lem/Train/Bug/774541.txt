Steps to reproduce:

i have a homepage that get overflow-x: hidden; on the parent of a 10000px wide div.

<div style="width:880px;overflow:hidden">
<div style="width:10000px;">
<ul>
<li><!-- image that are scrollable horizontally using javascript--></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

if somebody is adressing this bug just send me a mail and i will give you the url to see for yourself, since i have no mac here it kinda hard to supply a test case otherwise.
the style are not inlined in the html too, just did that here to show the problem.


Actual results:

on mac o x in the newest firefox build (i dont have a hackintosh here right now so cant say which version exactly, it happened in the build before too though but seems to be a relatively new "random feature")
the overflow is registered correctly, until i scroll.
once i scrolled vertically i can also scroll horizontally.

maybe something bug because overflow is different in css3 than in css2 and the change for that are messing something up?


Expected results:

no vertical scroll at all
