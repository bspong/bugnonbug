URL autocompletion even when full URL specified
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031208 Firebird/0.7+ (Oxs G7 SSE optimized)

If I type a complete URL in the Firebird addressbar (e.g. http://test/) this is
changed by adding a "www." prefix and a ".com" suffix (e.g.
http://www.test.com/). This behaviour can cause "page not found" error and
even the display of incorrect sites.

For example, I have an intranet site called "ora1-dev". To access it, I type
the url:

http://ora1-dev:1532/pls/nims/xperweb.home

This work in Internet Explorer. When I do the same in Firebird, however, the
address is changed to:

http://www.ora1-dev.com/

Which doe not exist, causing the message:

"The system detected an Unresolved Host Name while attempting to retrieve
the URL: http://www.ora1-dev.com/."

...to be displayed. Worse yet, the port number is stripped off and not
reinserted. Even if I had an cname called www.ora1-dev.com pointing to the same
host, my query would fail since the port number is gone.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type http://test (or http://test:12345 into the addressbar
2. Hit enter
3. Observe the result

Actual Results:
The URL in the addressbar is changed to http://www.test.com and that site is
displayed, not the one I want. (Actually, in this test case, a "page not found"
erroor messge should appear.

Note: the port number (if specified) is stripped from the URL

Expected Results:
Firebird should have displayed the page at http://test

Note: in my config, the value: "browser.fixup.alternate.enabled" is set to
"false". The same failure occurs if I change this value to "true".
