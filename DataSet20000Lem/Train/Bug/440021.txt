I've got too many bookmark on my bookmark toolbar (even when it's just the icons) to fit on one line, and I have multi-row bookmark toolbar set up in the chrome. In FF2, the one that didn't fit on the first line just would be on a second line.

In FF3, the one that don't fit on the first line show up a a pull-down menu on the right side of the toolbar - that's annoying enough.

But when I click on the off-the-screen bookmarks, nothing happens. I can't even see the properties. When I right-click I get what look like the right context menu, but by the time I scroll down to "properties" it disappears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure the following two item are in user chrome:
/* Pop-up bookmark toolbar */ #PersonalToolbar {display: none;} #navigator-toolbox:hover > #PersonalToolbar {display: -moz-box;}

/* Multi-row bookmark toolbar */ #bookmarks-ptf {display: block;} #bookmarks-ptf toolbarseparator {display: inline;}

2. Put enough bookmark in the bookmark toolbar that they won't fit on one line

3. Look at bookmark toolbar

4. Navigate to one of the off-screen bookmark and click on it.
Actual Results:
There is only one row when there should be more.
When you click on an off-the-screen bookmark, nothing happens. Right-click on it and attempt to see "properties" it doesn't stay visible long enough to get there.

Expected Results:
The bookmark toolbar should have shown a many line a necessary to show all the bookmarks. All the bookmark should have been functional.
