popup window get stuck on screen when hiding and unhiding application

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on Finder in dock. Leave Finder window up.
2. Click on any other application that brings up a window. Doesn't matter which one (I used Mac Mail).
3. Click on Firefox. At this point, you have Firefox on top of two other application on the desktop. Position mouse on "Home" icon. Home page pop up (in my case it "about:blank"). IMMEDIATELY hit Apple-h to hide Firefox. Make sure you hide it before the "about:blank" popup go away.
4. Click on the Mac Mail window, move the window a little, then hide it using Apple-h (or use the "hide" menu option).
5. Click on Finder window and move it a little.
6. Click on Firefox icon in dock to un-hide it.

If it doesn't reproduce for you, then you're not hiding the application fast enough. Position the mouse on the HOME icon and IMMEDIATELY hit apple-h.
Actual Results:
There will be a blank popup box where the home URL wa originally. The blank popup sits on the screen no matter where you move the Firefox window. The only way I know to get rid of it is to position the mouse on the HOME icon and then move the mouse away.

Expected Results:
No popup window should show after unhiding the application.

Until I figured out that positioning the mouse cursor on the HOME icon to get rid of the box, I had to move the browser window to read or click the information under that blank box.
