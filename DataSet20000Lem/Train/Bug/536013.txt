When there are 2 IP address (like one from the ISP and other from VPN), when one of them is disconnected (say, VPN), firefox fails to work
User-Agent: Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.0; U; en) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 GTB6

I have tried this many times.
* When I have 2 IP address (IPv4), one provided by the ISP and the other provided when connected via VPN tunnel, firefox work fine when I start with both IP addressed being active.
* When I try to open any web-site (example, yahoomail.com, gmail.com), after disconnecting one of them (say, typically VPN), firefox fails to open the website. It always say "Connection Failed"
* The only way to recover is to restart the firefox browser


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox with multiple IP connections, preferred if one of them is VPN
2. try logging into any of the gmail or yahoo account (or both in multiple tabs)
3.Disconnect one of the connections, say VPN
4. The gmail, yahoomail fails to open
5. Refresh the page. After sometime, the browser say "Connection failed"
6. No other web site will open
Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
I expect the browser to work at least after the refresh operation or should open a new web site
