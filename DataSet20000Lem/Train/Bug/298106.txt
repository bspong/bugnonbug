site doesn't load fully - i.e. picture are never fully loaded - just on this one system
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-DE; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

It seems to just happen on my main machine and just with Firefox.
When I open up www.saturn.de -> after choosing the site of my market:
Gummersbach (http://www.saturn.de/frontend/html/outlet/61/home.html) the site
never is fully loaded (loaded completely).
I use Firefox 1.0.4. Internet Explorer on the same client pc doe NOT show this
probem, instead the site www.saturn.de is very quickly.
Firefox 1.0.4 on my laptop (other machine) also doe NOT show this problem,
pretty wierd.
I deleted all www.saturn.de Cookies and cleared the Cache.
After a restart of Firefox, the issue are the same nonwhatsoever.

So I am looking more for a way to see why this is happening, maybe some logs, a
I usually frequent this site very often.

Both client PCs (see above) are connected through Wireless LAN (WLAN / WiFi) to
the same access point in the same network.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just start Firefox and open up http://www.saturn.de
2. If you do not have a Cookie, you first gotta choose your nearest market
(Gummersbach in my case), before you get to the final site.
Actual Results:
The site start loading in Firefox, picture start to become visible, then
finally the site "freezes", i.e. nothing get loaded anymore, although Firefox
say in status bar "Übertrage Daten von www.saturn.de..." ("Transmitting data
from www.saturn.de...").
Firefox itself stay fully intact!! (i.e. it doe not freeze or anything)
You can even hit a link that already showed up, and then the game begin again
(the linked www.saturn.de-Site show the same phenomena)...

Expected Results:
The site should of course be completely loaded (at least slowly).

As I already said, IE doesn't have this problem.
Also, a Firefox installation on a second PC doe NOT show this problem.
