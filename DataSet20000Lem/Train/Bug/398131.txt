When my ajax application loads, it place an <img> tag in the DOM using xmlhttprequest, afterwards it executes another xmlhttprequest, at the moment the image is loaded. Somehow, firefox 1.5 and 2 deadlock. While firefox 3 produce weird things.
See http://img212.imageshack.us/img212/3077/ff3tg7.png for the firefox 3 behaviour. (It show some kind of screenshot the from the last time user input wa given)

Firefox 2 deadlocks. I have not been able to get more detailed debugging info. This is the strace information on the loop firefox get in:
clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, {1191226506, 108156000}) = 0
futex(0x3e585cc, FUTEX_WAIT, 1, {0, 9989000}) = -1 ETIMEDOUT (Connection timed out)
futex(0x129f500, FUTEX_WAKE, 1) = 0
read(44, 0x7fffcfe111b7, 1) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
read(15, 0x7fffcfe11177, 1) = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)
and the filedescriptors 44 and 15 are pipes.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. My application is unfortunatly copyrighted, it doe some complex ajax calls. I have not yet been able to produce a smaller testcase. The likelyhood of hitting the bug is related to the amount of code and data it transfer over the network.
2. Open the page. The bug get triggered. When the image are in cache, the possibility of hitting the bug decrease (but still happens sometimes).
Actual Results:
A deadlock with firefox 2, and weird things/memmory coruption with firefox 3.

Expected Results:
Correctly displayed images.
