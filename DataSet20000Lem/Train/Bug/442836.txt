There are a few high cpu use bug on a number of different platforms. Some of these are 432028, 434513 and 439488. None quite summarize what I'm seeing although 434513 is the closest I've found.

The CPU go fairly high and grows. It seems to start when idled for a bit. It will consume CPU and use more and more after each subsequent idle period until it's rather obvious via fan and heat. The response of the browser doe not seem to be impaired when in high cpu state. CPU doesn't seem to rise or fluctuate beyond normal usage while active.

Plugins include Sage and Forecastfox.

This is on OSX 10.4.11 dual core Intel Powerbook.

If Firefox is up for a while it get pretty hot... real hot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Apart from the obvious I'd have to say start on a 10.4.11 powerbook
2. Install FF similar to above
3. Use it, go away, use it again, repeat

Actual Results:
Well, a bothersome lack of cpu when I'm off doing other thing that might like to use it and a decidedly uncomfortable level of <em>heat</em>

Expected Results:
A calm, well mannered Firefox browser. One that will be idle in the face of .. idling.

Other than high cpu on the pc, the browser response and functionality in no way seem to be impaired with regard to normal use.
