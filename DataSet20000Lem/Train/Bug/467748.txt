After moving Firefox Window on desktop it seems to hang until Alt-Ctrl-Del used to invoke task manager

On some busy website (ie lot of external banner URLS or flash) if I try to move the Firefox Window on the desktop the system appears to freeze. By freeze I mean RSS (if running( will stop), downloads will stop and no other window can be selected. After using Alt-Crtl-Del to invoke the Task Manager everything burst back into life again. If I do not move the Firefox window then usually ok.

I have tried disabling a number of my add-on but that doesn't seem to affect the problem.

I will try to get a set of conditions, including a URL, that permit easy replication of this problem. In the meantime I am regretting upgrading from 2.0!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Move Firefox window whilst displaying a busy URL (sky.com/news sometimes)
2.Try to select other window
3. Invoke Task Manager using Alt-Ctrl-Del to unfreeze system.
Actual Results:
Ultimately I have to kill Firefox and restart afresh to get a usable system again.

Expected Results:
Moving a Window should not cause the OS to freeze.

I think an event is being lost somewhere. It seems that invoking the Task Manager unlocks the Firefox task.
