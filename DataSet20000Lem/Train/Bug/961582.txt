Steps to reproduce:

Ran my basic extension (using Firefox SDK) and attempted to find all <DIV> element on iCloud.com or Pandora.com by using document.getElementsByTagName("div").

This is not an issue on most sites, only seems to be certain site using HTML5/ARIA. In the case of iCloud.com it seems there are a few <DIV> element in a row (which are detected) but then there are a few <SCRIPT> element after then and then many more <DIV> element trailing those. All of the <DIV> element trailing the <SCRIPT> element are simply ignored and not returned in the array from getElementsByTagName. I tried using querySelectorAll("div") a well and also added a check to see if the page needed more extensive loading over the normal tab's "ready" event (tested using window.onload) with no change.


Actual results:

Only a small fraction of the actual <DIV> element were returned in the array and the Firefox DOM inspector show many more that are simply ignored.


Expected results:

All element should have been returned and parse-able.
