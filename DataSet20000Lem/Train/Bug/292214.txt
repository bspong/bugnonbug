Ok, first of all I recently wrote this report and made it, a I see it, perfect.
But when I sent it, I had to login, back-button forgot how to make time travel
and a login didn't make anything better. Yes, everything disappeared, so I'm
kind of frustrated now.

Well, back to the main bug report.

When I use document.createElement() for image or script tag and then make them
load (using appendChild, insertBefore etc) the status bar display "Transferring
data from <domain>". This message appears from the moment of loading the element
until some other "normal" data transfer is requested.

I forced a no-caching through attaching ?a=Math.random() in the file requests.
Without that measure the above problem appears at first load, after that the
status message is changed to "Read <domain>", also this time without break.

At first this bug appeared in a much more complex environment, so I simplified
everything and a you can see it remains. Additionally, the page is W3C-standard
(xhtml1.1) and the scripting strictly follows W3C DOM standard.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached link.
2. Click any of the visible link (javascript triggers).

Actual Results:
Status bar displays: Transferring data from <domain>...

Expected Results:
Status bar should display: Done
