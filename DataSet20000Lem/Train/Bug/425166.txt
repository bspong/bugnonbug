I think I may have encountered a bug in JavaScript 1.8, though I don’t know enough about j (a) to specify exactly what it is, (b) to see whether it ha already been logged. (I really have tried. Sorry. I want to be helpful, so please give guidance.) In brief, an online database (academic journal admin) that ha worked fine for some ten year (and still doe with Fx 2, Fx 1 and IE 6) is giving a j error for certain operation when accessed with Fx 3b pre5 and other Fx 3 betas. The db interface us ColdFusion and JavaScript, and the j module that misbehaves (some 800 line of tidy code, which I can supply) provides an editing screen with multiple independent sections: dropdown list with submit buttons, checkboxes with action buttons, etc. With Fx 3, a routine edit via checkbox and action button throw up an error a if you were doing a different edit from elsewhere on the page and had failed to select from a dropdown box. Any clues? Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into database used by editor of academic journal. Private access: I can enable limited access for testing if desired.
2. Select article in db with an overdue event.
3. Click "Edit article" button.
4. Check "Clear status?" box against that event.
5. Click "Click Event Status" button and confirm action.

Actual Results:
6. An error is returned "You have not specified any Associated name to add.
Select at least one name before proceeding."

Expected Results:
The event would be cleared and would no longer be shown a overdue.

This error implies you had instead clicked the button "Submit the new names" elsewhere on the screen. The error code and the data handling for the whole page are contained in an 800-line j module, professionally written and neatly coded, with internal comments, available on request. The error implies that the wrong function ha been called, or rather, that none of a series of test of type

if(getSelectObject(formObj.update_A_Name_ID_1) != "")

returned true, when all of them should have because all the field were empty.
