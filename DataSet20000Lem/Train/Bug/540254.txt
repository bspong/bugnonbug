On Jan 16, I downloaded the available Mozilla update into my computer. After that download, after going into yahoo mail and signing out, I do not get back to the yahoo home page (which I also have set a my home page). All I get is a blank screen the the following reference on the top bar "Inbox([number])-yahoo mail-mozilla firefox". I cannot do anything once it get to this page. My only option is to hit the "x" on the upper right hand corner and close the window and re-open.

Also, it appears that the right click button to "copy" no longer work in many instance

Please note that with regard to your requested information, I did not know some of the entries. I can tell you that I downloaded the Mozilla product on 1/16 and I run window vista.
