firefox hang repeatedly on startup.
you guy should take out the "latest headlines" live bookmark that is automatically in firefox. i did not know this wa in my firefox at all. i have been having crashing problem for six week where the machine hang up. i had to search for three hour on the internet to find this thing. i have not added any live bookmark on my own. this should be a feature that people can select if they want. it should not automatically be in the program so that user don't even know it's there. i have seen numerous report of firefox hanging for no apparent reason and suspect that this is the cause for more user a well.
