PDF text Missing when viewed with ff pdf viewer [unimplemented annotation type:FreeText]
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0
Build ID: 20130227063501

Steps to reproduce:

When viewing certain PDF's using the default PDF viewer in Firefox 19 and 20 a blue bar appears above the PDF saying This PDF document might not be displayed correctly giving the user an option to open with a different viewer. The problem is that only 1/2 the PDF display and unless the user decides to click on Open with Different Viewer to compare the result they are left with missing information.

It appears to be an issue with PDF's that have text typed on them using Acrobats typewriter tool. Everything typed on the PDF using the typewriter tool is completely missing but the rest of the PDF get displayed. I tried printing the PDF using the print Icon below the blue bar and still don't see the typewriter text. If I save the PDF and open it with Adobe Reader the text is now visible.


Actual results:

Here is a link to a PDF file that doesn't display properly in Firefox but doe in Adobe Reader.

Expected results:

If the PDF can't be displayed properly cant there be a popup or something that warns the user that the PDF they are trying to view should be opened with an external app for compatibility reason or go ahead and let Firefox attempt to display it?
