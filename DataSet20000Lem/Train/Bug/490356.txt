file dialog in save a is VERY slow if dir is large - and save button won't work until file list is displayed

The first time I save a page to a directory with 1000 odd files, it take more than 10 second for anything on the dialog to respond.
I can't just quickly save the file without waiting for the file list to display.
I must keep my download dir cleaned out to prevent even worse delays.
I can't change to another directory until it displays, then I must wait another 10+ second in the other directory before I can save.
If I have other program running and RAM is tight, the delay do not improve with time unless I save several thing to the same dir quickly.

The directory are on a fast SATA HD.
I see this with over 2G RAM, dual core 2G CPU.
It is worse and more frequent on single core CPU w 750M RAM.
This happens when HD and CPU were previously idle.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2. save page to a large directory
3. save the same page to another large directory
Actual Results:
Dialog freeze until file list display

Expected Results:
Dialog responds, file list display a background thread on 2nd CPU core.
