Firefox interacts strangely with OS X "Zoom follows the keyboard focus" option

When using OS X's Universal Access zoom function, clicking anywhere in a Firefox 3 window will recenter the zoom on the middle of the Firefox title bar. This make it difficult to navigate/enter text in a page while zoomed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activate the Zoom function under System Preferences/Universal Access (in the Seeing tab).
2. Get focus on any Firefox window.
3. Use Command-Option-= to zoom in on the Firefox window until the title bar is no longer visible.
4. Click anywhere in the window.
Actual Results:
The zoomed screen is recentered to the center of the window's title bar.

Expected Results:
The zoom should only recenter when changing the keyboard focus within a window, and then it should follow the keyboard focus, not the title bar.

I have tested this in Firefox 3.0 beta 4 and 5 running under OS X 10.4.11. The problem doe not exist in Firefox 2.

A partial workaround exists: under Zoom in Universal Access, select Options... and turn off "Zoom follows the keyboard focus". This is not optimal, a it disables proper focus-following for all applications.
