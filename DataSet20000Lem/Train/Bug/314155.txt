I have a div with several other div's inside it. When I dynamically set a few of the inside div's style to display: none (through javascript) then the parent div doe not collapse properly. There is a space between the divs that are shown and the last child of the parent div. The space disappears if there is no parent div or when the parent div ha a border set. The larger the hidden divs are, the bigger the space is.

I have created three HTML file that demonstrate this problem. divtest.html show the problem in action (click on the one, two and three link at the top in succession). divtest2.html ha the parent div removed (this prevents the error from happening). divtest3.html ha a border set on the parent div (again, the problem go away).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open divtest.html
2. Click on link one, two and three (in that order) to see the problem
3. Try the other two file to see the problem disappear

Actual Results:
There's a space between the divs that can be shown or hidden (one, two or three) and the div below that (four).

Expected Results:
There should be no space between the divs.
