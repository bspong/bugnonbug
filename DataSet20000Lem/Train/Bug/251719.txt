Proxy username/password is prompted at every startup when not needed.

I have to use an MS-based authenticating proxy to access the internet (Microsoft
ISA). Our domain username and password are also required. The proxy address is
spec'd in Tools, Options, Connection... Username/password is filled in and the
checkbox is 'checked' and saved. After "Okay"ing, the browsing session work fine.

Close Firefox and restart it and the login prompt again appears. This is
unnecessary (isn't it ?). My login credential haven't changed. If they do
change in between FF sessions, automatically passing the old value to the proxy
would give me an ISA authentication failure page. Trying another page should
then pop-up the login box to allow me to correct the value(s).

IE handle this more transparently (obviously) but doe pop-up the login prompt
on occassion (when the proxy is acting up or I've changed passwords).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. See detail above
2.
3.



Expected Results:
Not prompt for already filled-in data everytime (IE doesn't).
