Pages in Firefox don't respond properly to the pg up and pg down key like they have been historically, and like they still do in IE.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Page stick or jump and stick again at the bottom of the page when I try to navigate up or down the page using the page up or page down key on my keyboard. This wa never the case before the last day or two. I tested the same scenario on IE and it work perfectly, like Firefox always has. So, if the page is longer than the screen length (which they usually are), I can no longer use the page up or page down key to scroll up or down a page length at a time, and even the scroll up and down arrow have a jumpy time of it and don't work consistently. Again, this is not happening on the same page with IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a long page like news.google.com or gmail
2. page down -- page hop to the bottom of the page.
3. try to page back up again, and it doesn't work. jump and stick back at bottom of page, or hop all the way up to the top of the page. can't page down or up, screen by screen length anymore.



Very frustrating because I realize now how much I use this to navigate a page. Thought it might be a key stroke function accidentally set, but it work properly with IE.
