I have a page containing a <div> with style set to either 'position: fixed;' or 'position: absolute;'. When I increase the font-size on the <body> using javascript, the text increase in size but the containing <div> doe not. If I change the the <div> to 'position: relative;', then everything resizes the way I would expect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the attached html test case.

2. Click the "Increase" button which increase the font-size on the <body> element.

Actual Results:
The section at the bottom of the html test case which is using 'position: fixed' doe not resize correctly. All of the text start to overlap and extend outside the boundary of the <div>.

Expected Results:
If you look at the top section of the html test case which is not using positioning you will see the result I expect. The text should have increased in size a well a the <div> containing the text.
