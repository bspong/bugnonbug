honor browser.warnOnQuit even if browser.tabs.warnOnClose is false
Some user set browser.tabs.warnOnClose to false because they regularly close window with multiple tab intentionally and don't want to be prompted when that happens. But they still want to be prompted when they quit the application while multiple tab are open because they do that unintentionally a greater percentage of the time and want to be protected from accidentally losing their tab (f.e. bug 189290, comment 36).

Currently, if browser.tabs.warnOnClose is set to false, browser.warnOnQuit is ignored. browser.warnOnQuit should be independent of browser.tabs.warnOnClose, so it's possible to configure Firefox to prompt you when you quit the application but not when you close one of it windows.

Note: this bug is not about what the default value should be or what kind of UI there should be for setting these preferences. It only request the ability to set them independently (and for Firefox to respect the value of browser.warnOnQuit even if browser.tabs.warnOnClose is set to false), leaving existing UI intact. Modifications to the default value and the UI (if any are deemed appropriate) should be handled in a different bug (like bug 384907, bug 433123, bug 419009, or bug 443396).
