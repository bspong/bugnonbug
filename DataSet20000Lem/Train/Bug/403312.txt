My firefox 2.0.0.9 on WinXP SP2 crash from time to time, did not happen with 2.0.0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

I do not know what exactly trigger the browser crash (hang).
But it look like it is connected to mouseclicks either near or in the addressbar.

Pretty annoying
How do I get my 2.0.0.8 install back again.

Another annoying thing is this:
When Firefox release a new version of Firefox I'm notified that a new version is released and if I want to upgrade. If I say no, then I get message that new version of Firefox will be installed on next startup.
How do I disable that.
I want to be in control when new software is installed on my computer...

Anyway, Firefox really kick the superugly IE7 (and IE6) on the scrapyard :-)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:
