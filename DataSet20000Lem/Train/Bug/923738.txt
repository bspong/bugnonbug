Move the Awesomebar dropdown marker to the right of the go/stop/reload button.
alex_mayorga brought this up in bug 594050, comment 31, and it sound like an idea worth considering:

The dropdown marker next to the go/stop/reload button suggests that the Awesomebar is like a combobox, but the fact that it's not immediately at the end of the bar kind of break that idiom.

The heatmap study from 2012 (https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/2012/06/firefox-heatmap-study-2012-results-are-in/) suggests that the dropdown marker is interacted with by ~38.4% of user v the go/stop/reload button which is interacted with by 40.1% of user (split over 3 buttons). This suggests that user might find this button more useful than the individual go/stop/reload buttons, and perhaps we can give it more prominence by anchoring it to the end of the Awesomebar.

Also of note that one of the reason to keep the go/stop/reload button at the end of the Awesomebar (that being that these button can be separated out via customization magic) is going away by default with Australis, so we can get away with tucking them one level deeper into the bar.

Totally open to argument here, but alex_mayorga ha a gun to my head and is making me type this in at Moz Summit 2013 (Toronto). :)

(Also this is a super easy fix if it's one we're gonna roll with).
