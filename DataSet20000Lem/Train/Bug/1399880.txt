Add telemetry probe for page metadata collection
As Firefox start collecting page metadata in bug 1393924, we'd like to add some telemetry probe to monitor more detail of this feature, furthermore, we want to leverage those metric to understand various potential impact on Places database.

The data collection proposal,

# Objective

To better understand the impact on Places of page metadata collection. Specifically, the storage impact, query performance, and data expiration policy effect on Places database.

# What to collect

We'd like to add following probe to http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/modules/ContentMetaHandler.jsm,

* To monitor the size (in bytes) of page metadata, for both description and preview image url in bytes.

* To gauge the availability of page metadata, which could be attained by counting the total number of page metadata parsing success, divided by the total number of page metadata parsing attempts.

# When to collect

All the probe will be activated when the user visit a page. Some metric will only be collected if applicable, for instance, only record the size of metadata if it par it successfully.

# Target channel

All the metric would be calculated in aggregate but not individually, the target audience is for the user on the prerelease channel.

# Who will be using this

Both Activity Stream and Firefox Search team will be analyzing it.
