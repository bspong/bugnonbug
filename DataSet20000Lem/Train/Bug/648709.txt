If you go on http://en.lernu.net/
there is a menu with items:
- Main Page
- Introduction
- Courses
- Learning
- Communication
- etc.

If you hover the mouse over item "Communication", a menu pop up (good so far). Move the mouse down to try to select the last menu item and notice that menu close spontaneously before mouse can reach the last item. It make it impossible to select the last item in the menu.

I can reproduce it with FF-4.0 4.0b13pre (2011-03-22) (Ubuntu-10.04.2)

The bug doe not happen with Firefox-3.6.17 and doe not happen with Chromium-10.0 either. I only see it with Firefox-4.0.

Many other people can reproduce the bug on Windows too and on Linux, all with FF-4.0 according to this forum: http://en.lernu.net/komunikado/forumo/temo.php?t=8742 (in Esperanto).

It happens nearly all the time (99% of the time).


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://en.lernu.net
2. hover mouse over menu "Communication"
3. move mouse down to try to select last menu item "Forum"
4. Observe that menu close before mouse can reach last menu item

Actual Results:
Observe that menu close before mouse can reach last menu item


Expected Results:
I would expect that menu doe not close spontaneously. Menus is not closed in other browser I tried (FF-3.1.6.17 and Chromium-10.0).
