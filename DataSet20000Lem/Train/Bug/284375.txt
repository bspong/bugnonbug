Firefox 1.01 always HANGS upon opening...unable to navigate! And upon closing, an error box pop up...the detail are in the DETAILS box belolw -->
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier:

[Exception..."Component returned failure code: 0x80520011
(NS_ERROR_FILE_NAME_TOO_LONG)[nsIFileOutputStream.init]" nsresult:"0x80520011
(NS_ERROR_FILE_NAME_TOO_LONG)"location: "JS frame ::
chrome://booktofav/content/booktofav.js :: anonymous :: line 113" data: no]

(OK)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on shortcut to open firefox
2.Firefox "opens" but hangs...unable to navigate anything
3.No Choice but to CLOSE Firefox (v1.01)
4.The error above in the detail box "reproduces" EVERY single time...
Actual Results:
Firefox just shut down (closed...not visible.
But if one open "Task Manager"...one will find that under processes,
firefox.exe is STILL RUNNING!
So, to completely "STOP" firefox...I've to navigate to the process in "Task
Manager" and "Right-Click" on "firefox.exe" and then click "End Process" on
the pop-up box that appears...

Expected Results:
1. Open..let me sur the NET!!

2. Close without "hanging" and coming up with the "error msg" described in
detail above.

3. Not having to "end" the "process" "firefox.exe" in Task Manager even though
Firefox ha seemingly "shut down" a it is nowhere to be found on-screen...

4. A better SURFING experience...and this problem NEVER go away even after
un-installing and re-installing Firefox <-- Tried 5-6 times!!

Reporting this...which I also wrote in "Details" section above...

I do not know if this bug still occurs in the default theme or not cause it
ALWAYS hang upon starting!!! Hence, not possible for me to change back to
default theme...

So, I use Firefox "safemode" now...but all extension do not work in "safe-
mode".

As you can probably understand my frustration now...=)
