There are two main quirk I noticed when using Firefox 2.0 Beta 2 under Linux/GTK with the Default theme that included:

1. The URL box's dropdown button is disjoint in misaligned with the URL box and Go button, causing a clash with the new theme's "integrated URL box and go button" look (see attached screenshots.

2. When the mouse is over Back and Forward buttons, both new "small button" a well a old vanilla GTK button appear at once (I'll try to get a screenshot, but gnome-panel-screenshot is currently not letting me).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Quirk 1:
1.Open Fx 2.0b2 under Linux
2. Look at the URL bar

Quirk 2:
1. Open Fx 2.0b2 under Linux
2. Move mouse onto either back or forward button
Actual Results:
Quirk 1: Dropdown button misaligned with and not attached to URL bar
Quirk 2: both GTK button and the new theme's back button style appear

Expected Results:
Quirk 1: Dropdown button aligned with and attached to URL bar
Quirk 2: Only new button style appears
