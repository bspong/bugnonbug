Reposition app tab when leaving private browsing mode
You can end up with pinned app tab within the scrolling region of the tabstrip rather than being pinned to the left of it, if you create enough tab while you're in private browsing and then exit private browsing.

Best stated in an STR:

1 - Start with a fresh profile (zero add-ons, default theme).
2 - Make sure the window is not maximized and not fullscreen. (This may not matter, but that's how I did it.)
3 - Pin some app tab (try four).
4 - Create enough other unpinned tab (try fourteen) to trigger tabstrip scrolling.
5 - Enter private browsing.
6 - In private browsing, create enough unpinned tab (try fourteen) to trigger tabstrip scrolling.
7 - Exit private browsing.
8 - Notice that the four pinned app tab are now scrolled, rather than being to the left of the tab scroll arrow.

Expect results:
- pinned app tab are always to the left of the left-most tab scroll arrow

Actual results:
- pinned app tab are sometimes to the right of the left-most tab scroll arrow, and included in the tab that scroll

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:5.0a2) Gecko/20110426 Firefox/5.0a2

Notes:
- saw this with Aurora build
- did not try with either fx4 or fx6 nightly, so can't say whether it also happens there or not
- wa very easy to reproduce
- simply entering private browsing, and then immediately leaving private browsing without creating any new tabs, did not trigger the error
- saw this whether the firefox button wa shown or not, and whether tab on top or not
- did not try on Mac or Linux

Please check that I picked the right version when filing this bug .. this is my first bug filed since Aurora wa added to the mix of versions.
