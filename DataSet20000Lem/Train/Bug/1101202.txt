Steps to reproduce:

35.0a2 (2014-11-17) Hello, since the developer is coming instead of aurora the address bar is not functionally for search and shortcut old link. exa.= if I'm tapping any word to search like "Firefox" and click enter nothing happen if i put already visited page like "" spee..." it give the suite " speedtest.net" but don't link to it. Thank you for answer or repair, MOZDOC


Actual results:

1. Firefox aurora ( become DEVELOPER lat week. OS win 8.1+. 2. address bar must work a address tool (http://www.balbal.bla) etc. (that work. 3.address bar must recognize also history for site you'd visited on the same browser and machine like : www. spee

www.speedtest.net
www.speed.isp.net etc.

that give address and suggestion but do not link to anywhere , with or without the ENTER key. 4. address bar have to use a search bar like "HOW TO FIX,,,," and that won't work at all. Thank you , MOZDOC IMAGE:link request & action (no action!), search request & action (no action!)


Expected results:

link to address or giving search result
