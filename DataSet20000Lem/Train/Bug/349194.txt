Paste URL behavior changed with upgrade

This is unbelievably irritating.

I upgraded to latest firefox, running gentoo. I think I went from like
1.0 to 1.5 so this wa a big jump.

I had been using a feature where I could use X11 to highlight a
URL in some other window (like an xterm) and then just click the
middle button over the firefox browser window. This would very very
very conveniently just take me to that URL. This is what it should do.
This is what I had expected.

Now, however, an ugly round circular thingy appears on the window, and
it ha something to do with scrolling the existing web page within that
browser window. WTF? How do I make it go back to the old behaviour? Why
did this even change? Who would want it to do this, anyway? The middle
scroll button already work perfectly fine to scroll the window.

I've switched to using mozilla now instead of firefox, just because of this
problem. Mozilla doesn't have the problem. Is it a preference setting?
In Edit/Preferences there is no such setting for this. So I've got to dig
and dig and search and study and figure out WTF I've got to change to
fix this? Like I don't have better thing to do, right?

Pardon my rave.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
Previous behaviour. Why change it in the first place?
