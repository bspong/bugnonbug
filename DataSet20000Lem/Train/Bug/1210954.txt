Move devtools variable into a single variables.css file that get imported into both dark and light theme
Right now we have two separate CSS file for the light and dark theme.

https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/themes/light-theme.css
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/client/themes/dark-theme.css

The first thing each of these doe is declare a bunch of variables. We could move all of these into a separate file that doe something like:

:root.theme-light {
--theme-body-background: #fcfcfc;
...
}
:root.theme-dark {
--theme-body-background: #14171a;
...
}

Then @import("variables.css") from each theme file.

This would get u closer to being able to replace light-theme.css and dark-theme.css with a single file since there's a lot of copy/paste between them.

Relatedly, there are case like in the Web IDE where the full theme file are included basically just to get access to a few of these variables: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=theme+path:webide+path:logs&redirect=true&case=true&limit=100&offset=0. This bug wouldn't allow u to get rid of that, but it would make it much easier to replace the theme-switching.js reference in Web IDE with a link to variables.css and a simple listener that swap the theme-light / theme-dark class on the root element.
