when i close it cause it hang up on itself, i can't just restart it without having to go into the task list and actually have to end the process. Everytime I close IE explorere, or Flock, they just close. and I can start a new window again. But when I close fire fox, i CANT just open a new window, because it say firefox is alreay running, yet nothing happens til I have to go into the damn task list and actually end the god damn program, this is a major bug. How come you can't just close firefox and thats the end, why must I continue to go in and have to end the process, im sure you guy have better brain than that, this is just a 5th grade problem, so solve it.
