Type in a User ID on the webpage and hit "Enter". A window pop up explaining
that you didn't type in a password. The "OK" button of that window is selected,
and so hitting "Enter" again should close it. That single keystroke both close
the window, and try to log into the webpage again, causing the same error
window to appear again.

Clicking "OK" with the mouse brings you back to the webpage, a expected.
Trying the exact same sequence of event in IE work a expected.
