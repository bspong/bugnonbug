When calling a java function from javascript that display a JFileChooser it cause firefox to crash (becomes unresponsive, I have to open the the task manager and kill the process manually). Sometimes it doesn't crash, it hang but if I switch to a different window and then back to firefox then it becomes responsive again. If you look at the url I entered, if you click the link then the problem happens about 50% of the time. Clicking the button work fine, since it isn't called from javascript. Here's my applet code, it is signed:

import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
import java.security.AccessController;
import java.security.PrivilegedAction;

import javax.swing.JApplet;
import javax.swing.JButton;
import javax.swing.JFileChooser;
import javax.swing.UIManager;


public class TestJFileChooser extends JApplet{

public void init(){
JButton jb = new JButton("test");
jb.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) {
selectLocalFiles();
}
});
this.add(jb);
}

public void selectLocalFiles(){
AccessController.doPrivileged(new PrivilegedAction<Object>(){
public Object run() {
try {
UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());
} catch (Exception e) { }
JFileChooser jfc = new JFileChooser();
jfc.setMultiSelectionEnabled(true);

int returnval = jfc.showOpenDialog(null);
if(returnval == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION){

}
return null;
}
});
}
}

and here is the html to test with:
<html>
<body>

<applet id='imagemgr' name='imagemgr' code='TestJFileChooser.class' archive="TestJFileChooser6.jar" mayscript width=100 height=100></applet>


<a href="javascript: addAttachment()">Test JFileChooser</a>

<script>
function addAttachment(){
var selectedfile = new Array();
var startpos = 0;
setTimeout("document.getElementById(\"imagemgr\").selectLocalFiles();", 500);
}
</script>
</body>
</html>


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the webpage I entered.
2. Click the link 'TestJFileChooser'
Actual Results:
Causes firefox to become unresponsive, I have to kill firefox from the task manager. Sometimes if I switch to a different screen and back to firefox then it becomes responsive again.

Expected Results:
Should execute exactly the same and calling the function from java (click the 'test' button on the webpage I entered)

This problem happens to a lesser extent on the mac and linux, but it still happens occasionally. It happens a lot (>50% of the time) on all version of window (32 bit and 64 bit a well). Seems to have gotten worse on firefox 3 a compared to firefox 2. Clients have reported this problem to us, so a workaround or a fix would be greatly appreciated.
