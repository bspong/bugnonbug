Steps to reproduce:

Over the last week, I have used Safari and Firefox separately, on separate boot with 100% starting charge on my battery. Each time each browser wa used under similar reproducible configuration and circumstance (my workflow doesn't change much). Running Firefox on my machine consistently reproduces similar hardware load and battery drain that on average far exceeds Safari 7 in my comparison on my machine.


Actual results:

Hardware: late 2011 Macbook Pro, 2.4 GHz i5, 8GB RAM, SSD, 94% of batter capacity left according to Coconutbattery app.
Boot ups are with full 100% charge on battery, Screen 50% brightness, keypad lighting OFF, bluetooth OFF, WiFi is ON, 1 program running in dock; Firefox Aurora or Safari 7.

Today's example:
approximately 35 minute use on battery with 100% charge to start and indicator is showing 88%. Safari doe not display this rate of battery drain with the same page opened.
Various screen shot of activity panel and the open tab in Firefox are included. The screen shot are of course snapshot and CPU load varied between 2% and a high a 7% at idle. Idle in this case meaning nothing in the tab is running (to my knowledge); ad are blocked, flash is blocked (they are mostly contextual pages) and I am writing this or looking at activity monitor.


Expected results:

In my usage over the last week, I have consistently seen Firefox produce CPU load between 2% and 6% under similar circumstances: between 4-8 tab that are all mostly text, no video's, with extension adblockedge, flashblock and lastpass running. Memory load also seem to remain consistent between 550MB and 750MB.

Safari 7 show somewhat similar number of CPU and memory in usage under the similar criteria. Safari 7 CPU usage seems to not fluctuate a much and it actually let go of CPU load in contrast to Firefox at idle. At times, CPU and memory number seem to converge to a more one to one relationship, but OS X 10.9 is still reporting their arbitrary energy usage number a much higher and the battery usage is significantly higher using Firefox over Safari 7.

For a period in time, Aurora wa flaky in even showing up in the energy usage graph. Reboot fixed that. I would love for Firefox to be at least a little more energy conserving. I understand this may be unique to this machine, but I hope it help button something up making FF better.
