User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Opera 7.54 [en]

for your convenience you can test this bug on http://www.purplemoon.ch/
firefox_frameset.html and compare it to http://www.purplemoon.ch/firefox.html :
The second page contains a link which open a popup, firefox doesn't block this
popup because it is (correctly) user-requested. The first page however contains
a frameset in which you can click on the same link in every frame, the link
open the same function a before, just this time it is located in the frameset,
so it call the link javascript:top.last_messages() instead of javascript:
last_messages() - firefox block this popup a an unwanted popup. Clearly, it
isn't an unrequested popup and should not be blocked.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.purplemoon.ch/firefox_frameset.html
2. Try to click on any of the two link when having the popup-blocker enabled.
For comparison see http://www.purplemoon.ch/firefox.html which contains almost
the same code in a single html-file and which work flawlessly.

Actual Results:
Firefox block the requested popup-link you clicked on.

Expected Results:
It should have opened the popup because it wa user-requested and not unwanted.
