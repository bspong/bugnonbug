<input style='cursor:pointer;top:110px;left:0px;width:120px;text-align:center;' type='button' name='bSubmit3' id="bSubmit3" value='Submit Your Choice' onClick='Javascript:RadiosSelected();'>
I am a developer and so when this button apparently stopped working for no reason on a page I wa writing... well it wasted a couple of hour until I tried clicking all the way along and found that onclick wa only detected at the left 20% of the button area. Increased the width to 800px to see if I could make some sense of this and found that the pattern of "event sensation" became more random. Click wa detected at the extreme left and over the text, but not in the area between.

I have other button on the page which are defined almost identically except for having different name and id and different javascript function called, and these all work a expected.

This error doe not occur in IE.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Actual Results:
A couple of month ago on a different page I found that a button apparently went dead. That time I couldn't figure it out and ended up rewriting that block of the page. I don't know how to reproduce this. It occurs rarely.


Obviously the entire surface of the button should respond to an onclick event since this event wa defined within the input tag. I speculate that this may be a problem integrating normal HTML object with CSS positioning.
