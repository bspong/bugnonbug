Using the now-built-in drag-and-drop capability in Firefox (see <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=179656">Bug 179656 - Allow
drag-and-drop reordering of tabs</a>). When I try to change the tab position of
a tab that is in the background, the tab is focused on mousedown (see <a
href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=295721">Bug 295721 - focused
tab in tabbox behaviour tweaks</a>).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open www.google.com in the first tab
2. Open www.yahoo.com in a second tab
3. Focus the second tab (Yahoo).
4. Drag the first tab (Google) to a new position so that it follows the second
tab (Yahoo).

Actual Results:
The Google tab ha focus.

Expected Results:
The Yahoo tab ha focus.

I understand from the comment 5 and 6 in Bug 295721 that the mousedown focus
wa the intended behavior. However, I believe that they did not consider the
effect that this change would have on Bug 179656, and therefore I have filed
this bug to request a change.
