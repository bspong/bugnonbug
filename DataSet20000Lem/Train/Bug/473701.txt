Mozilla, since newest update 3.0?, shuts off after EVERY download (photo, music, file, etc...)and I get a "DEP" bubble pops-up. Mozilla also shuts off during normal usage intermittently but either way, a click of the 'restore session' button brings everything back. I do not speak 'computer' very well and read every link until I got a headache and they're all similar but slightly different. I shut down all open page and went in and updated all window software, security software, etc.... then tried again, same result. I tried "MOZILLA-SAFE MODE" with same result again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.download anything
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Mozilla shuts off but come back to the exact page with "restore session"
P.S. I LIKE THIS BUTTON

Expected Results:
Download a normal without shutting off
Sorry, I don't speak computer very well, I don't know how else to describe it

Sorry, I'm an idiot, I tried a STACK TRACE and couldn't figure it out.
Please help.
