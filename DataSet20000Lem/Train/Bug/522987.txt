Flash uploader under password protected site (htpasswd) freeze Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; es-ES; rv:1.9.0.14) Gecko/2009082707 Firefox/3.0.14 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I am creating a site. One of the folder need to be password protected. I protected the folder with the basic .htpasswd method of apache.

On one of the page there is a flash uploader. This is for uploading images. The uploader used is the YUI Uploader (included in the Yahoo library, version 2.7.0b), but I think that this could happen with any flash uploader.

If I dont't try to upload nothing trought this control, Firefox work normally. If I try to upload something, the upload never finish and when I try to reload the page or try to go to other section, firefox simply freezes.

This doesn't happen if I remove the password protection. With an unprotected folder, Firefox run normally.

The Flash uploader call a PHP in order to upload the file. That PHP is in the same folder than the uploader. This mean that the PHP is password protected too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page that is under basic apache password protection (htpasswd), and ha a flash uploader.
2. Enter a valid username and password. The page opens.
3. Try to upload a file through the flash uploader.
4. The flash uploader display a username and password window. Again, enter a valid username and password.
5. The page start displaying progress of upload (if it ha this feature), and the file never end uploading.
6. Try reload the page.
7. At this point, Firefox should freeze.
Actual Results:
Firefox freezed, and I needed to kill the process.

Expected Results:
The file thas is being uploaded trough the flash uploader should finish uploading.
