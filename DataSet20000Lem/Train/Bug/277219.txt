When viewing a web page that set the icon in the address bar (say newegg.com or
mozilla.org), Firefox crash when opening a new tab and clicking on the "home"
icon before the "blank page" turn from gray to white. Perhaps my slow system
(650 megahertz Athlon) make the problem possible, where a faster system won't
display a new tab with a gray screen for 0.5-1.0 second (like my computer
does). I have to be quick to reproduce this, but I can do it 100% of the time.

My home icon brings me to http://www.google.com

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox
2. go to http://newegg.com
3. press ctrl-t (for a new tab)
4. quickly after the new tab appears, but before it turn from gray to white,
click on the home icon.
5. wait for a second and Firefox will crash (process will terminate, window
disappears).

Actual Results:
Firefox's process terminated and the window disappeared.

Expected Results:
I expected http://www.google.com to load in my newly created tab.

This version of firefox wa installed through Fedora Core 3's packaging system
using a command like "apt-get install firefox". My architecture is i686 and I
have i686 binaries.
