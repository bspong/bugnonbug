"All Bookmarks" selection option for Gold Star-added Bookmarks disappears
If a user is on a web page and selects the star on the location bar, a bookmark is added for that page and the star turn gold. If the gold star is selected a second time, a dialog come up which contains a field for the bookmark name, a drop down to select the folder the bookmark go in, and a field for tags.

By default, when this dialog come up, the folder dropdown is pre-selected with "All Bookmarks" a the containing folder. Two of the other option if the dropdown is selected are the Bookmarks Menu and the Bookmarks Toolbar. If either of these are selected and the dialog is dismissed by clicking on "done", the "All Bookmarks" option will never appear again when the dialog is opened in the future. This seems like a bug of some sort (either we should never see "All Bookmarks" or it should consistently be there).

Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to an unbookmarked page.
2. Select the star on the location bar. It will turn gold.
3. Select the star again.
4. In the dialog that opens, change "Folder" from "All Bookmarks" to "Bookmarks Menu".
5. Click the "Done" button.
6. Select the star again.
7. In the dialog, try changing the folder back to "All Bookmarks".

Result: "All Bookmarks" is no longer a folder option.
