Jumping to a new page in eBay search reset category, but only for the first time

When searching for a popular keyword in eBay's search page, you generally get
many thousand hit in various categories. The list of hit can span ten of
page in eBay's auction listing.
In this case you generally want to narrow down your search by choosing a
specific eBay product category. If the listing still span multiple pages, you
get a "Go To Page #" input box at the bottom of the listing.
Typing a page number in this input box get you to that page, but *for all
categories*, not for the category you're interested in.
This happens only when coming freshly to the eBay search page and doing a search
for the first time. If you now do a second search and proceed a above,
everything work OK, and it keep working OK until you navigate off eBay or
close Mozilla Firefox.

NOTE: I don't know whether this is a bug in Mozilla Firefox or in eBay.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ebay.com.
2. Search for something, e.g. "tuxedo".
3. You should get about four thousand hits, of which one thousand in the "Men's
clothing" category.
4. Click on the "Men's clothing" category. You should get about one thousand
hits, spanning 20 pages.
5. Enter "20" in the "Go To Page #" input box and press Return, or click "Go".


Actual Results:
I got the same four thousand hit a in step #3, i.e. all auction matching
"tuxedo", *in all categories*, but this time I wa on page 20 of 82.


Expected Results:
I should have got the one thousand hit in step #4, i.e. all auction matching
"tuxedo" in Men's clothing, and be on page 20 of 20.
