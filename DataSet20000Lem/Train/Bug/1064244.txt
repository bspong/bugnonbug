firefox sync stop working after few days, weekly server maintenance seems to fix it for few next day again
The sync of all in setting checked stuff stop working after a few days.
And based on my observation from the several past week I have a feeling that a sync server maintenance always seems to fix it for the few next days, when the sync stop working again, and I have to wait for another server maintenance again.

The sync wheel is spinning normal and stop a expected after it got fixed via bug 1006360, and a wa discussed in there, I already enabled the following option for more verbose logging:
services.sync.log.appender.file.logOnError;true
services.sync.log.logger.engine.history;Trace
Unfortunatelly, when I notice that the sync stopped working again (most notably the history sync ain't transferred to another station, last week I noticed password sync mismatch too, but it could simply be all the sync checked stuff), absolutely nothing is writted down in the log (~/.mozilla/firefox/my profile ID/weave/logs/), even the log file aren't created.


As already said above, I have the feeling that the sync server maintenance seems to fix it for the few next days.
So my guess is that there might be something broken on the sync server side, a it always get fixed after the maintenance.

I have no idea whether I'm the only one being affected, or if there are more user affected like this. If there are more of you, please people for your additional confirmations.
And though I filled in the bug form my OS: Linux, this problem could be OS independent if there is some issue on the sync server.
The lenght of when sync start working (after the server maint. message is shown in the browser) till it stop (a mismatch is noticed) is various, sometimes it is 1-2 days, the last week I think it could've been about 4 days.
