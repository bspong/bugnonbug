Steps to reproduce:

In bug 891786 comment 9 (and 10), talking about applying the persona to the find bar on top:

I've made a comparison screenshot of the same persona in Aurora and in the current Nightly that ha been undergoing many visual changes. I'm not exactly sure how many more change will the Australis look bring yet, hopefully some of them will at least attempt to bring the UI together. But when I look at the Nightly screenshot, I don't see a "unified" visual UI like I do in Aurora, I see 3 small window (nav bar at the top, sidebar, content with find bar heading it), each with it own color and looks.

If this persona look really wa considered on purpose then all I have to say is I'm sure there will be many (many!) people unpleased with how their firefox will look. The Australis theme may indeed look visually appealing by itself, but applying a persona to it, at least for now with only the change that have been implemented so far, it is far from even tolerable. I would not use a persona if I wa using the current Nightly a my default browser. It look like the browser is... broken in pieces.

I would strongly suggest to at least consider some way to better unify the browser look when using personas. Implementing bug 891786 would be a start.
