after installing FF3rc and loving it for the first few hours, i am now experiencing 2 issue having to do with text entry focus i think.

first one is the find in page feature, i press / key and the bar appears at bottom, yet it is unfocused and typing will not enter to text to either the search bar or the previously focused text control. i must specifically click on the search field to enter text.

the second problem is with textfields in form when value have been typed in before. i enter some text, and click submit, but rather than submit the page, it show me a dropdown of saved form suggestion for the last textfield which wa focused. similarly, clicking on a radio button cause the same result, and my only mean to proceed is to press enter to submit form, or relaunch FF. this occured for instance, after using a flight search page on american airline about 5 times, it then began every time after this
