When I create certain SVG text element some of the text get cutoff. It only happens when the SVG element is nested inside a CENTER element. It also only happens if it is inline SVG inside an HTML element. The example URL should show this pretty clearly, you will notice that it seems like the bottom 1/4 of the text ha just been cutoff.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an inline SVG Example with an SVG element, with these added attributes. viewBox='0 0 210 297' width='900' height='1200'
2. Center the SVG using <CENTER> tags.
3. Put a text element inside this SVG a follows <text style='font-size:2.82px;' x="15.30" y="52.09">Number:</text>

Actual Results:
It produced my text a I expected but the bottom part of the text seemed to be cut off and not 100% rendered.

Expected Results:
Usually all the other text get posted fine but I notice some of this text get cut off now and then, I expected the text to show up normally i.e. 100% rendered.

I wa not using any themes, just the normal install of Mozilla. I don't have any special configuration either.
