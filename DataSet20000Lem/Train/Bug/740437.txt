Malicious Website redirects all tab to different website

Steps to reproduce:

Browse on the website www.mmorpg.com where one of the advertisement contained a piece of code which caused all active tab to be redirected (or reloaded) since the site in them remained the same.
However when checking the link target on anything clickable on all the tab (including the one which had www.mmorpg.com) they where now going to an malicious website instead.

This can be used to exploit other vulnerability within the browser or install harmfull software on the target machine.


Actual results:

All active tab where "reloaded" and all clickable link where replaced with an url to an malicious website.


Expected results:

No other tab should be possible to be accessed in a way that allows to replace their content if the script is not from the same domain.

If such an attempt is discovered it should be logged silently in the error window so malware site can be more easely tracked who are abusing this exploit.

Another extra feature should be added to be enabled or disabled (enabled by default) to allow same domain script to access tab which are from the same domain.

Side note: this used to be a rare but becomes more common these day and is even applied within advertisement script now which would affect potentially every user which visit regular website where advertisement are displayed (pretty much all websites).
