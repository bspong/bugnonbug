After enabling the designMode with JavaScript (document.designMode = "on"), the browser go into the Designer Mode where you can edit the pages.

When you turn off designMode, it prevents you from editing the pages. However, the right-click menu still act like from a text area, submit button go to "resource://gre/res/%5Bxpconnect%20wrapped%20nsIURI%5D", and numerous other glitch occur.

The only way to completely leave designMode is to either restart the browser or close the tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and look at the normal right-click menu and such.
2. Enable designMode with javascript:designMode = "on"; void 0.
3. Look at the right-click menu and such again.
4. Disable designMode with javascript:designMode = "on"; void 0.
5. Notice how the right-click menu and such still have not reverted back.
Actual Results:
The designMode still prevents you from editing, a normal, but the right-click menus, submit buttons, and more still do not revert back.

Expected Results:
The right-click menu / button should have gone to the way they were before designMode wa turned on.

This is a minor but very annoying glitch. For a demonstration, go to http://www.zeldacastle.com/exploit/ . This all happens with a Vanilla installation of Firefox on Windows XP. This is not exactly a security problem but a nuisance problem instead.
