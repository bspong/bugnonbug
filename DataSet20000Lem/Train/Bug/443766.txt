When you view the site i submitted the page scroll slow with the background image even when i lowered the resolution and size of the image to 60%. Also the Flash element and Script element within the page (ie: the SHoutbox on the front page) lag behind when you scroll up and down quickly. This doe not happen in IE7 at all and scroll perfect. Basically any website using a fixed background that ha Google Ads will experience this too a the Google ad lag behind and overlap other element of the site temporarly.

Of course one can not use fixed background but then this is ruining the web surfing experience a i am sure alot of myspace site use this feature.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load up any website with a fixed background
2. Scroll up and down really quick
3. compare same site with IE7
Actual Results:
What happened is the web site scroll very slow and flash element lag behind and look choppy.

Expected Results:
it should perform like IE and scroll fast and all element should stay fixed in there table instead of lagging and overlapping other part of the site temporarily.
