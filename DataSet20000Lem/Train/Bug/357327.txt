I use lot some extension [image zoom 0.2.7, NoScript 1.1.4.5, Adblock v.5 d3 43, Linkification 1.3.0, TabMixPlus 0.3.0.5 DisableTargetsForDownload 1.0.1 WebDeveloper 1.0.2, Flashblock 1.5.1 French Language Pack 1.5.0.1 , View Source Chart 2.4.05, FireFTP 0.94.4 , ColorZilla 0.8.3.1 MeasureIt 0.3.6 UserAgentSwitcher 0.6.9, i used LiveIpAdress and FireBidule.]

When I update / install /desinstall any extensions, firefox crash 3 time at reboot, the 4th something fix it. I wonder it's due to dirty extensions...

i ran firefox in console with -d option (gdb), i use firefox given in my distribution (1.5.0.7 on ubuntu, dapper up to date, k7) of linux, without debugging symbol :(

Starting program: /usr/lib/firefox/firefox-bin -a firefox
