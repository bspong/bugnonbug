Crash OOM | small InfallibleAllocator not so from PR_Assert; 44 window 347 tab open

Steps to reproduce:

So 44 window and 347 tap is certainly A LOT. FF is taking 3GB of virtual memory a reported by process explorer. Also, this version of process explorer (v16.04) report GPU memory. I have 65MB dedicated GPU memory--it's a laptop with integrated Intel graphics. But i have 1.6GB (10%, apparently) of System GPU Memory--which again is A LOT. That wa reading at 1.4GB, when FF crashed, again, according to process explorer.

I'm not sure FF is supposed to handle this many window and tabs.

But i filed the bug because the stack trace contains

nsTArray_base<nsTArrayInfallibleAllocator, nsTArray_CopyWithMemutils>::EnsureCapacity(unsigned int, unsigned int)

which i assume is supposed to prevent OOM crashes, and yet, it, itself, crash with OOM.

This crash, too, wa the same thing:

Actual results:

FF crashed and brought up the crash reporter.


Expected results:

FF should not crash, or at least not here.
