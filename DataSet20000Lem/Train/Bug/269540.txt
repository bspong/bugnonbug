*I wa running Firefox 1.0 and sent a bug report about the CMND-UPARROW and
CMND-DOWNARROW key combination not functioning a "HOME" (top of page) and
"END", asking for a single-handed approach (for powerbook users.) I downloaded
the latest daily build of 0.9.1+ and it seems this problem wa addressed.
*However, in 0.9.1+ (today), the tab do not function properly most of the time;
for some reason, when you change tabs, the old page stay on the screen until
you either scroll down or resize the window.
*Additionally, CNTRL-T no longer seems to swap tabs. The key combination on a
powerbook to change tab now is CTRL-FN-UPARROW, but even this is finnicky,
since if you accidentally hit the FN key before you hit CTRL it won't work.
*Finally, I downloaded 1.0 OSX again and it will not launch at all. It simply
quits itself before even establishing a menu bar. I downloaded it three time to
be sure.
