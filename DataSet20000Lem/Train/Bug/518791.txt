When visiting http://www.hueppe.name/ the site is not displayed at all in the browser window. The functionality is there (mouse menus, link etc) but the content is not displayed.

Eg., I have this report open on one Tab, and the hueppe.name site on another.
When I change Tabs, the report is still visible a if I hadn't switched Tabs,
but the functionality of hueppe.name (menus etc) is active: menu pop up, jpegs
are displayed a the mouse enters them etc.

Note that this seems Linux/Opensuse-specific, since I don't see the problem on
Windows with Firefox 3.5.3
