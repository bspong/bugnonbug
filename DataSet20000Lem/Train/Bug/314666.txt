This website ha very lign yellw/tan cell background that don't display properly in FF 1.5 B2
The navigation bar at the top doesn't align vertically the same way that it doe in IE6.
I am running Windows XP SP2 w/a 1920 x 1200 Samsung Monitor w/ large screen font (120DPI, not the standard 96DPI for those cheap 1024 x 768 entry-level monitors.)

All 19" and above monitor that I have use large screen font

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.in FF 15. B2, go to http://www.parkplacetexas.com/DealershipHome.asp?DealershipID=1
2.in IE6 SP2 go to http://www.parkplacetexas.com/DealershipHome.asp?DealershipID=1
3.see the difference

Actual Results:
this is a no brainer to see if you have large screen fonts, an LCD monitor, and a nVidia GeForce FX 5200 or better video card with 32M color


Expected Results:
different from IE, some color do not show up, cell do not aling vertically

looked exactly like the IE6 page
