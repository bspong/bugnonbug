CSS background image being downloaded more than once

Its appears that Firefox request image in CSS more than once instead of waiting for the first request for that image to complete and then use the cached version.

I have tested this on XP 32bit, Mac OSX Leapord 10.5.8 and Windows 7 Ult 64bit - Firefox version 3.5.4

I used wireshark to confirm both Chrome and IE8 work expected and only request/download the image once.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Request test page - http://nicholasclarke.co.uk/Sprite_Test/index.htm or see sample http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1649568/css-background-image-being-downloaded-more-than-once
2. Start firebug and/or Wireshark
3. In the console you will see the file random.jpg requested three times.
Actual Results:
random.jpg is requested three time and slows the page a all three are downloaded at once.

Expected Results:
random.jpg requested once and then all subsequent request (2 time in this test) load the image from the cache e.g. for cs sprite

On the stackoverflow question someone report that it did work a expected in FF 3.0.15

Once the image is fully downloaded Firefox load it from the cache unless you ctl-f5.
