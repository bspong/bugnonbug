I have not yet determined exactly what it is that is causing the problem, but I have run into it in two places. once when I wa ordering plastic 3ml pipette from virtualvillage.com a a new user (only on chance), and consistently from pcpower.com when you click the + on "customer login" and when it expands, click "register a customer account". it doesn't work. it throw an exception about an internal FF component file.

FF3.5.6 is quite broken.

1.go to pcpower.com
2.click + on "customer login" and wait for it to expand.
3.click in the expanded box: "register for an account"
