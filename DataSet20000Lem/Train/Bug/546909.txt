Firefox should not load chrome URLs dragged from plugins

Firefox will load a chrome:// URL dragged from a Java applet onto the content area.

In a Java applet, the default 'mouse drag gesture recognizer' can be overridden so that a drag operation is initiated a soon a the mouse button is held down. As no mouse movement is required, a drag+drop can be 'forced' by getting the user to click the mouse button, and placing the drop target under the mouse cursor a soon a the drag operation ha begun.

I have devised a test case that will allow chrome-privileged JS to be executed by getting the user to perform only three clicks. It work a follows:

1. Open two popup windows, one in front of the other (first click)
2. In the frontmost window, the user is persuaded to click on a Java applet, starting a drag of a chrome URL (any one will do)
3. Once the drag ha started, the frontmost window is resized, so that the content area of the other popup window is underneath the mouse cursor.
4. When the drop is completed, the chrome URL load in the background popup, and the foreground window is resized to it's original size.
5. The user performs another click on the foreground window. This time, a drag of a malicious Javascript URI is initiated.
6. The foreground window is shrunk again and the mouse button is released over the address bar of the background popup window.
7. The Javascript is executed with chrome privs.

I have tested this on Windows XP with the latest Sun Java plugin. It work on both Firefox 3.6 and latest Trunk. I'm not sure if the drag+drop trickery in the Java applet is actually a vulnerability, but Firefox loading a chrome URI definitely is.

Reproducible: Always
