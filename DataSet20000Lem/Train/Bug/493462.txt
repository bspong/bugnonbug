this is not about current/stable build but about latest beta, mac o x only.
despite i have an excellent video card (with all extension enabled) and despite the latest stable build is working just fine (when it come to scrolling), after installing thew newest beta (which I uninstalled, being unusable) i realized that with the new build, scrolling is incredibly slow. i messed with all scrolling options, no use... i had to reinstall the stable build (which i am using a we speak)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install latest beta
2. start browser
3. scrolling in the main rendering surface should be a fast a before (current stable release)
Actual Results:
scrolling in the main rendering surface is extremely slow, no matter what scrolling option you use. it is actually unusable (had to roll back to stable build)

Expected Results:
should scroll a fast/smooth a stable build, other browsers, etc
please do no dismiss the issue thinking that i may have a problem with my video/graphic card. all my setting are top notch (i am a software eng). the very same machine scroll just fine with current/stable firefox build. the latest (beta) build is the only one with this issue (not other product scroll a slow, including firefox stable). it must a build option you forgot...
