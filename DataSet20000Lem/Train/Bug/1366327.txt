Firefox copy URL and email link feature should deal with Reader View URLs properly.
With 57 getting the page action menu, it seems likely that a lot more people are going to be exposed to and use share action such a Email, Copy, etc. And from a mockup I saw, Reader Mode may be getting even more visibility.

Currently if you attempt to share any page while in Reader View instead of sending the URL you see, you get something like about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdolske.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F05%2F18%2Fphoton-engineering-newsletter-1%2F
This make for a poor experience for user - and potentially frustrating/confusing experience for recipients.

When I previously brought up that addons were fetching this internal URL, it wa pointed out that this wa intentional and addons would have to convert it on their own for user-facing purposes. I doubt any did, but notably *we* didn't do it internally for something like Email (Copy wa fixed though).

I've just now seen that the "Share" button is disabled in Reader View (don't think it wa originally). I'd argue that due to it's increased visibility, this should be enabled for Reader View. As seen in the following mockup, the Share button now seems to pas off URLs straight to the platform's sharing function.

We can't expect any of these to convert the URL, so let's just convert it for them.
