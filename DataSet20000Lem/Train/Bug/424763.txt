From any website, click file->print preview. This open the preview in the same tab. If I change any aspect of the printing (landscape/portrait or zoom) and then close the preview I lose the back button and also the alt + left arrow navigation. The History->back menu still works.

This wa tested on:
2008032005 Minefield/3.0b5pre
2008032305 Minefield/3.0b5pre


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit two website in the same tab.
2. Click the File menu then Print preview while on the new website.
3. Change something like portrait or landscape or zoom levels.
5. Click the close button.
6. Try clicking the now disabled back button or alt+left arrow to go back to the old website.
Actual Results:
Back button is disabled and so is the alt + left arrow functionality. Clicking on History->back in the file menu still works.

Expected Results:
Navigation to still be enabled to go back to the source website.

Default everything.
