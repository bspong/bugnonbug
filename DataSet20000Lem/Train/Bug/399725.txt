IE ALWAYS Does. For IE it doe require shutting down all sessions-a simple refresh won't do it, but if you close it down and reopen, then the new xml data is read. No matter what you do with Firefox, it never read the new data. I have tried all the meta tags, command within action script. I find this incredibly annoying a it is affecting customers, not me. I want them to see new proudcts added and any of them using FF will think nothing is ever added.

In Flash I have even chnaged the name of the xml file to have the date/timestamp added onto it, and it still doesn't know it a new file, still read the old data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add new data to xml file
2. go to site in IE, new xml data is fed in to flash
3. go to site in FF, old xml data is read, meta tag no help, refresh no help.
FF seems to have some very odd way of dealing with cache and being quite stubborn about it. I cannot control any setting on my customer browsers. I guess in this case it actually good that most people are still using IE, even though I personalluy far prefer FF
Actual Results:
described above, FF doe NOT read new xml file, it continually read cached version Add data to xml file, upload xml file, load page, old data is still being read.

Expected Results:
read the new data in xml file
