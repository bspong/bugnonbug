After importing huge number of IE bookmarks, Firefox will not load, freeze and crashes.

When installing firefox on a friend computer, (this one), I imported IE's
settings. Then when I started firefox, it loaded, and the 4 bookmark that
actually showed up all started with "!" or "#", and were advertisment related.
the large number of bookmark being loaded caused firefox to freeze and crash.

I deleted the profile folder, and restarted firefox but without importing IE's
stuff, and it worked fine.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a huge number of bookmark (I have no idea how many, but probably hundreds)
2. Run Firefox with the default setup including bookmark bar showing.

Actual Results:
firefox crashed.

Expected Results:
No crash.

This wa a computer that wa infested with spyware which I had removed, but the
bookmark were left behind I guess. Interestingly, they didn't show up in IE,
so i'm not sure where Firefox found them to import. SP2 wa installed, so maybe
that had something to do with it.
