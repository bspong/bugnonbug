cannot restore pdfjs due to conflict with download prefs
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 Iceweasel/27.0a2 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

A virgin Firefox will use pdfjs, however if one day this becomes gimp, there is no way to restore pdfjs action. No matter if the user reset his application preference to "preview in firefox", reset all the pdfjs setting in about:config, remove his .mailcap and .local and .mime*, etc. etc.


Actual results:

P.S., even a virgin firefox's strace show
open("/tmp/.local/share/applications/gimp.desktop", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/local/share/applications/gimp.desktop", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/usr/share/applications/gimp.desktop", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE) = 24
access("/usr/local/bin/gimp-2.8", X_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/usr/bin/gimp-2.8", X_OK) = 0
stat64("/usr/bin/gimp-2.8", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=5837824, ...}) = 0
access("/usr/local/bin/gimp-2.8", X_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
access("/usr/bin/gimp-2.8", X_OK) = 0
stat64("/usr/bin/gimp-2.8", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0755, st_size=5837824, ...}) = 0

But luckily gimp is not finally called.
