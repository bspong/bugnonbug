Whenever I'm on YouTube, Ebaum's World watching video or surfing the web, FireFox becomes totally unresponsive after 10-45 minute when trying to load a new page or new video. It doe this reliably. I have increased and decreased my cashe to no avail. So you know, FireFox never stop in the middle of a video or a search, it just won't load a new one all of a sudden. It also doe not do this in the middle of a flash game or when I'm in my Entourage email program. Sometimes eBay freeze a well. It probably ha to do with the "loadng" process. The message is always the same when I Force quit the application; FireFox Not Responding.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.The only solve is to force quit, and reenter the app.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Just go on YouTube for 10-45 minute

Expected Results:
Force quitting is NOT a proper way to browse. This need attention immediatly a it is ultra irritating.

Keep working like every other browser on planet Earth. I know others who have this problem with FireFox, so they use Safari now. Maybe I should too.
