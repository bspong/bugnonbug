when using javascript to switch the visible <div> tag on a page (see my example at 'http://fmkaiba.xmgfree.com/mozillaembedbug.html') when you return the div style back to visible, any embeded object are no longer present. when the style is changed back to style="" from style="display: none;" all embeded flash seems forgotten, and are lost on the style="display: none;"

I checked this on IE and it work ok, so the HTML is good. i would highly apreciate a fix for your already great product

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

3. click the Expand hyperlink to change it back to style=""

Actual Results:
the flash is gone, and the whole object isn't displayed or running

it occurs on all computers, and all theme and with even no extentions installed.
