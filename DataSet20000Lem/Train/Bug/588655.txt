When in private browsing mode, make the Firefox button purple
As an ambient and peripheral cue that the user is in private browsing mode, we should adjust the color of the Firefox button on Windows 7 and Vista from orange to purple. (purple is used on the masquerade mask in the content area message, and doesn't have any other semantic meaning in the product other than privacy).

Additionally we should alter the text of the button to "Firefox (Private)"

Any other modification to the theme (like darkening the toolbars) will be done in addition to this change, but this is the minimum change for indicating the state of the browser.

A specific non-goal of this bug is over the shoulder screen privacy. We are assuming that if you are using private browsing mode, you are probably not in a situation where other people can view your computer monitor (since the content of content area are being shown just a much a the firefox button).

We are however, very interested in giving user a reminder that Firefox is not storing any information about their activity on the Web, and we are interested in significantly reducing the number of mode error that user are currently experiencing (staying in Firefox for long period of time because they forget to exit).

(listing this under content area notifications, which isn't entirely accurate since it persists after we show about:privatebrowsing, but I didn't really have any other place to put it)
