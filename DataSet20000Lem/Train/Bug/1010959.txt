Move themes/*/devtools/computedview.css into themes/shared/devtools/computedview.css
As part of the process of DRYing up our CSS, we should move the computed-view CSS file into the shared folder.

The main step for merging these file into one are:

1) Make sure there aren't any difference between the windows/linux/osx version of the files. You can use a diffing tool for this, or just look at them:

diff browser/themes/linux/devtools/computedview.css browser/themes/osx/devtools/computedview.css
diff browser/themes/linux/devtools/computedview.css browser/themes/windows/devtools/computedview.css

2) If there are no changes, then all we need to do is delete the two of the version then hg rename the other (to preserve history):

hg rename browser/themes/linux/devtools/computedview.css browser/themes/shared/devtools/computedview.css

2a) If there are minor change between OS, then the new file will have to have a * in front of it in the jar.mn files, and we will need to add some conditions, like %ifdef XP_MACOSX to handle them specifically.

3) Modify browser/themes/*/jar.mn to replace (devtools/computedview.css) with (../shared/devtools/computedview.css). Note that the windows/jar.mn file ha two place that need to change.
