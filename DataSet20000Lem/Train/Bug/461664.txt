A restart of a complex firefox session (dozens of windows, hundred of tabs) will not properly reload ftp URLs.

This appears to be due to timeouts in responding to the FTP server (which will tend to be slow during a complex session restore).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start a complex firefox session (dozens of windows; hundred of tabs).
2. Visit some "standard" ftp sites; e.g. ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/ and ftp://ftp.broad.mit.edu/
3. Crash firefox and attempt a normal "restore".

The ftp session hang, apparently with an error:
421 Login Timeout (60 seconds): closing control connection
which spring a Firefox popup window which may (or may not) hang further page reloads.

The FTP URL restore process should recognize that it undergoing a "restore" operation and retry the URLs if an error 421 is received.
Actual Results:
Pages fail to load and popup window are generated.

Expected Results:
One should always be able to reload "common" server FTP page (assuming one internet link is functional).
