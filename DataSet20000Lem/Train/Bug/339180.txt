Every single time I access a webpage that ha banner ad from advertising.com the site freeze and lock up. Everytime it happens it freeze at the servedby.advertising.com prompt, but this ONLY happens with Firefox and not Internet Explorer.

More and more site are using banner ad from Advertising.com a they appear to be nearing if not THE market leader for online banner ads. But, viewing any site served by advertising.com is a complete waste of time using the firefox browser because for some reason it just freezes. This happens to me on multiple PC's and multiple website (ESPN.com, Rivals.com, Careerbuilder.com, etc...) so it is obviously some disconnect between Firefox and Advertising.com.

Many of the site I visit on a regular basis use advertising.com for their banner ad and I am now forced to use Internet Explorer (which pain me for numerous reasons)

I switched to Firefox for mostly security reasons, but if it is not functional I'm going to shit can it altogether which would make me very sad. :(

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE open up a discussion with the advertising.com techie to find out how to fix this problem. I really would prefer to use a non-microsoft product, but I can't if it won't work.

I would be happy to walk you through if it would help, but I'm sure you're smarter than me and you can figure it out. I have faith.

Thanx for listening to my gripe.

Best of Success,
