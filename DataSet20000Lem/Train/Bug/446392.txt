If you are in the habit, like I am, of using the Windows 'window bar' to bring window to the front, you will come across the following bug where Mozilla is rearranging the stack order of browser windows.

It may sound minor, but I am finding it very annoying a I strike this bug all the time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with at least two browser window open and occupying enough of the screen that they overlap (so you can see their stack order). We also need the window of another application available. It's position is immaterial.
2. Bring a browser window to the front by clicking on it's button on the Windows window bar (bottom of the screen). Lets call this 'window A'
3. Now do the same thing with a different browser window ('window B')
4. Now Window B should be at the front, with Window A just behind it.
5. Bring the window of another application to the front by using the window bar.


Actual Results:
If you were watching the screen, you will have noticed that just before the other application window wa brought to the front, Mozilla switched the order of the two browser window on us. If you close or hide the other app window that is now at the front, you will find that Window A is now in front with Window B behind it.

Expected Results:
The browser window stay where they are and do not change order on us.

This only seems to happen if you use the Windows 'window bar' to change the order of windows. Using some other method such a clicking on the window themselves, doe not seem to induce this behaviour.
