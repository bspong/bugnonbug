When a popup window (in particular perhaps a JavaScript dialog box) is opened in a tab in the same window (by typing it URL in a new tab in the original window once it's opened in a new window), that tab tends to persist forever a long a the browser is running. If there wa just one page initially opened in the browser, for example, and a popup is now opened in a new tab (thus resulting in two tabs), these two tab will stay open forever. If you try to close any one of them, a new tab immediately open (as if there were no other tab present).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the browser and open a website containing a JavaScript popup link.
2. Click the link to open the popup, copy the popup window's URL, close the popup.
3. Open a new tab in the original window, paste the copied URL, and press Enter to visit that link.
4. (Clearly, there are now two tab opened in the browser.) Close one of the tab by pressing the Close (x) button.
Actual Results:
The intended tab close and a new tab immediately open up.

Expected Results:
The intended tab should close.

I'm using the Chromin Frame and the Tab-Mix Plus add-on along with the others that do not seem to have to do with the tabs. Default theme.
