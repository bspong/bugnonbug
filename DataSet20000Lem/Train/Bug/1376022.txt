User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0
Build ID: 20170608105825

Steps to reproduce:

I updated from Firefox 53.0.3 to 54.0 (32-bit) on Windows 7 Pro (64-bit).

Windows 7 Pro (64-bit) is up-to-date up to and including the May-2017 patches.

I start Firefox, and when I close it with File --> Exit, or X in top right corner it closes, but always give the message: "Firefox ha stopped working" (see attachment firefox-exit-1).

Firefox 53.0.3 doe not have this problem.

I tried the following with 54.0:
1. Safe mode;
2. Refresh Firefox;
3. Uninstall Firefox and install Firefox from scratch;
4. Tested, rebooted, tested again.
But I keep getting the exit message.
