Sporadic page load stall for 10-30 seconds.

On one of my computers, all 3.5.X release randomly stall for 10 to 30 second with status 'looking up...' when loading a page. This occurs unpredictably and can effect any website.

Other browser installed on the same computer are not effected. Other installation of 3.5.2 on other computer on the same LAN do not have this issue. Creating a new profile did not help. Disabling IPv6 in about:config did not help. Downgrading from 3.5.2 to 3.5.1 and 3.5.0 had no effect. Downgrading to 3.0.13 worked around the problem. The Firefox profile wa not replaced or altered when downgrading.

The effected system is a dual core AMD system running Windows XP SP2 32bit. The two other computer on my LAN using 3.5.2. without issue are single core Intel system running XP SP2 32bit.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Occurs randomly and is not reproducible on command BUT occurs regularly enough to make 3.5.X unusable.



This may be a version of bug 446249 (bug listed for FF 3.0) in the 3.5 series.
