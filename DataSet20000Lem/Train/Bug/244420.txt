The problem appears to be related to extension but I am filing it against
firefox because the two different system I tested it on have no overlap
in the extension used.

It is VERY common for criminally incompetent webmaster to write something like
<A HREF="javascript:showDoc('http://....');">
Which is a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, instead of:
<A HREF="http://....">

Now, if I disable all extensions, disable popup blocking, and fully enable
javascript, this work on both browser configurations.

But If I enable extensions, it fails silently. Thing is, it isn't the same
extension on the two browsers. It is the window.open() call which is
failing; the alert() dialog box I have added prove that javascript is being
run. However, when the window.open() call fails, the following javascript
doe not get executed.

I tried, unsuccessfully, to determine which extension on the linux side wa
responsible by selectively enabling and disabling extensions. Instead, I
mannaged to end up with a user profile that wouldn't let firefox start up.
Also, it is very difficult to restore the browser to it prior state
after having to create a new profile.

None of the extension involved are pop-up blockers.

Also, this problem seems to infect the
Firefox -> Tools-> Options -> Extensions -> get newbutton a well.

Even if the two extension are making the same coding error, this still point
to some problem in firefox. There are no feature to allow debugging of
extensions. Where is the tool that would show me which method are invoked
when I press a button and which extension or built in function are executed
a a result? Short of riding the full mozilla/firefox developer learning
curve, there doesn't seem to be a reasonable way to diagnose extension problems.
When I tried the venkman debugger (on windows), the problem disappeared
after I selected Debug -> Error Trigger -> Trace errors, even when I
subsequently set it back to "Ignore errors". So, it may be that the
debugger change the error handling behavior of firefox once you first
select this. However, if you select "stop on error" mode, it doesn't
stop for the error below though it doe intermittently stop in various other
place that aren't related to the problem being reported, a those bug are
excited by activity.

The following error appears at approximately the time the program would
malfunction a outlined in this report:
Error: ``this.docShell ha no properties`` [xs] in file
``chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml``, line 0, character 0.



Other Problems I noticed while trying to debug this one:
- If a javascript <script> section ha a parsing error, all function in that
section cease to function, even those which occur before the syntax error.
For example, omiting a closing quote or closing parenthisis on a function
call at the bottom of this section render the whole section unusable.
It is likely that this will make for even more page that run on
other browser but not firebird.
However, no error is reported on the javscript console.
- Javascript console:
- Does not display syntax error when loading file
- Many javascript command silently fail with no error
- Needs option to
[ ] Evaluate command with remote privilege
[ ] Evaluate command with local privilege
[ ] Evaluate command within context of current page. I.E. window,
document, and other object set appropriately
[ ] Evaluate command in separate context




Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
0. Create a new user profile with no extension initially loaded.
(kinda hard to do if you installed your extension system wide)
or disable all extensions.
1. Load either tab browser extension or longer list of extension above.
2. Copy html/javascript snippet below to file and open in browser
3. click on the "click here" link.
4. Wait for Godot (literary reference)
5. Disable all extension
6. Try again


Actual Results:
Nothing happens. No error message in javascript console.

Expected Results:
Open document in new tab.

<html>
<head>
<title>CIA FOIA - Search Results</title>
<base href='http://www.foia.cia.gov/' />
</head>
<body>

<script language="javascript">
// Note: an unterminated string or a missing ) will cause all of
// the javascript to be rejected. document.write('Hello, World');
alert('loaded script');
function bzzt(text) {
alert('bzzt: '+text);
}
bzzt('test');
function showDoc(dest_link) {
alert('Got Here!');
// this works:
//window.location=dest_link;
// this doesn't
window.open(dest_link, 'foo777', ''); // <------BUG!!!
alert('Got Here too!');
}
</script>
