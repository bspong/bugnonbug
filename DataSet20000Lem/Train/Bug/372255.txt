We use a Dell DRAC remote console to administer computer in a hosted data center. With Version 1.5.10 of Firefox we can connect to this remote console successfully. The remote console choses a cipher-suite of TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 a reported by ethereal. Version 2.0.0.2 fails to connect and ethereal show the flaw a being in the certificate handshake dialogue.

The about:config screen show that the preference name security.ssl3.rsa_rc4_128_md5 ha a value of true.

I can provide ethereal packet capture if desired.

Thanks!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to log into web server for remote console.
2. Connection fails.
3. Examine packet with ethereal
Actual Results:
Login screen never appears a key exchange fails after choosing cipher proposal.

Expected Results:
Successful negotiation of ssl secured connection.

I label this a Major since there may be others trying to do what I am.

Thanks!
