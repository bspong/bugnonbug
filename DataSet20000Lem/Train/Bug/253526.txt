Since about it ha been named "firefox", the browser crash a lot of times. I
deployed it to companies, and now it is not usable. It crash for me also ---
it crash more if you surf around commercial web pages, like www.cib.hu or
www.noklapja.hu. It nearly never crash on standard small weblogs like
www.hup.hu. It can mean that the crash are connected with extra capability
like flash <-> javascript <-> java or something. However, it render mozilla
undeployable --- since I am not able to identify more exactly the problem, I did
not report it for months. However, the problem still stands.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install flash player and java (several version tested)
2. www.cib.hu


Actual Results:
The browser crash (disappears), or if the talkback client is enabled, it pop up.


This bug report is the exact "bad example". Im sorry for it, although now I
waited for a long time, and it is critical for me to get rid of these crashes. I
deploy mozilla for around 1000 machines, and now I must drop it.

I tried to compile some version with and without gtk2, with and without
freetype, etc. However, I did not have the time to find the reasons. Although, I
am very sure that since the version that ha been named "firefox" the browser
ha some instability.
