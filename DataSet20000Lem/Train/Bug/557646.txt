Firefox Updater trigger UAC prompt without warning
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If an update ha been installed in the background, a UAC prompt will be triggered next time Firefox is launched, with no warning, or any indication that anything other than Firefox would be launched. As the UAC prompt is a full-screen notification that stop all other tasks, this is jarring and potentially confusing for users. The UAC window is not a replacement for an explanatory choice window, it is a security feature.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install and run old version of Firefox
2.Wait for an update to be downloaded in the background
3.Close and re-open Firefox
Actual Results:
A UAC prompt appears, halting all user actions, with only minimal explanation of what is happening.

Expected Results:
A window should appear, with an explanation that an update is ready to be installed, and "cancel" and "install" buttons; the "install" button should have a UAC shield on it. Then, when the shielded button is clicked, a UAC prompt should be triggered.
