Incomplete painting when running Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

When Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5 is running in the background (either minimized or
maximized), Firefox ha weird problem painting the screen. If the Firefox
window is larger than about 1024x768, or maximized (1920x1200 on my desktop), it
can't paint the current web page or the toolbar. They just "leak" the stuff from
underneath them.

This is probably releated to some special screen mode that Premiere is setting
up for the system. Internet Explorer works, however. I noticed this bug because
Premiere's help file is HTML and since my default browser is Firefox, I can't
browse the help comfortably.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Adobe Premiere Pro 1.5
2. Start Mozilla Firefox
3. Open any webpage and maximize the browser window (with a large display, at
least 1920x1200 will do)

Actual Results:
The webpage and Mozilla toolbar are not painted properly on the screen. They
"leak" the graphic underneath them that should have been painted over.

Expected Results:
It should have worked a usual.
