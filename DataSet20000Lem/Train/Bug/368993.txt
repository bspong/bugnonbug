Popup exception exists for site - in this case daltonrs01.mohawkind.com

Logging into Lotus Domino Web Access for email (https connection) I can open email message by double click or pressing enter which show a popup of the email message.

After some time (About an hour of running the last time it occurred) Firefox start blocking all popups from this site and showing the "Firefox prevented this site from opening xx popup windows".
