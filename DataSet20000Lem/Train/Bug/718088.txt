offer to re-set keyword.URL if it ha a non-default value
SUMO feedback show that user falling victim to "search hijacking" (keyword.url being taken over by an unwanted search engine) is a common problem.

Some of these case are triggered by aggressive malware that want to steal search referrals, but other case can be resolved by u simply resetting the pref to it default value once:
- poorly written add-on that legitimately change the pref, but programmatically such that removing the add-on doesn't revert the change
- sketchy software installation might do a one-time change of the pref value in the user's profile
- user may have unintentionally change the pref value, or may have been encouraged to modify it by a "tweaks" site, without realizing that this leaf them susceptible to brokenness in the future (google.com/firefox is no longer being maintained, and might go away at some point)

There are two case we can detect:
- pref is changed, and the hostname is different (e.g. switched from the default of Google to SuperAwesomeWebDealsSearch.com)
- pref is changed, and only parameter are different (e.g. user customized to a specific type of Google search, or referral code where added)

In either case, we could prompt the user and offer to reset the keyword.URL value to the default after they trigger a search from the location bar (with perhaps a slightly different string for each).
