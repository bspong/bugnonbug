Gecko error after updating extension (langpack)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9

I'm localizing Firefox 0.9 to portuguese (pt-PT) and I'm trying to make it
possible for user to update it from our site.

From the test that I made, update normally works, but sometimes something go
terribly wrong and Firefox becomes unusable, giving a yellow gecko error window
on startup.

At first I thought that the problem wa a botched langpack, but after fixing
firefox (by deleting the corresponding entry in the extension directory in
the profile), I installed the same langpack and it worked ok.

This happened both in Linux and Windows.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
This is what I did before the problem occurred:

1. Installed my langpack
2. Restarted Firefox
3. Activated my langpack
4. Restarted Firefox (it worked)
5. Updated the langpack
6. Restarted Firefox
Actual Results:
Sometimes these step make step 5. only show an yellow error dialog from Gecko.

Expected Results:
The new langpack should have been updated and activated.

When this happened in Windows, I had previously performed the above steps. When
it happened on Linux (prior to Windows) I had already updated the langpack
several time successfully.

Another note, the same langpack updated successfully on Linux and then triggered
this problem on Windows.
