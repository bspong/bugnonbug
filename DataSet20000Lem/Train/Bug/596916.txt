Tabs no longer use Gtk theme style
Build old: m-c trunk from 2010-08-17
Build current: m-c trunk from 2010-09-15

Firefox on Linux us the Gtk theme (by default). It match the look of Gtk apps pretty well. Also, KDE apps have a brigde theme, so my whole desktop ha a
consistent look. More importantly, it's a look that I had explicitly chosen the Gtk theme to what I like.

This is good, that I can choose the look and all apps follow, and I consider that to be a major platform advantage. The apps look "nice" to me, and I despise other random look like Windows or the default Gtk or KDE themes. It's not just the colors, but the styling, too: rounded corner vs. edgy, gaps, sizes, scroll bar look etc..

Until last month, Firefox followed the Gtk theme, too, including the tabs.
Now, the tab bar and url bar don't anymore.
1. The tab have rounded corner instead of being edgy a in the theme.
2. The tab have very ugly gap between and above them.
3. The color are slightly off, too. It *seems* that the bottom of the urlbar ha the right color (same a menu and widgets), but then us a gradient crossing urlbar and tab bar to a slightly brighter grey for the tabs. That look ugly, too. Inactive tab use a different, darker gradient.

None of that match my theme, look totally off, and is ugly for the user (ignoring his theme).
