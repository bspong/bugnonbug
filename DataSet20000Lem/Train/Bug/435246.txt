Sliding tab animation cause UI to handle keystroke differently

Ubuntu 8.04, package firefox 3.0~b5+nobinonly-0ubuntu3.

Once there's enough tab in a window so opening a new tab cause the existing one to *slide* left in an animation, FF3 is too busy doing that to handle my keystroke in the same way a it would if there wa no animation on-going.

With FF2 regardless of the number of tabs, and FF3 when there's so few tab open that no scrolling occurs when opening a new one, I could quickly type <Ctrl-T>news<Tab> and have the URL field complete to http://news.bbc.co.uk/text_only.stm ready for hitting Return. Now, after typing that, I find the <Tab> ha moved the input focus from the URL field to the tab bar instead of completing the partially typed URL and the possible completion haven't yet appeared. It seems the overhead of doing the animation, which isn't smooth but jerky if I type at the same time, mean FF3 isn't doing the more important task of working on completing my URLs.

The animation is distracting and annoying. I've a blocker for animated image but I'm not aware of an about:config option for turning off the animation and reverting to FF2's behaviour. That would be a workaround for those of u that are suffering.

Perhaps connected is the fact that the list of URL completions, when they do appear a one types, appear to cause more X protocol overhead than the old widget that wa just a simple drop-down of URLs, one per line. This also cause poor typing feedback at times.

Reproducible: Always
