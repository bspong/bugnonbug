Arrow key won't move cursor in webforms (textbox,input)

If I'm typing in a webform, the arrow key will not move the cursor through text
I already typed. (i.e. the cursor will only point at the last character I
typed) If I want to fix a typo, I need to use the mouse to select the exact
spot, delete the offending text (del and b-space do work), and enter my new
text. I then have to use the mouse to move the cursor back to where ever I left
off.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. Go to any site with a web form.
3. Pick a form element (input or textbox), and type something.
4. Try to use the arrow key to move the cursor to the left.

Actual Results:
The cursor stayed where it was.

Expected Results:
Moved to the left thru the char I already typed.

Gentoo Linux distro running Gnome 2.6 (I doubt this info is necessary, but just
in case).

Didn't affect 0.9.3.

I really considered making this Major instead of Normal because it's a major
annoyance. I need to implement the 'fix-typo-by-mouse' procedure while typing
this bug report.
