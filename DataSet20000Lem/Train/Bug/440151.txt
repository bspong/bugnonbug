Please don't casually delete this bug. It's a big deal to people who cannot use keyboards/mice.
In the sheet for customizing the toolbar, the "Done" button doe not respond to the keyboard nor to "Universal Access" application like a normal Mac OS X button. It look blue, but it's not the normal Mac OS aqua. It doe doe not highlight nor pulse like a normal Mac button (e.g. the "clear private data" dialog appearance is correct). As the default button in the pane, it should "get a click" when the user press Enter or Return on the keyboard.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Firefox > Menubar > View > Toolbars > Customize...
2. Hit Enter or Return to activate "Done" button.



Actual Results:
Nothing.

Expected Results:
Sheet closure; the standard behaviour of a Mac OS X "default" button.

I poked around in FF and this is the only button I could find that ha this incorrect behaviour.
