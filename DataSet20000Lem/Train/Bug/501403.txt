Partial page rendering via javascript manipulation clip some glyph

I'm providing a distilled test case to show the issue at hand. When you click on one of the "Click Here" titles, it toggle a hidden div to be visible (blue background). When the div is revealed, part of the page is rerendered with the additional content, and everything below the div is pushed further down. The No. glyph (&#8470;) ha a little tail out to the left that extends beyond the render zone, so a little piece remains while everything else moves. When many of these are stacked in a list, it leaf a large trail of random dot on the screen. When the page is rerendered via tab or window switching, the issue disappears, but when the open item is closed and the div hidden or another is opened, the dot return because they're left behind like before.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open testcase
2. Click on "Click here" label
Actual Results:
Vast majority of the No glyph is moved with the rest of the content, but a small sliver of the bottom left serif doesn't move with the rest of the content.

Expected Results:
The entire glyph move with the content.

I've been tracking this little quirk for a while. The result are reproducible in firefox 3.0.x, the just released 3.5, and the current nightly build. I haven't noticed any difference between quirk mode and standard mode rendering with firefox.
