Shockwave Flash Illegal operation at plugin

Using Windows XP SP2. Open Firefox to homepage www.comcast.net. Then go to URL www.hgtv.com. Error message a follows ALWAYS appears:

Illegal operation at plugin.

Shockwave Flash

The plugin performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to restart Firefox.

This happens at other site too, but I know it always happens at this one. If I click "don't show me again" and continue, at some seemingly random point, I will get the following message:

firefox.exe ha encountered a problem and need to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience.

It give me the option of sending Microsoft an error report (bet they love that!). When I click OK, all Firefox window close - all is lost.

I have not found the exact problem in your bug library and don't understand any of the bug reported with shockwave flash or macromedia.

Please explain fix (if any) in SIMPLE term the ordinary user can understand.

Thanks,

Glenn

Expected Results:
Firefox closes.

I don't know - there's some conflict here I don't understand (I'm a user, not a software expert).
