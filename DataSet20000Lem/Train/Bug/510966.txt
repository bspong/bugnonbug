Firefox use tends to cause intermittent "THREAD DEADLOCK IN DEVICE DRIVER" crash on my Gateway Core II Duo laptop with NVIDIA GeForce Go 7900 GS video chipset. I have WIN XP svc pack 3 and the latest video drivers. When the CPU is pinned or near pinned (ie over 80% utilization), these event are more common. I do not ever observe this unless I have run Firefox (it doe not have to be currently running for this to occur), and have observed it with the current version and past version going back at least 8 months. When this problem occurs, you get the "blinking screen of death," and generally lose control of the PC.

I observed another recent bug about Firefox remaining active even when all window are exited. Do you have orphaned thread that are consuming resource and ultimately deadlocking? Something like that could explain both their issue and mine. I have seen this happen after I ran and exited Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run something that hit the CPU hard, like Pro Tools or DVD authoring software.
2. Run Firefox, and load a fairly active page like http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/ or www.myspace.com/thechoirofsatan.
3. Play some videos, play some music, etc. and sooner or later, you will get caught in this.
Actual Results:
"THREAD DEADLOCK IN DEVICE DRIVER," or blinking screen and frozen keyboard requiring re-boot.

Expected Results:
Just plain work. Manage your thread better.

Possible bad in interaction with Flash or embedded media.
