If i shut down Windows while FF is running the next time i start FF the session saver of TabMixPlus say that the last session crashed. Nothing unusual can be observed if window shuts down with FF running. It just exits.

The extension developer say the fault is FF not the extension. It seems that FF exit differently if closed manually then if it wa closed by window on shutdown. The extension doesn't have the ability to write to the config that FF wa shut down properly like it doe if FF is closed manually.
My Windows installation is set up properly so that program can shut down and take some time to perform closing functions. But a already said, FF exit immediatly so it isn't killed hardly by Windows because it take too long to exit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF
2. Restart Windows
3. Restart FF

Actual Results:
Session saver of TMP say last session crashed, like FF didn't exited properly last time.

Expected Results:
Nothing, since FF wa shutdown properly.
