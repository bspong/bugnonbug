If you have a multiple select field that ha been resized (i.e. by javascript) such that the field originally did not show all of the option without scrolling, but now does, the onmouseout is not always called when the mouse leaf the field across the scrollbar at just the right speed. Onmouseout is always called when leaving across one of the other three edge of the select field. You have to go across the scrollbar with the mouse at just the right speed; if you go too fast or too slow, it work properly.

If you look closely, a you move the mouse over the scrollbar from the inside, it display the position marker for a moment. It seems that if you get the mouse out during the brief moment that the position marker is shown, then onmouseout is not called.

I have reproduced this with the following (with official version from mozilla.com unless otherwise noted):
1.5.0.7 on Linux (Debian package)
2.0 on Linux
1.5.0.7 on Windows 2000 Server
2.0 on Windows 2000 Server
1.5.0.3 on Windows XP Professional
2.0 on Windows XP Professional

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Display a multi select field that scrolls.
2. Resize the field so it doesn't need to scroll anymore.
3. Move the mouse over the field.
4. Move the mouse out of the field over the scrollbar.

Actual Results:
onmouseout wa not called

Expected Results:
onmouseout called

With the exception of "1.5.0.7 on Linux (Debian package)", all were with standard install, standard themes, no additional extension installed.
