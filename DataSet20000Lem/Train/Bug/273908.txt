mousewheel.withnokey.numlines ignored under os/2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (OS/2; U; Warp 4.5; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030730 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1
Build Identifier: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.0/contrib/

This work under older version (Firebird 0.6.1 for example), but not Firefox 1.0:

// Allows for faster mouse scrolling
user_pref("mousewheel.withnokey.numlines", 6); // Adjust this accordingly -
Default = 1
user_pref("mousewheel.withnokey.sysnumlines", false); // This must be set to
false in order to read previous line


I'm not sure when it stopped working, since I jumped from 0.6.1 to 1.0.

Interestingly, I can configure (about:config) the "withaltkey" stuff and it
work great: but I don't want to hold down the alt key all day.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.os/2 mouse properties---> scroll speed ---> normal/use simulated key
2. page up/ctrl option NOT SELECTED.
3. Using warp 4.51 (wseb), tried serveral mice. Works fine with older version
of moz/firebird.

Actual Results:
Scrolls one line at a time no matter what about:config is set to.

Expected Results:
Should scroll the number of line specified by mousewheel.withnokey.numlines
when mousewheel.withnokey.sysnumlines is false.
