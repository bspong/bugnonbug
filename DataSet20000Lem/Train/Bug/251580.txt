crash when using the kinput japanese text input server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8

When entering the japanese input mode by pressing the special key combination,
Firefox crashes.
Mozilla 1.0 doe not exhibit the problem at all in the same condition and can
handle japanese text input without problems.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set LC_CTYPE to "ja_JP.UTF-8"
2. set XMODIFIERS to "@im=kinput2"
3. start the kinput2 server with "kinput2 -canna -xim"
4. launch firefox
5. in a text input field, enter the japanese input mode by pressing the special
key combination (usually shift+space or ctrl+space)
6. crash :(

Actual Results:
All firefox window get closed immediately, no firefox process remain running.


Expected Results:
It should have allowed the kinput2 input server to handle japanese character by
opening a small window (near the text input field) in which the corresponding
japanese character are displayed a the user enters the latin equivalent
(using the keyboard).


This probably prevents all japanese user from entering japanese text into
firefox. Which seems to me a big issue.

The bug happens on a Debian woody.
the following package must be installed :
kinput2-canna-wnn 3.0-19
canna 3.5b2-46.2

firefox wa installed - using the tar.gz, in a local user folder, strictly
following the readme recommandations

Good luck, and congrats for the overall work !
