There is no prompt to activate the java plug-in when using firefox on mac. The Plugins say that it is enabled but to manually activate it for all websites, it doesn't show any. Just the step how to but there's nothing to click on to activate it.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/27.0.1453.94 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I wa doing a remote session and We were able to install java and even verified on safari>preferences>security tab> checked allow all other plugins, allow java, enable javascript. Plug-in should be working. When we tried to access zipForm 6 professional we got to the attention page that say You don't meet the system requirement to run zipForm 6 professional(this happens whenever java plug-in is not enable/activated)


so I had a choice to manually activate it by clicking on the link under Mozilla firefox users. It then show a process on how to activate it but there's no way for me to click on that "block(red block for plugin)" to activate it.

*Firefox 21 and 22 beta


Actual results:

We're not able to activate it. No pop-up prompt next to the address bar to click on.


Expected results:

we should be able to click on that so that the java plug-in could run. I've tried that on safari and we were able to activate it. Pretty much the same process that could be taken.
