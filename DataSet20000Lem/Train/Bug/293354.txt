Mozilla crash if you type "shift-left-arrow" while entering data in a text form to select a region of text
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

The web page listed above provides a mean to "write to your congressman".

Two screen after the "entry screen" listed in the URL, you are presented a
text box for your "letter to your congressman".

In that text box I wa typing a letter when I wanted to "select a region of
text" to cut and paste. One can do this with the mouse, but to be more
efficient and key my finger on the keys, I typically do it by holding down
shift, and navigating with the arrow keys. (In fact, I've done that several
time while typing this bug report... using IE). In Firefox though, this
cause Firefox to crash.

The "shift-arrow" habit is so ingrained, I can't stop myself. Even if Firefox
doesn't support that set of keystrokes, it still shouldn't crash.

I'm a big fan of Firefox, and it make me sick to my stomach to have to use
IE, but I've tried sending my letter to my congressman three time now (each
time, losing 10 minute worth of typing). So, sadly, until this bug is fixed,
I must click the "View this page in IE" extension anytime I have to enter more
than a few character of text.

It doesn't happen in all text forms. I copied and pasted a portion of the
HTML code for the form to

http://www.cis.udel.edu/~pconrad/work/html/test3.html

and found that this wa enough to reproduce the problem. This html file
contains an unclosed <dd> tag.. this is in the original source for the page
that crash (i.e. the one from the US House of Representatives web site.)
Acknowledged that the HTML is badly formed.. still it shouldn't crash!



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page with an unclosed <dd> tag before a textbox (such a
http://www.cis.udel.edu/~pconrad/work/html/test3.html, or the US House of
Representatives "write your congressman page").
2. Enter text in the textbox.
3. Hold down shift, and hit left arrow.
4. Mozilla crashes.

Actual Results:
Mozilla crashes.

Expected Results:
Don't crash.. just let the text be "selected". (This is what occurs when
there is not an unclosed <dd> tag before the <textbox> element.
