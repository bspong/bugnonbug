WebSENSE requires authentication through the web browser for Mac user since the user don't authenticate through Active Directory. Firefox intermittently prompt the user for credential but it seems to prompt every 3-8 time the browser is opened. This is not a form login prompt it is the actual Firefox login box that need to appear. This authentication need to happen every time Firefox opens. Unless this prompt appears user will only see "Connection wa reset" page.

The prompt for authentication appears 100% of the time in Safari

1. Turn on manual authentication in WebSENSE
2. Launch Firefox
3. "Connection wa Reset" page will appear
4. Close and reopen the application until the authentication prompt appears
5. Authenticate and browse the web
Actual Results:
No authenticaion prompt

Expected Results:
Authentication prompt would appear and user could authenticate

From WebSENSE KB about process to authenticate users.

# The browser creates an HTTP session and Websense software receives the request.

# Websense software sends an HTTP 401 request for authentication to the browser at the client machine.

# The user receives an authentication prompt. The prompt is browser-specific and is not generated by Websense. <--// This is the prompt that is only appearing intermittently.

# The user enters his or her network user name and password.

# Websense software receives confirmation from the directory server and add the user name and IP address to a table.

# The browser cache the user's credentials, and then creates an Internet session.
