The browser seems to randomly drop characters, resulting in page full of empty space.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060612 Firefox/1.5.0.4 Flock/0.7.0.17.1

Many, if not most of the website I visit--including this one--will not properly display upon my system. I entered the above URL because your embedded frame will not display anything. In fact, I don't even know if this bug is not already reported.

To reproduce this bug, use an intel-based Macintosh computer running the current OSX operating system, and install Fire Fox 1.5.0.4. Simply browse around. Many site will not display correctly. It seems that whatever is responsible for displaying character will allocate space for each character, then not draw in the required glyph. Links will still display their under-lines, but are other wise empty.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use an intel-based Macintosh running latest OSX.
2.Install latest FireFox.
3.Browse almost any site. (I used my personal blog at http://chibitoku.blogspot.com)

Actual Results:
Characters randomly drop out. Here is a photo: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/76228347@N00/168371823" > <img src="http://static.flickr.com/63/168371823_10700f9dcf_d.jpg"/></a>

Expected Results:
This is what the default browser on my system doe in the same place on the same page: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/76228347@N00/168373727" > <img src="http://static.flickr.com/46/168373727_c0d01db996_d.jpg"/></a>

I wa only using the default theme. Although I have the Wizz RSS reader installed in the version depicted, the bug show up in all Gecko-based browser on my system, including Flock and Camino.
