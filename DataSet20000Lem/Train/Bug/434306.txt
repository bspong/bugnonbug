IM NOT SAVY ENOUGH TO KNOW ALL THE LINGO SO HOW DO I REPORT A BUG IN THE SYSTEM IF I DONT KNOW HOW TO REPORT IT , I WOULDNT KNOW IF IT WAS A BUG OR IM DOING SOMETHING OR MY SYSTEM IS DOING IT ..KNOW WHAT I MEAN ?? I JUST RECENTLY STARTED LOOSING FIREFOX SHOWING AND ERROR MESSAGE AND IM NOT SHURE WERE TO LOOK IT UP TO COMMENT ON IT SO I THOUGHT TO GET SOME HELP HERE .ANY SUGGESTIONS ?? PLEASEEE!!!IM USING WIN2000 PRO LATEST FOX AND IM DOWNLOADING SOMETHING THROUGH QUICKTIME AND THEN IT SHOWS AN ERROR.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.OPEN FIREFOX
2.DOWNLOAD A QUICKTIME FILE
3.LISSEN TO IT AND THEN IT SHOWS THE ERROR MESSAGE
Actual Results:
NO SPECIAL STEPS I JUST WENT TO A SITE THAT I HAVE USED BEFORE AND IT SEEMS TO CRASH AT NO SPECIAL PLACE

Expected Results:
IT DID IT AGAIN BUT NOT IN THE SAME PLACE AS BEFORE .

I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE CHOICE TO SAVE THIS FILES BEFORE TO A CHOSEN PLACE NOW IT OPENS IN QUICKTIME AND PLAYS IT AUTOMATICALLY I HAVE NOT CHANGED ANY SETTINGS BUT NOW IT CAN ERROR AT CERTAIN TIMES .THE ONLY THING I CAN CHECK ,IF I CHECKED IT PROPERLY IS THE EVENT VIEWER SHOWING A Dhcp error which i searched on the site ,not exactly the same thing .but i tried it again to see if it show up again and it ha not .sorry for being vage it is probably not your bug but i thought to send the info anyway .ill keep trying to fix it somehow or ask other people ,it may be something very simple and it is not stopping me using Mozilla .
