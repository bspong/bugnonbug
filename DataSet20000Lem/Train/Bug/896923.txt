Firefox (18 or 22) refuse to store certificate for *.google.com
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

Try to go to ANY google page.



Actual results:

For the past 6 week or so, Firefox present repeates security warning for ALL Google pages. It tell me that google's security certificate is invalid because it is signed by google. When I try to download the google certificate, I am told it is valid. No permanent storage of a valid security certificate for either *.google.com or for accounts.google.com is possible, no matter what I do with Firefox's security certificate menu. That menu show certificate for mail.google.com and for www.google.com, but somehow these do NOT work for *.google.com nor for accounts.google.com. The net result is that Firefox make it EXTREMELY difficult to do normal work on the web, e.g., use my Gmail account, which prior to this worked FINE with Firefox, and which still work FINE with an older version of Firefox on an office computer, and also work FINE from a borrowed Mac with Safari.


Expected results:

Firefox's security certificate MUST be updated so a to allow proper, prompt access to *.google.com and to accounts.google.com. All google web page should be simple to access.
THANKS for your help!!
