Any JavaScript-actions are extremely CPU-hungry on Mac OS X

Let the "water" run about 10 second (until it run continuously). From then on my CPU (1,42 GHz) go up to 100 % and stay there until I close the page.

Here a little test of this site on different machine and systems:

iBook G4 1,42 GHz (MacOSX 10.4.8, Firefox 2.0): 100 % CPU
PowerMac G5 2,0 GHz (MacOSX 10.4.8, Firefox 2.0): 100 % CPU
PC 1,7 GHz (WinNT 5.1; Firefox 1,5, 2.0, 3.0a1): 10-20 % CPU
PC 1,8 GHz (WinNT 5.1; Firefox 2.0): 2-6 % CPU

Another Test: Go to the menu "About Mozilla Firefox" and click there "Credits". The running text there eats very much CPU but only on the Mac:

iBook G4 1,42 GHz (MacOSX 10.4.8, Firefox 2.0): 65-70 % CPU
PowerMac G5 2,0 GHz (MacOSX 10.4.8, Firefox 2.0): 40-50 % CPU
PC AMD Athlon 2.0 GHz (Linux, Firefox 2.0): 2 % CPU

So this is very much broken on the Mac. No wonder many action are incredibly slow. Gecko is fine and fast, but the whole browser experience on the Mac is very slow and CPU-hungry.

Reproducible: Always
