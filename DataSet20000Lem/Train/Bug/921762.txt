Collecting text and scroll data separately from history can lead to inconsistency
I just discovered this problem during normal browsing today. When we collect session history, we store data for iframes in a list of children. Then when we collect text-and-scroll data, we iterate over the list of iframes and assume that it match up with the list of child that we collected earlier.

However, in between collecting history and collecting text-and-scroll data, we return to the event loop, which allows code from the page to run. nytimes.com ha a habit of creating and destroying iframes constantly. If it change the set of iframes in between collecting history and collecting text-and-scroll data, then the history data that we collect won't match up with the text-and-scroll data.

I noticed this because the patch in bug 909048 cause this failure to be more verbose (i.e., there's a JS error). The current code manages to get away without throwing any errors, but it still return bad data. What do you guy think we should do here? I can think of three things:

1. Collect both kind of data atomically. I don't know how expensive it is to collect them, so I don't know how much it matters.

2. Try to detect when the set of frame ha changed, and recollect the data atomically in that case. I'm not sure how difficult the detection would be though.

3. Ignore the problem a we do now. I can make the patch in bug 909048 fail silently. This doesn't really appeal to me though.
