more than one 'Most Visisted' tab in toolbar when importing bookmarks.html created by autoExportHTML

I'm using user_pref("browser.places.importBookmarksHTML", true); and user_pref("browser.bookmarks.autoExportHTML", true); setting and these are set forcefully everytime on window logon to achieve something (Explained in http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=38&t=896955)

Problem:
First launch of firefox after upgrade is creating 'Most visited' tab in toolbar and only shutdown of firefox tho change are exported to bookmark.html. On next launch of Firefox it try to import bookmark from bookmarks.html (I'm setting import setting to true and deleting .json files) and it creating two tab of 'Most Visited'. I guess this places.sqlite which store bookmark is holding one default tab and the one in bookmarks.html is getting added to it.

I'm using logon script to delete json file and set import setting to true. Everytime a winodws logon is done and firefox is started one extra tab is getting added. Same is the case with "Recently Bookmarked" and "Recent Tags".

Please let me know if there is quick workaround for this problem. I planned to deploy firefox to few user in our organization tomorrow and then suddenly stuck up with this problem.

Thanks,
Prakash
