[toolbox] Implement Shorlander's visual design
Live mockup is located here: http://people.mozilla.com/~shorlander/files/devTools-toolbox-i02/devTools-toolbox-i02.html (enable the new flexbox model to see this mockup: layout.css.flexbox.enabled -> true)

We can divide this mockup in 3 sections:
1) toolbox toolbar/tabs
2) inspector
3) developer toolbar

The scope of this bug is only about the toolbars. Not the content of the tool (markup view and rule view in this mockup)

About 1),

The toolbox toolbar should not use common.css and have it own style. common.css is a stylesheet shared by all the tool to ensure they have a shared look (button, toolbars, search fields, …). The toolbox doesn't need it. Not using common.css will make our work easier (we can start working on 1), then work on 2)).

For 2),

This mockup us a "flat design". We need mockups for the other tool a well, because most of the work will happen on common.css and will affect all the tools.

For example: in the inspector, we see that the tool toolbar doesn't have any padding anymore. That mean that the button in the other tool (web console and debugger) won't have room around them. This won't be possible a they have border in the current implementation.

We need mockups for the other tools, or a design for all the in-tools control (textbox, searchbox, toolbarbutton, toolbarbutton with no text but only icon, dropdown menu, button + dropdown menu).

This also cover the sidebar.

For 3),

this can be done in parallel. It might have some impact on the Gcli (position of the panel).
