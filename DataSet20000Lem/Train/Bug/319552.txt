I use the URL history a a MRU bookmark list, but sometimes I want to be able to control what go in there and what get purged.

Here's an example:
I go to a fatwallet.com, click on the hot deal forum, then accidentally hit the Go button. The URL history think I put this URL in there when I didn't, so it save it. I never type this URL in again, but it leaf it there because I visited the URL multiple time by clicking on my fatwallet.com URL history item, then clicking on the hot deal forum link.

The only choice currently is to purge all my URL history and re-enter everything. Or convert those item to bookmark entry of course.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to a web site's root page
2.click on a forum area
3.click the go button
4.notice the forum area's URL is put in the URL history even though you didn't type it in
5.wait a few week (while still visiting site 1 and clicking through to the forum)
6.notice that the forum URL is still in the URL history

Actual Results:
- extra URL history entry are not purged a expected
- extra URL history entry are entered when you don't expect them to be


Expected Results:
- Go button store URL that you browsed to when it should really store URLs that you typed in
- extra URL history entry should be purged if you don't visit them directly (if you click through and visit the URL, the history should purge it because you didn't go to it from the menu)

I'd like the Bookmarks editor to be able to be used to edit the URL history so we have full manual control over it.
Add a content menu entry to the Go button to let u edit the URL history.
