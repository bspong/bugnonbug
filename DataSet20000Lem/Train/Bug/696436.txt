Rename MoCo-generated Aurora and Nightly Mac build to "FirefoxAurora.app" and "FirefoxNightly.app"

OS X ha the unfortunate limitation that you can only have 1 app named "Foo" in your Applications folder (since apps are really just directory named "Foo.app"). This mean if you already have a "Foo", then download some other "Foo" and try to put in in Applications, OS X asks you if you want to replace the existing Foo.

As it turn out, there is at least one other OS X app called "Aurora" -- http://www.metakine.com/products/aurora/, and thus conflict with our "Aurora" channel build of Firefox. If a user ha one and then go to install the other, confusion ensues. (You can of course have both around in different locations, but most user are likely to want their apps to live in the usual spot.)

So, we should resolve this conflict. The minimal change would probably be to just twiddle the bundle name to be unique so they can coexist. Product Marketing, specifically, would like to start using "Firefox Aurora". (See also, bug 659321, where this wa previously considered.)

This change should also be done for Nightly, since that sound just a likely to conflict with someone somewhere. The Beta channel is already just called "Firefox", so no need to change that.

There is no requirement to change the name of existing installs. (To be more specific, unless there's some technical requirement to do so, it's fine to only do this for new builds.)

One issue gavin already mentioned is that if a 3rd party build from our source right now, it default to the "Nightly" branding. We probably don't want such 3rd party build to prominently feature "Firefox Nightly". So we may need to do some cleverness to allow building a "Nightly" or "Firefox Nightly". Or we could get bug 682414 moving, and default 3rd party build to that...
