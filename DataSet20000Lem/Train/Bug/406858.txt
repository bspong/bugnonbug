Ever since I installed the latest update of firefox, my browser crash every time I use it. Sometimes it's after 1 minute of use, sometimes it's after 10 minute of use. It will just close no matter what I'm doing (it's closed when I wa typing in it and also when it wa just running and I wasn't doing anything with it). There are no warning sound or other alerts, it simply disappears. When I open it back up again, my session saver asks me to restore the crashed session but otherwise, there is no indication that something went wrong or is broken.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I open the browser and it will invariably crash some minute later.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Browser will crash (just disappear from sight and will not be in my list of opened window so I know it's crashed and will just reopen it, and it'll crash again after some minute - sometimes right away sometimes after a good 10-15 minutes)

Expected Results:
Stayed open...

I have the following installed:
Plugins: Move Media Player 1.0.0.07074039
Extensions: Forecastfox 0.9.6, Map+ 1.1.0, PDF Download 0.9.3.2, Tab Mix Plus 0.3.6, United States English Dictionary 2.0.0.6

I have always installed any update available for all my extension and have not changed any option on any of my extension since before this started happening. As far a I can tell, this started happening right after I installed the latest Firefox update when it asked me to update.
