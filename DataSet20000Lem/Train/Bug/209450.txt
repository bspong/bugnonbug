Flash plugin is not registered in Linux Firefox
Using Firebird 0.6 on Linux (RedHat 8, glibc 2.3.2) and Flash plugin 6,0,79,0
(of March 3, 2003) installed in ~/.phoenix/plugins/, about:plugins doe not show
that the plugin is being registered. This is confirmed by visiting Flash-based
sites, which either detect that the plugin is not available (the linked URL) or
pop up the null plugin dialog for type application/x-shockwave-flash
(http://www.homestarrunner.com/).

Using Mozilla nightly 2003031808 on the same host with the same plugin works.
Also note that the "click to display" Flash blocker from bug 94035 is not in use
in either browser.

Additional report from bug 187570 (flash plugin doesn't transfer from Mozilla
to Firebird installs, which appears to have been misread a "Flash doesn't work"):

hi,
same here..
i'm using phoenix-cvs (don't have mozilla installed)
(Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4a) Gecko/20030416 Phoenix/0.5+)
and phoenix can't see flash plugin either...

$ l /usr/lib/phoenix/plugins/
flashplayer.xpt javaplugin_oji.so libflashplayer.so libnullplugin.so

the plugin is in the plugins directory,
but about:plugins doesn't show it's installed.
(it can recognize java tho)

I have the same problem. I'm using

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030503 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

under gentoo linux 1.4-rc4 (obtained phoenix-cvs through portage.) I try to
install the flash plugin (libflashplayer.so) by putting it in
/usr/lib/phoenix/plugins/ (plugins is actually a linked directory that link to
/usr/lib/nsbrowser/plugins/ not that that make any difference.) I restart the
browser, and when i try to go to a site a popup tell me

This page contains information of a type (application/x-shockwave-flash) that
can only be viewed with the appropriate Plug-in.

I have successfully used the flash plugin in phoenix before, so i am not sure
why this is not working with this new version. So far, i have found no workaround.

Having similar difficulties. The plugin is symbolically linked in the firebird
plugins directory. When loading (or looking at about:plugins) the following
message appears...

LoadPlugin: failed to initialize shared library
/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so
[/usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so: undefined symbol: NPP_SetValue]
