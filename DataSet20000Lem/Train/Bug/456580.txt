I wa in my yahoo account when firefox3 browser wa being used. I wa sending a job resume to a perspective employer and when I went into my sent folder to review it, it showed my resume attached and about 6 (six) .jpg file (that I did not attach). When I viewed those .jpg file they appeared like firefox pic from the turorial or something. So, I closed the firefox3 browser, and open up IE browser and apologized to the employer and resent the resume the same a I had done with firefox browser. This time only my resume wa sent and no additional .jpg files.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Haven't tried to reproduce it with firefox browser since I wa sending it to an potential employer, but did resent with IE browser and it sent correctly and did not do the same thing a firefox browser.
2.
3.



Pretty self explanatory. When attaching a document, it should only attach what you select and not randomly select other things. I think this is very serious because you can't randomly be sending attachment to people that you don't know about. Could be a major privacy issue a well.
