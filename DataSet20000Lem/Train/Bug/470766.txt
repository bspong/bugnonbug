I will attach screen grab showing the Computerworld.com home page using FF2 and FF3.1 Beta 2. The same layout problem occur with FF 3.0.5, which is the new default for Fedora 10.

In the latter, it can be seen that what should be the left hand navigation column, becomes centered when JavaScript is enabled. When JS is disabled, the page layout generally appears to be correct.

This doe not happen with FF2 or with Seamonkey on the same machine. It also doe not happen on an iMac running FF3.

It wa not clear whether this is part of the image rendering problem referred to in the current Known Issues in the Release Notes, or is something completely different. I thought that it might be, if image did not scale correctly and resulted in page element being shifted a a result. Perhaps not.

However, clearly, something ha changed in FF3.x resulting in this page and some others not rendering correctly.
