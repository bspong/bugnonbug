This is duplicate of the problem I had with first release of Firefox 1.5. When logging onto certain website that require javascript password checking the website return the error

This problem wa previously fixed in Firefox update to 1.5 (I think it wa 1.5.2? by the time I wa able to use it). I just updated to 2.0.0.1 and am going to look for a copy of 1.5 to downgrade. The website in question is my personal bank.

My current work-around is to use Safari (Mac OSX proprietary browser).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. commercebank.com

Actual Results:
Site return message:
