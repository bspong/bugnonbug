TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_877447_skip_missing_ids.js | Should be back in the default state, despite unknown button ID in placements.

Looks the same on all OS X versions, not happening anywhere besides OS X.

Note that there are other test that verify that thing are in the default state, and they succeeded. I don't know why these are failing, but not the other ones. Perhaps other test (or these tests?) call reset() and that eliminates the cause of the issue here.

Matt, wa there anything tricky about this merge?
