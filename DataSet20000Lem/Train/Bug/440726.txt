Crash after unlocking system

I left a Firefox window open on my office computer overnight. When I came back in the morning, unlocked my computer, and tried to check my Gmail, it crashed. I think it crashed after I typed "gmail" and when I hit Ctrl + Alt + Enter (to complete the .com URI and launch in another tab), but it MAY have crashed before then. about:crashes is blank, so this wa not caught by the crash handler.

When I restarted Firefox, it detected that it had crashed, and successfully recovered my tabs.


Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
??? Sorry! No idea how to reproduce.



I did transcribe the following information from the Windows crash report:

appver: 1.9.0.3071 ModName: mozcrt19.dll
ModVer: 8.0.0.0 Offset: 00006c6c

I'm using the default theme, and the following extension are installed:

All-in-One Gestures
DownThemAll!
Favicon Picker 2
Firebug
Google Gears
Greasemonkey
Live HTTP Headers
Nuke Anything Enhanced
Web Developer

It occurs to me that I installed All-in-One Gestures despite that it isn't specifically compatible with FF3 yet, so this crash may have resulted from it presence, though I wasn't doing anything that involved it functionality when Firefox crashed. If, from the information above, you can tell that it doe result from this out-of-date extension, feel free to remove this bug report.
