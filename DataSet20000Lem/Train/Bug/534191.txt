I am not a teckie.
Using window xp pro 64 bit
with intel pentium(R) 4 cpu

Google set a home page.

Usually at wakeup but mostly on initial bootup when clicking on a Firefox icon (no browser open yet) the timer (hourglass) will indicate that it is opening and then it doesn't. The timer just go away. Opening Task Manager indicates that the process is not running. Several clicks, same results. Then after 30-45 seconds, clicking several time (in frustration) waiting 10-15 second or so, three or four browser window will open in sequence (according to how many time I clicked the icon).
Once the first window opens, Firefox is quick to open (1-2 seconds)
I suspect that this may not be a Firefox problem but one of my system a the other desktop icon sometimes respond (or fail to) the same way, i.e., clicking on an icon produce the hourglass for 5 to 10 second (up to 30 seconds) and then just go away.
Rebooting sometimes but not always solves the problem.
