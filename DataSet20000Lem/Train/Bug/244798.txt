User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040515 Firefox/0.8.0+

Internal Firefox drop down box (not HTML based ones) that are currently opened
do not display correctly when the "Show Desktop" shortcut (WINDOWS + D) is used
to minimize and then re-maximize a window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the arrow on the right of the URL bar to open up the list of
recently visited website (this will actually work any time an internal drop
down box of this sort is open).
2. Use the Show Desktop shortcut key (WINDOWS + D) to minimize all windows, then
press WINDOWS + D again to re-maximize all windows.
Actual Results:
The drop down box ha turned completely gray. This will only go away if the same
or any other drop down box is opened, or if firefox is closed. The box will stay
in the same place on the screen even if the window is minimized.

Expected Results:
The drop down box should close itself (as it doe when firefox is minimized
normally).
