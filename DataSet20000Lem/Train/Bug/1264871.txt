Firefox hang after a day - with high cpu (kernel time), maybe related to VM or RDP

Steps to reproduce:

I'm running Firefox 45.0.2 with admin right on Windows Server 2003 SP2 x86 in a VM, accessed by RDP.
I have hundred of open Tabs, many of them since years. Since they are loaded on demand, that's normally not a problem.
Firefox is running all the time, at night the VM itself is suspended.


Actual results:

Since a year or so, over all Firefox version since then, after running about a day or two, Firefox start to hang for some second and reacts to mouse click very delayed. The hanging time get longer over time and after some more hour it doesn't come back at all. If I exit Firefox before it completely hangs, the session is correctly saved and restored, so I can continue where I was.
I tried many things, like closing Tabs, to see if one of them cause it, but when it started to hang, it never became better again.
The maybe interesting thing is what I see in the Sysinternals process explorer CPU graph: one of my 4 core is completely loaded (25%) during the hangs, but in red, which mean kernel time, I think - but I have no idea what this tell us. During the hangs, there is no I/O. See screenshot.
When I watch it longer, I sometimes notice that the hang are exactly for 45 second and then Firefox continues to process my click for 1-2 seconds. Then the next 45 second start - maybe some timeout? But it's not always like that, it can be shorter or longer.

How can I find out more, without throwing away all my Tabs and History? I found some plugins showing memory per Tab, but they didn't help.

Could it be related to suspending the VM at night? I am not sure if it ever happened on the same day after a restart.


Expected results:

Firefox should not hang at all, of course :) Multiple core should be used correctly and a restart should never be necessary to make Firefox be faster or use le memory.
