use this url, scroll down quite a bit, the top portion of the page is now (temporarily) empty, find a movie that "needs a plugin" to view, this is a walkthough of an apartment i am trying to sell

this is a yahoo-generated site

when i view in mozilla i see this need for a plugin, when i view in Internet Explorer, the file is viewed, (rather boring and jerky photography) (IE did ask me to permit activeX controls, with due warnings)

yahoo telephone tech support replicated the problem on their 'lab machine', no view in mozilla, yes view in IE

in mozilla, when i do follow the prompts, for plugin download, nothing is found, but then some medium player, which requires a manual install, i get to window medium viewer, which sends me all over the net but never let me view the file, anyway, i end up in window medium viewer online store being urged to buy URGE, which urgent urgement i successfully resist

i am an old geezer who wa a mainframe programmer, back when writing wa done with stick on wet clay, and a PC-DOS programmer, which mean that I am too old to understand this stuff, and need a ten year old kid with ten year java applet experience, but the nearest ten year old kid is asleep or in school or lost in play station

thanks
martin

ps, i even tried to covert from avi to mpg, since yahoo tech support said that mozilla should be able to play mpg files....and managed to destroy all my movies, go figure, including a backup copy preserved in case the conversion failed

i had to replay in real player to restore settings, i think real player restores setting

i prefer sharp stick on wet clay, but then, did i ever tell you about punch cards...., well, kids, it wa a loooong time ago, before global warming.....

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. delete the file from the web page
2. reload (re-upload)
3. see the 'needs plug-in' message
4. follow the 'download plugin into the desert
5. view successfully in IE
Actual Results:
see Repro, above

Expected Results:
expect (hope) to view movie in mozilla

i now do not expect to view movie of avi form in mozilla, but it is sooooooo much better than IE, up until yesterday

software should have
(i) not asked for a plug in
(ii) produced a plugin if it had to ask for one
(iii) plated the movie first time out
