View e.g. page http://gamblincolors.com/newsletters/newsletter12.html

- Renders fine in browser.
- Html is fine (no spurious <div>, <table>, ...)
- anything print-related show a bug shifting the content
after page 3 to the right out of the visible area.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. view specified page
2. set medium size to A4
(probably necessary to force the page boundary to
catch the picture "just right", if I guess correctly
* please check this *
setting medium size to letter or legal seems to just
catch other picture at page break time for me;
still triggering the error, though not necessarily
between page 3/4.)
3. either print this page
or print to file and ghostview the result
or print-preview

Actual Results:
page output is shifted to right a constant offset
per page after the bug is being triggered.

Media setting is A4, with default borders.

Pages 1,2: ok
Page 3: <2 image side by side>
top of the left image is shown, cut off
Page 4: everything shifted 1+ inch to the right,
top contains both pictures, with the top
of the left one "blanked"
Page 5: shifted 2+ inches, though no more picture
across page boundary

Expected Results:
printed without the text/pictures being shifted-to-right out
of visible page.

optional: it shouldn't have printed partial picture at all, but
moved them to the next page (splitting only make sense,
if picture size is a significant fraction of page size)

really optional:
would be nice, if a mode <try to avoid truncating/shrinking
but use a new page instead for the whole picture> would be
available in the options.

possibly 294591 is a dupe of this one
(but I couldn't locate it example and verify this).


The output for legal wa interesting:

page 1 end with a paragraph between 2 pictures.
This paragraph and both picture are "cut" correctly
between the pages, without triggering the shift.
(images part of <p>)

page 2 end with a cut image without text by it side
(actually: <div><img1><img2></div>), where img1 is
cut a per the bug above, with the remnant on page 3).
And page 3 display the first shift-to-right.


another tidbit:

all the text is in cascaded <div> paragraphs,
so divs with <p>embedded text</p> seem to be save,
even if containing pictures.

The trigger I suspect <div><img1><img2></div>,
center the picture in both print and
browser window.

At page break time, it center ONLY img1 and just
display the top of it (INSTEAD of centering
both image and displaying their topmost portions).

The next page (and all following, regardless of
pictures) are shifted.

I aligned the next page below, assuming both
image would have been centered, and it looked
ok.
