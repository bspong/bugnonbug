A couple of update ago Once I logged in, till I "Tossed my cookies" I remained logged in, also www.rvforum.net, facebook, http;//community.compuserve.com/diabetes (And several other forums) even http://mail.yahoo.com would remember fo for anywhere from 2 week to forever.

Now I have to log in every time.. Firefox remembers the log in ok in password manager, but it's not retaining the cooky session to session.

It only retains cooky for a long a I have the browser open

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into any of the site above (Being sure to check "Remember me" if offered)
2.Close the browser
3.Re-lanch firefox and return to the site


Actual Results:
It will ask for your log in EVERY time

Expected Results:
Yahoo Mail should ask you to log in only once every 2 week or till you toss your cookies. It should not ask for log in EVERY TIME you re-start the browser

Other site I listed never ask for log in le I toss cookies.. Till now

It should have loaded the cooky from the last session and remembered it wa logged into the site
