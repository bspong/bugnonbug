Errors while printing

This bug only occurs from time to time, not always. It seems it is more likely
to occur when Firebird is stressed and is printing out a lot of page
simultaneously.

I get the problem in Firebird 0.6.1 when I close the window of the page that is
being printed. The window should of course not be closable while processing the
page for print; the progress-dialog should be modal.

Also, printing shouldn't start before the processing is finished, so that
[Cancel] actually stop the whole printing job, and not just the remaining
unprinted pages.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several large (long) webpages.
2. Start printing them simultaneously. (Press CTRL + Page Down and CTRL + P)
3. Close some of the page before the progress-dialog is finished.

Actual Results:
Some of the page were not fully printed, but stopped with the error-message:

ERROR: syntax error
OFFENDING COMMAND: --nostringval--

Expected Results:
Firebird should have printed all the page fully, and not started the print
before the print-process wa finished. It should not be possible to close
window that are being processed for printing.
