Please go through this script I wrote using LDTP to automate the test cases.

from ldtp import *
from ldtputils import *
import time
try:
x = execfile('launch_firefox.py')

except LdtpExecutionError:
log('Unable to launch firefox', 'error')
log('Firefox Test Report', 'end')
sys.exit(0)

waittillguiexist('*-Minefield')
try:
selectmenuitem('*-Minefield','mnuFile;mnuNewWindow')
time.sleep(5)
except LdtpExecutionError:
log('Oops! Unable to launch a new window', 'error')

try:
selectmenuitem('*-Minefield','mnuFile;mnuCloseWindow')
time.sleep(5)
except LdtpExecutionError:
log('Unable to close the firefox window', 'error')
try:
selectmenuitem('*-Minefield','mnuFile;mnuNewTab')
time.sleep(5)
except LdtpExecutionError:
log('Unable to open up a new tab in the firefox window', 'error')
try:
selectmenuitem('*-Minefield', 'mnuFile;mnuCloseTab')

except LdtpExecutionError:
log('Some error occured when closing a tab', 'error')
try:
selectmenuitem('*-Minefield', 'mnuFile;mnuOpenFile')
except LdtpExecutionError:
log('Unable to open up the dialog to select a new file to be opened', 'error')

Well for the above

selectmenuitem('*-Minefield', 'mnuFile;mnuCloseTab')

This doe not work, ideally this should close the open tabs.

selectmenuitem('*-Minefield','mnuFile;mnuCloseWindow')

Again, the above doesn't work ideally this should close a new window of firefox.

selectmenuitem('*-Minefield','mnuFile;mnuClose')

But, however, if the above is included in the script, it just close the all existing firefox windows.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just run python file.py
2.
3.

Actual Results:
It should launch firefox.
A new firefox window should be opened up.
It should close the second window.
And open a new tab in the first FF window.

The close window and close tab are not working.

Expected Results:
It should launch firefox.
A new firefox window should be opened up.
It should close the second window.
And open a new tab in the first FF window.

The close window and close tab are not working.
