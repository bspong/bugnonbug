Steps to reproduce:

Please note: this happens on every page. It is not limited to a few websites. This error didn't happen in the previous two versions, but I believe this bug ha occured once before in version five or six. These error seem to occur straight after the update and continue until a new release is made. Therefore, in my opinion I believe this is a Firefox bug and not an issue on my side.

In short: After the 9.0 Firefox update - Firefox automatically selected and highlighted text on it own. Please refer to the image for an example.




Actual results:

I will use Google Reader a an example.
I wa checking my feed on Google Reader and a I scroll down the page, Firefox automatically selects and highlight text. Further - another example is I might be writing a blog on wonderhowto.com and I a I'm typing Firefox for some odd reason highlight itself and then a I press the next key-stroke I lose what ever work I've written that wa highlighted.


Expected results:

Firefox shouldn't have automatically highlighted text.
