Out of control pop-up browser since downloading latest version of Firefox.

Since I downloaded the latest version of Firefox I have been experiencing continuous pop-up browser of various websites, most of them dating site or porn. They are not the standard pop-up window but an entire new browser opening. I checked my option and Firefox is supposed to stop any pop-up window but it isn't stopping these. I have also checked my Norton and it is all working fine and not recognizing a problem. The only thing I have changed is the new version of Firefox. How can I make these browser stop (sometimes there are several at a time and the just keep coming!) or go to a previous version of the program. I have tried eliminating cookies, clearing cache, dumping history and everything else I could think of. As my kid occasionally use my computer it would be best if porn didn't pop-up to them from Facebook. Thank you for checking into this for me.
