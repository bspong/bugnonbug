When resizeing a weblogic developed page with a sitescape frame you loose all of
it content. Sitescape support say it is a browser issue. It work in IE. It
is also a problem is Mozilla 1.7 and Netscape 7.2 and on Linux, Windows and Mac.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://test.ptagis.org/ptagis/
2.Click "DATA" (Top frame)
3.Click "Sites" (Top frame 2nd row)
4.Click "Separation" button (left frame)
5.Click any entry in the "Seperation" window
6.Click "Site Events" button
7.Resize window.

Actual Results:
You loose all the content of the page after the resize.

Expected Results:
The resized page should have the same content, but resized.

When you resize the page and loose it content, if you then go to any URL (just
go to any bookmark) then hit the back button, the page is back and working
correctly. At this point you can resize it all you want and it works.

I also had my browser working with it resizeing correctly (I had several
extension - QuickNote, OpenBook, googlebar,ImageZoom). I disabled them all and
the resize problem appeared. I re-enabled them and is still did not fix the
problem. There is some combination which fix it but I cannot figure out what
it is. I saved the prefs.js file when it worked and when it stopped working and
they are both the same so it is not part of the prefs.js...
