after long usage (4-8 hours) speed of rendering animated element slows down to almost freezing

After a few hour of using mozilla firefox, the speed of rendering animated
element (animated gifs, progress bar in firefox and even thunderbird [they
use the same engine?]) becomes very slow. LOTS slower than normal. You can
also see that the animation is not smooth. A few frame would slow down, the
following frame would go with 10x speed. Restart of the application doe not
help, only restart of the whole PC. I'd suppose it's some sort of memory leak,
but unfortunately I can't prove it by looking in the code.

For instance, a an example, the url loading progress bar's movement would be
very distorted after a while, or Thunderbird's notification of incoming mail
would also slow down to taking 50 second tho show up and disappear with
distorted motion.

I tried this on a totally clean PC, with freshly installed XP, so that I'm
sure no software can affect that.

PC itself is a dual-core amd 3800+ with 1.5G ram. I've seen it happening on
other machine a well, actually, same behavior occurs on my laptop, on some
machine of my colleague at work and so on, so the problem is indeed not only
limited to my PC.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up mozilla
2. Browse here and there for a couple of hour (or just use the same mozilla
session for a few days)
3. Open up some page with animated gif in it, and look at the motion

Actual Results:
The gif's motion would be distorted.

Expected Results:
The gif's motion should be smooth.
