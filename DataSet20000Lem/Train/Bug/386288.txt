I just downloaded 2.0....well, the new one, since my "About Firefox" option is greyed out. Downloaded today, anyway. I had been using 1.5.0.1.

It seems to run a "normal" for 5-10 minutes, and then everything happens at once. I wa watching some video and downloading something the first time, but stopped doing both and they're still happening.

Here's a list of the problems:
1. Drop down menu don't work.
2. Right-clicking seems to be entirely disabled.
3. It overlap everything, in a "stay on top" kind of way. As in: I have to move the window to access my dock, and even to access anything from the dropdown Finder menu on Firefox itself. Even my minimized stay-on-top iTunes window is under it.
4. Wow, this one just happened. I moved the window up to check on something under it, and the top of the window is actually going over the Finder bar. I can't move it back down.
5. I can't minimize the window at all. The button's just gone.

I don't know if I just hit something buggy or what...but at this point, I'd rather just download the older version I wa using. Is that possible anywhere? This version is horrible...also, please bear in mind part of this form may be incorrect because my drop down menu aren't working. Severity is NOT normal, this is horrible, my whole browser is broken and I can't get the old one back!
