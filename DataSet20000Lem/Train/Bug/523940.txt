Browser hang when "auto load images" disabled and user hit Ctrl+S while visiting url:
http://www.pornbb.org/tunn-r-com-2009-full-sets-collection-t2136507-30.html

A single CPU core hit 100% and the modal file save dialog cannot be interacted with, thereby preventing interaction with the browser.

Also, when frozen, the memory use fluctuated between 200MB and 270MB at very regular interval (~10 sec). looked like a cardiogram on the memory meter.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable all browser extension and restart. (ensures extension not at fault)
2. Disable "Auto load images" in the Options... dialog "Tools-> Options... -> Content tab"
3. Visit the URL listed above.
4. Press Ctrl+S a if to save the HTML page to a local file.


Actual Results:
Browser becomes unresponsive (hangs) with a single CPU core at 100%

Expected Results:
Browser becomes unresponsive (hangs) with a single CPU core at 100%
