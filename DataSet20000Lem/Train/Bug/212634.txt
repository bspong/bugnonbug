Inspiration: I wa hoping to have a button that I could click to do the
equivalent of View / Increase Text Size.

Suggestion: be able to add a toolbar button for any/most menu picks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on toolbar.
2. Select Customize...
3. Review button on palette.

Actual Results:
Various button are available, eg one to correspond to Edit / Cut etc.

Expected Results:
Various button are available, including one to correspond to most/all menu
picks, including, for example, View / Increase Text Size, or Help / Release Notes.

This could almost certainly be done nicely enough a an extension.

If a menu pick is currently grayed out, a corresponding toolbar button will need
to also be grayed out.

To minimize the graphic work needed to implement this, all the button could be
the exact same design. Basically, if someone want to put any of these button
on their toolbar, they need to either use just a handful at most, and rely on
tooltips when they're wondering which is which, or switch text label on. If a
skin designer ha more time, then perhaps there could be multiple button
designs. For example, have an underlined capital V and underlined capital I on
the button corresponding to View / Increase Text Size. Or perhaps "Ctl +". And
so on for other menu picks.
