Duplicate index in nsFaviconService and nsAnnotationService

nsFaviconService and nsAnnotationService create table on the fly, but they have duplicated indexes.

example in nsFaviconService:

CREATE TABLE moz_favicons (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, url LONGVARCHAR UNIQUE, data BLOB, mime_type VARCHAR(32), expiration LONG)

then it creates an index with:

CREATE INDEX moz_favicons_url ON moz_favicons (url)

That index is a duplicate, there is already a UNIQUE index on url, if you open places.sqlite with sqlite explorer you can clearly see that are present 2 indexes:

moz_favicons_url, not unique, url
sqlite_autoindex_moz_favicons_1, unique, url

Having 2 index could slow down INSERTs because they have to be updated both, and can also slowdown SELECTs because the db engine ha to benchmark and choose between the 2 indexes.

Similar problem in nsAnnotationService on table moz_anno_attributes

I attach patch to remove create index, but this is a schema change, so probably something other need to be done if approved.

Forgive me if this is expected behaviour
