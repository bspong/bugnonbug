window focus launch url command line
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. open up firefox and open some windows.
2. minimize all open window
3. open up a linux shell terminal
4. type "firefox google.com"
5. a window is restored and the site http://google.com is loaded in a new tab. The active window doe not have focus. the window doe not obtain focus when you click on the search box, the titlebar of the window, or anywhere else on the window iteself. you can place a cursor in the search box, however, when you start typing, all the keystroke are sent to the last window (the terminal window). this same behaviour happens when any other application launch any web page in firefox. it is extremely dangerous. many time i click on link within thunderbird, and start typing into a text box on a web page, and then e-mail from my previous thunderbird window start getting moved, deleted, changed, etc. I can't even imagine what other dangerous problem could happen with this behaviour when other application launch a web page within firefox. the only way to gain focus of the window is to click on the taskbar. this same problem doe not occur with seamonkey.
