I'm surprised I couldn't find another bug for this (appoligies of I missed it).
I see no reason that we can move regular bookmark around but not live
bookmarks. Specifically:

1) Live bookmark cannot be drag and dropped to new locations/folders a
bookmark can in the "Bookmarks" dropdown menu.
2) Likewise, live bookmark cannot be moved in the "Manage Bookmarks" interface.

I see absolutely no reason for this. I have a custom folder for RSS feed in my
bookmark tab. Unfortunately since many web page require that I add the feed
manually via New Live Bookmark (paste URL), I have no way of adding the live
bookmark to my special RSS folder. I have to manually edit the bookmarks.html
file in my profile to relocate it. I should mention that manually cut and
pasting the location of the live bookmark in the html file work PERFECTLY well,
so I see zero reason it can't be done right in the interface like other bookmarks.
