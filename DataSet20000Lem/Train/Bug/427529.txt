I have two Firefox window open (one in my main desktop and one in another desktop). I use the browser in my "primary" desktop 99.999% of the time.

I work with an online tool that monitor a list of tasks. When I click one of the task link it open a new browser window (not a tab). Below is an example of one of these links:

javascript:open_window('http://mytool.example.com/?task=2871')

This new window ha a link inside of it that open a new tab. This link inside the new window is not a Javascript link (instead it's just a normal link). However, when I click this link, the new page is loaded inside of my *secondary* browser window (located on my secondary desktop), a opposed to the primary main browser window.

This wa not the behavior found in Firefox v2. It doesn't make much sense to have this "new" tab open in a browser window that hasn't been used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have two browser open in Linux on seperate desktop
2. Click a Javascript link that open a new window, such a javascript:open_window('http://mytool.example.com/?task=2871')
3. Click a link inside of that new window that result in opening a new tab.
Actual Results:
The new tab open in an "inactive" browser window, a opposed to the one which originally wa used to open the Javascript link.

Expected Results:
Firefox should open the tab in the "active" browser window (i.e., the one that wa originally used to open the Javascript link)

The "new page should be opened in: a new tab" setting is selected.
