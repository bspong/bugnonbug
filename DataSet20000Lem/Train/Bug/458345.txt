flash object from the top of a long page are redisplayed further down the page, covering other content

Sometimes, on long page containing several embedded YouTube objects, the object not only appear in their proper place on the page but are also repeated elsewhere on the same page where they clearly do not belong. I first noticed this on some Salon.com page (with Firefox 2.0.0.16 or possibly earlier). This time I can provide an easier to access example:

The Think Progress article http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/02/vice-presidential-debate-live-blogging/
contains six flash objects, all in the top fifth of the page (the article proper) and all displayed normally. The article is followed by many (currently 523) comments. Starting in the vicinity of comment 434 and 435 (currently about 4/5 of the way down the page), the same object recur in the same order covering and obscuring the text of the comments.

Reminiscent of bug 373016 which report (also on long page with flash objects)
"rectangular blocks" (rather than additional copy of the objects) "covering part of page". That's Mac, though, and this is PC.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://thinkprogress.org/2008/10/02/vice-presidential-debate-live-blogging/
and note the five Flash object and one Flash JavaScript near the beginning of the page.

2. Scroll down the page to the vicinity of Comments 434 and 435. Note the first Flash object redisplayed over the text of the comments. Between there and Comment 480, note the other Flash object redisplayed in their original order.

The position of the redisplayed object doe not seem to depend on the total length of the page. As the number of comment grew from 523 to 526, the repeat occurred in exactly the same positions.
Actual Results:
Same object repeated in same places. The page now ha 527 comment total.

Expected Results:
Should have displayed each object only once, near the top of the page where the HTML actually call for it.
