I have this code: "<object type="application/x-mplayer2" classid="6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6" allowScriptAccess="never" allowNetworking="internal" height="100" width="425">

</object><noembed><bgsound src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2006/12/25/554468/She%20Swallowed%20It.mp3" loop="1"></noembed>" minus the "" on myspace page. However when I go to the url all i hear is a beep and nothing else. My music doe not play in the background or doe it show the player. It doesn't even tell me if I need additional plugins, all though I should because I have Quicktime Alternative, Windows Media Player, and Real, just too name the popular one. When I open my IE browser(and I dislike very much to use IE) everything is fine. So I could use a little help. PLEASE. Thank you. Corey
