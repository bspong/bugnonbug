Explicitly stated protocol is ignored
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0

Steps to reproduce:

I have a web server on my local network. It us different protocol (http and https) on different ports: http://server:5222 and https://server:4444

Create a new profile and visit the first url. Then try to open second url.


Actual results:

It is not possible to visit the second url because firefox ignores the HTTPS but force HTTP instead. (Same problem, vice versa, happens when first opening second url.)

This problem wa discussed already but it seems it wa never reported here:

Expected results:

1) If a complete url including protocol is entered firefox should open this address without modifying it.

2) If firefox store the protocol for an address it must store server name AND port.

So, by explicitly typing "http://server:5222" and "https://server:4444" both site should be opened. Afterwards typing "server:5222" should open "http://server:5222". Typing "server:4444" should open "https://server:4444".
