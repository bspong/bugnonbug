Visiting http://clearleft.com/ cause Firefox to hard freeze with a SPOD.
Trackback doesn't launch. Crash reporter also freeze and doesn't report. The app must be force-quit. Also happens in Camino 1.5 (though I managed to get Trackback to sent a report there, once). Doesn't happen in Safari 2.0.4, Opera 9.2.1, Omniweb 5.1.3, iCab 3.0.3 (iCab even smiles).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://clearleft.com/
Actual Results:
Browser freezes, then some thread crashes. Somehow freeze crash reporter (?). No Talkback. From comparison with working browsers, there are four box of information at the lower right in two rows. Firefox show them in a column (two of them a far a I could see) a if the browser window were resized too narrow. Seems never to get to the next layout step of moving them to the 2x2 grid.

Expected Results:
Page should display.

In lieu of that, after crash, Talkback should open. Apple's Crash Reporter should give me the whole crash to "Report".
