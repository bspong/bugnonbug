Please bear with me on this, it's a little difficult to explain.

I am using FF version 1.0.7 because 1.5 doe not work for me, install is fine and the browser executes without a problem, but no connection to a website is ever made. No errors, just no connections. But that's a different issue.

I found something interesting in the eBay source code that I thought might allow me to include a greeting to a viewing member of an online auction. I don't think it work anyway, but that's beside the point. In the process, I stumbled upon something.

As strange a it sounds, it only appears to be reproducable whilst submitting an auction to eBay, obviously using a live account, therefore such is a prerequisite in any testing you might carry out. It doe not work by simply creating a local HTML file.

I honestly don't understand how or why this problem occurs, but what I do know is that it is indeed a problem and potentially exploitable. There must be something in the javascript file on the eBay site that's causing it, but I have no idea what or where that would be.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. For those with an eBay account and can submit a live auction...
2. Proceed to create an auction (no need to actually submit it).
3. In the item description, input the following (remove the comments)...

<!--script src="http://include.ebaystatic.com/js/e449/uk/ebaybase_e4492uk.js">
</script>
<script>
ebay.oDocument._getControl("greetings")._exec(

"writePersonalHeader",
"Sign in",
"",
"register",
"",
"Sign out",
"",

'Hello! ##1## or ##2##.',
'Hello, ##1##!',
'Hello, ##2##!',
'Hello eBay Guest!',

1,null);
</script-->

4. Preview the description

You should now see "Hello [username]!" This is normal, thing are working a they should.

5. Now try this...

<!--script src="http://include.ebaystatic.com/js/e449/uk/ebaybase_e4492uk.js">
</script>
<script>
ebay.oDocument._getControl("greetings")._exec(

"writePersonalHeader",
"Sign in",
"register",
"Sign out",

'Hello! ##1## or ##2##.',
'Hello, ##1##!',
'Hello, ##2##!',
'Hello eBay Guest!',

1,null);
</script-->

6. Preview the description once again.
7. I expect the browser is now unresponsive.

Note that the "", bit have been taken out of the second example. I thought they were irrelevant, but I guess not. One or more of them are the cause.
Actual Results:
Browser hangs, forced to end the process when task manager finally shows.

Expected Results:
Browser should execute the script without or without error, but certainly not causing the hang that I witness.

Not repoducable at all in IE, it doesn't even accept the script.
