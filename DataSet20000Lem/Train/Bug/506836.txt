Browser window resizes when clicking between tab and toolbar or bookmark bar

With the browser window sized to maximum, if you click and slightly pull down (mousedown and move a hair, a with unsteady hands) between a tab and the bookmark toolbar, the browser window will resize.

Don't click on a bookmark or bookmark folder, and it's not on the tab itself, it's right between them.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open browser window to maximum
2. mouse over a bookmark or folder in the bookmark toolbar to see where the boundary is
3. click and hold (mousedown) just below the bookmark edge
4. move the cursor slightly
Actual Results:
Browser window resizes to approx 1/2 of the screen size.

Expected Results:
Nothing should happen, least of all the browser window resizing.

- Problem first occurred for me with the 3.5 beta.
- Will NOT repro if the window is anything other than maximum size (on Mac, Window > Zoom)
- Problem will repro if one tab or many are open
- Problem repros in safe mode
- Problem repros with add-on disabled
- Standard application install, no chrome changes, no UI tweak
- Does not matter what URL or content is in the browser
