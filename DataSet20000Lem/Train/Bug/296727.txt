Since install, certain feature on web page were not displaying in Firefox,
mostly image and graphics. These graphic seem to be tied to Java scripts. My
mouse cursor would change to the little hand when placed over these "void" or
empty area on the page and thing would happen when I clicked on these "void"
areas. I could get MS IE to work just fine on the site so I thought there is
something amiss with Firefox. Just today, I figured it out. I went to
www.barnesandnoble.com to find their store near me but could not find the tool
on their site to put in my zip code. I remembered a problem with IE about image
loading in the browser originating from site other than the site actually
visited. So in Firefox, I went to Tools > Options > Web Features and with "Load
Images" checked, I unchecked "for the originating web site only". Everything on
the Barnes and Nobles site work fine now - other sites, too. The thing is,
that discomfiting function, "for the originating web site only", wa checked
upon installation; it wa that way when I installed Firefox. I hope this helps.
