In one tab I loaded some page and noticed that the activity indicator of the
tab (not the common one in the menu bar, but the on in the tab "ear") wa still
spinning.
I loaded another (simple) page and the indicator just kept on spinning.
No matter what I loaded (successfuly) , the indicator doe not stop.
I load page in other tab and there is not problem, just the first tab
indicator is always spinning.

Also there problem with the URL bar of the problematic tab :
- doe not expnad URL: I enter "foo", it load "http://foo", but keep
displaying "foo"
- no matter what page I visit, the favicon of the first page is always displayed
- sometimes, if I look at another tab and then go back to the first, the
favicon of the other page is still displayed
- if I open a HTTPS page in another tab and go look at the first, the URL bar
keep the yellow backround, even if the page is plain HTTP

(first tab=the problematic tab, with the spinning indicator)

I am not sure how to reproduce. Maybe a site that load slowly or time out
trigger it.
