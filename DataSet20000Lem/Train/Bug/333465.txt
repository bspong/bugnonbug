I'm on Mandriva 2006.0 community. I installed FF 1.5.0.1 from the official binary package (tarred, not rpm) since my distro come with FF 1.0.7 in the stable branch.
On my linux box I have the habit to use 2 user accounts, one for web activity (surfing web , mail, watching streaming video, etc.), and one for when using apps (writing my thesis, doing system maintenace, etc.). That is the way I keep my apps le exposed to security risk coming from the web.
That can be debatable, however I feel the need to have the same bookmark in these 2 accounts, so to share my bookmark I've do the following:
0) Let me call my user 'web' and 'apps', they belongs to the 'myusers' group.
1) I have made a new folder /home/bookmarks and pasted there my bookmarks.html.
2) I've assigned read/write user/group permission for /home/bookmarks and /home/bookmarks/bookmarks.html so they are like this:
/home/bookmarks web.myusers 770
/home/bookmarks/bookmarks.html web.myusers 660
3)In both firefox user profile I've setup through about:config the string browser.bookmarks.file pointing at that folder/file

Doing so I can read my bookmark from both users.
The problem arises when I add or modify a bookmark: every time firefox writes on bookmarks.html, it change the owner/group of bookmarks.html to the user writing on it. For example, if I'm logged a 'web' and I add a new bookmark, firefox change thing so they look like this:
/home/bookmarks web.myusers 770
/home/bookmarks/bookmarks.html web.web 660 (/home/bookmarks/bookmarks.html apps.apps 660 if I'm logged a apps).
At this point of course user 'apps' (web) is cutted out from bookmarks.
Trying to manage the problem, a a first (stupid) workaround i've made a script that control and change (if needed) the owner/group of bookmarks.html, runned every hour by cron. But after a bit I found that, under particular circumstance (I think this is related to bug 251692 and 273088), the bookmark file can be rewrited by FF with an empty file.
Actually I've removed the group write permission on the shared bookmark file to avoid data loss, and I can live with the problem of a partially bookmark share, however I think FF should let me share my bookmark if I instructed it to do so. Why keep changing that file owner, since it isn't in the profile folder, it is in a shared folder?
Now, I eared that FF 2.0 will use sqlite for bookmarks: please don't let FF 2.0 be too egoist on the sqlite bookmark file a FF 1.5.0.1 is with bookmarks.html.
I think we also need managing concurrency on sqlite file (using a lockfile?)
