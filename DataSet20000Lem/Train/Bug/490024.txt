When using a wysiwyg online text editor, graphic or link dropped into editor create a relative link even when full web address is given.

I am a sysad for compuhigh.com an online highschool.
We use a wysiwyg text editor for communication between student and teachers.
Teachers will sometimes drag linked text to another lesson or a graphic into the text box.
Here is an example. When we link to a lesson a href "http://compuhigh.net/directory" from a text box created in a web page located in compuhigh.net/directory Firefox change take out the compuhigh.net/directory and replaces it with a relative link.
This creates a problem. When the final post is read by the student, it is in a different directory, and the relative link doe not work. Web designer know when they can use relative link and when they can't. Having Firefox interpret what the designer want limit it flexibility. Since the form in question is in a password protected site, I can't give you access to see it. The problem is a new one for Firefox, and is not present in Explorer.
