I use Firefox really alot and after upgrading to 2.0.0.12 I have had to experience several "freezes" or "hangs" per day with Firefox by opening certain sites. Freeze is not accurate to describe the problem because the site where the problem occurs do eventually load. After the really long loadtime, refreshing the site work well. But I believe there is a some sort of bug in CSS parsing or in the loading of the webpage because for example, the Apple Store Iphone page take several minute to load. And this example page is not the only one. It seems that site where there is alot of advertisement or javascripts reproduce this problem also. Sometimes I even get the dialog for stopping or continuing the execution of some Javascript file.

I really hope this bug could be fixed because I don't want to go back to IE or Opera. Both browser open the "problematic" site really fast. This long loading appears only on Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clean out browser cache and cooky
2. Go to http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/wa/RSLID?nnmm=browse&mco=3587D031&node=home/shop_iphone/family/iphone
3. Begin the wait...
Actual Results:
Firefox loaded the page in 2,5 minutes.

Expected Results:
I would hope the browser would load the page in several seconds.

I have been able to reproduce this bug with 2.0.0.12 and also 3.0b5.
