Bad live bookmark cause Firefox content / memory usage to grow endlessly until OOM and crash

My Firefox (1.0.7) started having problem exactly like what is described at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Memory_Leak: "Memory usage will be seen to increase dramatically even though Firefox use itself is dormant or static".

I found that this happened because one of my live bookmark had gone bad. URL http://goldenspud.com/webrog/feed/ start a a correct XML feed, but soon start repeating a warning message indefinitely. Firefox doesn't notice this and load hundred of meg of the error message, and eventually crashes.

When Firefox load a live bookmark, it should check that the XML file doe not contain error like this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Bookmarks->Manage Bookmarks
2. Select File->New Live Bookmark
3. Type feed location: http://goldenspud.com/webrog/feed/ (This is the feed that is not working now, on 27 Oct 2005)
4. Click OK. Open process pane in Windows task manager and follow Firefoxes memory usage.
5. Continue browsing, the problem shuld appear almost immediately.

Actual Results:
Firefox memory consumption start increasing rapidly, even when you do nothing (probably depends on speed of your internet connection). Firefox crash at random (usually when you close it).


Expected Results:
Firefox should give an error message about incorrect feed and should not crash or leak memory.
