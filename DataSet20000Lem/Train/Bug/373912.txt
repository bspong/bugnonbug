While upgrading update-manager firefox crashed. Firefox' bug reporting tool immediately sprang into action but I suspect this is an update-manager bug though I am going to submit a bug to firefox a well.

The circumstance were: Noticed update-manager icon in 'notification area' -> clicked on icon to start update process. Update-manager had one update; itself. Update-manager runs, window focus changed back to firefox from update-manager -> update-manager force focus back to itself -> high cpu load, update-manager us significant processor cycles, so much so that X cannot redraw update-manager's window -> update-manager finishes, update-manager window destroyed, firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click update-manager icon when present in Ubuntu's notification area
2. Run update manager, change window focus to firefox
3. change window focus back to update-manager, firefox crash after update-manager finish
Actual Results:
seg fault, core dump

Expected Results:
continued running a normal
