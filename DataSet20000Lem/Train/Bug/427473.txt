font reset to default on dual-boot machine (both Firefox and Thunderbird)

I am running an Ubuntu 7.10/Windows XP Professional dual boot machine with shared profile for Firefox and Thunderbird. I changed the font in Linux to match the default in Windows. However, any time I use the Windows system, when I boot back up in Ubuntu the font have been reset to the Linux default instead of keeping the user settings. I assume this is because the program read the setting a the default in Windows and assumes it is set for default fonts. If I change to some other font or boot back up in Linux without using Firefox/Thunderbird in Windows the font stay a they were set.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Boot in Linux.
2.Start Firefox (or Thunderbird) and set font to Windows default (Serif=Tahoma, Sans Serif=Arial, Monospace=Courier New)
3.Reboot in Windows and open Firefox (or Thunderbird)
4.Reboot in Linux
Actual Results:
The font have reset to Linux default (Sans Serif/Serif and 16 point).


Expected Results:
It should have kept the actual font rather than assuming this wa set to the default. Actually, I really wonder why 16 point is default in Linux to start with, but that's not really a bug.

Both operating system are using Firefox 2.0.0.13 and Thunderbird 2.0.0.12. Other than this problem, the shared profile work great.
