Google and Firefox Start not correct language (Catalan, Dutch, French, multi-lingual countries)

Google and Firefox Start are not in Catalan by default in country with a local
version of Google (.es, .fr, .it, etc.)

It work in other country where there is not a Google local version, and you
get the Catalan version after Google get the language from the browser language
header.
Most Catalan user would also prefer not using a local version of Google, just
google.com, that's the reason that
http://lxr.mozilla.org/l10n-aviarybranch/source/browser/locales/ca-AD/searchplugins/google.src
is google.com.
In next versions, we may add 'hl=ca' tag to Google search and this would repair
that Google would be in Catalan but it would not be google.com and Start Firefox
Page would continue appearing in the default language of the local version of
Google.

The problem in google search is client=firefox-a tag. It trigger the search
into the local version of google with the default language in that domain.
