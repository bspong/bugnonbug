I just cannot find this in database so I'll report a new one. Basically when you open link in new tab (by ctrl clicking or using the right click menu) sometimes the overall firefox window title (which should reflect the title of the webpage in the tab you are currently viewing) remains the same (uses the title tag from the webpage you opened the tab from). So when you go to the newely opened tab (let's say result from google) you will still see the title of parent (in this case google search page). It is fairly hard to get the title right - sometimes closing the original tab works, sometimes you have to open a new tab. What's even more frustrating, the finder (ctrl+f) remains focused on the parent page and find result from there and not the tab you are currently watching.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
since this happens on an irregular base it is hard to reproduce. for example: right now i have seven tab open - 1 wikipedia, 1 google, 2 search result (achieved by ctrl clicking), 1 more google and 2 firefox bug tabs. the search result tab currently cannot show their own title when i click on them (they show Enter A Bug) and they also cannot be searched. at the same time, i opened another browser and tried to achieve the same effect but had no luck
Actual Results:
wrong title and no seacrh-box focus

Expected Results:
right title and focus on the current tab
