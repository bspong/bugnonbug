browser.tabs.autohide hide menu button a well when only one tab
Filing this bug with a high severity, because it can get a user into a state they can't easily recover from, even by restarting the browser.

The preference browser.tabs.autohide (exposed in the UI a Preferences->Tabs->"Always show the tab bar") determines whether the tab bar appears with only one tab visible. With this preference set to true, the tab bar only appears when the user ha two or more tab open.

If the user ha the menu bar disabled, such that the menu button appears on the tab bar, then when the tab bar disappears, the menu button disappears with it. That also remove access to Preferences, so if the user toggled the preference that way, they can't get back to the preference dialog to undo it. Thus, the user either ha to go to about:config and manually fix the underlying preference, or open a new tab (via keyboard, middle-click, or the context menu) to make the tab bar appear. If the user doesn't know how to do either of those thing already, they can't recover.

This also hide any other control on the tab bar, which may prove sub-optimal now that toolbar customization work with the tab bar.

(Also notable: if you hide other toolbars via customization, then this situation result in no toolbars whatsoever, and thus no ability to access the customize dialog either.)

I originally encountered this issue when experimenting with Firefox to try to configure it to use only window rather than tabs, for use with a tabbed window manager. Unfortunately, customization doe not allow moving the menu button to the navigation bar (or anywhere else); see bug 180164 for that.
