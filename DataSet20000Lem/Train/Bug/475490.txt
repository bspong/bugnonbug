XUL dialog very slow with 3.1 and 3.2, but fast with earlier version

On testing my extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2318) with 3.1b2 and the latest 3.2 I found the option dialog to be unusable (8 sec to load compared with <1 sec on 3.05 and excrutiatingly slow to use. So I created a stripped down extension to narrow this down to the .xul, then created the smallest .xul that still showed sign of the problem (test31.xpi).

I suspect it is the nested tabs, each with a reasonable number of component on each tab, that is causing the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install test31.xpi or totalvalidator.xpi on Firefox 3.1b2
2. Open the option dialog in Tools->Add-ons menu
3. Try to use it and click on Cancel to close
Actual Results:
Dialog open with noticable delay, is slow to respond to mouse clicks, and slow to respond when click Cancel to close. CPU use go up noticably when using the dialog.

Expected Results:
Install on 3.05 (or earlier) and dialog opens, responds, and close very quickly with normal CPU usage.

If you can't see a noticable delay using test31.xpi (your PC may be too quick), try replacing options.xul with http://www.totalvalidator.com/downloads/options.xul which ha the full .xul from TotalValidator
