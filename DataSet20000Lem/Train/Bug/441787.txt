Firefox fails to load all of the graphic content, then fails to load whole page on 'reload'
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

This happens very often and is very annoying. When page loads, there is everything except images. When You try to reload page it usually fails completely - but then, the whole site is not accessable, and not only the page. Restarting Firefox doesn't solve the problem. What is more strange - this issue seems to come and go a it pleases. After some time page might be accessable again, but problem still occurs (if You try to browse the site it usually lock again).

This happens for me on http://www.spaceweather.com for example.

I had a Firefox 2.0.14 and when I made a rollback it work fine.

P.S. I'm posting it a a bug, since it seems to affect just me.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just loaded the page through bookmark.
2. Click reload button.
Actual Results:
Images fail to load. Firefox wait for them forever. After hitting reload button page fails to load completely.

Expected Results:
Just load the damn page.
