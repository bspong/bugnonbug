The "print selection only" check box is placed on the "options" tab of the print dialog tab set. It should be present on the "general" tab of the tab set because "print selection only" is the most commonly selected option (i.e., select a second of a large page, print the selection) and additionally ha much in common with the "print page range" option that already appear on the general tab of the print dialog. I.e, "print selection only" ha much more in common with "print pages" in that it is a specification to print a specific "range" of a particular page, and therefore should be present on the "general" tab, not hidden away in an "options" tab where it is a pain to utilize when desired.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open print dialog
2. Notice that no ability to choose "print selection only" appears in the default tab "general" that open first.
3.


Expected Results:
The "print selection only" checkbox should be present on the "general" tab just below the "print pages" range selection options.
