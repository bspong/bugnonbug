Element Properties -> Image Properties should include file type

The Image Properties Window doe not tell what type of image it is. This can be
a problem when checking the image on bugzilla.

For example:
Go to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=124232&action=view
Right click on the image and select properties.
Using the property window, there is no valid way to determine what type of
image it is (aka gif, png, bmp, etc...) You will notice the location field ha
the value "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=124232&action=view"
Because of this, you cannot determine the type from the URL of the image.

Thus, for case like this, either an "Image Type:" or a "Type:" or a "File Type"
field would be useful to indicate what type of image it is.

----------------------
Here's one suggested layout of where to place the new field:

Location:
Width:
Height:
Size of File:
File Type:
Alternatate text:

---------------------
A suggested formatting of the "File Type" value could be a follows (note it is
similar to the Size of File field).

EXTENSION (Description)
GIF (Graphics Interlaced Format)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
BMP (Bitmap)
JPG,JPEG (Joint Photographic ? Group?)

Hope I got them right :)
