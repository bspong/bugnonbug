Changing character encoding generates firefox menu artifact until click event

Screenshot of the menu artifact

On Windows XP using the latest nightly trunk (2007070604), I get an artifact on the menu when I change the character encoding. The artifact appears to be the "raised button" graphic when you mouseOver a top-level menu choice (see screenshot). This only happens if I click an option in the View>Character Encoding>Auto Detect menu. Also, the artifact only disappears if I click the mouse somewhere on the screen. If I hover the mouse over the other top-level menu item without clicking, the raised button will be moved to that menu choice but remain there until clicked.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Minefield
2. Click View > Character Encoding > Auto Detect
3. Select any of the options, I used Chinese

Actual Results:
The raised button look for the view menu stay until I click somewhere else. If I move the mouse over the other menu option without clicking, the raised button look will follow and stay.

Expected Results:
The normal menu look should return after the click event triggered by my menu choice.

Reproducible:
Always. This appears to be a Windows only bug.
