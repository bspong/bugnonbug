This is an online classroom used by increasing number of school with the number of student easily within ten of thousands. When the specific thread are accessed perhaps only for new one created the title bar within the body of the page display but doe not respond.

When Firefox is closed the process remains running and disallows new browser to be opened until it is closed through non graphical OS interface means.
