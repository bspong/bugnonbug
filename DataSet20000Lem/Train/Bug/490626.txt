Searching http://www.play.com/ for any product, cause Firefox 3.0.10 to crash. Operating system concerned ha been recently upgraded from Windows XP service pack 2 to XP service pack 3. Using Firefox 2.0.20 under XP service pack 2, did not cause the browser to crash. This maybe related to the version of Java installed - at the moment this Standard Edition 6 (version 1.6.0, build 1.6.0_03b05), which ha not changed since the upgrade to XP service pack 3.
