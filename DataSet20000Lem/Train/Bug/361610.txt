The title say it all but I have a workaround for this one. I have an ASUS K8N-DL motherboard which support dual processor with dual cores. There is a feature in the boot rom called Memory Hole Remapping. I've had a lot of trouble with this feature. It come defaulted on but the system is generally le stable with it on. No application I'm aware of doe what firefox doe though. With Memory Hole Remapping switched on (default) firefox infinite loops. The loop is so tight I can't even kill it with the task manager. I have to reboot and shutting down take forever. I now have a good reason to leave it off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.switch on memory hole remapping feature in the boot rom
2.let the system boot up. launch firefix. I had Yahoo calendar a the default site.
3.observe super tight loop. One of my processsors competely tied up.

Actual Results:
The loop is so tight I can't even kill it with the task manager.

Expected Results:
normal display of site with no hour glass.

normal display of site with no hour glass. Default theme. Switch the feature off and bug go away every time.
