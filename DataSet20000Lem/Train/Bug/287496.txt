In any page, if you are running FireFox in Linux without a window manager,
drop-down style SELECT/OPTION box do not drop down. You can select the box
and use the up/down arrow key to toggle options, but clicking on the dropdown
button will not drop down the menu. In KDE/Gnome/TWM/etc. it work correctly,
but running without a WM (this is for Kiosk systems) cause the problem to
occur. SELECT/OPTION box with a height of more than one row (i.e. list
boxes, not drop-down boxes) will display properly.
