Password prompt appearing frequently

I have just loaded 1.0PR after running .9.3. I am now prompted repeatedly for my
userid and password authenticating me on our proxy server. I wa prompted 3
time loading the forum page.

I normally don't allow my password to be saved to prevent other user in my
office from using my account but in desperation I tried saving my password. Made
no difference.

Proxy server is a Microsoft ISA server.

My operating system is winXP sp1.

I have uninstalled 1.oPR and gone back to 0.9.3. Problem doe not occur.

I posted this on the forum and there several other user connecting to
Microsoft Proxy server who are experiencing the same problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. enter a URL for a site such a http://forums.mozillazine.org/
2. When userid password dialog appears enter detail and submit
3.

Actual Results:
The password dialog reappears after part of the page is loaded, submit, more of
the page loads, password dialog re-appears. Going to the above URL the password
dialog appeared 3 times. If you cancel dialog it only re-appears again

Expected Results:
It should have only prompted for userID and password once for the browser session

From the forum it seems that the problem is probably related to connecting to
Microsoft ISA server. I do not run the Microsoft Proxy agent. The member
experiencing the problem are not all running on XP a I am - one wa running on
window 2000
