Summary: New 3.6 issue - Product problem

Comments:
Your latest issue of your Firefox browser 3.6 ha some serious problems.

When trying to access various site to log-in, such a AT&T email,
Gmail, Facebook, MySpace, etc., the browser rest to a blank log-in window.

When attempting to make change on a site, such a updating information,
etc., the browser reset everything back to the original information, or
go to a blank window.

There is no longer any "Properties" selection on the File menu. This
selection is also missing when 'right clicking' on any object to check
the properties.

We have tried several themes, including your default and all of these
same problem occur regardless.

These issue must be corrected a soon a possible or we will be forced
to uninstall Firefox from all of our systems.

Thank you.

We reverted back to the previous issue of Firefox - 3.5, and the problem have gone away.

We conclude that all of these problem are a a result of change made in your 3.6 version.
