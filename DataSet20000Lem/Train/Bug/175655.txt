cases, the url appears a a new separator at the bottom of the list, just above
the separator over 'Open in tabs'. It cannot be selected. The bookmark doe
display correctly in the bookmark management window. If the bookmark wa
created by dragging it onto the bookmark toolbar, it will display in the

in the toolbar. Dragging more url cause more separator to appear. These
bookmark display correctly after Phoenix is restarted.
