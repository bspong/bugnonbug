Page layout issue caused by extension installation
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

This is really bizarre. I wa testing some extension when I noticed the
Firefox extension list page were not formatting correctly,
https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/showlist.php?application=firefox&category=Download%20Tools
for example. The obvious problem were overlapping text and missing rating
star and thumbnails. I've spent several hour attempting to narrow this down
but it doesn't seem to be tied to any specific extension. These are the one
I've messed with:
Download Manager Tweak 0.6.3
FlashGot 0.5.9.7
Sage 1.3.5
Tabbrowser Preferences 1.2.7.1
Forecastfox 0.8.1.1
Adblock v.5 d1 * nightly 39

Sometimes removing an extension fix the problem, sometimes not (even with the
same version). The page is viewable if I change the page style to "No Style"
from Cavendish. I've tried to recreate the problem predictably on three other
system with random results. All system can develop the problem but the
extension that cause it is not always the same one nor doe it appear to be a
combination of extensions. In addition to the main XP SP2 PC which wa 1.0.4
upgraded to 1.0.6 (as per the Build ID above), the other system are:
Mandriva 2005LE: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6)
Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.5
Ubuntu 5.04: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050524
Firefox/1.0.4 (Ubuntu package 1.0.2 MFSA2005-44) (config version changed to
enable access to extension site)
Windows XP SP2: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.10)
Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I wa able to correct the problem on the Linux PCs by wiping out the profile
data except for bookmark and profile folder, thus removing all extensions.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 1.0.6
2. Install some extension
3. Check extension download list page to verify layout

Actual Results:
Overlapping text and missing graphics.

Expected Results:
No change in rendering a compared to default install.

Theme doesn't seem to affect it. I normally use Microfirefox but the other PCs
with the default theme have the same problem. Systems were using 1024x768 and
1280x1024 with both the default window size, maximized, and full screen.
