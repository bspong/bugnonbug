When entering DOM fullscreen, toolbars are still visible if browser.fullscreen.autohide is false
STR:

1. Go to about:config and disable browser.fullscreen.autohide
2. Go to https://www.humblebundle.com/
3. Load up any game
4. When it's ready and playing, click it fullscreen button

Results: the toolbars at the top are visible, even though they're completely inaccessible (or should be) while in DOM fullscreen (please correct me if I'm using the terminology wrong) like this. Another example is any YouTube video in fullscreen, you can't access the toolbars by moving the mouse up when the preference is enabled, so the toolbars shouldn't be visible either when the preference is disabled.

This preference should really only be followed when in browser fullscreen mode, where the toolbars are still accessible but hidden away at the top until you move the mouse there. In DOM fullscreen mode, like in a game or video or anything else, the chrome should always be hidden, regardless of that preference.

I'm opening this a UNCONFIRMED because I don't know if this is actually not intended behavior, I would appreciate it if someone could confirm this.

(BTW I've only tested this on Windows, so I assume Linux will behave the same. Mac OS X browser fullscreen mode is a little different, a the toolbars never hide at all, so I'm not sure of what the behavior there should be, but I'm happy to test once someone confirms this is actually a bug.)
