The tab list get funked up after scrolling (see below for more info). I think this bug might have been introduced in v3.6, a I never saw it before the upgrade. Sorry if this is a dupe - I couldn't find anything when I searched for "tab list".


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox (optionally in Safe Mode).

2. Hold Ctrl+T until enough tab open that the tab list will scroll.
(You should be on the last tab.)

3. Click on the tab list button.

4. Press UP (on keyboard) once to scroll to the last tab on the tab list. (You don't have to press Enter.)

5. Press ESC to exit the tab list.

6. Press Ctrl+PgDn - this should move you back to the first tab.

7. Right click the first tab -> Select "Close Other Tabs".


* The tab list should now be funked up. (On my computer it is 100% reproducible.)

* Restart Firefox to get the tab list back to normal. (I didn't find another way to do this without a restart, but I didn't spend a lot of time searching.)

Actual Results:
The first few tab seem to show up a blank entry at the end of the list (instead of non-blank entry at the top); the blank entry don't respond to mouse clicks.


Expected Results:
Obviously the tab list should list all tab and not show blank entries.
