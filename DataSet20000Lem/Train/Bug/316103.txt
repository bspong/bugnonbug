If you create separator's between each of your bookmark and drag a bookmark in front of the first bookmark, the bookmark jump to the right most position on the bookmark toolbar. Also, if you create 2 separator's right next to eachother, and try to drag a bookmark inbetween these separator's, the same thing happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Example A:

1.Create several bookmark
2.Insert separator's inbetween each of your bookmark
3.Try to move a bookmark in front of all your bookmark

Example B:

1.Create several bookmark
2.Create 2 separator's right next to eachother somewhere between these bookmark
3.Try to drag a bookmark inbetween these separator's
Actual Results:
Bookmarks move to the right most position on the bookmark toolbar.

Expected Results:
Bookmark should move the the position you dragged it to.

While you can work around this bug, it can be quite annoying when managing your bookmarks. It's just a little annoyance that should be fixed.
