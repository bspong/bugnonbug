I use the USAA banking website and have never had a problem till recently. Now only that one single bookmark keep breaking and becomes un-deletable. I followed the instruction given in another thread to remove all bookmarks. I did this and rebuilt all my bookmark from scratch just to have it happen again. I tried to empty the folder these dead bookmark were located in yet they will not move. I can select it and select the delete option over and over yet nothing happens. I can from within the Organize Bookmarks option type a new Name, Location, and Tags for the broken bookmark but I still won't be able to delete it. As I write this the broken bookmark ha taken the bug image and location of this page but retains the USAA/Welcome to USAA bookmark name even though I have not bookmarked this page. If I create another instance of this page a a new bookmark it will function properly until I close FireFox. Once I reopen FireFox the new instance of the USAA link will be broken a will the old instance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the USAA webpage (https://www.usaa.com/inet/ent_logon/Logon).
2. Bookmark the page.
3. Close FireFox.
4. Open FireFox.

Obviously I can not predict if this will happen on another system.
Actual Results:
As outlined in the Summary the new instance of the USAA bookmark will be broken and un-deletable.

Expected Results:
As with all other bookmark it should not break and should be deletable if so desired.

Other then this issue I have greatly enjoyed FireFox. This is my first actual solid issue with a bug concerning FireFox.
