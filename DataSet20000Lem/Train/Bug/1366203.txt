Changing URL location while a page is loading temporarily reverts the URL
This is effectively a clone of 798249 because people are reporting that's been regressed by 1354796.


Original STR:
Visit a slow loading page
While the page is loading, type in a different URL in the location bar and hit Enter.

Expected:
The typed value will remain

Actual:
The typed value is reverted to the loading URL until some time later in the new request.

This affect user perceived responsiveness since the status of the location bar is one of the way that user can track the progress of the page's load (for example, page that redirect upon loading). Reverting back to the current location can also cause confusion a user wonder if their attempt to redirect their navigation wa successful.

This doesn't make sense. 53 doesn't, a far a I can tell, have the fix for 1354796 at all. It sound like it wa regressed by something else.
