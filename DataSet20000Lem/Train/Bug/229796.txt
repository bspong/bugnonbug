An added preference dialog box that address cosmetic and option such a the
autofill, pop-up blocker etc.
An option dialog box that address the fundamental way in which the browser
behaves such a the download manager, security and plugins etc.

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:
A preference box with a greater degree of option (such a file type and other
cosmetic from about:config etc.) that rival I.E's preferences. (if you like, a
bit like tweak UI)
An options, or advanced, dialog which let the user change option such a the
way download manager/tabs etc. work. Ideally the advanced dialog is a one stop
set-up that can be reviewed by the user periodically.

The seperation prevents user error that will negativly affect their experience
using Firebird (if they change option by mistake) and ease clearing up of the
crowded option box.
It also add to the feel that the browser is an integrated component, making IE
more redundant to the end user (in order to expand firebird's acceptance a an
alternative)
