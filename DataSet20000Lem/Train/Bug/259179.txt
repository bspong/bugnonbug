"Web Features" configuration is currently spread out amoung the "Web Features"
section and the "Advanced" section under the preference dialog. By definition I
dont believe that firefox should (by default) have any advanced configuration
section (extensions might allow advanced config). I suggest simplifying the UI
and unifying the two section under the "web features" section.

I propose the following structure which slightly regroups the setting so that
they may be located intuitively. The UI change i propose would work best if
implemented in the same way a the current "Privacy" section in the preference
dialog. I have attached a rough mockup for illustrative purpose but nothing
in the right order or anything. Here is my suggested ne "Web Features" Section:

+ Accessibility
[x] Move system caret with focus/selection change
[x] Use find a you type

+ Images
[x] Load Images
[x] for originating website only [Exceptions button]
[x] resize large image to fit in the browser window

+ Java / JavaScript
[x] Enable Java
[x] Enable JavaScript

+ Popup Windows
[x] Block popup window [Exceptions]

+ Security and Certificates
[x] Use SSL 2.0
[x] Use SSL 3.0
[x] Use TLS 2.0
[x] Ask which certificate to present [manage certificates]

+ Scrolling
[x] Use Auto Scrolling
[x] Use smooth Scrolling

+ Software Installation and update
[x] Allow web site to install software [Exceptions]
[x] Periodically check for update to:
[x] Firefox
[x] My Installed Extensions and Themes

+ Tabs
[x] Hide tab bar when only one tab is open
[x] Load new tab in background
[x] Warn when closing multiple tab
[x] Force new tab when link specifies new window

Obviously any of these feautes that have changed since my last nightly should be
updated. Additionally if you think that this is too complicated then remove
some of the menu items. This is not an all or nothing bug. Even a general move
to the concept will be appreciated. Discussion welcome
