I am using the google personalized a my home page. When i try to open a new tab (right click on link and click on open a new tab) the browser freezes. When i try to open the page under the current window the browser doe not seem to freeze a often but doe at times. The specific link on www.digg.com that i'm trying to open at the moment is the following (http://digg.com/world_news/Venezuelan_troops_use_tear_gas_on_Chavez_protesters_but_CNN_ignores_why)


I have seen the same problem with other link on digg a well. I'm unsure if i have seen this problem in opening tab from other site but i'm not able to reproduce this at the moment. I'm also using version 2.0.0.9 and have seen this problem with earlier version a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla with google IG a home page.
2. Add Digg 'window' to show link which are popular on digg.com
3. Try to open a new tab with one of the linked page
Actual Results:
Expected page to open a new tab. Found that browser freezes. In some case when i open the link in the current window it work at other time it doe not but at this time i'm not able to reproduce the browser freezing when opening page in current window. Because of this i feel this may not be due to tabbed browsing but i'm not sure.

Expected Results:
It should not have frozen and should have just failed to open the page.
