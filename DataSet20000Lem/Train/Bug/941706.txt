[Australis] Alternative to Chevron: make second row of item
Once there are too many item on the nav toolbar, by some measure, they get put into a "Chevron", a dropdown. This mean they are not just practically invisible to the end user.

This is a usability problem. Assume that the user ha intentionally installed certain extension some time ago. Further, assume that she is not very computer proficient, she doesn't know what a "URL" is (she enters "Facebook" in google, a many many user do), and generally just manages to get by with all these computer things. She like Facebook and her music, and she ha a little extension for playing music and alerting new mail.

Now, suddenly, it's all done! She doesn't know what happened, it wa there yesterday, and how it's gone. She's calling me, a friend of hers, for help. I of course have problem to diagnose what's going on, not seeing her screen, knowing what happened, and she's not expressing herself very well, she say thing like "that thing here" over the phone.

Sorry for the long, colorful story, but I try to illustrate which kind of user we have, and how they'll react to thing being put in the Chevron: Panic.

Please don't assume that people will read and understand the interactive tutorial. I think it's a great idea, but it's basically defeat. UI should be obvious without teaching. While it will probably teach many, and that's good, there are good chance that the teaching is lost of >50% of the userbase.

As company, we've had user calling our hotline, because they had used the Firefox customization or menu item to remove thing (themselves!) and forgot that and now called the hotline because the extension 'didn't work', 'nothing is there'. Real stories. We had to put extra code in to undo such hiding on re-install, so that naive user have an obvious recurse. If you have these kind of tech support calls, it's not hard to envision what will happen once the "Chevron" solution is rolled out to end users.

Competition: Please note that Google Chrome is no measure, because 1) this isn't the same userbase and 2) Firefox ha a lot more extensions, they are lot more powerful, and a lot lot lot more popular. Many of our user *depend* on extensions, and don't want to live without them.

Importance: In fact, I'd argue that extension are one of the primary reason why people stick with Firefox instead of Google Chrome. So, it's critically important for the survival of Firefox to get this right.


The main problem is:
* The user is surprised
It's important that the user is not surprised, that it's always clear to him/her what happens. And that he ha the choice. Neither is currently the case with the Chevron.

----------

Solution:
If the toolbar overflows, i.e. ha too many item and we're running out of window width, then
* make a second row of items, underneath the urlbar.
* Add an button "^" (or "-") which hide the toolbar and show the Chevron instead.
Ideally, there is an animation that let the button go into the Chevron,
so the user can see what happened.
* The Chevron ha an "v" or "+" item to reverse that action

Advantages:
* Keeps current system where all item are always visible.
* Gives more space for customization
* Still allows to save screen space, in an obvious and discoverable way
* Once the user ha clicked the "^" button and saw the animation, he know where stuff
is and will not be surprised about their lack.
* User ha the choice whether he want to see the item and sacrifice the screen space,
or whether he want to hide them.

Implementation:
I can volunteer to implement this myself, if given approval.
