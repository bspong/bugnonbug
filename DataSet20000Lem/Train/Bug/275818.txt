Printing generally ok, except right click on mouse doesn't include print option.
The particular problem happened with attempting to print out a table of
transaction for my checking account. Printer outpu consisted of 3 pages, none
of which wa what I asked for, and it went into a permanent printing mode, not
stopping until I gave the stop printing instruction. Then, computer said major
error. I had to pull the plug to get the computer to turn off. Other page on
that website printed ok. Today, I tried it again, and it wa better, not perfect.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log onto Citibank's Direct Access program. Requires password.
2. Go to accounts, call for a particular account; in my case, checking.
3. Give print instruction (file, print).

Actual Results:
Described in details, above. Today, it actually printed, went to very bottom of
the first page of what should be a two page printout (0.25 inch from bottom,
only top half of last ine printed). Second page not printed at all. Went back
to Internet Explorer, which worked fine, a usual.

Expected Results:
Software should have printed out the full two page display.

Sorry, I didn't copy the crash display, and it didn't crash today. I've just
had Firefox for a few days. Still haven't tried to print a picture.
