Whenever I try to guess my matches, I click on the correct one and then this overlay appears saying "Loading..." and it doe not go away.

Also, when I view the match I have already made:
http://www.myyearbook.com/apps/match/my

And try to go to the next page to view older ones, it doe not switch pages.

Here is the code that is supposed to switch pages:

<div class="matchListPages">
<a href="#page.1" class="matchPage currentPage">1</a>
<a href="#page.2" class="matchPage">2</a>

<a href="#page.3" class="matchPage">3</a>
<a href="#page.4" class="matchPage">4</a>
<a href="#page.5" class="matchPage">5</a>
<a href="#page.next" class="matchPage">></a>
</div>

Here is a picture of trying to switch pages:

Please note, it work on every other browser except FireFox (yes, I even tried the latest version 3.1b2pre)

If you need and more code/screens from the page, just ask.

Thanks, Derek
