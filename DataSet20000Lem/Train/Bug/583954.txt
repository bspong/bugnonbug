Just trying to sign in, click an item, refresh the page, click to go to next page etc, anything cause a small box to appear, Alert: The URL is not valid and cannot be loaded. The link is the same a the page I am on or trying to go to and will open the right page but also another page(s) with the Alert box. I have to close each Alert box before I can close the error page: with the tab stating [xpconnect wrapped ILitmusff]. Sometimes on other site I might have a many a 12 of these Alerts, the average is 3-4. It started with the prior upgrade of Firefox and is worse on this version, 3.5.11.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. signing in, or just going to the website
2. refreshing page
3. clicking on any link on the page
Actual Results:
It happens on more than just ebay, don't remember the other websites, but happens daily.

Expected Results:
It doesn't ever stop until I give up and leave the website(s).

I shouldn't have had the errors! It is very frustrating to try and just go to a website and read or click on a link and have the error
