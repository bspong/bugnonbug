Bug 148418 wa filed against the "Mozilla" browser, and fixed apparently
(according to that Bug, and my own quick test).

However, that bug still affect Phoenix.

To summarize (and plagiarize):

When I make a link using file:///// to a file on our network:

<A HREF="file://///server/directory/file.doc">MyFile</A> it behaves differently
depending upon if I middle-click the link verse if I left-click or right-click
and select "Open in new tab" or "Open in new window". The middle mouse button
work correctly (opens the file in a new tab). All other method of clicking the
link do nothing (no error message, no action).

[As I've been reading today, the file-links-don't-work-from-http-pages behavior
is known and can be controlled with the preference security.checkloaduri. See
Bug 841128, among others.]

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.



Expected Results:
When security.checkloaduri is set to true, this middle-click should do the same
thing a a regular left-click. [Track Bug 84128 again, 'cause the user are
clamoring for different behavior than the current
cryptic-message-in-the-Javascript-Console-that-the-user-probably-won't-see-anyway
action.]
