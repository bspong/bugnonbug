when typing a search in the address bar, and you enter the side search window
open and your previous window is still open and dominates the view, no way to
enlarge new window! is this a feature or a glitch? not sure a it never happened
in previous versions, and it is a bit of a hassle to do search and get new
window to finally enlarge after you have done something on it and entered on the
small side window then finally you will get the old window to change to the new
one! Note this happens every time I use my bookmark and go to new site, and
could not see this in the list of bugs...thanks sincerly jazziemam beta testing

view, so there! always happens each time
