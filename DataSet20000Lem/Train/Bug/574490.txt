I click on a video to load (Zero Punctuation wa the one that occurred for me this afternoon, however it happened when I tried RedVSBlue, a well a my news link for Engadget/Gizmodo).

I have made sure to have the latest FLASH version a well a FireFox before doing this report, I check these site daily and only updated to v3.6.4 yesterday.

I also would like to note that it doesnt just crash a tab or that process, it kill firefox.exe ENTIRELY and DOES NOT bring up the crash reporter but doe bring up the restore window upon relaunch of FireFox.

I will be downgrading to FireFox v3.6.3 after I have submitted this bug a it a "deal breaker" for me.



Still love firefox but latest update is a "showstopper".

Thanks!

1. Open Browser (FireFox)
