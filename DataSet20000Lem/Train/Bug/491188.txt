I recently noticed that clicking link on some website wa leading to no reaction whatsoever. At first I thought it were simply broken links, than started to open these site in Internet Explorer where I found out that the same link were actually working just fine. I guess it must have something to do with a very recent Firefox update.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a website with this problem, see sample URL
2.click on any of the affected links, in this case the thumbnail of the veneer
3.nothing happens
Actual Results:
nothing

Expected Results:
new tab with larger sample veneer in this case, but I've seen it on other site with external link a well.

I do have an awful lot of addons, I've not yet tried to reproduce with all addons disabled. By the way, Firefox 3.x crash a lot more than 2.x and never report any crash information, but this problem is no crash.
