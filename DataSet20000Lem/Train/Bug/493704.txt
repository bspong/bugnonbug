Still seems to be major issue with ssl.google-analytics.com

Many site I go to including GMAIL logon page hang while trying to loading something from ssl.google-analytics.com. What is this analytics nonsense and why is it so necessary? Is there a way to disable that annoying feature? It NEVER seems to load whatever it's trying to load, just always say waiting for ssl.google-analytics.com. I have to actually manually click the stop button otherwise the password manager doesn't fill in the password. Really annoying. If it aint broke don't fix it, clearly someone added an unnecessary feature that ended up causing more problem than it solved. Why can't we just have browser the browse? Why do we need all this extra bull crap that just bog down the system?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
• Go to http://mail.google.com/ and look at the status.
• Browse around at http://www.ppctechs.com/ and notice the waiting status
• See how the password manager is hindered due to the page not ever fully loading.
Actual Results:
Waiting for ssl.google-analytics.com

Expected Results:
page stop loading COMPLETELY

There are like 500 post about this crap on here what the heck are you guy doing about it? Apparently not much! Just give u the option to disable that; I do not see any reason why when I go to a web site Firefox ha to check a google site a well, especially sense it NEVER is able to connect to that site.
