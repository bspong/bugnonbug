Minefield 2.0b11pre [Feedback] Button redirect to "Download the Beta"

I wa visiting URL: http://digitizor.com/2010/08/16/happy-17th-birthday-debian-and-some-interesting-history/ and wanted to submit Feedback that I did not like the way that the Site wa being rendered (It look better in IE based AOL9.0VR).

I notice in Minefield that I have a HUGE [Feedback] Button (for a quick Sad/Happy + URL Post) so I clicked it and ended up here: http://input.mozilla.com/en-US/beta/download

I updated Minefield only hour ago and with "b11pre" a part of the name you would think it would be "Beta enough", but not according to the Website.

Thus either it is incorrect to have the Button (NO, please) or the Website need to handle this version of Firefox (er, Minefield) (YES!, please).


Thanks,
Rob


PS:

Note that I have installed:

Related Bug 603083 but I am not privileged enough to re-open it (should _I_ be?).


Reproducible: Always
