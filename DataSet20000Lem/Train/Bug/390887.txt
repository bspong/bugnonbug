When working correctly, you can resize to decrease width of main browser window and the tab box will resize to keep the tab scroll arrow visible on both end of the tab box. However, after you drag and drop a tab, resizing to decrease width of main browser window only work until the dropped tab is at the right edge of the tab box, after which the tab box width will no longer decrease (instead, the right-side tab scroll arrow overflow off the right side of the window).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure Firefox to reopen tab on restart.
2. Open five tabs. They can hold anything or nothing.
3. Close Firefox.
4. Reopen Firefox. All five tab should still be present.
5. Resize window width both narrower and wider to demonstrate proper resizing of the tab box, including presence of tab scroll arrows.
6. Drag and drop the last tab to make it be the third tab.
7. Resize window narrower. This should demonstrate proper tab box resizing until the third tab is at the right edge of the tab box, after which the tab box improperly decline to get any more narrow, no matter how narrow you make the window.
