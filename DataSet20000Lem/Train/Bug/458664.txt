FF3 regularly freezing for several second coinciding with memory spike.

I'm unsure what is causing this, but I am experiencing regular freezes/pauses that last several second (5-10) and occur quite frequently (1 or more time per minute). It coincides with a large memory spike which is clearly visible in the task manager. This spike is about 250MB in size. e.g. my current FF memory usage is about 730MB. When the spike occurs, it grows to 988MB and then drop back to 730MB. The 5-10 second this spike occurs, the memory regularly ramp up and then just get released at the end, at which point Firefox becomes responsive again.

I am a heavy user, meaning I usually have several window open with many tabs. At the moment, I have 6 window open with a total of 54 tabs. Some tab are auto-refresh, but they don't refresh at the frequency I'm seeing, even if they were staggered.

My list of plugins and addons (a total of 8) is no different than when I run FF2, and I've never experienced this in FF2. I don't have many and the one I do use are pretty mainstream - e.g. Java and Flash plugins, Firebug and Flashblock addons.

The memory spike and resultant freeze appear almost to be FF doing some bookkeeping or some other maintenance type task, though I don't know what it could be.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Unknown at the moment. I'm not sure if it's a particular website/page or just the fact that I have lot of tab open.
Actual Results:
Frequent, large memory spike which cause Firefox to freeze for 5-10 seconds, after which the memory go back to "normal" and FF becomes responsive again. They occur roughly from 1 per minute to several per minute.

Expected Results:
No memory spike :-)
