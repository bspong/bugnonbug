After running for many day (about a week), firefox start refusing to open helper applications.

This problem ha occurred in several recent builds, including all the 2.x series.
My system is essentially a Fedora Core 3 installation. After about a week of continuous running, clicking on a link which requires a helper application or a plugin produce the following error:

! /tmp/listen-7.pls could not be opened, because an unknown error occurred.
Try saving to disk first and then opening the file.

| OK |
Saving the page (in the case of a pdf file - I could not save a pls script) a
suggested in the error message doe work.

Closing firefox and restarting return all to normal (for about a week).

I've indicated "Happens every time" below because it doe happen every time (after about a week)
