Introduce an easy method to print a listing of bookmark
Currently, there is no easy method to print a listing of existent bookmark in the bookmark library. In order to print a listing of bookmark one ha to perform the following steps:

A) Click bookmark
B) Click organize bookmark
C) Click the third star icon
D) Click export to HTML
E) Specify a location on disk to save
F) Click File | File Open
G) Specify the location on disk to print
H) Print the static HTML page

This is way too many step and way too convoluted for a user who merely want a listing.

You might be asking why a user would want a listing? I have a use case with my grandmother. She is completely unfamiliar with the concept of importing and exporting bookmark to another machine. Feeling completely comfortable with writing out each bookmark she has, she would rather just print a listing to take to another machine. I feel that this is a necessary intermediary step towards then progressing towards a user to importing/exporting whom is unfamiliar with the concept.

Alongside my use case, her current mental impression wa to have the bookmark sidebar open when printing a page (i.e., cmd-b | cmd-p | print) in order to perceptually believe to be printing a listing of bookmarks. Surely I can imagine there are other user out there who believe this too.

Steps to resolve? There should be an easier way to print a listing without the need to export. There should be a drop down selection somewhere in the Library window that exhibit this functionality.

Perhaps this is a feature in hindsight for the revamping of the bookmark library coming up.
