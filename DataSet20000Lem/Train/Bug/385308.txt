when having many window and tab open in firefox the tab feature freezes, the url at the top freeze also and it show the previous url that wa there before the freeze occurred, tab cannot be changed until you close 10 or more tab and it becomes active again, it feel like it almost too much for it too handle when having 30 or more tab open at the same time and it freezes, even though browsing is ok and everything work you cannot switch back and forth between different page in your tabs, when having mouse over the tab they blink but when clicking on them nothing happens, you cannot close them either untill you start closing one by one all the tab from the right. I have installed many firefox update since i noticed this bug but none of them fixed this issue so i decided to report it myself, this only happens when having 20+ or more tab open at the same time, sometimes more window with more tab in them cause that also, it very annoying because I'm a student and i need a lot of tab when i work on different image and note and i constantly have to close them and reopen again. Sometimes the only way to fix that is to terminate the browser and reopen everything again. Thanks a lot for your time and i hope this feature get fixed asap. Gera
