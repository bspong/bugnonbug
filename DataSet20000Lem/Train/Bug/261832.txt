Firefox/Incredimail "send a link" issue - link in email body garbled
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

I searched through dozen of Bugzilla post but still didn't see one that
matched my inquiry, so I apologize if this ha already been addressed...

When I try to "send a link" from Firefox, a new Incredimail email message
open but the link is garbled and not usable (I have tested on both the
sending and receiving end).

Situation can be recreated IF using Incredimail a primary mail program and
Firefox Browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox Browser
2. Click on "send link"
3. After new Incredimail message opens, view link in message body

Actual Results:
if I try to send a link, such as... link http://www.mozilla
org/products/firefox/ I would get a new message but the link in the message body
would appear as: http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozilla.org%2Fproducts%2Ffirefox%2F

Expected Results:
embedded the correct "phrasing" when sending a link so the receiving party can
actually click on it and follow that link

I end up having to copy and paste the link myself to allow email recipient to
actually utilize the sent link.

System Info: I use Windows XP over a Cable modem on a Dell Dimension 2400 Series
w/P4 CPU 2.66 Ghz 256 MB of RAM.
