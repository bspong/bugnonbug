Forms don't work with ISO-2022-CN

I worked with a web page developer whose page used the ISO-2022-CN Chinese
character set. It turn out that form data doe not get transmitted back to the
server with this character set. Using the GET method, all that show in the URL
is the equal sign, not the field name or contents.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run script CGI included below.
2. Enter some text in the box
3. Submit.
4. Look at the URL

Actual Results:
The page reference will fail, but that isn't a problem. The URL will have an =
without the field name beforehand or the content afterwards.

Expected Results:
The field name and content should be in the URL.

CGI script to demonstrate the problem. I don't have a handy public server to
demonstrate the problem from.


----------------------------------------------

#!/usr/bin/perl -T

use strict;

use CGI qw/:standard/;

print header(-charset => 'ISO-2022-CN'),
start_html(-title => "A simple example");
print '<form action="bin/echo-form.cgi" method=get>

<p>This form us the get method.

<p>Click the Submit query button.

<p><input type=text name=textinput value="Hello, world.">

<p><input type=submit>

<p>After you click the Submit query button, check the Location: box.

<p>The original URL should have the following string appended to it:

<p>?text_input=Hello%2C+world.

</form>',
end_html;
