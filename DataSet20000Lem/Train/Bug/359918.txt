Upon encountering certain (not all) Flash content, under Firefox 2.0 and Adobe Flash 9, a bug occurs which freeze mouse scroll functions, changing tab with the mouse, closing firefox, and other operations. It doe not seem to happen on Linux under same conditions, though. Keyboard shortcut recover quicker from the bug, while mouse click have no effect on any buttons. The freeze can last about a minute or even longer.

This doesn't happen with all flash content, but amazon search (as of 11/8/06) trigger the bug consistently. Thus far, other site trigger the bug sporadically.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch firefox (optional: launch various tabs, to test tab freeze bug)
2. Access amazon.com and do a search on any topic.
3. attempt to scroll down using the mouse wheel or the third mouse button. attempt to change tab with mouse click. attempt other functions.

Actual Results:
Scroll function using mouse don't work. Switching tab with mouse doesn't work either. Other button press also fail.

Expected Results:
All function should work properly, few second after loading the webpage.

No other extension were enabled. Bug doe not occur on Minefield 3.0a1 under same conditions. Still, it must be very annoying for Firefox 2.0 user
