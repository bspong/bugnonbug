Note - I don't know if this is a duplicate of report like 372590 or 247116, since they seem to be reporting the same or a similar problem, and their status is "RESOLVED FIXED", and are from long ago, yet I'm still having the problem.

When "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" show nothing, webpage including the scrollbars bounce up and down. The row of tab doe not move; the toolbars do not move; the status bar doe not move. I don't know if it happens when I have no bookmarks, only when I have bookmark and none are shown. The page move up or down rapidly, about 5 pixel from and to it normal position, and it can become hard to click or read something on it.

It doesn't shake only when the window ha been resized small enough to show no bookmarks, it's only small in the screenshot for a small image and since it wa the quickest way for me to reproduce it. If "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" is spaced out from other toolbar item enough, or there are many other toolbar item on the same row, or the first bookmark or folder in "Bookmarks Toolbar Items" ha a long enough name, all bookmark item can become hidden making the page shake. Because any of this can be common, I've set the severity rating "normal" instead of "minor".

Reproducible: Always
