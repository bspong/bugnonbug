firefox 1.5.0.1 hung when trying to use after machine had been idle, window and tab respond, can be selected and toggled, minimised, maximised, and most can be closed (see my other bug for detail of the menu function and the final window). web page links, however, do not respond in any way, nor doe the back, forward and reload buttons. data cannot be entered into the address bar, nor can new windows/tabs be opened, but curiously most can be closed. scrol bar and menu continue to function, except for link (history, bookmarks, etc). unable to use and unable to exit cleanly (task only exited with a forced-quit)
