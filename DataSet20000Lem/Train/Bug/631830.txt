Ive spent the past two week trying to determine what wa the cause of drop frame and stuttering in FF4. I've

-tried every video format, flv, mp4, webm, theora, lagarith, uncompressed, various mov formats, and apng.
-tried all the player i could get FF to recognize, flash, VLC, <video>.
-tested each combination with hardware acceleration on/off. I get 64fps with it on (23off), but video is just a bad regardless.
-uninstalled and cleaned driver/codec remnant and reinstalled latest.

Ive tested mostly on 720p/24fps material (except for flv which requires 30fps) on my system:

Win7x64 on OCZ vertex SSD
Corei7 920
12GB Ram
4drive raid10 medium drive (200MB/s read)
9600GT

Ive also been testing this on another system (gets 46FPS on hardware acceleration test):
Win7x86
Core2 w/onchip intel HD graphic
4GB RAM
Seagate 500GB (100MB/s read)

Playback performance is identical. Drop frame are difficult to detect for most people unless the video drop so many frame a to stagger, but it best seen when viewing fluid motion or stroboscopic material (the pattern will change frequency like spoke do when a bike wheel change velocity). One method ive found to cause the footage to basically freeze is to click on the tab bar (but not on the tab) while it is playing. Oddly enough HD youtube footage play fine and doesnt exhibit these problems, yet VLC, <video>, and the default dreamweaver flash player all do. My guess is that google leveraged it vast resource to make their player work around FF's faults, but a for the rest of us, we're SOL.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Play video
2.Repeat
3.Become frustrated at how terrible FF ha become.
