Firefox is experiencing multiple freeze - from every 30 second to a few minutes. I didn't believe it wa the browser at first and thought I must have been bugged by some maleware, did some scanning cleared some cookies, did some virus scan - nada, and still freezing. I then re-downloaded and re-installed - still freezing. I then checked the other browser on this system, Netscape, Opera, and Maxthon (IE) - they all work fine except for Netscape and Firefox. Thunderbird also is running fine on this system. No other program is experiencing freeze or hangups. This started around a week ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start browser
2.
3.

Actual Results:
hang ever minute or so

Expected Results:
no freeze or hang - smooth sailing like I've come to expect

I'm runing an AMD Athlon XP 2600+ with a gig of ram and a 76GB hard drive.
Installed and and running - Web Developer Toolbar; Stumble Upon; digg; rubnub
Using theme - crystal dream 1.0.2

This is my work computer so I don't surf too much to 'bad' places, mostly used for web dev work.
