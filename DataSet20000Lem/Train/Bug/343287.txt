After paging down to near bottom of page, the cursor mysteriously position itself on a (table?) of ad at left of page. It appears elongated and blinks. Unless it is moved to another position, PageUp and PageDn will not change the vertical position of the page, or the position of the cursor. (Moving the cursor by mouse or arrow will clear the problem.) If only one tab is open, the cursor behaves in the same manner, but PageUp/PageDn are not negatively affected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have one tab open.
2. Open a new tab and go to nytimes.com
2. click on the page anywhere in the "normal" text area (otherwise won't PageDn)
3. <PageDn> until the cursor appears elongated at left side of page
4. Attempts to PageUp won't work

Actual Results:
Follow "Steps To Reproduce"

Expected Results:
Unable to change the Vertical position of page with PageUp/PageDn unless the cursor is manually moved to another location.

1) I think you should never even see the cursor on a page that doesn't allow data input.
2) I think one shouldn't have to click on the page to execute PageDn.
3) I think the cursor should not jump to an arbitrary field on PageDn, especially since it wa initially positioned in the top center of page.
4) I know that PageDn shouldn't result in a "hung state" unless one is at the bottom of the page.
5) Is Firefox somehow treating this Web Page a a Form instead?
