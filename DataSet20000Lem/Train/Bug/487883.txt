I clicked on one single image on imagefap and got this.

What I see here:
1. The image is in disk cache but it ha 0 bytes.
2. The image is not in memory cache (not shown on pic)
3. It's not a cache collision because cache collision are marked a (not
cached) in "page info"
4. In page info the image is shown immediately (not from network). I'm guessing
it's from decoded-image cache.
5. After highlighting the url and pressing enter, the image reloaded from
network but wa put in disk cache correctly this time around.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open link: http://imagefap.com/gallery/1594591
2.open some image
3.one of them will show 0 byte on property or page info (it's random)

OR

1.install mondofap script to greasemonkey: http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/15603
2.load the link (all image will load in one page)
3.open page info and go to medium tab
4.images have 0 byte
Actual Results:
Images load correctly but have 0 byte

Expected Results:
Images should show the correct size
