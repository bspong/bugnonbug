Whenever I start Firefox 3 it come up with an error dialog "Firefox-534798572387.growlRegDict" may be an application. It wa downloaded from the Internet and will be opened by GrowlHelperApp. Are you sure you want to open it?

After much searching this file exists in /var/folders/9Z/9ZXJtv9pGbGxbOcrJKnzyE+++TI/-Tmp-/

Removing the file doesn't help because it seems that Firefox re-creates it every time I start Firefox. And for some reason xattr reveals that the file contains the com.app.quarantine extended attribute.

So it seems that Firefox want to register with Growl (I'm running Growl 1.1.4), so it creates the registration file, but for some reason it get created a quarantined. Then I guess it call the Growl Helper App to install it every time it starts. It doesn't seem right to me it should install into Growl every time you start Firefox, but there you are. EIther way, the dialog shouldn't show up and is really annoying, and I have found no way to stop it.

I have another Mac that it isn't occuring on. The only difference I can think of is it ha a slightly older version of Growl, but it hard to see how this would be the problem.
