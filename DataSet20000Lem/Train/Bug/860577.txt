DNS cached when domain forwared even forward old IP
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0

Steps to reproduce:

A website I visit, for example tpb.se, recently changed to tpb.gl . When the TLD changed tpb.se forwarded to tpb.gl . After a day or so the website reverted to tpb.se but tpb.se is still forwarded by firefox to tpb.gl , even though the server at tpb.se is no longer doing so. I even looked up the A record for tpb.se typed in the IP in the address bar and this is forwarded to tpb.gl , but not in IE or Google Chrome. And after downloading DNS Cache 1.7 add on and clearing the cache, tpb.se work correctly again in firefox.


Actual results:

Firefox cached tpb.se and used a reverse lookup on IPs pointed to by tpb.se and forwared them to tpb.gl , even though tpb.se server wa not forwarding to tpb.gl


Expected results:

When i type tpb.se into firefox I want it to go to tpb.se, not remember that tpb.se ha recently been forwarded to tpb.gl and think it ha some sort of trick to skip the request to tpb.se and go to tpb.gl directly, then fail to find tpb.gl and just quit. It should at least go back and try to refresh the DNS entry for tpb.se upon failure of the "shortcut".
