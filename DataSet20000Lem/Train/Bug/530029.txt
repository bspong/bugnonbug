Firefox can only open the homepage, no other page from other server because of a language pack
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: MozillaFirefox-3.5.4-1.1.2.x86_64.rpm from http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.2/repo/oss/suse/x86_64/

After having installed an experimental language pack made by myself (http://walotux.walon.org/firefox/walloon_language_pack-3.5.0.1.20091111.1-fx.xpi) I tried to uninstall it to install a more up to date version. After uninstalling it, I got a message of XML error (sorry, I haven't copied it).

Sinds then, I can't open anymore any other page but the homepage.
I start with for example firefox.com and I open a page from another server adress, it give a page from mozilla "404 not found". If I start with openSUSE (command "firefox http://www.opensuse.org"), it will open opensuse.org but when trying after firefox.com, it give an error page from opensuse.org...

I've uninstalled all the walloon language pack and set it back tu en-US.
I've tried to remove the profile in ~/.mozilla/firefox, it doesn't help.
I've created a new profile it doesn't change anything
I've tried in safe mode, it doesn't help
I've uninstalled and reinstalled the RPM, it doesn't change anything.
When I try with another Linux user (without installing the addon) it work without problem.

Everything happens like my addon changed something in a config file in the user home folder but that's not located in ~/.mozilla/firefox/

Something strange, another tester in Windows XP ha reported a similar problem, after uninstalling it and reseting the locale to fr, het got this: http://walon.org/pipermail/linux-wa/attachments/20091119/4d2cedc7/attachment-0001.jpe and had problem with "downloading some attachment from gmail and with many other pages". He say that it work well now.

The message he got look very similar with the one I had the first time I restarted FF after uninstalling language pack.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox (in openSUSE 11.2?, may buggy on other platforms, to try)
2. Install Walloon language pack from here: http://walotux.walon.org/firefox/walloon_language_pack-3.5.0.1.20091111.1-fx.xpi
3. Set general.useragent.locale in about:config to "wa"
4. Restart FF, it should be in Walloon.
5. Go to Usteyes->Pacaedjes and uninstall the Walloon language pack, don't close the addon window
6. Go to about:config and reset general.useragent.locale in about:config to "en-US"
4. Click in the addon window on the button "Restart Minefield" (or "Renonder Minefield", in Walloon)

Actual Results:
You get an XML error on the about:config page and when you try to open another page than the homepage, it doesn't work (as described above).

Next time you launch FF, it should open about:config without problem but the other problem will persist

Expected Results:
No XML error message and to be able to navigate to more than one webpage.

Notice that in the language pack that make the problem there were one error: the file wa.jar wa put on the root of the archive and not in the folder chrome/. I have since corrected it in an updated version. Another problem in that language pack is that I enabled the branding translations, it's why Firefox become Minefield. I also corrected it later.

I've also installed and uninstalled the language pack in Moblin and it doesn't make any problem.

Please help me to get my FF work correctly and to identify the problem want I want to distribute that language pack more widely.

Thanks.
