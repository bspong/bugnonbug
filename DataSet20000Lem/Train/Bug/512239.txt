I am running Firefox 3.5.2 on window XP.

The version is: (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv: 1.9.1.2) Gecko/20090729 Firefox/3.5.2

When window recovers after a crash and firefox is restarted it start with a message like this:
"Well, this is embarrassing....."

I request you that please, please do not use such unprofessional error messages. It might be a good way to express humour, but for most user out there on the edge concerned about malware and other viruses, this message ring alarm bell a if some virus ha taken over the computer (because these kind of soft humor message are usually associated with malware, prompting for some follow up action). This is all the more alarming a it happens after a crash.

Please, please use only professional error messages.

"Firefox encountered a problem while trying to restart..."
or
"Firefox could not recover from a previous failure..."

etc...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Windows XP crash when firefox is running (crash unrelated to firefox)
2. Windows XP restart
3. Restart firefox to get the "Well this is embarrassing..." error message
