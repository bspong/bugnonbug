if you close an exsisting Firfox instance (by e.g. pressing the 'X' on Win) and then open Firefox again very fast (~ le than 0,5 sec. in between), e.g. via shortcut, all user defiend setting are erased and the browser is set back to default settings.
i.e. all extension are set back, a well a all options, including connection settings, homepage, download manager settings, etc.
this is reproduceable every time you do it fast enough and very annoying.
I experienced this issue up from FF v0.8 when I first tried the browser till now (v.1.5).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. close an existing single session of FF (no other session should be open).
2. rapidly restart the browser (less than 0,5 sec. in betw.) via shortcut.

Actual Results:
all user defiend setting are lost and set back to defaults.

Expected Results:
user defiend setting should be kept.

- 'works' in plain WinXP a well a in SP1 and SP2. havn't tried other OS.
- using AMD Athlon XP 1800, 512MB Ram, Nvidia G-Foce 2 MX, SB Audigy 1, MSI KT3Ultra2.
- system is stable and not OC (passed 8 hour of Prime95 and MemTest).
- using plain FF v1.5 with only a few extension installed (AdBlock, NoScript, SpellBound, FlashGot, X Mod).
- large amount of bookmark present (though I guess that's of no importance).
