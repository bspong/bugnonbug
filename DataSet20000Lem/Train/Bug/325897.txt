When trying to run an online game - a pretty simple one - the entire browser will hang.

When it happens I will go to the URL with IE and it start every time without fail.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Go to www.gamehouse.com
Click on OnLine Games
Click on Jewel Quest


Actual Results:
It will often hang the entire browser and I have to abort it.

Expected Results:
It should now display an ad, start java, download the applet, start the game.

This used to work all the time. The problem started after upgrading to this build. I often have the URL open in a second or third tab. I often do this after the browser ha been running all day, but it will occasionally hang when the browser ha just been started. I never run IE except after this problem happens.

I tried to test this on Deer Park Alpha 2(1.6a1) but it didn't want to run on my system very well so I gave up. (The Deer Park feedback survey page is Error 404.)
