"Always show the tab bar" option cause "Server not found" error.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3

When I select the "Always show the tab bar" option in Firefox 3.6.3, the selected default home page (no matter what the page I select is) will only open about 1 out of 8 or 10 time on startup. The rest of the time I get a "blank page" tab heading, then a "Server not found" error page. The home page load fine when I click "Reload".

When I deselect the "Always show the tab bar", the problem go away.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.After updating to 3.6.3 from version 2 the default homepage would not open.
2.Select "Always show the tab bar"
3.Clear all cache, clear all IE cache in internet options, close Firefox and restart it.
Actual Results:
The selected default home page (no matter what the page I select is) will only open about 1 out of 8 or 10 time on startup. The rest of the time I get a "blank page" tab heading, then a "Server not found" error page. The home page load fine when I click "Reload".

Expected Results:
Open the default home page on start up.

I use Verison wireless internet modem, Avast Home Edition, Ashampoo Firewall, Spybot S&D, Windows Firewall is disabled, but all security setting are set to default. However, since the problem go away when the "Always show the tab bar" is deselected, I can't see how any of that would matter.
