Hovering over HTML in inspector should highlight location in document, not just upon click of HTML in inspector.
When hovering over HTML element in the inspector, the document should immediately highlight the area that are being hovered over in the HTML. Currently, to view the highlighted area, the HTML in the inspector must be clicked. Firebug currently doe this.

As a bonus, perhaps the document should scroll the highlight into view when not in view, and a click on the HTML element in inspector would lock the scroll until the mouse is hovered over the document (leaves inspector code), so that mousing over the HTML in the inspector won't retrigger the live highlighting and scroll.


In addition, and this might fit better in another bug report, but after selecting an element in the HTML inspector, the area in the document is highlighted (dashed borders), with the tooltip positioned above or below the highlight, which is the standard behavior. The problem is when trying to get rid of it; there's no convenient way to do so, and most workflow won't require this tooltip and highlight to persist. The only way to get rid of it is to either select another element in the inspector, or close the Developer Tools. There should either be an option in the setting to disable the persistent tooltip and highlight, or an easy way to close it from within the document. For comparison, Firebug doesn't persist the highlight at all, nor provide a tooltip for the highlighted area.
