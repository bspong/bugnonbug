Firefox 3.6.12 refuse to start after I install the GWT developer plugin or the ColorZilla plugin

Everytime I install the GWT developer plugin or ColorZilla on a clean fresh Firefox 3.6.12 installation, the browser refuse to start. With "clean, fresh" I meant to say I previously uninstalled Firefox using AppCleaner so it erased all my profiles.

These are the only two plugins I'm experiencing this behavior with. The first time I encountered this wa when I installed ColorZilla a few month ago. So I contacted Alex Sirota (alex@iosart.com), the plugin developer, but after we exchanged some email I stumbled upon this link: https://support.mozilla.com/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?comments_offset=20&comments_threadId=0&comments_parentId=588227&comments_threshold=0&thread_sort_mode=commentDate_asc&forumId=1&time_control=3600

I ignored this for a while but now I'm really in need of the GWT developer plugin to work.
