Thunderbird to Firefox IPC go via X11 screen instead of via user (with multimonitor config)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6
Build Identifier: version 2.0.0.5 (20070716)

If X-Windows is configured to treat each monitor a a different "screen" in a multi-monitor setup, Thunderbird can't communicate with Firefox if they're running on different screens, even if they're running on the same PC a the same user.

If Firefox is loaded on DISPLAY=:0.0 and Thunderbird is loaded on DISPLAY=:0.1, then clicking on a URL in an e-mail message will try to load Firefox on screen 0.1, but because it's already running on 0.0 a message pop up saying "Firefox is already running, but is not responding."

If another user run Firefox on the same display a Thunderbird, then when User-A click a link in User-A's Thunderbird, the page open in User-B's copy of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Load Firefox on one display (export DISPLAY=somehost:x.y ; firefox)

2. On the same computer, load Thunderbird on another display (it shouldn't matter whether it's a local screen or a remote X11 display on another PC.)

3. p -A | egrep 'firefox|thunderbird' should verify that both program are running on the same PC a the same user

4. Click on a link in Thunderbird, and it won't open in Firefox

Actual Results:
A message pop up: "Firefox is already running, but is not responding...etc"

Expected Results:
The link should open in Firefox, a it doe when Firefox and Thunderbird are running on the same screen.
