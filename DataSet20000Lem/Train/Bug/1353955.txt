Full installer doe not set default browser on Windows 7
With a currently nightly full installer (20170404030204)
https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/2017/04/2017-04-04-03-02-04-mozilla-central/firefox-55.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe

0. Have some other browser (say IE) a default
1. Run the installer with all default option
2. Check the default browser, Nightly ha not become the default (I have been checking in IE's Internet Options Programs tab, a IE had previously been the default browser, it still claim IE is the default)

The regression range seems to be between 2017-02-01 (20170201030207) and 2017-02-02 (20170202030211), so I suspect bug 1324617 may be involved. Aurora is also affected.

It seems that at the same time another issue appears, when running the uninstaller from an non-admin command line a
C:\Program Files\Nightly\uninstall\helper.exe /SetAsDefaultAppUser
it will pop up a UAC prompt. This didn't happen before 2017-02-02.

I think this is causing a UAC prompt for helper.exe towards the end of a stub install in current nightlies and aurora (on Win 7). I can file another bug for that if it seems unrelated.

I'll also note here that manually running helper /SetAsDefaultAppUser to set nightly a default stopped working between 2017-03-02 and 2017-03-03, though it still attempt to elevate with the UAC prompt, possibly related to the fix for bug 1340568 given the timing. The stub installer is still able to set default, though, and a far a I know it us this mechanism, so I don't know exactly what is going on here.
