eBay[DE] auction description inside cascaded iframe missing in FF source, although MS IE8 (in compatibility view) display the code.

Is eBay protecting their auction description from Mozilla FireFox and latest Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 by two hidden iframes?

I tested version v3, v3.5 and v3.6 on several auction item on German site.

What did I do?
=> opened an eBay-auction
=> show source code
=> tried to extract (or at least find) the description

The interesting thing, you can find the auction description in Microsoft IE8 by showing the source in compatibility! view (or use earlier versions).

Workaround:
Saving the website (eBay auction) by "save page as" in FF embeds the auction description.

This means, the saved page is not anymore protected and you can view the whole content of the auction including the description via page source.

Important:
I discovered this flaw by using the AddOn ScrapBook (Plus), because if you are saving any auction locally (archive site) by the AddOn and open it after that within FF the auction description is missing and it is a little malformed in the header.
Personally I love archiving auction by ScrapBook.
I have already written an email to the author of ScrapBook, but he doesn't know how to fix this problem, although he were able to reproduce it.
So I guess it would be enough, if either Mozilla Firefox becomes updated to support the iframes in source anyhow or the author of ScrapBook AddOn need to update it saving/archiving routines.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open any eBay[DE] auction with FF
2. show page source
3. search "<div class="d-iframe">" => see following <iframe> tag
4. open any eBay[DE] auction with IE8 in compatibility mode
5. show page source
6. search for some auction description content and you will find the code

Actual Results:
- doesn't show auction description in source code (maybe hidden iframe for content protection)

Expected Results:
- show the auction description in source code (i.e. already possible with Firebug)
