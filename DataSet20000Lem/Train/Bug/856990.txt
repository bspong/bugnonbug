Bookmarks Manager hang after every action
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:22.0) Gecko/20130401 Firefox/22.0
Build ID: 20130401030817

Steps to reproduce:

open bookmark manager
cut > paste OR
right-click > insert separator OR
drag and drop bookmark


Actual results:

FF hangs.
I can mouse scroll the scroll bar, but the content doe not move.
it take up to 90 sec for the content to 'refresh' and scroll
or to be able to preform another task such a move, cut, modify url of description of a bookmark or insert separator / folder


Expected results:

there should be no (perhaps fraction of a second) delay.

*this happened to me once before and only once before did i use sync. I don't remember if i used sync last time this happened, but i know this time, i have just used sync and with the miniscule amount of control and information available for sync, the crap 'service' added 6 or 8 'addons' that are 10 month out of date. I had addon manager opens, is the only reason i know. I removed (undo) the added items. I tried restoring the backup json file i made just before sync, but after inserting separator Bookmark Mgr still hang for a minute or so.

my two cents... sync sucks.
