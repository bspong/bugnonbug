This site us popups to display new incoming messages, new people coming online
etc.

After a period of time, the notice come up saying "Firefox prevented this site
from opening a popup window. Click here for more options..."

The site is in the allowed list, but even if the popup blocking option is OFF,
the error will still occur.

To rectify the problem, it is necessary to shut down all instance of Firefox,
and restart a fresh window - where it will continue to work for a period of time
and then again start blocking the popups.

Have installed Firefox on 5 different machines, both version 1.0 and 1.0.1,
standard install - no themes, plugins, etc.
