Randomly bad generation of DOM tree

When I go on my website ( http://oldschoolsc.free.fr ) and then I click on "L'association" et then I click on "Accueil", the left column is too big, due to a span which should be hidden and is visible (it should be visible only if the user put the mouse over some areas.) When I make a F5 or refresh button, all is correct. I saved the HTML document when it worked and when it didn't work. I made a comparaision between theese 2 document (with tkDiff) and there were 0 difference. Then, I used the DOM inspector to see the DOM and make the comparision when it's ok and when it's not ok. I view one difference :

On the good DOM, there is a TD element which contains an A elementand this A element contains an TABLE element and a SPAN element.

On the bad DOM, the TD element contains 3 element : A element (which is empty), TABLE element and SPAN element.
It's very strange because the HTML code is exactly the same!


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to http://oldschoolsc.free.fr (here, all is correct, the left column is well)
2.click on the 'L'association" link (at the buttom of the page)
3.click on the 'Accueil" link (at the buttom of the page, this link is the home page link)


Actual Results:
The left column is bigger because of span which should be hiddden and are visible.
This left colum could becom well if you click on F5 or refresh button

Expected Results:
The left column should be correctly displayed

I have a 15 inch screen, but when i did the test on another comuter with bigger screen, the bug did'nt occur.
