Here's the error message I get:
Visual Studio Just-In-Time Debugger error
An unhandled Win32 exception in occurred in firefox.exe [2692]. Just-In-Time debugging this exception failed with the following error: No installed debugger ha Just-In-Time debugging enabled. In Visual Studio, Just-In-Time debugging can be enabled from Tools/Options/Debugging/Just-In-Time.
Chech the documentation index for 'Just-In-Time, errors' for more information.

Firefox doe not close until I click OK. This crash doe NOT open a Windows Error Reporting message.

I'm not sure what cause the error. I always get it after opening a new tab, while the page is loading. It ha happened about three times, but it is not predictable. It doe not seem to be caused by any particular websites. It might be related to Flash, but it hasn't happened enough to know for sure. Flash work normally most of the time.

I don't have Visual Studio installed anymore (I did previously, but I uninstalled it a while before I started using Firefox 3 beta).
