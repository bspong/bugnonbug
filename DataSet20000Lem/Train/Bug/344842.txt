History- several week ago I lost my bookmark and search extensions; consequently, I reinstalled Firefox and have been working on rebuilding my bookmarks. When I went to organize them I found that I could not move the bookmark to another folder. Before my problem and reinstall I could always manage the bookmarks. Also, I notice that there is no help or FAQ on how to manage bookmarks; maybe there is something that ha changed and I am missing it.

What I am doing is a cut and paste, since in the past that ha worked. I cut the entry and highlight the folder where I want to place it, then right click to paste or use the Edit/paste method but the entry is placed above the folder and not inside it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.tried edit method to cut and paste
2.used mouse left click to cut and paste
3.tried to move bookmark without using bookmark manager by right clicking on bookmark on list of bookmark and cut/paste but the result is always the same.

Actual Results:
selected bookmark is moved but placed above the designated folder

Expected Results:
bookmark would be moved inside the designated folder
