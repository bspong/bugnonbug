When i have about 60 or more tabs, i want quickly close all of them. I press CTRL+W and start to wait.. about 5 or 10 seconds. At the beginning, i see how firefox kill tab one by one. But then suddenly firefox hangs. I see absolutely white screen and nothing else. Windows mark firefox process a 'does not respond'.
Also, it is much more quicker way to close all tab - just kill the process and start firefox again.
My tab always include site with javascript (maybe slow javascript) and several youtube.com tabs.
