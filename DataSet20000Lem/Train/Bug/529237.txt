the script I am trying to debug is recursive, and FF refuse to stop it. I get the same dialog box over and over "unresponsive script", and then some more image appear in the list element (bug in my script, should only be 1 image per list item). in the meantime, Firefox switch to other window applications, refuse to respond to the red "X" stop button, and the debug script button doe the same thing a the stop button - useless. only recourse is to kill FF from task mgr.

also, first time I bring up that page (restore previous pages) it doe not execute. FF is not executing the javascript (maybe that's a good thing, but still...).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. run FF with page restored from previous state.
2. make sure to refresh buggy DHTML tree development page with recursive script.
3. stop script dialog will appear. press stop script button or debug script button. doesn't stop. try over and over.
4. try to hit the red "X" stop button.
5. kill FF using task mgr.
Actual Results:
doesn't matter which button I press or what I do (except kill FF), same result - doesn't stop and FF doesn't respond.

Expected Results:
find a good way to terminate and restart the javascript engine, or truly reset/reinitalize the javascript engine.

I have not published the problem web page. If you need the source code, I can provide it, just ask, it's GPL'd, and the tree menu is under development.
