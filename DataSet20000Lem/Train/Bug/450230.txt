Organize Bookmarks - adding folder doesn't work, function add/delete/replace folder don't work every time, new created folder doesn't appear in bookmark through the menu, etc., etc...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Organize bookmark and open library window.
2. Click once on "bookmarks toolbar" - add a new folder/try to replace it, delete it, add the address in it, etc...
3. Go to bookmark toolbar folder through the menu "bookmarks" and check how they behave (endless level of folder in folders...)
Actual Results:
When you add a new folder to the "bookmarks toolbar folder" through library window, it place it in a very anarchic way, and often in double. When you check them via "bookmarks" menu, in this two tween file are other three empty file with the same name, and in them tree others, etc, etc... the endless level of them !! o_Ô It is impossible to move or delete this file or to place an url address in them. If you close the library window, they do not appear in a bookmark menu, but if you try to create again the same new folder in a library window, they appear in couple of place in double... and with multiple level o_O

Expected Results:
You can create new folder via library window in the "bookmarks toolbar folder" for example... organize them: remove, delete, add the file in them, etc...
