Display of print preview should reflect rounded up margin value

If the margin size (left margin in this example) is changed to exceed the page,
the print preview behaves unexpectedly by making the page appear and disappear
(behavior of text remains a expected).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a webpage in the browser and go to File->Print Preview
2.Open the Page Setup option box and change all margin size to zero
3.Increment the margin size of the left margin size from 0 to 7.8 (will see
expected behavior)
4.Enter 7.99 a the left margin size (unexpected behavior- Refer snapshot
Unexpected_Layout).
5. Return to the Page Setup option and now enter 7.9 for the left margin.
(expected behavior returns-Refer snapshot Unexpected_Layout2)


Actual Results:
The value 7.99 is truncated to 7.9 and the page and the text disappears.
Returning back to the Page Setup and manually entering 7.9 a left margin brings
back the expected preview.


Expected Results:
The text should move out of the boundary of the page and hence will not be
visible. However the page (white background) should remain.
Otherwise, the truncation of the value 7.99 to 7.9 should produce the same
effect a for the value 7.9 when manually eneterd.

Follow Up test
---------------
1. In certain replication instance checking on/off the 'Shrink to fit page'
option also helped bring back the expected preview page.
2. 7.95 a the left margin result in expected behavior(white page with no text)
even though the value is truncated to 7.9

Importance of the bug
---------------------
1. The chnges in value of the margin size affect the print preview irrespective
that the displayed value are shown within bounds. This can be considered a a
corne case (boundary) where the 7.99 make the page disappear and the program
set the value of the display to 7.9. Finally manually entering the value a 7.9
make the page reappear.
Conclusion: Changes in margin value affect the preview but not the display of
the value.
