the location bar / address bar is no longer available for direct editing after a new tab is created. Bookmarks and link still work, but direct manipulation of address string is blocked :(

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open browser, enter url
2.use ctrl+t to create new tab (creates new tab with about:blank)
3.go to new tab and enter url (fails)
4.return to original tab and edit url (fails)
Actual Results:
after a new tab is created the address bar (location bar) is no longer available for editing.

Expected Results:
address bar should available for editing on all tab

address bar should not be blocked for editing. maybe related to auto-complete, or tab focus issue that are already reported.
I'm calling this a major feature because ff3.5 is useless to me a a developer until this is corrected.

here is my current build info:
