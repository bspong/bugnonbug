Uninstall deleted everything in my program file directory save a few open binaries.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows 98)
Build Identifier: Firefox (1.0) ?

I downloaded FireFox a while ago and finding that the integrated 'plugin
installer' didn't work ignored it and downloaded and installed the necessary
component manualy.

All component except for 'Nippon-Browse', a japanese to english dictionary,
have worked correctly.

A recent update notice promted me to upgrade. The inataller again didn't work
(no outgoing connection...) so I decided to download the latest version and
uninstall.

I also uninstalled that unstable Adobe 6 nonsense first.

The uninstall went off without a hitch except that now I could not access the
internet nor any other browser I had.

A quick restart and behold a desktop of broken icons, application
crashing/failing to start correctly and window installer telling me that I
could not install microsoft office (it wa installed two year ago and wa
still not a minute ago...) a it wa now missing critical components...

A quick file-browse and I discover that the FireFox installer ha *deleted
every file* not a-running-binary from my *program files* directory up.

This not only includes every application I had installed, common components,
but more inportantly the custom conficurations, script and plugins I'd
developed/accumilated.

Reproducible: Didn't try

1. install FireFox(1.0)
2. use FireFox plugin-installer (w/no success)
