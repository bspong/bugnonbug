Firefox 8 ha ridiculously slow bookmark searching and address bar dropdown with thousand of tag
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.106 Safari/535.2

Steps to reproduce:

Initiate a bookmark search through the bookmark sidebar (ctrl-b) or the bookmark manager window, or click on the dropdown arrow at the right of the address bar.


Actual results:

Firefox 8 stop responding, I get the blue spinning cursor in Windows 7, and only after several minute doe the search finish or the dropdown populate and Firefox 8 becomes responsive again. This started only in the last few beta build but persists


Expected results:

Should have finished the action instantly or within a few seconds. This started only in the last few beta build of Firefox 8. It did not happen in 7.01 or previous beta 8 builds. But it persists in the release build of Firefox 8. There wa a similar issue several version ago which wa eventually fixed. This is extremely frustrating a it render Firefox nearly useless for me and it is now constantly trying to force me to upgrade from 7.01 to 8.0 on all my computers.

I've run Firefox 8 in safe mode to rule out an extension but this doe not help.

Note also, even re-installing 7.01 doe not immediately fix the issue. However, I've found that deleting the file "urlclassifier3.sqlite" and "places.sqlite" (40 and 20 Mb, respectively) will fix the issue after downgrading to 7.01. The first time Firefox load after deleting these file it will remain hidden and hang indefitely, but if I kill the process and reload it then work fine and i can restore my bookmark library by downloading it from Xmarks, after which performance is just fine. If I do this same process using Firefox 8, it continues to have poor performance even after rebuilding the bookmark library.
