Palette for Firefox and Thunderbird different from other applications. Relogin to CDE fix problem.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041109 Firefox/1.0

When I startup my SunBlade 100 workstation (Solaris 9.0) CDE reloads
application I had running on logout. This usually mean emacs, StarOffice,
Firefox, Thunderbird, and a couple of terminals. However, when the Mozilla.org
apps open, their palette are clearly different from those of the other
programs- the window content are displayed using "wrong" color until I make
them focussed (using point-to-focus), at which point the window decorations,
rest of the applications, and desktop are now using the wrong colors.
Strangely, if I exit CDE and log back in without restarting the machine, the
program will load fine. The fact that both Thunderbird and Firefox display this
problem make me think it lie with them and not with Solaris.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot up my Sun workstation.
2. Login to CDE.
3. Wait for Firefox and Thunderbird to load.

Actual Results:
Palettes for window content of these application is only correct if I focus them.

Expected Results:
Palettes should be the same whether the application are focussed or not.

Using default theme with no extensions.
