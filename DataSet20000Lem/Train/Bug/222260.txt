Page that set cookie is called twice

In a PHP hit logging script, that us a 15 minute long cookie to determine a
new hit or a subsequent hit, The log show that Mozilla 0.6 and 0.7 hit the page
twice everytime, with a second or so between them.

The script test for a cookie by name, and record to a Db accordingly.

So on first entry (no cookie set), a hit is logged and the cookie is set,
causing another hit to be logged for this page access.

Moving to a different page log a hit, the timeout for the cookie is reset by
this page which in turn cause another hit to be logged.

Thus always double logging with Moz 0.6/0.7, this doe not happen with IE6,Opera
7, or Netscape 7.0 on Win2k or Win98.

To ensure it wa double hitting, I checked my Apache access log, here's a
typical Mozilla 0.6/0.7 page hit (index.php called twice):
[15/Oct/2003:15:48:07 +0100] "GET /index.php...
[15/Oct/2003:15:48:07 +0100] "GET /css/menuimg/20.gif...
[15/Oct/2003:15:48:08 +0100] "GET /someinclude.php...
[15/Oct/2003:15:48:08 +0100] "GET /index.php...



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.simple PHP script to check for a named cookie. If set, refresh the time, if
not set, set it.
2. check time of access against server access log, look for double page call.
3. Repeat with other browsers, esp. Netscape 7.0, and note this doe not happen.

Actual Results:
server log for Moz. show second page call a above
server log for same page with Netscape 7.0, show page (index.php) is called
only once.

Expected Results:
Should not recall page when a cookie is set/refreshed.

Noticed on Mozilla 0.6, downloaded Mozilla 0.7 with default theme, no
improvement. Sample script have been tested many times, cooky deleted and
test carried out again each time.
Has been tested on Win98 and Win2k only.
Cannot replicate this issue in any other browsers.
