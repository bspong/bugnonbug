Firefox spellcheck feature ha begun to underline almost all words, regardless of whether word are spelled correctly.

This happens when typing text into text field on various web pages, including Mozilla at the time this bug report wa entered.

Sometimes some paragraph are not underlined but generally almost every word is underlined with a red zigzag.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I visit a web page or forum using Firefox 3.6.8 (even after downloading and reinstalling it fresh).
2. I enter text in text fields, for example the one used to enter these steps.
3. Almost all word a I type them are underlined and remain underlined.
Actual Results:
The spell checker doe not work in the way it is expected to.

Expected Results:
The spell checker should only underline word that are not spelled correctly according to the dictionary I have installed (which are British English Dictionary 1.19, and German Dictionary extended for Austria 2.0.1 - both enabled).

The spell checker ha worked in the past for both of these dictionaries.

The same thing happened even after I downloaded and reinstalled Firefox 3.6.8.

I also made a note in a Firefox support forum in case anyone else ha experienced the same thing: https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/751023

Firefox's spellcheka is one fo my favorite feechures and I wish it wasa wroking (seriously though, do miss it).
