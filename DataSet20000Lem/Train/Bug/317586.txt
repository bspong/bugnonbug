Relative path on file:// link are always relative to first page loaded instead of current page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7

First page loaded is file://c:/top/MainPage.htm. When a link to file:/top/subdir/Page2.htm is clicked, the page loads, but all link to page in the same subdirectory cannot be found. For example, a link to 'Page3.htm' fails to load because Firefox is looking for the file in file:///c:/top/ relative to the first page called, instead of in folder file://c:/top/subdir/ relative to the current loaded page. These kind of link are handled correctly in MSIE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a page in a directory with a link to another page in a subdirectory one level down.
2. The page in the subdirectory should have a link to another page in the same subdirectory.
3. Load the main page.
4. Follow the link to the second page located in the .
5. Follow the link to the third page located in the same subdirectory.
Actual Results:
An Alert message box open with the text:
The file /c:/top/page3.htm cannot be found. Please check the location and try again.

Expected Results:
Page3.htm should have been loaded from c:/top/subdir/ . Instead the browser is looking for the file one level up relative to the original calling page instead of the current calling page.

It should have found Page3.htm in the same directory a Page2.htm.

This only happens with relative path on mapped drives. This is not an issue for relative path on a web server.
