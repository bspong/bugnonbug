Focus is lost on filtering in Cookies/Permissions dialog

These three dialog can't be closed using the Escape key, while all other
preference dialog can. While these are non-modal dialog sporting a Close
button (instead of modal with OK/Cancel), I'd still expect Escape to work since
even Bookmarks/Download/Extension/Themes manager can be closed this way.

Additionaly selecting Clear in the Download actions/Cookies dialog leaf the
focus on the disabled button - which you certainly won't want, if you cleared
the filter using [Alt]+[L] and would like to go on filtering right away.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open e.g. the Cookies dialog (Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> Cookies -> View
Cookies).
2. Filter for "bugzilla" and hit [Alt]+[L]
3. Try to filter for "slashdot", quit your attempt with [Esc]

Actual Results:
You have to hit [Shift]+[Tab] before step 3 (or use the mouse) and the dialog
remains open afterwards - unless you close it with [Ctrl]+[W] (which I'd rather
use for window instead of dialogs), [Alt]+[C], [Alt]+[F4] or using the mouse.

Expected Results:
No further key have to be pressed.

Against the first point, you might argue that these seemingly non-modal dialog
are actually window a are View Source or the DOM Inspector (which are closed
using [Ctrl]+[W]). However, these feature a menu bar and no Close button, which
IMHO is a more intuitive indicator for "window-ness".
