OSX built-in toolbar hiding, which is activated by the "pill button" in the upper right corner of the browser window, force new tab to open only in window with toolbar hiding turned off. For example, opening Google Reader in a separate window and hiding toolbars prevents any link in that window from operating normally. Links clicked in Google Reader should, based on Firefox Preference, open in a new tab in the same window a Google Reader. With Toolbar Hiding turned on, this is not the case. New tab instead open in the earliest open window that ha Toolbar Hiding turned off or otherwise still ha toolbars present. If all window have Toolbar Hiding turned on, then any link that would open a a new tab instead open a a new window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open two window of Firefox.

2. Turn Toolbar hiding ON in one of these window by clicking the "pill button" in the upper right corner of the browser window.

3. In the window with Toolbar Hiding ON, click a link that should open in a new tab.
Actual Results:
Observed the clicked link opening in the window with Toolbar Hiding OFF.

This may also be observed in more than two open windows. In case where all window have Toolbar Hiding turned ON (as in Step 2), Step 3 will result in the following altered result:

Observed the opening of a new window containing the linked page clicked in Step 3.

Expected Results:
The link clicked in Step 3 should have opened a a new tab in the window containing the link, regardless of Toolbar Hiding state.
