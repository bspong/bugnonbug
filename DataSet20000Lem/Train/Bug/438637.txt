When restoring a session with multiple tabs, that in the previous session had differing horizontal scrollbar setting (ex: some far right, some in the middle, etc.), these position are not restored. Instead, all horizontal scroll bar are reset to the far left.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a session with several tabs, and move the horizontal scrollbars at the bottom of each to different positions, zooming in if necessary to create a horizontal scrollbar.
2. Exit Firebox, choosing to save session if that option is offered.
3. Run Firefox once again, choosing "Restore Session" in the initial dialogue.
4. All tabs' horizontal scroll position will have been reset to the left side (default position) of the screen.
Actual Results:
Same a in "Details" description above.

Expected Results:
Just a all zoom setting and vertical positioning for all tab are maintained when saving a session, horizontal position should be maintained a well (ex: for centering text, viewing the desired portion of an image).
