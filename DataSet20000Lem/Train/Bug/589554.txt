Location bar reacts slow to fast typing and skip keystroke

Sometimes the location bar skip keystroke when typing URLs very fast. An example would be if I'm typing "www.dn.se", it sometimes becomes "wwwdn.se" or "ww.dn.se" and similar patterns. It's not sloppy typing from my side and it's seems to happen for any URL pattern.

I can not strictly confirm this yet, but I have a feeling that it's mostly happening after waking up the computer from the screensaver. After a few minute of usage the problem is gone.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Wait until computer activates screensaver
2. Wake up and type URL in location bar very fast
Actual Results:
Some random keystroke are sometimes skipped

Expected Results:
Should not skip keystroke

I didn't see this when running FF 6.3.8 on the same machine, but I had similar, though not identical, issue with the search/google bar where it wa "eating" keystrokes.

Minimizing the window and then going back seems to be a workaround in both cases.

I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 on an HP EliteBook with an Intel I7 and 4GB RAM.
