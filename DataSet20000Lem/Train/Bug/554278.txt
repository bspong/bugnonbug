After closing F I turn off my PC through the Start and so on, after a few sec I get a message "firefox.exe is running, close it and try again" or if I click on a (known) URL inside a mail I get the message "another instance of firefox is running, close it down and try again" I have to go to device manager and from the tab process close firefox. I´ve had this problem for 7 or 8 days.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I close firefox
2.Close down window or click on URL in mailprogram
3.close ff through device manager
Actual Results:
firfox close and I can do my next move

Expected Results:
ff should have been closed

After closing ff there is still activity on my internet connection a few to some hundred B/s are up and downloaded, but I can´t figure out to or from where or wich application is connected. I have Panda internet security 2010 installed and it doesn´t react.
I use teh deault theme
