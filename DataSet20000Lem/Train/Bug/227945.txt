I open the about box because I wa curious. I clicked on the contributers link.
After that I went to amazon.com to look up some stuff. As I wa looking I opened
up tabs. I wanted to minimize Firebird, so I clicked minimize. The tab
minimized, but not Firebird it self. And sitting there in the middle of the
window wa the about box. But when I tried to click the close button, it didn't
close. It made a default sound (ya know, in window XP) everytime I clicked on
it. The tab were minimized on the bottum left of Firebird. There wa a restore
button, a maxamize buton, and a close button. I could restore the tab fine, but
I couldn't minimize Firebird completely. By the way, I've tried to reproduce the
problem, but the abour box won't come up.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the about box by selecting Help > About Mozilla Firebird.
2. Click on the contributor link.
3. Without closing Firebird, type in a website. Open some tab if possible.
4. Attempt to minimize Firebird.By the way, I've tried to reproduce the problem,
but the abour box won't pop up.

Actual Results:
Firebird didn't minimize, only the tab did. You couldn't minimize it.

Expected Results:
I expected Firebird to minimize.

By the way, I've tried to reproduce the problem, but the about box won't come up.
