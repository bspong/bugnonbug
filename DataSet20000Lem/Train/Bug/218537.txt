I am using Mandrake 9.1, with all patch's, Running KDE 3.1.with Kopete version
0.7.0 rpm version for Mandrake. Using the latest Nightly Build of Firebird, have
also tried the milestone release a well. and the problem happens on both..
Problem doesn't happen with the mozilla that come with Mandrake.

When a web link is sent via Kopete instant message clicking on it with a browser
window open or closed will first appear to download the web page then give the
following error message and open a blank page.
error "The File /home/myhomedir/.kde/share/apps/kfmexec/tmp8203.0(this # is
random) can not be found please check the location and try again. After clicking
ok on the message it will open a browser taking you to your home page. Forgive
me if the problem lie else were IE with KDE or Kopete, I am assuming since it
wa working before firebird with mozllia it should be a firebird problem..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start a conversation on Kopete IM, have someone send you a url such a
http://msn.com. and click it. Or send someone else a url and click on the one
you sent.
2.
3.



Expected Results:
Should have opened the link in the current browser window or opened a new one.

If I have left out any information I am sorry please don't hesitate to ask, I
will supply any info needed to see this problem fixed.
