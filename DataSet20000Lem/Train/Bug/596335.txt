Pop-Up blocker not working -- Not allowing a redirection to other page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.9) Gecko/20100824 YFF35 Firefox/3.6.9 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Steps to Reproduce:

When on a web page and selecting a hyperlink that redirects to another page, receiving the Firefox pop-up "Firefox prevented this page from automatically redirecting to another page."

I have cleared cache/cookies and have gone into Internet --> Options --> Content and ensured that the "Block Pop Up Windows" check box is selected. I have also ensured that everything is cleared out of the exception window. I have rebooted my machine, but to no avail.

This is not just happening on a few selected page but on any page where a redirection is trying to take place. I have had payment posting not take place due to this issue.

I wa even having problem with entering this website.

I have also run virus scan on my machine to ensure that I do not have a virus, and the scan came back clean.

This issue started ~ 4-5 day ago -- today is 9/14/10. I hope you will place a priority on this issue. I like Firefox, but will definitely be looking into other browsers.

Thank you very much for your assistance.
