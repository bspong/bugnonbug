Firefox/Minefield 4 beta 10 seems to have trouble with opening local SWF files. Upon attempting to open the file, I receive a download prompt (Open With/Save To...). Attempting to point it back to Minefield result in an infinite loop of the same. The file association is correct, I've tried reinstalling both Flash and Minefield, and the action under Applications is correctly set to "Use Shockwave Flash Plugin (in Minefield)." However, it still refuse to play the file in the browser a it did in previous versions.

Note: SWF file hosted on website (i.e. not file:///) work fine, the problem only occurs with local files. Have tried disabling all add-on to no avail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Simply try to open a .swf file with Firefox 4.0 Beta 10.
Actual Results:
"Opening <file>.swf" window pop up and prompt to open with another program or save the file.

Expected Results:
Should play the file in the browser a it would if the file were hosted on a website.
