After returning from Print Preview, any action that were assigned through event listener no longer respond. For example, clicking link or button that have attached event no longer trigger the events. By contrast, standard link with an href value are followed, and/or code within onclick attribute is executed. It is only attached events, be it to an individual item or to the body, that are ignored. All the attached event work fine prior to Print Preview, and work fine once again after page refresh.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://demo.backbase.com/RSS/
2. Toggle tab ("Live" or "Archive") and Show/Hide Columns to verify that these event respond. Note the time display in the upper-right corner.
3. Enable Print Preview.
4. Exit Print Preview.
5. Attempt to reproduce the previous action (toggle tab and/or Show/Hide Columns).



Actual Results:
They have stopped responding. The time-display in the upper-right corner ha also stopped.
Please Note: This page ha a built-in auto-refresh time interval; after it triggers, the page function once again.

Expected Results:
Attached event should continue to respond after Print Preview.

The page above is merely one public example. Other page not available publicly but all using the same event attachment model are behaving exactly the same.

This bug is NOT present in Firefox 2.
This bug is most likely related to Bug 296288.

There doe not seem to be any possible workaround.

We have been advising all our user to use Firefox, but until this issue is fixed we are sadly unable to continue to do so.
