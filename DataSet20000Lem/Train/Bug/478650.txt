After the Mozilla browser starts, I hear a lot of disk thrashing. When I invoke "Task Manager", the display show high CPU usage for 10+ second and the app is displayed a "firefox". Also, I notice when I start "Task Manager" it seems a though Mozilla "firefox" detects the utility running and stop the disk thrashing. Say after some time > 3 to 5 minutes, the disk thrashing will start again. Task Manager again show high CPU usage. What's happening?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla "firefox" borowser
2. Disk trashing start after some time; maybe 1 to 5 minute
3. Funny thing, I can stop the disk thrashing by starting Task Manager and in a few seconds, the thrashing stops. The high CPU activity is displayed (as "firefox") and then stops, a though the app is looking for Task Manager utility monitor running.
Actual Results:
If I don't start Task Manager the thrashing continues and after a while (say 4 to 7) minute it will stop.

Expected Results:
If I start Task Manager, the thrashing stop after a few seconds.

I don't the software (firefox) should cause constant disk thrashing, because a previous version of firefox didn't display this problem. Something ha happened with later version and updates.
