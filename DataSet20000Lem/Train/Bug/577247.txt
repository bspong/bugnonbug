After viewing a few youtube video and other flash site like hulu.com, firefox.exe becomes very unresponsive and i noticed it us more than 1GB of RAM. Not many tab are open... and only 1 window is open. I have had a many a 60 tab all together in several window open at the same time before, and this never happened before. also, plugin-container.exe cause firefox to become unresponsive a well, a us memory in excess of 60MB which I feel is too much.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. watch a few youtube vids
2. watch a few hulu vids
3. have a few tab open (like around 5)
4. continue browsing normally.... it should lock up and freeze or be really slow
Actual Results:
firefox became slow and used more than 1GB of RAM, plugin-container.exe used more than 60MB of RAM

Expected Results:
firefox.exe should have used around 500MB of RAM like it usually doe and still be very responsive and fast, etc.
