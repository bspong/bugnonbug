Write Source Editor documentation in MDN
Firefox extension are starting to use the Source Editor component even if it lack a public page on MDN with usage example and docs. We should have a page with such information so we can point developer to it.

Sheppy: can you or someone from the MDN doc team please help u with writing the docs? Please let me know of any help you need! You can find the code in browser/devtools/sourceeditor.

You can also find code that us the Source Editor in Scratchpad: browser/devtools/scratchpad (see scratchpad.js and the associated xul file). Style Editor us it in browser/devtools/styleeditor/StyleEditor.jsm and in the associated styleeditor.xul file. Scratchpad code is easier to follow - Style Editor's usage is a bit more advanced and more complex.

Suggestions:
- please mention that source-editor-orion.jsm must not be Cu.import()ed directly. Always do Cu.import() of the source-editor.jsm.

- point out that private method and property of SourceEditor instance are a no-no in term of compatibility with future Firefox versions.

- point out that the API is not yet too stable and that devs should keep an eye on their use of the new Source Editor component.

There should be section for: integration into the XUL file and initialization in the JavaScript, basic api (get/set text, selection and so on), keyboard shortcuts, theming, event and probably more.

Thank you!
