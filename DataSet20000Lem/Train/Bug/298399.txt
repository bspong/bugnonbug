Resizing a page using ctrl+scroll resizes the window's content but leaf the
select tag's right-hand button untouched. The text field in the left hand is
resized, a are other controls. Sometimes it doe resize, but in a glitchy way
(like not every scroll).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page with a select tag (eg.:http://as.switch2hosting.com/firebug.html )
2. With your mouse's scroll wheel, press ctrl and scroll it down.
3. Then keep pressing ctrl and go all the way up.
4. The select button will have changed size but not in the same proportion than
the window, or will have not changed at all.
Actual Results:
The select button did not change.

Expected Results:
The select button should change in the same proportion than all other control
in the page.
