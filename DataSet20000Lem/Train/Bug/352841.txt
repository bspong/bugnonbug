A breadcrumb feature could be nice, possibly by enhancing the Go menu

Some site nowadays include a "breadcrumb trail". This trail consists in an ordered list of the last page visited on the site. It allows a user to easily access previously visited pages, without having to trawl through the browser history.

The Firefox "Go" menu seems to provide similar functionality, though it seems to contain element from all previously visited sites, rather than element only from the current site.

I wa wondering if it could be possible to reproduce the functionality of a "breadcrumb trail" for all websites. This could perhaps be accomplished, for example, by grouping the last visited page of the current website at the top of the Go menu, above a separator.

I'm sorry if I have not properly grasped the way the "Go" menu works, or have committed some other inane stupidity.

Love, Karderio.
