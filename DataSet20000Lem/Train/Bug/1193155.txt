[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Regression since 40.0candidate

+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #1193088 +++

This bug is reproduced with disabled e10s. (about in e10s mode, see Bug 1193088).

If I set the option (Tools -> Options) to open pdf document in the Adobe Acrobat plugin preview (in firefox),
this option becomes only effective after restarting firefox.

Selecting this option without restart result in a download of the pdf file (like selecting the option "safe file")
