Media player in pop-up window ha no volume control (whereas IE 6.0 ha a volume control)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

A medium window launched from Firefox ha an incomplete and non-functional volume control and the mute button is disabled.

This same medium window launched from IE 6.0 ha a complete and functional volume control and mute button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://www.bobrivers.com/
2. Click the "Listen Live" link on the left of the page
3. The next page ha "You have a pop-up blocker enabled" warning and also a "launch the player" link (this must be Firefox(?) a my IE 6.0 automatically skip over this). Click the "launch the player" link.
4. A short ad will come up.
5. After the ad runs, a 'Click to Continue' button come up in the player, click it.
6. Music will start playing in the medium window. There is a slider area for the volume control, but there is no button on the slider to adjust the volume. So there is no way to control the volume. Also the mute button is inoperable.

If this is launched via IE 6.0 there is a button on the volume slider so volume 'can' be controlled. The mute button also works.

Actual Results:
Incomplete and non-functioning volume control. Non-functioning mute button.

Expected Results:
Volume control and mute button should both work (like they do if this is launched via IE 6.0).

I had just installed Firefox so no modifications, themes, etc. were added.

I can reproduce this problem consistently and ran both IE 6.0 and Firefox side by side when running these tests.
