An email hyperlink in firefox doe not open into a new message in tbird. It should place the proper email address in the "to" line and the proper info in the "subject" line. Instead, it just open in the Tbird "in box"; or whatever folder is open. This occurs if T-bird is open or not open. T-bird and Firefox are both set up a my defaults. T-bird version is version 1.5 (20051201). This is a new computer, purchased in the last month. Hyperlinks worked before on old computer when default wa Firefox and Outlook. Posted on forum with about 40 view and not one suggestion. Is this a setting thing or a bug? I searched other post but did not see this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hit hyperlink (email now)
2. End up in t-bird inbox
3.
Actual Results:
End up in In Box

Expected Results:
It should open a new message with the information from the hyperlink inserted into the "TO" and "SUBJECT" line

No crash or messages, it just seems that the hyperlink get me half way to the right thing.
