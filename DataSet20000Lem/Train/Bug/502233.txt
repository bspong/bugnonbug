I think it ha to do with a new way Firefox handle clipboard information,
the way the program work is that you copy a segment text from a website and the program read it to you using the Microsoft text-to-speech engine.

Program is called TTSReader

Program work a usual in Internet explorer and desktop applications, only in the Firefox environment the functionality of reading from clipboard don't work.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open TTSReader.
2.Select read from clipboard option( button on the top)
3. Browse to any webpage can try to copy text, listen to see if the program is reading the text.
Actual Results:
No special step except the three written above, the functionality of the program is very simple, you copy text to the clipboard, the text get read.

Expected Results:
Nothing happened, maybe the text wa copied to the clipboard but the program did not read it.

The text would be read aloud through the speaker


-- in testing the problem all add-on were disable, started in safe mode
result is the same.
