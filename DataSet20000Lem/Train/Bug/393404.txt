firefox dosn't display correctly in 16bit mode

I wa using ff3 alpha pre7 for quite a time, but decided to get pre8. Now, Firefox doesn't render itself nor the page correctly. All I see is white solid rectangular area instead of a page content and a gray panel instead of tabs.

When I scroll the page (using the scrollbar) I 'uncover' the part that were offscreen (often badly damaged anyways). Using mouse wheel to scroll make it even worse. Moving a window over the ff window also make a funny effect of an eraser and reverse-eraser.

The only thing that work seems to be about:*
If I change X color depth to 24 bit everything look and work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Change X depth to 16 bits.
2.Run Firefox.
3.Visit any website.
4a.Scroll the page.
4b.Move a window over the firefox window.
Actual Results:
Visited website doesn't display at all and/or is badly damaged.

Expected Results:
A website.

I use xorg-server 1.3.0 if this may be an issue. Nevertheless the pre7 alpha wa working nicely.

I run xcompmgr a my composite manager, however turning it off didn't help.

I remember this wa an issue a few day ago (maybe a week or two at most) with pre8. I thought it could be a poor build or something so I decided to wait a bit. This didn't get fixed for me, sadly.

I provide 3 screencaps of what it look like:

I'd like to note, that if ff window loses or gain focus page content get redrawed randomly with major or minor damage here and there.
