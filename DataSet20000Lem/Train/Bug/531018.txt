when downloading multiple file simultaneously, and the initial save sialog come up for each file, the first one come up ok, all subsequent come up with the save button grayed/disabled. very consistent behavior.

Reproducible: Always

2.do not click on save button.
3.wait for all download box to come up, and examine them side-by-side.
Actual Results:
it will be necessary to take the remaining dialog and click on one of the other control and then back on the save button. then the save button will be un-grayed.

Expected Results:
enabled save button for each dialog so I can do my work without hindrance.

I believe other bug have been submitted with incorrect information regarding this bug. I did not keep track of which one they were. typically they cite the cause a being due to plugins or something like that. this is not the case with my browser.
The download manager is supposed to handle multiple simultaneous downloads, right? And hopefully seamlessly at that. please fix.
