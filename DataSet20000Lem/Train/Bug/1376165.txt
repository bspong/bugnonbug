It's apparently trying to copy the width of titlebar-buttonbox-container to caption-buttons placeholder (to avoid overlapping button and tab maybe?), but it doesn't look like resulting in expected state, since the titlebar-buttonbox-container and caption-buttons placeholder are not in the same place (see attached screenshot), and that result in unnecessary gap between button and the first tab.

I guess caption-buttons placeholder is supposed to be aligned to the left side of the window, but is not for some reason.

(might be related to bug 1120880 but this also applies to non-devedition)
