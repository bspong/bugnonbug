The Options window ha multiple issue scaling. Maximizing and minimizing
occurs in strange way and the once maximized the window doesn't scale at all.
The window can only be either at it default size, maximized or minimized - it
cannot be scaled to an intermediate size. I suspect the window should not be resizable at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools -> Options
2. Double Click the top-bar on the window to maximize it (like all other
windows) - it will not maximize
3. Right click the top-bar and click maximize - the maximized window will
maximize to take up the entire screen ***including covering the main Windows
bar on the bottom***.
4. Double clicking the top-bar of the maximized Options window will now go back
to it default size.
5. Right click the top-bar and click minimize - sends the
window into the bottom left of the screen just above the start button and
clicking once on it brings up a right click menu.


Expected Results:
The window should not be resizable at all or it should be and basically all of it functionality need to be fixed.
