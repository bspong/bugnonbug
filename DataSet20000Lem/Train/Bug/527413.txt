Firefox crash due to virtual address space shortage. It happens over a longer period of time e.g. 1d even if it use is moderate. The leak of virtual address space ha been observed.

After leaving my firefox session running over a weekend I found it crashed on Monday. It take 1d08h09m, of witch initial 5h wa medium use to up to 10 tabs, while for the rest 43h the PC with the browser wa left alone with the tab opened. The working set (mem usage) at the time of crush wa 1,196,532K (while peak wa 1,349,496K), but eventually the browser run out of virtual address space.
reaching 2,020,612K a reported by process explorer.
Of course it might have been a logic of one of the opened site that cause it to leak, however, it is not a reason to get whole browser crashed in such a case. If this is a case then each tab should be a separate process to allow for use of more resources.
The average CPU usage wa before the creash 3,08% CPU.


Reproducible: Sometimes

2. Wait about 2 day to notice crash due to virtual address space shortage. Or just watch how the virtual address space size grows for at least an hour.

Actual Results:
Virual address space fluctuates and on average grows although the browser.

Expected Results:
Virtual address space fluctuates but stay on average at the same level.

Used Process Explorer to observe virtual size figure of Firefox process.
