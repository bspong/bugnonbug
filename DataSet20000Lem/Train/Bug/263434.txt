If the only window you have open in Firefox is the bookmark manager, then
opening a new browser window can be tricky.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the bookmark manager.
2. Close all other windows.
3. Click in the bookmark manager window (notice the menu bar change to the
bookmark manager context).
4. Try to open a new browser window.
Actual Results:
It's hard. Since the bookmark manager change the menu bar, there is no CMD-N
or File -> New Window. The only two way I've found how to do it are:

1. Close the bookmark manager window and try again.

2. Hit CMD-TAB until you select the super-secret invisible window (see #168692
and #223545), then the menu change back and you can try again.

Expected Results:
You know what? I have no idea. I expected to be able to open a new browser
window, but I haven't the foggiest idea how to be presented with the opportunity
that retains any kind of UI consistency.

It's probably useful to note that workaround #2 (above) is probably no longer
going to work since the super-secret invisible window is no longer accessible.

It may be that the best thing is just to leave the behavior and require that
people close the bookmark manager to open a new browser window. Or perhaps put
a "New Window" command in the bookmark manager's File menu? I dunno. It's late.
My head hurts. :-)
