back-forward-dropmarker wa floating near, but not connected to, the back button after update from fx 2 to 3.0b4

I had a non-default theme installed, Mostly Crystal, most recent version by Cathief.

After update toolbar only had the back button, with the little dropmarker to the right of it, but no bezel around the button to show that it's connected.

Removing the button then adding it again brought up the new button look.

Besides ensuring that the toolbar button come through ok, also recommend that the dropmarker be changed to a stacked left and right arrow

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with Fx 2.most-recent-version and Mostly Crystal theme. Try with and without removing the forward button.
2. Update to Fx 3.0b4
3.
Actual Results:
UI look broken. Not clear what the dropmarker is for, since wa on wrong side to apply to the back button, using old UI conventions.

Expected Results:
UI that doe not look broken.
