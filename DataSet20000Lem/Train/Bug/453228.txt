When try to 1)highlight text on page 2)hold onto scrollbar to move page 3)grab a map to see other part of map (at least at Google maps) 4)depress mouse button and hold anywhere in an open window, then the cursor grab the window and want to move it. In other words, you end up moving the window on your screen, rather than doing one of first 3 option above. (I realize #4 is probably intentional but thought I should include it.)

I don't know anything about theme or many other FireFox option. Bug started after I came in today and agreed to let software do it automatic update thing. Now it's a constant. Are there some pre-sets I could check to see if something's been automatically set incorrectly? I'm running OS 10.5.4, main app's used are Office 2008 (mostly Word, Excel) and FileMaker Pro 9.0 v.3 Recently upgraded to Adobe Reader 9. Otherwise, I don't use anything but iTunes and Dashboard.

Thank you!
