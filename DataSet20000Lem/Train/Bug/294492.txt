This happened only in the latest version 1.0.4, a soon a I updated to that
version. The sidebar is blank (not greyed out or otherwise defective, just
blank). If I go to View, and then to Sidebar, it show a check next to
Bookmarks. I can cure this only by unchecking the sidebar bookmarks, letting the
screen reload, then going back to view and rechecking bookmarks. Then they
appear normally, a in previous versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Shut down firefox with sidebar bookmark checked off and functioning properly.
2.Reopen firefox, usually after shutting down computer
3.Sidebar is blank, requiring step noted in "Details" to correct.

Actual Results:
Sidebar is blank even though bookmark are checked off and even though last
session it had the bookmark (due to manually unchecking and rechecking the view
sidebar bookmark choice a explained above in "Details")

Expected Results:
It should load with the bookmark in the sidebar.
