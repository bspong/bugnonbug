Offer to reset a user's profile if it's gone unused for month
There are probably a lot of user out there who, for various reasons, have since moved from Firefox to another browser. When those user return to Firefox to try out a new release, the Firefox profile is no longer up to date with their contemporary browsing data. Returning the user to that old profile data doesn't make good sense. Also, if the user abandoned Firefox because of some profile instability issue from add-on or other profile hackery, then returning them to that old profile doesn't make good sense.

I believe that Firefox should check at launch and if the profile it's about to use hasn't been touched in more than one month (two?), we should prompt the user with some kind of a "Would you like to reset Firefox to "factory defaults" and/or re-migrate your IE/Chrome/Safari data?" option.

If the profile is really really old, I think we should just do this automatically.

If doing thing automatically is rejected, then I think we should add a button in the advanced prefs that reset Firefox and re-migrates user data from other browsers.

Abandoned Firefox profile are either out dated or broken or both. We should so something to give the user a better returning to Firefox experience.
