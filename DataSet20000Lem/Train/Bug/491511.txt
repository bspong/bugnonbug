Hi,

I believe I have a problem with dodgy caching or remembering of setting. I get the following symptom each time I load FF:

a) FF always load up the same tab I had open previously, even though I do not have this setting activated.
b) FF always performs the default browser check, even though I clear the checkbox each time.
c) with the ForecastFox v10n add-in, it never remembers it's setting for my location, I have to keep selecting them.
d) with the FoxClocks add-in, it never remembers which time zone I have selected and I have to reimport the setting each time.

This happends each time I load FF. Because it affect FF and add-ins, I don't believe it is add-in related. I have tried uninstalling each add-in and then FF and then re-installing them. However this make no difference. Reproducible on demand. Let me know if you'd like a demo of this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Load FireFox.
Actual Results:
I get the following symptom each time I load FF:

a) FF always load up the same tab I had open previously, even though I do not have this setting activated.
b) FF always performs the default browser check, even though I clear the checkbox each time.
c) with the ForecastFox v10n add-in, it never remembers it's setting for my location, I have to keep selecting them.
d) with the FoxClocks add-in, it never remembers which time zone I have selected and I have to reimport the setting each time.

Expected Results:
As used to happen, I'd have expected:

a) it to load with a blank tab,
b) to remember what my default browser setting is,
c) to remember my add-in setting in ForecastFox, and
d) to remember my add-in setting in FoxClocks.

It used to do this.
