Firfox seems unstable on gmail. I downloaded it today on a clean osx install
nearly fresh from apple. It is 10.2.8 I crashed and restarted and had this
bug repro twice. Tired of restarting i forced quit and applied for gmail using
mozilla which worked great. Clicking "learn more" gave a dialog box. I
finished my gmail account applicaiton in mozilla. When that wa done I logged
out and quit and then started firefox. When i hit compose message and then
clicked on "contacts" aka address book. Firefox crashed again. screen shot
taken. Where can i upload the screen shot?? i'm new to bugzilla.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a friend send you a gmail invitation
2. open invite link in firefox
3. go down page to text "learn more" next to secondary email

Actual Results:
Firefox lock up with big spinning rainbow cursor. Waited 10 minute then
forced quit and restarted. Firefox only app running, same crash.

Expected Results:
A dialog box to come up that explains "secondary email". Mozilla allowed me to
finish my gmail account creation.

This is a emac. very little software installed after unboxing. Downloaded
firefox current version today.
