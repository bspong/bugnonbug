Right now, we have two icons: the Web feed icon, and a star.

The Web feed icon is the same, regardless if the user actually subscribed to it.

The star look disabled when the page is not bookmarked, which isn't quite intuitive.

I think, the hole concept of star should be dropped, and use a _bookmark_ icon, instead; since we have _bookmarks_ and not favorites.

I'll explain how it would work, assume 100% opacity and full color when not specified:

The Web feed and bookmark icon would _always_ appear. Their appearance would change with this rules:

If a page doe not offer a Web feed, then the Web feed icon would look disabled, for example: grey scale, 50% opacity.

If a page doe offer a Web feed:

A) If the user ha not subscribed to it yet, the Web feed icon would appear with a plus sign.

B) If the user did subscribe to it, then the Web feed icon appear without a plus sign.

If the page is not bookmarked, a bookmark icon would appear with a plus sign.

If the page is bookmarked, the bookmark icon would appear without a plus sign.

Reproducible: Sometimes
