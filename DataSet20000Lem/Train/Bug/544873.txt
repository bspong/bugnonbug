A program blocking ALL use of my mozilla firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; InfoPath.2; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30618)
Build Identifier: Moxilla Firefox

I've had this problem from the moment I download firefox 3.1. It will open Firefox and within a few minute a new page pop up "ca home office, Your renewal period ha expired". It would only happen about every 15 to 20 minute and I closed the window and it would dissappear. Now, it come up within 30 second and will continue to open continually not letting me do anything retarting itself over & over again and the only way to get it to stop is to go off-line. So if I wanted to download a newer version or something to remove the problem I can't because it won't stop reloading. I don't know what to do, what information to give you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. connect to the internet
2. click on mozilla, page come up with google search a the home page
3. ca home and office your renewal period ha expired pop up and continues to keep loading additional pages. The only way to get it to stop is to disconnect.
Actual Results:
I had to disconnect with internet in order to make the problem stop.

Expected Results:
As long a I'm not connected, the problem doe not exist.

This problem should not happen at all and once Mozilla is brought up it should allow me access to different website sites.
