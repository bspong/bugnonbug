I've written a javascript application which hide and reveals bit and piece of a page sometimes in response to a completed xmlHttpRequest. Your usual stuff. With the default firefox on ubuntu (1.0.7), this all work fine. With 1.5 and 1.5.0.1, I get a lot of "flicker", either the area clear before being repainted, or invisible content appears for a split second.

Now, I might just assume I'm doing something wrong (though it worked before), but this also affect the smooth transition in gmail.com, and, surely, those guy know what they're doing!

Having to absolutely position a whole lot of variable length textual element (or tabular) seems a bit overkill for what used to work fine. Also, it's much nicer to be able to just redraw a table with one new line in it than to process a lot of DOM element and insert a row into a table (if that's even possible).

On the other hand, quicker reflow and redraw is nice too! What a dilemma!

Are you guy going to tell Google to rewrite their app? (That sound nasty, but, really, I don't mean to be!)

Just seems like something's not quite right. Like maybe redraw/reflow should be fast when you're download pages, maybe a bit slower when you're manipulating the dom. Shrug!
