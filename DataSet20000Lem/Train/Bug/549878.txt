Hi all

I have a problem using ASP.NET with Firefox - ever since Firefox version 3.6, I think.

The problem is that sometimes when you post back a page, ASP.NET doesn't realise it's a postback. Obviously given ASP.NET's postback model, this is a big problem for ASP.NET apps. Unfortunately, I don't know how ASP.NET determines whether a page ha been posted back or not.

The problem tends to occur after the page ha not been used for a while - so if I leave my desk and come back five minute later, then click a submit button, I get the problem. Initially I assumed that Firefox wa using GET instead of POST, but Firebug say this is not the case.

I cannot reproduce this problem in any other browser.

Has anyone else had this problem, and can anyone suggest a remedy?

Thanks

David

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find ASP.NET web app, e.g. forums.asp.net
2.Find a page with a form
3.Make a cup of tea
4.Submit the form
Actual Results:
You receive back the 'initial' version of the page, with all form field blank.

Expected Results:
Form submitted and processed in the expected way (e.g. message saying 'your post ha been logged').

This is new in the last month or so, I suspect since Firefox 3.6.

I'm going to save this page before submitting it, a I don't want to lose everything I've just typed.
