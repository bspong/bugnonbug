doe not recognize my log in. I can log in under Explorer Fine. Happened after Upgrade this Morning.

After I upgraded this morning, at your suggestion, I can no longer log into this website. No error message, but it keep giving me log in screen. Administrator at that site tried and he had no problem, so I switched to Internet Explorer and I also had no problem Only when I use Firefox doe this occur. Always have used Firefox to log in to this site, and prefer to use Firefox.(I hate Explorer)As I am on this site frequently, if Firefox's new upgrade cannot handle this website, I will have to change browsers, which I really do NOT want to do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter Email address
2.Enter Password
3.Click LOG IN Button
Actual Results:
Same screen appears..asking for log in information..No error message.

Expected Results:
It should have logged me into the website.

I don't believe there IS any more information. I have "Remember Password" for this site, so wa surprised to even see Log In request. Contacted Site Administrator first via email. Using another browser besides Firefox we are able to get in. I have been using Firefox for years, and it ha always been compatible. It began happening after Firefox update this morning (3/24/10). Please find out what the problem is, so I can come back to using Firefox. I did add a theme, (Bejewled) but I took that down a a first step...too bad I really liked it! I have no problem entering other web sites...just Militarybrats.com
