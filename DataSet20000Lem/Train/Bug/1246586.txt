Steps to reproduce:

browse to youtube.com (re-directs to https://youtube.com). The error shown after clicking the 'Advanced' button show the following information:

www.youtube.com us an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown. The server might not be sending the appropriate intermediate certificates. An additional root certificate may need to be imported. (Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)

I have also noticed this with other major sites, and some sub domain of major sites. Eg, twitter suffers from this too. (The mobile version of Firefox on IPhone/IPad is not afflicted with this issue, it just the desktop version that's having this problem).

I have tried reseting Firefox and removing all addons. This make no difference. I have also read the 'Learn more' article associated with this error and removed the cert8.db file a advised, to no avail.


This is a show stopper for me now, and mean I can no longer for the time being use firefox, so I have had to regretfully move to chrome.


Actual results:

Firefox report 'Your connection is not secure'.


Expected results:

Site should not be blocked.
