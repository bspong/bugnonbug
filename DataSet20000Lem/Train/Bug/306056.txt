The following javascript code, run on a window opened by script, crash Firefox
(tested on Linux and Windows with several releases, including latest nightly
build) :

window.setTimeout("window.close()", 100);
alert('Testcase Message');
window.stop();

Testcase attached.

Marked security to reduce short-term annoyance (it is easy to use script
injection technique to trigger the bug).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://julien.plissonneau.duquene.net/mozilla_crash_testcase_20050826.html
2. click [crash]

Actual Results:
The alert dialog is shown, disappears almost immediately, and Firefox crashes.

Does not crash when any of the three line is commented out.
When removing window.stop(), the window closes, but also remove the alert box
before the user click on OK.

Expected Results:
Keep running.

Wait until the user click "OK" on the alert box (MSIE doe this with similar
code) to close the child window.
