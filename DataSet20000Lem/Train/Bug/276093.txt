Slow form widget rendering - delay when depressing buttons, opening listboxes

Widgets on some form (see example url) render slow. There is noticeable delay
when you open a listbox, depress a button, or click & drag the scrollbar in an
opened listbox (only delay just after a click; is fast in dragging thereafter
until you re-click).

It is interesting to note that when I start Macromedia Dreamweaver MX (whether
before or after I start Firefox), the widget on that page render fast. When I
close Dreamweaver, they revert to slow.

Another site with form that act similarly:
http://www.newegg.com

Sites with fast widget include:
any vBulletin forum form
any phpBB forum form
amazon.com
google
Google Translations (which us unicode like babelfish)
pricegrabber.com

It seems this show up on very few websites. I'll post more a I notice them.
It took me a while to find a second site (newegg) that had the same issue.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to example site
3. Click on form widget
4. Try opening a language listbox, then click and quickly drag the scrollbar.
Actual Results:
Slow widgets, hang/delay (I'd guess 150ms) when depressing button or opening
listboxes, and when scrolling in the listbox (only delay just after clicking
the scrollbar). The scrolling in the listbox delays, then jump to your position.

Expected Results:
Widgets should render a fast a any other standard Windows widgets.
