Data loss issue or wrongly labeled "Delete This Page"

Applies to website with multiple webpages, like webshops.

While browsing through history, I wanted to check every page I visited before on a certain website. However each page's title wa the same. So I wanted to remove the history entry of said website I revisited, so I don't revisit them twice or not at all. The most logical option seemed "Delete This Page". When I did this, the history of all page of that website went missing, and moreover, all evidence that I ever visited the site seems have been removed (cookies, shopping basket contents, closed tabs, etc).

I can't figure out what this action is supposed to do because the general help is unavailable. "Delete This Page" apparently doe the same a "Forget about this site".

So either this 'feature' is gravely mislabeled (starting with the definition of Website and Webpage (see wikipedia if you are not sure)) or it doe all kind of thing it's not supposed to.

2. Browse several of those page (in case of Archonia.com, the search result pages)
3. Go to history and notice several page with the same name.
4. Right-click on a history page and with the intention of removing only that entry from the history, click "Delete This Page".
Actual Results:
All history entry from Archonia.com, all cooky of that site and all closed tab with that page (and maybe more) have been removed.
