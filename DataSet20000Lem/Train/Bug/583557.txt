Whenever I quit Firefox then execute it again, all my cooky appear to be reset. I've checked the option for handling cooky and I've made sure that the browser doe not automatically delete them upon being shut down, however the problem still persists, and I have to log into site once again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox.
2.Login to any site that requires user login.
3.Quit Firefox.
4.Reopen Firefox and go to the site that you are logged in at and check if you are still logged in.
Actual Results:
I wa logged out of any site I wa logged in to.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have kept me logged into the site that I had logged in to, a it had been configured to keep cooky until they expired.
