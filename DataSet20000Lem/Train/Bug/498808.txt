When I loaded the new version my all history, and bookmark disappeared. The history did not begin to fill in even after going to several pages. The history did not fill a I went from location to location.

After several attempt to locate a possible fix for the I also noticed that the back a page button on will not allow you to back up a screen from the tab that you are working in. The only way to go backwards wa to close the tab and reload where I wa going.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
(1) I expected like in the last load that the bookmark would sync.

(2) I would expect to see a history for the day to show with the ability to load a history from another day if needed. the history should fill in like the bookmark upon upgrade of the version like the last version did.

(3) I would expect that if you go from one page to the next that you should be able to use the back screen button after the first page.



(1) I would like to have a button in the bookmark tab that if the bookmark did not load for some reason that there wa a manual sync button.
