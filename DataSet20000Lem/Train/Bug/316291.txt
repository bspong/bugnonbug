Applies to Firefox 1.5 RC1 and RC2. When loading a web page, the status bar progress indicator, throbber and tab title stay active instead of indicating that the page ha loaded. That is to say, the progress indicator retains a bar that look at though it is at about 98% (almost all the way full) and the status bar text stay at "Transferring data from xxx..."; the throbber keep spinning; and the tab title remains a "Loading..."
