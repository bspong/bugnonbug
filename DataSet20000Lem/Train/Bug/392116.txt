Hi everyone!

fx (minefield actually - 3.0a8pre - 2007081305) still ha problem with memory!

After browsing some page (forums mostly) for a while
(didn't use JAVA/Flash or any other plugin that is known to eat up memory nor opened any page with large images),
memory usage jumped up to 120 MB (from 50+ when it started up)

Can I use any tool to wipe out unused memory?
Like a custom garbage collector?
I would like to clean up memory forcibly somehow,
not having to restart fx from time to time,
that's not an acceptable solution to me!

Please collect the 'garbages' guys! Please!
