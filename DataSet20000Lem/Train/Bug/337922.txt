i serve my own r feed so that i can always have my bookmark regardless of the system i'm using that day. for example, this one...

http://vangilpin.net/rss/blog.xml

...simply show link to my favorite blog homepages.

what would be cool is if an RSS feed i serve -- and point to w/ a firefox live bookmark -- could itself point to an RSS feed, which firefox would in turn display in my live bookmark. for example, i'm a miami dolphin fan, so i created a feed to show dolphin news...

http://vangilpin.net/rss/dolphins.xml

...but firefox simply display the XML in my browser, instead of showing link from the feed in my live bookmark.

hopefully i'm describing this well.

thanks & keep up the great work.
