If I set browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to '0', using childwin = window.open(...) in the parent window will create childwin a a new tab in current window. However, I cannot change the focus to childwin by using childwin.focus() in the parent.

If I set browser.link.open_newwindow back to default, childwin will not be created a a tab but a a separate window. However, using childwin.focus() in the parent will bring childwin to the top of the stack.

This seems inconsistent to me, possibly a bug. It seems to me that if you allow focus control of separate popup windows, you should allow it for tabbed windows. The lack of focus control for tab is unnecessarily restrictive for developer if you are allowing it for popup windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.specified above

Actual Results:
specified above

Expected Results:
Should allow focus control through javascript of tabbed windows, a it allows focus control of separate windows.
