Firefox would not open after visiting a certain site
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140314220517

Steps to reproduce:

I upgraded to Firefox 28.0. Later I wa searching for the Internet for a document template to download. I visited several sites, but I believe that the problem wa caused by this site: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDgQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Foffice.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Ftemplates%2Fproject-quality-plan-TC001172501.aspx&ei=JqAqU6-TEIeQrge2rYCYCQ&usg=AFQjCNEzOr0WZ7E9tDF18GGarqyl2YoVTA&sig2=TRUPoVZiURYhRdqbTU_8GA&bvm=bv.62922401,d.bmk.
The document cannot be downloaded without agreeing to allow Microsoft's cookies.


Actual results:

There were no immediate impacts, but once I closed firefox, it could not be reopened: there wa a zombie firefox process. I tried using task manager to terminate the zombie, but firefox still wouldn't open. I tried rebooting, but still had the same problem. I confirmed that there wa no extended screen set-up. I removed firefox (without deleting my existing profile) and reinstalled. The problem persisted.
Eventually I removed firefox, including deleting the profile, and reinstalled. Now everything work (but I have lost my bookmarks, saved passwords, form and search history, and cookies). Clearly something in the profile wa disabling firefox.


Expected results:

Firefox should have continued working normally.
