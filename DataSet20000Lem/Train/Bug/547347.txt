FF 3.6 partial "freeze": "CGWindowContextCreate: failed to create software delegate"

Since updating to 3.6, I am seeing repeated partial "freezes". Symptoms include:
- click on icon in status bar ignored
- opening preference doe not display preference sheet but block further interaction a if the sheet wa displayed
- system.log includes repeated error message "Failed to create window context device" and "CGWindowContextCreate: failed to create software delegate" corresponding to failure to display sheet

It is usually possible to quit normally via the menu. If I haven't tried unsuccessfully to open preferences, I may be able to use toolbar buttons, switch web page etc. a well so this is not a complete freeze.

The only way I've found of restoring normal function is to restart.

console.log show many repeat of error such as:
"2010-02-19 22:36:31.722 firefox-bin[6032] *** _NSAutoreleaseNoPool(): Object 0x23d22c0 of class NSIdEnumerator autoreleased with no pool in place - just leaking

..."
These do not correspond timewise to the partial freeze so perhaps they reflect a different problem but I'm not sure, so include them here in case.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use FF 3.6
2. examine console.log a it fill with error message after error message
3. wait until click on status bar icon are ignored and/or preference sheet fails to display although FF clearly "thinks" it ha displayed (i.e. it wait for it to be dismissed even though this is impossible)
4. examine system.log for corresponding error message regarding preference sheet, if applicable
Actual Results:
a described above

Expected Results:
ff doe not leak
preference sheet display
click on status bar icon are not ignored
