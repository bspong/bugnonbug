Symptoms:

Clicking icon to bring up window cause a window outline to appear for a
moment then blink off. Window blind mode show that the window is
behind the main window. Obscuring the window (with some unrelated
process window) then exposing will reveal the twitter window. Sometimes,
opening another page in another tab on Firefox show the twitter window.
In all cases, bringing the mouse into the twitter window cause the
twitter window to close, and the original Firefox window to open.

This is likely a Firefox bug, because it is similar to another bug with very similar symptom that wa fixed recently. It only happens when the windowmanager is Windowmaker. It doe not happen when the windowmanager is Gnome. (KDE not checked).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click twitterfox icon to pop up window
2. Use window blind mode on Windowmaker to expose window.
3. Bring mouse into popup Window
Actual Results:
Popup window outline will be momentarily visible, then hidden. Popup window is exposed when window is moved or hidden. Popup window close the moment the mouse is moved onto it.

Expected Results:

I think this is a firefox bug given it's strong similarity to another firefox bug that wa fixed. Windowmaker ha never done anything like this before.

(If you do find that it is a Windowmaker bug, please let me know so that I can get them to work on it.)
