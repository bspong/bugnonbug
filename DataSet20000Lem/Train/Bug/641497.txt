Firefox process plugin-container.exe is taking much ammount of memory and keep on growing. The memory expansion is observer to 500MB and above also. After some time then, the Page give error "Flash player plugin ha crashed".



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a page with flash objects(specifically containing an swf file which we use in our product).
2.Observe plugin container process memory usages.
3.Keep page open for some time and play around on the page.
Actual Results:
Plugin-container.exe ha exceptionally huge memory usage (500MB or more).
plugin-container.exe suddenly stops, disappears from process list of task manager and page shown error "Flash player plugin ha been crashed"

Expected Results:
Plugin-container.exe should not consume that much memory and flash player plugin should not crash.

I am not debugging the SWF file. SWF file is light-weight (4kb). Have analyzed the code of the SWF file, and don't think that it ha memory leaks. I have tried the plugin load timeout to set to 500 a well a -1. Still the same behavior is observed.

Problem is intermittent and is affecting the customer from using our product a we are heavily using flash object.
