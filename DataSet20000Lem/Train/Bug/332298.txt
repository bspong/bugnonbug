MozillaZine give some userChrome.css code for moving the tabbar to the left of the window. Very useful for user who keep many tab open.

Unfortunately whilst drag & drop to resort tab work really smoothly on a horizontal tabbar, it get serious redraw flicker and often fails to move the tab when released, on a vertical tabbar.

(Also the "marker" is lost for the move, unlike with a horizontal tabbar)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add the userChrome code from http://kb.mozillazine.org/Move_the_tabbar_(Firefox)
2. Restart FF
3. Load a bunch of tab
4. Try to drag a tab to a different place in the order
5a. Cursor will have serious redraw flicker
5b. tab often will not be moved.
Actual Results:
As above

Expected Results:
Horizontal tabbar is fine. I'd expect equal smoothness for vertical tabbar, ie, the tab moves, an indicator pointing to proposed new location (including scroll up/down at top/bottom if scrollbar-vertical is enabled), the tab always is moved, and no draw flicker.

Presumably this would also affect any other bar drawn vertically rather than horizontally which ha drag & drop capability to reorder the object displayed.
