in google chrome the use can get the "l'm Feeling Lucky" result in the address bar, it's nice but it's also a privacy problem.

in firefox the user can get list of suggestion in the search bar, it's nice but the user need to visit the search page.

peer is also nice, but to complicated not aesthetic and not really useful

the idea with example:
let's say you want to visit mozilla lab website:

1. go to the search bar (google) and type moz, from the suggestion select mozilla then type "l".
2. from the suggestion list select with mouseover mozilla labs.

3. now, the address bar change automatically to "google>l'm Feeling Lucky> labs.mozilla.com".
4. the user click on the "go" button in the address bar.

notes:
a. every time the user search is in google search bar, the address bar will also give a suggestion.
b. every time the user mouseover on suggestion in the search bar, the suggestion in the address bar will also change automatically.
c. to switch between search bar and the address bar the user can use the mouse or the left or right arrows.
