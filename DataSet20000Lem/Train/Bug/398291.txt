The preference dialog box cannot be resized on Windows. I have configured my Windows font (a valid operation) to be smaller for my laptop screen. However, doing so destroys the default formatting of the dialog boxes. Various option are occluded and inaccessible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change the font size in the Appearance Editor (Control Panel->Display Settings->Appearance->Advanced), See additional detail below for my configuration.
2. Launch FireFox/Thunderbird
3. Tools->Options->Main
Actual Results:
"System Defaults" is all I am able to see at the bottom of that dialog box. The problem also extends to other tab a well.

Expected Results:
I should always be able to see and change the preference available.

Theme: Default.

Modified Windows Display Settings (Appearance Font Sizes):
* Active Title Bar: Size 18; Font: Bitstream Vera Sans: Size 8
* Active Window Border: Size 1
* Caption Buttons: Size 18
* Icon: Size 25; Font: Bitstream Vera Sans: Size 8
* Icon Spacing (Horizontal): Size 39
* Icon Spacing (Vertical): Size 41
* Inactive Title Bar: Size 18; Font: Bitstream Vera Sans: Size 8
* Inactive Window Border: Size 1
* Menu: Size 18; Font: Bitstream Vera Sans: Size 7
* Message Box; Font: Bitstream Vera Sans: Size 7
* Palette Title: Size 15; Font: Bitstream Vera Sans: Size 8 (BOLD)
* Scrollbar: Size 16
* Selected Items: Size 18; Font: Bitstream Vera Sans: Size 7
* ToolTip; Font: Bitstream Vera Sans: Size 8

This problem can be mitigated by having the ability to resize the window: however, the window size should conform to the data contained within it, or, le optimally, provide a scroll bar to access the dialog overflow.
