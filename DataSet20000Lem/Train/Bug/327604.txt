Status bar message text persists when switching tab while page is loading
This bug ha been opened because bug 104532 wa closed due to a fix in SeaMonkey. The problem persists in Firefox, however. There are many Firefox dupe to that bug, but it's ultimately easier to just open a fresh bug report...

Essentially, the text on the left hand side of the status bar, which is presented during page loading, persists when you switch to another tab.

The status bar in the second tab will not be updated by any further change in the status of the original tab, however. The status bar text can only be changed by switching to a tab in which a page is loading (including the original) and waiting for the the status message to update. A side-effect of this is that if the original page finish loading while you're in another tab, and you don't load any new pages, then the status message remains in all tab indefinitely.

To reproduce, open at least two tabs. Start loading http://www.mozilla.org in one. Before the page can finish loading, switch to another tab. Check the status bar. It should say something akin to "Transferring data from www.mozilla.org...", even though it's not relevant to the current tab. Note that this text remains static unless you switch back to the first tab and receive a new status update, or you start loading a page in the new tab.

Repeat the above, and wait until the Mozilla page ha fully loaded before switching back to it. Note that the status message now remains for all tabs, including new one you open, unless you start to load a new page.
