Images displayed a broken
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040219 Firefox/0.8.0+

firefox wont display many of image even with reloading. you can use the view
option in right click to view broken image then the back button and it will
load that one image only. Also on this page
http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail.php3?fid=1028299275
the image of url http://fileforum.betanews.com/screenshots/1028299275.jpg
show up a broken. Both these page load fine using netscape 7.02
(Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.0.2) Gecko/20030208 Netscape/7.02)
which is my current everyday browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.used bookmark to go to page which didn't load images, tried reloading with
no luck
2.tried viewing image on iexbeta... most would load after using back function
on the betanews page I could get the large jpg to load by clicking on it or
viewing taking it to a seperate or next page but going back/reloading original
page still showed broken image.
3.tried same page using my netscape 7.02 browser, which I have been visiting
both site for over a year with no problems... both come up with no image
missing on it using same internet connection at same login session.



Expected Results:
software should have loaded iexbeta site image properly and
should have loaded the image (large) at a smaller size like many
of the screenshots on the betanews site load.
