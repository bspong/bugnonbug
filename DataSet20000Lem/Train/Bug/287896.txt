multiple instance of FX should be able to use different profile
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-AU; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-AU; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

My requirement is that I want to run two or more concurrent instance of FX on
the same machine with DIFFERENT profiles. If I have one instance running with
my default profile I often want to be able to run another instance with another
profile, typically a vanilla profile or a profile which ha just one extension
that I want to try in a "sterile" environment. I want to be able to switch back
and forth between these different instance to study FX's behaviour perhaps
before reporting a bug in the CORE when it is actually in an extension.

Currently under v1.0.2 when I start the first instance of FX I am presented with
the "which profile" dialogue, if I start another instance of FX I am NOT
presented with the "which profile" dialogue and all nth instance use the same
profile a that chosen in the first instance. Basically I want all instance of
FX to give me the "which profile" dialogue.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. establish mutiple profile
2. start FX selecting say default profile
3. start another instance of FX, note you are not asked to select a profile

Actual Results:
FX start with the profile selected in the first instance, which given that it
did not ask in the second instance is a reasonable thing to do.

Expected Results:
asked whch profile on the 2nd instance.
