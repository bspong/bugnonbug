I can use yahoo -or the web in general- for hours, or day (off and on - leaving mail active) with no problem. then at some point I try to navigate within yahoo or access another site in a new window, or anything at all - and I can just no longer navigate. within yahoo, the little circle (sorry I don't know the terms) go around forever but the menu option or item I selected never come up. When trying to access another site on the web, i get a blank white page, circle go forever, no message come up. If i then close mozilla and try to open it again, I get the message:"Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system." I have to go to task manager to discontinue the .exe process or logout and back in (related to bug#239223). I've been unable to identify a consistent action that result in this problem. I've always had yahoo mail active, but don't know if that is a requirement for duplication. I've only had this problem since the last update (version 3.0.6) Sessions cannot be restored so any work in progress would be lost.
