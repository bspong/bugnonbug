Firebird (gtk2 build) loses keyboard focus when going back and forth between virtual desktop
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030812 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1+

This bug is similar to #209856, but for me this only happens with Firebird gtk2
build and never with gtk1 builds, be it Mozilla or Firebird.

FB sometimes loses focus sometimes to the effect that you cannot type anything,
either in form or location field or search field. You might see a cursor but
nothing happens when you type. Fiddling about (opening bogus url by pasting
whatever into the browser window, minimizing mozilla, opening closing tabs)
mostly works, but I cannot predictable restore focus. I cannot tell what will
and will not work. Minimizing-reopening seems to work best.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open mozilla firebird gtk2 build (I use a nightly build from 2003-08-12)
2. Start typing in the location field
3. Switch to another virtual desktop and back again
4. Continue typing
Actual Results:
Nothing happens. No text appears, even after explicitly clicking in the location
field, trying to put the cursor where it should be.

Expected Results:
More text should appear where I left off.

I use Linux 2.4.20 and glibc-2.3.2 (slackware 9.0 + dropline gnome installed)
and ctwm 3.6, but can reproduce this in dropline gnome and metacity so I don't
think it's a window manager problem. I cannot reproduce this with for instance
gnumeric, which is another gtk2 app. I have XFree86 4.3.

While filling out this bug report FB lost focus when scrolling the page using
the scroll bar. Minimizing the window and opening it again set FB straight however.

Something is seriously weird.
