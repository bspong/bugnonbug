Investigate DevTools XPCShell test collision on B2G Emulator Debug
In bug 912121, I am moving all DevTools file up to a top-level /devtools directory.

This ha led to the following situation for XPCShell on B2G Emulator ICS debug:

# Overview

* Emulator debug XPCShell test are split into 4 chunk
* Tests are sorted alphabetically by source tree path before dividing into chunk

# Current State (before bug 912121 changes)

* Example run: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=fx-team&revision=30fffdc35b41&filter-searchStr=ics%20xpcshell
* Chunk 1 start the RIL test up to test_ril_worker_cw.js, then the chunk end
* Chunk 2 run the remaining RIL test

# Future State (after bug 912121 changes)

* Example run: https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=052b34bc7034&filter-searchStr=ics%20xpcshell
* All DevTools test are now before RIL in alphabetic sort
* Chunk 1 start the RIL test up to test_ril_worker_icc_ICCPDUHelper.js, then the chunk end
* Chunk 2 try to run remaining RIL tests, but test_ril_worker_cellbroadcast.js now permafails
* Bug 912121 caused 16 RIL test to move from chunk 1 to chunk 2

# Solutions

I tried disabling the RIL tests, but other test continue to permafail in chunk 2. In order to land bug 912121 for now, I have disabled the following directory on Gonk:

devtools/shared/apps
devtools/shared/qrcode
devtools/shared/security
devtools/shared/shared
devtools/shared/sourcemap

We should investigate a better solution so we can re-enable the DevTools test here.
