I have been using Mozilla for some time without any problems. I decided to try
firefox. The browser itself is fine. Printing work so long a the website doe
not have any graphic pictures. The above url is just one example. First, I get a
pop up that say PRINTING, Title: ta040930.gif (GIF Image, 500x348 pixels),
followed by a PROGRESS: bar, that eventually go to 100%. Then, another window
pop up that say PRINTER ERROR, Printing failed when completing the page. I
click OK on that second pop up and both then disappear. Nothing prints. I opened
up the printer box to see what wa going on when I repeated this, and it showed
that the file wa spooling. I am printing to an HP Laserjet 4 plus. I have no
problem doing this with any other browser, including Mozilla 1.7.3.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. See detail above.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Error. See detail above.

Expected Results:
Printed the page.

Not sure if this is related to an existing bug report I found during my search
that appears to be about Mozilla, not Firefox. The number wa 77155.
