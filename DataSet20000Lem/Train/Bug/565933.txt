When I click a link on the popular news aggregator Drudgereport.com, often the server hosting the linked page become overloaded due to the increased traffic coming from Drudge. When a page is taking too long to load, I will give up and hit the Stop button. However, more often than not, hitting the Stop button cause the browser to jump to a blank or partially loaded page, and then it stop loading that page. When I hit Stop, I want it to stop where it is.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to drudgereport.com
2. Click link till you find one that take more than 15 sec. to load.
3. Hit the "Stop loading this page" [x] button.
Actual Results:
Instead of stopping, the browser jumped to a blank or partially loaded page and then stopped loading that page.

Expected Results:
It should have stopped attempting to load the new page and stayed on the Drudgereport page.

This is a small problem, but it is really irritating, and it seems like it should be fairly simple to fix.
