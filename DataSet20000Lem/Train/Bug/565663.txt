I have membership to a site where the file are on a separate server and requires logging in.

When you right-click, save-as the file, the user/pass prompt come up, but click OK and Nothing happens. This is always true.

If you then proceed to left-click a different file, the user/pass prompt come up, click OK, and work fine. BUT, the request for the first file still seems to be lost in some infinite redirect loop a you cannot left-click the first file, nothing will happen.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right-Click Save-As any file that is in a password protected area BEFORE logging in to that area through any other means.
2. Click ok on the prompt
3.
Actual Results:
Nothing. That link is remembered and cannot be left-clicked or right-clicked for results, even if you proceed to authenticate your session to the password protected area from somewhere else. You must clear all active session and start over.

Expected Results:
Logged In successfully, then produced the save-as dialogue box for the file.
