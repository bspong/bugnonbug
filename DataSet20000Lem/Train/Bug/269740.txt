I had Acrobat 6.0 installed on my PC with Windows 98 OS. I wa using a preview
release of firefox which worked fine. Iu chose the upgrade tab in the browser
and upgraded to Firefox 1.0. Since then, whenever I click on a pdf link on a
website, a new browser window open and say Done in the taskbar. But the file
doe not open and I do not get the option to save to disk either. Acrobat is not
launched. The pdf plug-in is installed in the browser. I tried again after
installing Acrobat Reader 5.0.5 but it still doe not work. At the same time,
Internet Explorer wa able to open the pdf files. So the error seems not to be a
part of my software / hardware.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a pdf link on any website
2.
3.

Actual Results:
A new browser window open and the taskbar say Done. Nothing happens after that.

Expected Results:
Either opened the pdf file or offered to download it to the disk.

Things worked fine when I wa using the preview version of Firefox. Problems
started only when I upgraded to Firefox 1.0
