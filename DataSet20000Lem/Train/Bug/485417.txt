To start Mozilla Firefox even several hour after previous session, I need to reboot my computer
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.7) Gecko/2009021910 Firefox/3.0.7

Even after several hour after my session in Mozilla Firefox ended, it will not start again unless I reboot my computer. If I press ctrl+alt+delete and check for processes, it show an "idle process" that cannot be stopped. While rebooting the computer, I get a message from Firefox asking if I want to save a previous session. When I log in after my computer is back on, Mozilla display the last session that I had before the idle trial.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log off session in Mozilla Firefox.
2.Wait for some time.
3.Try to log on again
4.The web page doesn't appear
5.Processes show an idle process that cannot be stopped
6.Reboot the computer
7.Log on to Mozilla Firefox.
Actual Results:
I wa able to log on Mozilla Firefox, i.e. to see a web page where all the tab from the last successful session were in place

Expected Results:
It should load the home page without me rebooting my computer

It started happening approximately three day ago. Before it worked just fine so I don't think it can be related to my computer.
