When loading link from search result in history sidebar or in library, the selection doesn't stay in sync with the last loaded item when the list of search result is repopulated. This lead to a weird effect in history sidebar, that the selection move to the next item in the list couple of second after a link from search result wa loaded. When the last item in the list is clicked, the selection go one item back. Sorting doesn't matter.

This behavior wa introduced between 2010-06-04 and 2010-06-08. Maybe related to Bug 549192?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.mozilla.org/
2. go to http://planet.mozilla.org/
3. go to https://wiki.mozilla.org/
4. open history sidebar, search for "mozilla"
5. click the link to http://www.mozilla.org/ in the sidebar
6. click the last link in the list

Actual Results:
Directly after Step 5 the item "Mozilla.org - Home of the Mozilla Project" is selected in the history sidebar. Few second (3-4) later the selection move to the next item in the list.

The behavior after Step 6 is similar to Step 5 except of the selection moving to the previous in the display order item.


Expected Results:
The selection in the history sidebar after Step 5 stay at "Mozilla.org - Home of the Mozilla Project" and after Step 6 at the last item in the list a long a no other page is loaded or until moved by user.


The library behaves visually slightly different a the search result are automatically refreshed but the selection stay at it's position.
