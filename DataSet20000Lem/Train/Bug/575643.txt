Nightlies for last ~ 4 day show nothing where menu, toolbar, tab bar, and status bar should be.

For the last 4 or 5 nighlies, the menu bar, toolbar, tab bar, and status bar all come up blank, making the browser unusable. The content area seems to be fine. The previous nightly work fine, so I've been re-installing it after checking the nightlies. I figured it would be an obvious, major bug that someone would have noticed and corrected by now, but I can't find it, so I'm reporting it myself.

Reproducible: Always




I did reset the mozilla.widget.render-mode back to -1 and gfx.font_rendering.directwrite.enabled back to False, but to no avail. Also, I only have the AdBlock extension installed and enabled.

Also, since I have a loathing for Aero Glass that cannot be described in words, I am using a different FireFox theme (Smooth Blue) to give me a nice, solid background like the good old days. I tried reverting to the default theme also, to make sure this wasn't the problem.
