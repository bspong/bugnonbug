On any page I go to, tested on multiple machines, if the page take more than 8-10 second to load all the image it simply stop the loading process. The throbber continues, FasterFox if installed continues to count, however image are left either broken or with a place holder "trying" to load. Right clicking on any image and choosing "view image" then hitting back will load more image but again if that take more than 8-10 second it will "forget" again. Many page take 2-4 tries. Note: I suspected our wireless broadband connection might be confusing it however I have tested in IE and Opera a well they have no issue with this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site (ie: worldofwarcraft.com)
2. Wait 8-10 second for image to load.
3. Observe image that do not load.

Actual Results:
Some image displayed, others were left with placeholder/broken and throbber continued on.

Expected Results:
All image display regardless of how long it take to download them, throbber stop onload.

Done with clean install of latest FF build, using a local router & WAP behind a moterola wireless canopy system for broadband internet access.
