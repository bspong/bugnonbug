In attempt to access BankOfAmerica "ShopSave" in which one creates a one vendor use credit card number linked to your actual credit account (whithout revealing the actual cc number), the message something to the extent of: you have flash player "1.Nan" (quotes are mine) and you require flash player 6.4 or later. Have installed flash player 10.0 r12 to no effect. Result same with both 3.0.4, 3.0.5, and 3.1 beta 1, however mysteriously seems to work fine with MS Internet Explorer and previous version of Firefox.
Thanx....Marshall

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Firefox
2.Log into account at http://www.bankofamerica.com
3.Click on existing account number and click on "Shop Safe", then click on "Show existing numbers", this will cause the warning box to appear, obscuring most of the information in the display box
Actual Results:
Unable to view data in text box due to overlay of error message.

Expected Results:
Ability to observe correct data. There wa some indication that there were actual additional credit card number created, although there wa no explicit intention to do so. (I subsequently erased them since MSIE seemed to work OK although I rarely use it).

Display information correctly without overlaying it with an obviously erroneous software version number "1.NaN", which is apparently being interpreted a "Not a Number".

If there is an easy fix I cannot classify it due to my not having familiarity with the code, so the answer I give below is pretty much meaningless. Since the "workaround" is to use MSIE, (which I prefer not to do), I would class this a a bug that should be fixed.
Thanx......Marshall Lajoie
