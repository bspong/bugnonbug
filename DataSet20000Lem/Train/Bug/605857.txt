I clicked on a link to a HuffPost article from my about page with the Mac OS 'Command' button pressed to trigger a new tab.

While the Huffington Post page is loading I tried to go back and close the tab containing my site using the 'Command-W' key. When I do this it open another tab for the Huffington Post and my site's tab remains open. This happens even if I close all the Huffington post tabs.

Pressing the 'X' on the tab to close it work fine.

My site is done in PHP using frame containing some iWeb and other content. I track my site with Google Analytics. The also work with my Contact page at: http://cliffcheney.com/index.php?c=contact

I reported this a a FF bug rather than a website bug since the behavior differs based on how I issue the close command to FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://cliffcheney.com/index.php?c=contact
2. Open one of the link a new tab with right-click menu of holding Mac 'Command' key.
3. Switch back to tab with http://cliffcheney.com/index.php?c=contact and try to close using 'Command-W' key.
Actual Results:
Intended new tab is duplicated and parent tab (http://cliffcheney.com/index.php?c=contact) persists when attempting to close it with 'Command-W' key. This can be repeatd many time to result in many new duplicate tabs.

Expected Results:
Parent tab should have closed a occurs when the 'X' on the tab is pressed. No duplicate tab should have been created.
