JavaScript document.images[].src method fails on first use

Steps to reproduce:

Dear Firefox team,

I have detected a bug in updating image via JavaScript in Firefox 48.02 under Windows 8.1 with Bing running on a Toshiba Satellite C55-B laptop. My test URL is:

http://livingrussian.com/beginners-russian/firefoxproblem/type-numbers.html

To observe the bug:
1. Open Firefox to any page.
2. Open the URL I mentioned in a second tab.
3. Type '1' (without the single quotes) in the first text box and press TAB.
4. A green checkmark should appear to the left, and the '5' should be replaced by a bold 5 with yellow background. The latter happens; the checkmark doe not appear.
5. Type '2' in the second text box. I get expected behavior.
6. Click on the other tab. Then return to the first tab. The green checkmark is now visible on the first line.

Summary: essentially an image fails to update when javascript first attempt to change the image. This did not occur in previous version of firefox over the last five years.

Running on the same laptop this issue never appears under Internet Explorer version 11.0.9600.18205 with update version 11.02.08. It also doe not appear on the same laptop under Chrome version 52.0.2743.116. I have found the same error on Firefox under Mac OS X. It doe not occur under Chrome on the Mac OS X.

All the best, Don Livingston.
