Right click expose wrong menu -- text box

Steps to reproduce:

Using 35.0.1

I right click on a text box, after copying text in another location, and instead of the expected menu, the one that show up is the basic page menu (with left, right arrow at top, the reload every, and so on, down through the various native Fox item and the add-on relevant.



Expected results:

Opened a menu that included text box relevant item including undo and paste and etc.

Note, while the paste item wa missing, the ctrl-v paste did work

I'll note that in other places, ie, not necessarily inside the text boxes, the wrong item opens. At the moment, the URLs and menu expected/shown, are not recalled; but this make me wonder if there wa some meandering in the code, generally, relating to the exposure of drop downs, and the menu and situation aren't coded properly all over. Might could be a review is necessary?

I discount that some novel use by web operator is obfuscating the page's content under the mouse icon, but this appears now/then on different sites. I note that the cause for reporting this problem still exists, even though bugzilla's text box behave,
