I'm using Firefox 3.0.3 on an oldie-but-solid 450MHz Dell PC running Windows2000. I access the CPU's Win2K percentage-usage window routinely. I get national/political news from The Washington Post website, although I am across the country in metro Seattle. After navigating around the WaPo website for an hour or two, my PC lock up and the usage screen show that Firefox is taking 95% to 98% of the available CPU cycle and 120 mbytes of sream (versus 70 mbytes when I first start Firefox up). Closing and then reopening Firefox sometimes suffices to restore reasonable navigation, but not always — so I need several reboots every day. I did not have this problem with early version of Firefox 2, although I began to have it with later Firefox 2 version before upgrading to Firefox 3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reboot and launch Win2K and Firefox 3.
2. Access http://www.washingtonpost.com/
3. Navigate through a couple of lengthy story having 3, 4, or 5 parts.
Actual Results:
See above.

Expected Results:
Not locked up. Not taken over my PC's cycle completely, nor bloated it sram usage.

I have had this lockup problem when accessing other website besides WaPo, but le frequently.
