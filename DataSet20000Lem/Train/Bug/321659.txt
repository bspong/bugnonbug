Earlier version of Firfox (I am now using 1.5) had a problem with printer printerfriendly page from the washington Times. That wa fixed. But now a of a couple of day ago it will not load www.washtimes.com Only text come up with no graphics. Other problem site where graphic do not show in Firefox but do in Safari: - Ace Hardware - www.acehardware.com Washington Times: www.washtimes.com - http://www.thebabylukas.blogspot.com/

There are several others site that also will not load graphics. Used to be OK but not now.

There are also many problem with print from the Charles Schwab web site. I have talked with them and not sure whose problem it is but the mutual fund list for one will not print from Firefox.

I like Firefox but there are problmes.
