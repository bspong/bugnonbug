A simple search showed that contracted form of I am/have are preferred, so I did a list of the occurrence that should be replaced:

I am instead of I'm:

chrome/en-US/locale/browser/help/prefs.xhtml:
<dt>I am about to view an encrypted page</dt>

chrome/en-US/locale/browser/help/prefs.xhtml:
<dt>I am about to view a page that us low-grade encryption</dt>

chrome/en-US/locale/browser/preferences/securityWarnings.dtd:
<!ENTITY security.warn_entering_secure.label "I am about to view an encrypted page.">

chrome/en-US/locale/browser/preferences/securityWarnings.dtd:
<!ENTITY security.warn_entering_weak.label "I am about to view a page that us low-grade encryption.">

chrome/en-US/locale/en-US/pipnss/security.properties:
EnterSecureShowAgain=Alert me whenever I am about to view an encrypted page.

chrome/en-US/locale/en-US/pipnss/security.properties:
WeakSecureShowAgain=Alert me whenever I am about to view a page that us low-grade encryption.

I have instead of I've:

chrome/en-US/locale/en-US/reporter/reportWizard.dtd:<!ENTITY dontShowPrivacyStatement.label "I have read and accept the above privacy policy.">

Reproducible: Always
