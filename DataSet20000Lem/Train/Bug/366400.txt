This morning I noticed my grapics for "post a new topic" the button had been replaced with a graphic someone wa using for an avatar. I went to the exact address of the graphic and it still showed the graphic being wrong. I checked on IE and everything wa normal. I reloaded the graphic from my local file and it solved the problem. This wa using phpbb software.

later tonight I had the same problem on someone el forum which us v-bulletin software. The link I left above is where Im gettin the problem, it ha replaced the "quick reply to this message" button a a huge picture someone wa using on the forum. It look normal on IE

I love firefox, a FIRM believer in it, and tell everybody to use it. I just upgraded to 2.0.0.1 last night, and Ive never seen anything like this happen until tonight

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Posted a message on the forum
2. everytime I go there now the problem is there
Actual Results:
I goto the link even after I have closed and restarted firefox, and the "quick reply to this message" button is replaced with a 500x100 picture someone is using on the forum is in place of the button on any thread I goto on the forum.

Expected Results:
the graphic from the forum software should display.

using basic theme, no other program running at the time. After I upgraded to the new version I had never had this problem. I did however install the status bar calculator 1.0 last night, but didnt notice any problem until today.
