Once www.cisco.com start loading all Firefox window become unresponsive, sometimes the firefox icon on the taskbar even dissappears, although you can still ALT-TAB to it (although it show a blank firefox window then).
8/10 time response eventually come back after 2min+ after www.cisco.com ha finished loading, sometimes it completely crash and have to end-task it.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new window and go to www.google.com
2. Open a second window and go to www.cisco.com
3. See what happens, all open firefox windows/tabs become unresponsive for the complete duration of cisco.com load, or sometimes completely lock up and only a END-TASK operation give back control.

Actual Results:
All Firefox window and tab become unresponsive, sometimes the firefox icon on die Windows taskbar dissapear.

Expected Results:
I expect any other Firefox window not to lock up when accessing a problematic site on another firefox window/tab.
