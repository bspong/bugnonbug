Screenshot of same page NOT displaying properly in Firefox

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Build ID: 20121024073032

Steps to reproduce:

Not sure what put FF16 into this mode. But the problem occurs when a page is loaded.


Actual results:

Some website don't load their CSS file (i.e. the page is devoid of any formatting information and thus is displayed a a long series of unformatted object (see screen shots). The same page display fine in Chrome and IE. I used Firebug to inspect the loaded code and verified that one of the CSS file in a <link> tag failed to load. Oddly, the following <link> WAS able to load the CSS file. Both <link> command contain relative path (like "/css/global.css"), so a an experiment, I edited the path into an absolute path (like "http://www.somedomain.com/css/global.css") whereupon the page displayed properly.

So, apparently FireFox is having an intermittent problem traversing relative path (and apparently this corrects itself after the first instance.

Also, this doesn't happen on all page (for instance, this Bugzilla page is displaying properly).


Expected results:

The page should display with full formatting in place (like it doe in Chrome or IE).
