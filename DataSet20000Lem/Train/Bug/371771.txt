When user ha 2 profile with different proxy setting "Don't use proxy for" setting always reseted to "localhost, 127.0.0.1" after switching between profiles. For example I have 2 profiles. First "Home" without proxy and second "Work" with proxy and specific setting at "Don't use proxy for" field, for example .yourcompany.com. When I switch from "Work" to "Home" and back to "Work" then "Don't use proxy for" field doesn't contain my specific setting but only "localhost, 127.0.0.1". I put it back, switch twice and this field again is "localhost, 127.0.0.1".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use firefox.exe -profilemanager for loading Firefox 2.
2. Clear checkbox "Don't ask at startup" for enable ability choosing profile every start of Firefox.
3. Create 2 profiles: one without proxy, second with some kind of proxy and put something additional to "Don't use proxy for" field.
4. Close Firefox
5. Open Firefox with first profile without proxy
6. Close Firefox
7. Open Firefox with second profile with proxy
8. Read field "Don't use proxy for" - it contains only "localhost, 127.0.0.1" value without your data.
Actual Results:
"Don't use proxy for "Don't use proxy for" field contains only "localhost, 127.0.0.1"

Expected Results:
"Don't use proxy for "Don't use proxy for" field must contain "localhost, 127.0.0.1, .yourcompany.com"

Please fix this bug. I am tired of adding my setting every day to this field.
