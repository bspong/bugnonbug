In my bookmark menu I've separated group of subdirectory with separators. I
tried to move one of them and got an empty bookmark where it should have been
moved to. The separator remained in it original place.

I thought this wa weird, but I didn't bother much at the time and went on with
my life. However, since that time I've seen it more time and I thought it wa
time to report it even though I can't always reproduce it.

I'm going to attach a screenshot to this bug...

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just start with your own set of bookmark and make sure you have separator
in the menu.
2. Try to drag a separator.
3. I dragged it upwards, between two folder for example. Try that if you can't
reproduce it, I guess.

Actual Results:
The bookmark menu closed a soon a I had dragged the separator, and when I
opened it again, in the place where the separator should now be, wa an empty
bookmark with a standard blank icon. See screenshot.

The separator stayed in it original place and stay there even after I delete
the weird empty bookmark.

When I right-click the "dummy", I get the normal

Expected Results:
The separator should have moved to it new position and not have stayed in it
original position.

No "dummy" - weird empty bookmark entry - should have been created.

I can delete the "dummy" - sometimes that's fine, and then maybe I can move the
separator if I try again or move it to another place, but sometimes it happens
again. I can't figure out what the behaviour is caused by.
