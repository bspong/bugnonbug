Hello,

In 2 year + of using Firefox I've never had major issue with it, and it been a refreshingly smooth ride after long experience with the many hazard of IE.

However, recently after updating to the latest v. I've had pretty much the worst browser experience of my life, which ha made using the program not just aggravating, but pretty much unusable. Apparently it all down to 'plugin-container.exe'; FF continually crashes, and a box pop up naming this process a the culprit. Often the entire system need a reboot to get back to normality.

The workarounds here dont work for me:

In my exasperation with it, I've reinstalled an old version (3.5.2), but this is hardly ideal, seeing how a main part of new version is to fix security holes.

Would appreciate some assistance on this.

Sincerely,

Kay
