After viewing the source, it appears that adding two entry for the same search engine on a page (for 'discovering the engine') using <link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml"> will cause duplicate entry to appear in the add search engine drop-down menu.
Firefox should detect that they are the same, and only show one entry. (Confusing otherwise.)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make sure Mozilla Links search is not installed
2.Visit http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2008/02/a-deep-look-to-firefox-3-beta-3/
3.Click search drop-down to see search engine available
Actual Results:
Notice two entry for same url. (Same title, and hover text show same url)

Expected Results:
One engine (if really the same) or some indicator that they are actually different.

The referenced site has:
<link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" title="Mozilla Links" href="http://www.mozillalinks.org/download/mozillalinks.xml">


<link rel="search" type="application/opensearchdescription+xml" title="Mozilla Links" href="http://www.mozillalinks.org/download/mozillalinks.xml">

As the code that produce teh duplicate entries. Note that both entry are exactly the same.
