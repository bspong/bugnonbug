firefox (0.8 -> 0.92) hang on startup after hour of system-idle
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de-DE; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

After hour of idle time (about 8-12) firefox is started a first application
and nothing happens.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. do not turn of your computer
2. come back home after x-hours and run firefox a first application
3. usually not more needed
Actual Results:
The taskmanager report firefox is running a process (not a application),
consuming 1,4MB main-memory. First the explorer hang up, then (when started)
any other application, too. Only a restart is possible using the task-manager
(runs in several instances), trying to load another user-profile cause a
complete system hang up. I´m using firefox since v0.8, first the english one,
then the german, i updated to the english 0.92 and to the german one. I got this
"bug" on two complete different system ONLY when they were running 24h/day.

Expected Results:
Firefox should start a expected, but just didn´t.

The application-logs just report "firefox cannot be started, DLL initialising
failed". Dr.Watson dy with any other application and report nothing, in fact
no monitoring software we tried report anything. The problem wa detected on
two complete different system using W2K build 2195 Sp4 ONLY when running
24h/day, 7day/week. In fact we checked this on 28 other system NOT running
24h/day and we never got this error. The reprodrucity-rate of this "bug" should
be more than 50%. It´s a nice one, we are working on it about 6 months.
