Hello,

I'm downloading file into a directory named "downloads". This directory is shared on my home network (users=everyone, full control). when I go over to another computer to try to access these file I get an "access denied" file may be in use or "cannot access read only file" (they are not set a read only). I can access the file on the computer I downloaded it onto but not on any network computer. If I delete the file downloaded with Firefox and download with IE7 I don't have the problem. If I move the file to a different shared directory I can access them from the other network computers. Firefox is not running when i get "access denied".

Using Xp home w/ SP3 on a Lenovo Netbook computer.

Thanks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download file onto a shared folder on the computer. (I wa using .CSV and .MP3 files.
2.Go to another computer on the network where you could normally access file downloaded above.
3.Try to open a file (I used Excel for the .CSV file and Win Media player for the .MP3 files).
Actual Results:
Files will not open on any other network computer.

Expected Results:
Excel should open the .CSV file and Win Media player should open the .MP3 files.
