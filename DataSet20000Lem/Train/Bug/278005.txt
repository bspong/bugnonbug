In a page that ha frame on it, using javascript to create an iframe cause
mozilla to enter into some sort of an infinite loop. It say "Loading..." and
the wheel keep circling. It hit the CPU harder.

Other than that, everything seems to work. The rest of the JS on a page, the
browser interface, ... It just go into some sort of an infinite loop.

This only happens if the iframe is created in the onload function, or a function
called by it. Therefore, a good workaround is to call the iframe-creating
function with a setInterval of 0ms.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In a page inside of a frameset, create a funciton to be called with the
page's onload. Let's call that function init()

2. Have init() create an iframe (with any src) and attach it to the body.

Actual Results:
The title of the page is always "Loading..." and the little circle keep on
moving around. It hit the CPU harder, evidently in an infinite loop.

Expected Results:
Recognized that it ha finished loading the page, and quit drawing CPU resources.
