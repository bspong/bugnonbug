Unable to upload .ics file in Windows Live Calendar with updated Firefox.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

I have just updated Mozilla, and when I attempt to upload a .ics file into Windows Live Calendar online I receive this error message:

"There wa a problem with the file name you entered. Please clear the name and try entering another one."

I am still able to upload through Internet Explorer, and wa also able to complete the same action through the old version of Firefox. I have tried renaming the ic file to exclude space (to no avail) and have check all file for non-alpha character (there are none).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to http://calendar.live.com by my entering username and password
2. Click, "Subscribe"
3. Select, "Import from an ICS file"
4. Beside, "Choose the file," click the "Browse..." button
5. Select desired file ending in .ics to upload
6. Click, "OK"
7. Select either "Import into a new calendar" or "Import into an existing calendar" and both produce the same error message, which read a follows:

"There wa a problem with the file name you entered. Please clear the name and try entering another one."
Actual Results:
I received the following error message underneath the box in which the file's extension had shown:
"There wa a problem with the file name you entered. Please clear the name and try entering another one."

Expected Results:
Firefox should have navigated to another page in which text would appear explaining how many out of the total event had been updated in the online calendar.

I'd successfully been able to update the online calendar I use from the same file on the computer with the previous version of Firefox, and can still update using MS IExplorer with the same file that will not work with Firefox.
