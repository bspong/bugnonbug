In Firefox 3.5.2 and 3.0.13 with the Skype add-on v3.3.0.3789 installed, when you login to the online banking site at www.nwolb.com after the second step (entering Pin /Password) you are returned to the login step 1 page. Disabling or uninstalling Skype add-on resolve the issue.
Also, at he HSBC internet banking, http://www.hsbc.co.uk/1/2/HSBCINTEGRATION/CAM10;jsessionid=0000XRcE9AltDFGVRIiI0Y0HLcw:12ntf1ldo?IDV_URL=hsbc.MyHSBC_pib
one can login successfully but clicking on any menu item result in the you being returned to the first login page. Again, disabling or uninstalling the Skype add-on resolve the issue.
Both of the above first occurred with the 3.5.1 and 3.0.12 release of Firefox
