RSS sniffer is a little too aggressive

Is it really necessary for the RSS sniffer to run on page served a image/png? Can't it be run only on text/plain, application/octet-stream and other generic types? My application ha security issue because of this: Freenet store web site on a distributed network in order to provide anonymous browsing, each user run a "node", which provides a web interface on localhost. HTML is filtered to ensure that it doesn't include web-bugs (inline image that could give away the user's IP address), but this relies on a reliable MIME type. We have to emulate your RSS sniffer's behaviour in order to be safe, and since that may change in future this is suspect. I wa going to wrap text a HTML and parse image to ensure they are safe, but it look like it may be possible to create an RSS sheet which is detected a RSS, but is also a valid image.

It would help a lot if firefox would only run the RSS detection on the "standard" MIME type that unconfigured or old web server will use for .rss file (Opera us this approach with HTML detection), or if it didn't run RSS detection on the common image type (png, gif, mng, jpeg; running it on SVG isn't a problem a it's XML anyway). I don't know whether this could affect other applications.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Save an RSS feed a .png.
2. Upload it to a web server.
3. Open it in Firefox.

Actual Results:
It will open a an RSS file despite it having a MIME type of image/png

For our application, this is bad.

Expected Results:
Opened it a a png. It should only consider opening it a an RSS feed if the PNG is invalid (and even then that's questionable).
