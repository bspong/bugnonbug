Ever since June, when this new feature wa added, I can't keep firefox on a page that contains Adobe Flash player. Eventually, the system report plugin container doe not respond by Microsoft's troubleshooting feature. Pretty much, I think I am running out of resource of some kind because I have to power off my computer to get it to work again. I've now disabled the timeout feature and will retest. Try any site with Adobe Flash Player.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Adobe flash player in a window and leave open.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
System is very slow and unresponsive. Try closing Firefox, Microsoft trouble shooter will report that it can't close the application and cause Firefox to close. It then report the problem being plugin container not responding.

Expected Results:
System becomes unstable and must be shut off by power button.
