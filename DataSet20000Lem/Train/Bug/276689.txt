current page unusable while firefox is in the process of loading next one

When visiting any page and then, for example, clicking on a link to another
page, the current page is rendered effectively unusable while the new page is
being loaded, even though the current page is still on screen. This behaviour
seems to have changed from previous version of Firefox, but I can't find a
record of any bug being filed that might have prompted the change, or any bug
about the change.

Currently, while the new page is being downloaded, I can left-click on other
link in the current page, which will stop the new page from being loaded and
load a different one instead, but I can no longer middle-click to any effect. I
can force the view to scroll up or down by selecting the text, but cannot use
the scrollbars.

This behaviour is not what it used to be in previous version of Firefox. In
previous versions, while a new page wa being loaded, but before it wa rendered
on screen, I could continue to use the current page (I could open link in new
tabs, scroll, etc.)

While there may seem to be a simple workaround (back/forward), this is not
effective precisely because the issue is only really felt on slow-loading sites.
This ha an especial impact on site such a Wikipedia, where there is a lot of
information on the page (stuff I may want to read/links I want to open in new
tabs), but where page may at time load slowly.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site, especially one that may load slowly at time (e.g. wikipedia.org)
2. Go to a page with some links.
3. Left-click on a link to open in the same window
4. Before the new page start rendering, try to scroll on the old page, or
middle-click on other hyperlink

Actual Results:
Nothing!

Expected Results:
Scroll and/or open link in new tabs, or other action
