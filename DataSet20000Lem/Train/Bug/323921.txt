firefox 1.5 won't run with mandriva linux libraries.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915
Build Identifier: firefox-1.5,tar,gz for linux and mandriva 2006 free i586 linux

i've installed mandriva (mandrake) linux, the free version, called 2006/i586. it come with firefox 1.0.6 installed and working. i downloaded firefox 1.5 for linux and unpacked it in /usr/. typing /usr/firefox/firefox generates a complaint that libstdc++.so.5 cannot be found. a symbolic link between /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5.0 or /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6.0.5 produce complaint that GLIBCPP_3.2 and CXXABI_1.2 are the wrong versions. in this mandrake there is nothing in /usr/local/lib where in other linux libstdc++.so.5 might be found. in short the current firefox build doesn't run on mandrake linux due to library issues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.download free mandriva and select standard installation
2.download firefox-1.5.tar.gz and place in /usr
3.tar to unpack
4> attempt to run firefox

Actual Results:
firefox cannot find libstdc++.so.5 and won't run

Expected Results:
firefox look for the current version of libstdc++.so.X shipped with contemporary linux versions.

i tried quickly to find a rpm of .5 on the internet and it appears there is one but firefox should run out of the box on common and uptodate linux versions.
