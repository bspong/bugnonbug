Some, mainly large webpages, do not finish before the browser say the page is 'done'.

In large webpages, such a http://scapeboard.com/2/viewtopic.php?t=323722&start=15
do not always finish displaying before the browser report that the page is
'done'. This is on a 56k connection, but other browser do not seem to do this.
In the above web page i could not get the whole thing to display, meaning i
couldn't read post near the bottom.
This also happens sometimes with large picture files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.err... limit download bandwidth to 35 kb/sec :D (to represent the condition
on my computer).
2.go to http://scapeboard.com/2/viewtopic.php?t=323722&start=105
3.

Actual Results:
The whole web page did not load

Expected Results:
Check that the whole web page ha loaded before breaking off the connection
(maybe it is not firebird breaking off the connection, but i can't tell).

As i said before, I'm on a 56k connection (bandwidth tested to be about 35 kb/sec).

Can be solved by refreshing the page, usually multiple times, but with the above
extreme example I could not get the whole page to show not matter how many time
I refreshed.

I'm not sure if it is a bug with firebird itself, or certain servers, or what.
