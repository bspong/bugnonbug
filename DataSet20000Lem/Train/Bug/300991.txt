XP sp2. Adobe SVG viewer 6. Very basic svg file on desktop.
Access file through Firefox, perfect. Same with explorer.
Right click file and open with explorer, perfect.
Right click file and open with Firefox open a box that tell me that it cannot
find the file but the file is opened by Firefox and display properly.
This also happens when the file is opened directly by clicking on it.
No problem with explorer and no problem with Firefox except the annoying
warning is activated. The really annoying part is having to continually close
the warning if you are just testing a svg documentfrom a closed condition.

3.Click on svg document icon on desktop to open it.

Actual Results:
Windows open a box that say it cannot find the file but it does.

Expected Results:
It should not have activated the error box a the file wa found and opened
correctly.
