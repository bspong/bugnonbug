Firefox closing while in Hotmail, usually after only a minute or two
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

Firefox may be having incompatibility problem with Hotmail. I've had it crash several time in the last two days. If I have other tab active, the closing doesn't happen until I return to the Hotmail tab. There seems to be no effect to my Hotmail account.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Use my shortcut to get to Hotmail login page.
3.Login
4.Start to use Hotmail.
Actual Results:
After an undetermined length of time, but sometimes a short a 60 seconds, I get an error message saying that Firefox ha encountered a problem and need to close... When "ok" is pushed, Firefox window(s) close.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have stayed running.

I tried running Firefox update and Windows XP update (actually I do this every week). I also tried a cold restart on the machine. No change to the problem. I am not experiencing any problem when running Hotmail from IE.

I wa unable to send the error report through the Mozilla Quality Feedback Agent, probably due to problem with the proxy server at work.

I don't remember experiencing the Hotmail problem from home (I haven't been home much), but I don't think it has. I'm working at the TX Dept of Public Safety which ha a pretty severe firewall, but this problem is new in the last two days. ONLY the Hotmail site seems affected. Other site do not seem to crash Firefox, including other MS and MSN sites.

Attached is the content of the text file generated from one crash.
