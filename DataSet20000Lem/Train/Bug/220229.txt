Mouse click on file:/// entry in URL bar drop down prepends http:// and appends .com and .org

This is extremely predictable and annoying a hell.

I have a list of say ten url within a specific domain and upon working with
autocomplete I type until I select the url from the list of already visited
page I want to revisit.

I select the url and what happens is the browser launch a new Tab View and
catenates a prefix and suffix a follows:

Original file path

file:///home/mjd/JavascriptReferences/coreReference15/you-are-here.html

Resulting url path guess from autocomplete.

http://www.file.com///home/mjd/JavascriptReferences/coreReference15/you-are-here.html.org/

I'm guessing there are more than one bug here

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start typing your pathway you want
2. autocomplete show list of already visited from history
3. select one from the list
4. browser try to check for url and if not presently with an http:// it add
it with a .com to the protocol such that it http://www.protocol.com/pathway.org

New tab view result

Actual Results:
404 Error or worse an actual site with the domain name.

Expected Results:
Pathway selected and processed within the current view whether it be a file:///
or an https:// or an http:// path header.
