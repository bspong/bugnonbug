Refer to earlier reported bug #122698 on Linux. I get the same problem when I have had to restart Firefox (without rebooting the PC) - a message pop up indicating that another instance of Firefox is running. Doing a ctrl-alt-delete, I check for running processes, and sure enough, there is a Firefox process still running. When I terminate this process, then I can restart Firefox without a problem.

I have also noticed a problem when working with a Blackboard online course server. It seems that when I do a second course edit request: after exiting a course I am working on - a a developer - I attempt to open another, and Blackboard-Firefox do not seem to negotiate the transaction, so I am forced to shut down Firefox to access the second course. It also doe not like when I request to Log Out of Blackboard. I have verified with peer in our office that they are not having this problem, but they are not using version 3.0.1 of Firefox - they are still in 2.x.x.
