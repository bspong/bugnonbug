Between system boots, the location of a previously accessed bookmark within a multi-page bookmark folder is not remembered

In previous versions, Firefox would remember between session _and_ system boot the location of a bookmark last accessed within a multi-page folder of bookmark and restore that multi-page bookmark list to the same scroll position a the one previously scrolled to by the user, making the last-used bookmark easily accessible without once again having to scroll though a long list of bookmark in that folder to get to it.

Now, Firefox v4 remembers the same between sessions, but not through a system reboot. The information required to do so is apparently not being saved to disk.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a multi-page folder of bookmark
2.Scroll to a bookmark that is below the list of bookmark seen whn the folder is opened
3.Go to that bookmarked web page (i.e. click on the bookmark)
4.Close Firefox and reboot system
5.Open the same folder and you will find that you will have to scroll down below the initially displayed list once again to get to the bookmark last visited.
