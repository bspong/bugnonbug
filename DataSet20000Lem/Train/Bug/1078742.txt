Add a Manifest Editor to WebIDE
Maybe this is something that is already in the WebIDE, but I couldn't find it. So feel free to ignore all of this in that case.

I know bug 921254 wa filed for a JSON editor for manifests. I'm unclear of bug 921254 comment 2, so I decided to file this bug. But if it's invalid or not something you guy want to do, feel free to mark it a such or WONTFIX. I do genuinely think it's helpful for a lot of devs (not just the beginner but advanced devs too who don't want to keep manually writing JSON).

A manifest builder (wizard) would be even cooler. This way developer don't have to manually write JSON from scratch.

I've built a few prototype of manifest builder and editors. I won't distract you with all of those, but there's one idea in particular I like: inline validation of manifest. See my sketch on the left side here:

JSON validation (something like http://jsonlint.org/ or http://jsoneditoronline.org/, which wa discussed in bug 921254) could show manifest error or helpful notice a the developer creates or edits a manifest.

Today, developer have to go from App Manager/WebIDE -> Editor -> MDN -> Editor -> Save change -> App Manager/WebIDE to check validity. Or in the worst cases, developer are having to re-zip their packaged apps or reupload their hosted-app manifest to address a validation issue in the Marketplace submission flow (or when updating the manifest for an existing submitted hosted app or submitting a new version of a packaged app). It's really quite a tedious and frustrating process.

The Marketplace UX team (specifically, Elizabeth Hunt and Bram Pitoyo) are working on integrating a Manifest Builder to the Marketplace. If the WebIDE folk decide they do want to add a JSON editor or manifest wizard/editor, it's probably worth discussing with them. Their prototype area available for viewing here: http://62shu8.axshare.com/

As I see it there should be two goals:

* Help developer so they don't have to write JSON from scratch
* Help developer address validation issue in one spot, so they don't have to keep toggling window and get frustrated

Hopefully, the WebIDE can fix these. I think it will really delight developer and avoid lot of existing friction and frustration.
