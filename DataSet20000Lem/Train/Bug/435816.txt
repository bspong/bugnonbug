When loading from a local file, the document presented in the URL presented load fine, and the XSL transform is performed(*) however when loaded from a webserver, an error is presented stating the XSLT stylsheet doe not have the mimetype of text/xml

* DTDs are ignored in XSLT transforms.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Load an XML document such a this:
<blobs><blob /> <blob color="green" /></blobs>
tied to a DTD that defines a default value for an element (such a this:
<!ELEMENT blob EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST blob color CDATA "black">)
and an XSLT Transform that make use of that value
such a this:
<xsl:template match="blob"> The color of a blob is <xsl:value-of select="@color"></br> </xsl:template>
Actual Results:
On a local file:
The color of a blob is <br/>
The color of a blob is green<br/>

on a remote file:
The XSLT stylesheet given doe not have an XML mimetype

Expected Results:
The color of a blob is black<br/>
The color of a blob is green<br/>

When rendered in IE, there are no problems. tested in Firefox, IE6 and IE7. Firefox always produce the wrong result.
