While it's possible to create webloc file in FireFox by dragging and dropping
the URL from the address bar to the desktop, the opposite cannot be done.

Also (and this is likely related), if one control-clicks a webloc file (getting
a contextual menu) and selects the "Open With" command and navigates to FireFox,
FireFox is greyed out, not allowing the webloc file to be opened with FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select the webloc (Web Internet Location) file
2.Drag-and-Drop the webloc file into the address bar
3.

Actual Results:
Nothing

Expected Results:
The web location referenced in the webloc file should open.

Also, one should be able to configure a webloc file to be opened with FireFox
via the "Get Info" command (command-I) dialog box of the webloc file but this is
impossible - FireFox is greyed out.

The result is the webloc file is useless and cannot be opened via FireFox.

This is fresh installation of my system (Mac OS X, version 10.4 - Tiger) and
FireFox so there should be no issue with old and corrupted files.
