This just happened today for the first time after I okayed the upload to 2.0.0.13. In order to see our intranet sites, FF automatically switch to IE engine for these bookmarks. I have many file uploaded onto Sharepoint portal and have had no problem in the past, when I tried to open them but today, it refused. I had to control-alt-delete shut down and then restarted FF more than 5 time and it continued to hang up for Word docs. It opened pdfs just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start program
2.open new tab
3.scroll down bookmark to select portal
4. click on Word doc of interest
5. get hourglass and program hang indefinitely
6. Control-alt-delete to end program
7. cycle endlessly through these steps.
Actual Results:
FF hang and fails to respond to any attempt to end the hangup

Expected Results:
normally, I get a dialogue box asking if I trust opening the file from this site a some file are hazardous to my computer health etc. I click on "open" and the document open in MS Word with a Sharepoint connection to the storage location of the file on teh intranet

The only other thing I did after FF started up this morning and installed the 2.0.0.13 update wa to uninstall Stumble a I don't really use it. Then I restarted the program.
