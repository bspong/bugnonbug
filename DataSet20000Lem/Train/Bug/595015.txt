FF report a link a broken, but IE8 can usually access it
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I am almost ready to uninstall FF. I have already switched back to using IE8 most of the time. I keep running into site unavailable, or cannot be found, or link is broken, etc, but if I past the URL into IE8, I can access the site. Sometimes I simply "try again" in FF, or I close the tab and reload the URL into a new tab. Occasionally that works, but most of the time, after I get a message that I can't get there from here, it doe not work and I go to IE8. How can I get this "fixed"?? I don't run into this situation every time; it is more common when I have a large number of tab open, say 10+. It is more prevalent when I resume a closed session, especially if it is an old session. I like the session manager approach to access previous sessions, but I will probably learn how to use IE8's Favorites approach and like it a well. What can you do for me to fix FF??

Reproducible: Sometimes




Let me know if you need more info to understand the bug I'm describing.

Would changing / increasing the timeout time help?? I don't sense that FF doe not have enough time, but I am willing to try things...
