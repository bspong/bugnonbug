When clicking on a link on a page fails to load the referred page once, this link never work again. it always fails to load this page with infinite "busy" indicator for the page. This persists after quit+restart, reboot, clear all private data via extra menu + quit + restart and even trashing the cache manually. (i probably didn't get them all..)

this happens on Mac OSX 10.4 on G3 and Mac OSX 10.5 on Intel.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on a link
2.if it doe not load, then...
3.
Actual Results:
the referred page never load again

Expected Results:
the referred page should load at my 2nd try, at least after quit+restart.

The problem persists after quit+restart, reboot, clear all personal cache + quit + restart and even trashing the cache manually. (i probably didn't get them all..) and it persists for approx, 2 week or more (when wa Ff3 released?)

this happens on Mac OSX 10.4 on G3 and Mac OSX 10.5 on Intel.

For unknown reason my personal webpage k1.dyndns.org is especially prone for this+me, either because evtl. running apache on Mac OSX frequently hang during content delivery or because this is a WLAN or even local connection for me.
Though this is rare this is very annoying, because the problem, once established, stay for ever.

A workaround is to copy+paste the link address into the url text field of firefox or navigate to the desired page via other pages, if possible. The problem is related to the page with the link - not the referred page.
