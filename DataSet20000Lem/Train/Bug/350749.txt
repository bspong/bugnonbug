Can't paste into location bar or type in dialog box after launching FF from Start menu multiple time
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2

Steps to reproduce:
1.) Configure Firefox to use blank page about:blank a the home page
2.) Close all instance of FF
3.) Open notepad type about:blank copy it, paste it to verify it's in the copy buffer
4.) Start-> Firefox
5.) <ctrl>+v to paste about:blank into the location bar
6.) Hit enter
(repeat 4-6 a needed)
7.) Start-> Firefox
8.) <ctrl>+v to paste about:blank into the location bar

At this point the <ctrl>+v doe not work i.e., nothing show up in the location bar. It also doesn't work if you click on the search bar try to paste there. If you go back and paste into Notepad then it works. Note doing a right-click in the location bar and selecting paste exhibit the same behavior a <ctrl>+v.

You may need to repeat step 4-6 in order to get it to occur. It never occurs on the very first opening but it ha always occured sometime between the 2nd and 14th opening. It usually occurs after just 2-3.

If you do a Help->About-><enter> in the "unfocused" window then it will work. You don't need to close all window to get it to happen again, just repeat step 4-6 and it will happen after 2-14 times.

I have tested this with:
Windows XP SP2 + Firefox 1.5.0.6
Windows XP SP2 + uninstall then reinstall Firefox 1.5.0.6
Install Windows XP SP2 from CD - deleting all partition and formatting the hard drive + Firefox 1.5.0.6
Install Windows XP SP2 from CD - deleting all partition and formatting the hard drive on a different machine (IBM TP T42p instead of IBM TP T43p) + Firefox 1.5.0.6
Windows XP SP2 + Firefox 2.0b1
Windows Vista Beta 2 + Firefox 1.5.0.6
Install Windows XP SP2 from CD - deleting all partition and formatting the hard drive + Firefox 2.0b2 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2)

In all case I started from a completely new profile.

This also cause the FAYT bug. I.e., once I get to an "unfocused" window, I can't paste but I can type into the search bar. After typing in the search bar I can then type in the location bar. I type http://developer.mozilla.org/ and then try to type in the search box on the page - however the text doesn't go into the box it start the FAYT mechanism (I have FAYT enabled and I want it enabled, if I disable it then the dialog box work but I still can't paste into the location bar).

I often copy a URL from a doc, launch a new Firefox, and paste the URL into the location bar so I see this a lot. I've gone from various version of Firefox to IE6 to IE7beta to Opera 9.01 to IE7RC1 to Firefox 2.0b2. I assume this is all related to FAYT/focus issue which make Firefox unusable, but the other browser are worse so please resolve this one.
