On some web pages, the screen area between the upper and lower tool/status bar
bunce up and down a bit over a sixteenth of an inch, a doe the right scrollbar.
It will also sometimes occur in tabbed windows. It doe not always happen, even
when returning to a page that previously bounced. Sometimes
maximizing/maximizing the window stop the effect; sometimes not. I've noticed
that, when the window is in the "minimized" option, while I click and drag the
corner to resize the window, the bouncing stop while resizing. Special note:
if I move the window quickly while resizing, it give an effect of dragging
"multiple copies" of the window (and contents.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.It happens on it's own.
2.

Expected Results:
Uhhh.... screen shouldn't bounce? 8^)

I'm using the original theme. I've reinstalled Mozilla, and also Firefox (but I
did not un-install, first.) This only started a few day ago. I've used firefox
ffor over six month before it started. I've installed no software that might
cause an issue. I've went thru the problem search but found nothing exactly
like this. This ha not happened while using the regular Mozilla browser. Right
now I have two page open; both on your site. If I refresh the page, sometimes
it will be stable. However, if I minimize the page (it's set for just slightly
smaller than maximum,) it started bouncing, even if I again maximized the
window. Again, this doe not always happen.
