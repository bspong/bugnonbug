i have a very basic expand/collapse function in JavaScript that work well in IE, but not in Firefox. This issue caught me by surprise and investigated it a bit further. Each one of the <div> element ha a border with a set height and a basic line of text in it. When the element above is expanded ( using the "display" style ), it will move the text from the <div> element below down, but will not move the border with it. If i take the "height" style out, it work flawlessly.
Example :
<div style="height:20px; border-width: 2px; margin:2px">Hello</div>
Repaired:
<div style="border-width: 2px; margin:2px">Hello</div>

I then attempted to nest the <div> tags:
<div style="border-width: 2px; margin:2px">
<div style="height:20px">Hello</div>
</div>
This did not work. The same flawed result from the previous case occurs again.
Once again, i took the height style out and it worked flawlessly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.This is the JS:
function collapsable_Box(name, focus, number, close)
{
for (i=1 ; i <= number ; ++i)
{
if (i != focus) { if (close == 1) { document.getElementById(name+i).style.display = "none"; } }
else
{
if (document.getElementById(name+focus).style.display == "block")
{ document.getElementById(name+focus).style.display = "none"; }
else
{ document.getElementById(name+focus).style.display = "block"; }
}
}
}
2.have the function called in an onclick event handler to react to the following:
<div id="profile5" style="height:20px; border-width: 2px; margin:2px">
Hello, this is the collapsible box text.
</div>
<div style="border-width: 2px; margin:2px">I need to keep this border.</div>
3.Then, take out the height style from the first element. It will work.

If you need more of the coding, i will be happy to oblige.
Actual Results:
The result's are that it will move the text from the <div> element below down, but will not move the border with it. If i take the "height" style out, it work flawlessly.

Expected Results:
It should have moved the whole block down, just like it doe with the height style turned off. IE doe not have this problem, surprisingly. ...really, that did surprise me. I have been battling IE all damned day now to see this happen. A little odd. LoL

I'm not sure what you would need to further investigate this issue. This is the first time i have reported a bug in this fashion, however, if you would like, i can send more information. Please forgive me if i did something wrong on this form.
Thank you, Kenn.
