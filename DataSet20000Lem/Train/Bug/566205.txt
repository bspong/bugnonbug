I go to ebay.com and log into my account. When I attempt to change my password it asks me to login again to confirm my identity, I do so and it take me to the next screen where it asks me to enter my current password and type in the new one two times. I do so and click the submit button. It refuse to change it and display a message like "Session Timed out. Please sign in..." It display this message every time I try to change my password.

When I try to change my email it tell me to sign in again so I try to but when I click the button to log in it doesn't go anywhere and just display the Forgot username and Forgot password link below the fields.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to ebay.com Sign in and go to My eBay. Put mouse over Account then click on Personal Information.
2. Click on the edit link by password to change it.
3. Sign in again.
4. Type in current password and new password then click submit.
Actual Results:
It display the error message that say something about "Session timed out"

Expected Results:
It should have accepted the password change and taken me to the Personal Information Page.

It should have processed the request by sending the appropriate information from the fields. I do not know the exact cause of the problem only that I do not have this problem in Opera.
