Java applet don't work for non-administrators, unless an administrative user ha already loaded one. This appears to be because the Firefox installer isn't creating the necessary registry value CurrentValue in HKLM\SOFTWARE\mozilla.org\Mozilla.

I believe the installer is creating the value in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\Mozilla instead.

When an administrative user load a web page containing a Java applet the necessary registry value is created automatically, but this isn't possible when the user isn't an administrator. Sysinternal's regmon tool indicates that an attempt to create the relevant key wa refused with an access denied error.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start with a clean OS, or manually delete the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\mozilla.org.
2. Install Firefox 1.5.0.7 and the 1.5.0_06 (or later) Sun Java runtime. Do not visit any web page containing Java applets.
3. Log out and back on a a user without administrator privilege and go to any web page containing a Java applet (such a the NASA page listed above).

Actual Results:
The Java applet doe not start. The Java notification icon doe not appear.

Expected Results:
The Java applet should run.

I checked Firefox 1.5.0.6 and 1.5.0.4 and they both had the same problem.
