Bookmarks list collapse after a few second when using keyboard to navigate bookmark sub menu

When I have one instance of Firefox open and I use the keyboard to navigate my
bookmark (Alt+B, then arrow keys), after a few second and before I have
selected a bookmark, my bookmark list collapse and I have to start over again.
After I hit Alt+B again, the list stay open - the problem only occurs the
first time I open AND NAVIGATE (just opening the list doesn't cause the collapse
- I must navigate with the arrow key too) the bookmark list with Alt+B.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close all instance of Firefox, then open up a new one (it seems that I have
to open up another application between closing down Firefox and opening up a new
instance).
2. Hit Alt+B (open Bookmarks) and navigate your bookmark with the arrow key
(do not use the mouse), but do not select a bookmark.
3. Wait a few seconds, and the bookmark list collapses.

Actual Results:
The bookmark list collapses, and I have to hit Alt+B again to open up my
bookmark list. The second time I open up my bookmark with Alt+B the bookmark
list stay open until I select a bookmark.

Expected Results:
The bookmark list should remain open until I select a bookmark.

I need to open up another application (IE, for instance) between closing all
instance of Firefox and opening up another instance of Firefox to recreate this
problem.
