Steps to reproduce:

I am currently updating three of my add-on (Print Edit, Tile Tabs & Zoom Page) to work with the Australis UI. Print Edit and Tile Tabs each have a single toolbar button with type="menu-button". Zoom Page ha a <toolbaritem> containing three toolbar button all with type="button", and one of these button creates it own popup menu.

[Note: When the toolbar button are in the Menu Panel or Overflow Panel, I have found it necessary to add the noautoclose="true" attribute to all of the toolbar buttons. Without this attribute, when a button is clicked and the drop-down menu is shown, the Menu Panel or Overflow Panel closes. I'm not sure if it should be necessary to add this attribute.]

When the toolbar button are in the Overflow Panel, there are some focus problem causing unexpected closing of the Overflow Panel. These problem affect the toolbar button of all three add-ons. The simplest case to look at is the toolbar button of Print Edit.

There are several use cases:

First Use Case (works correctly)

1. Open Overflow Panel.
2. Click on toolbar button drop marker to show drop-down menu.
3. Click on browser page contents. Drop-down menu close [as expected]. Overflow Panel stay open [as expected].
5. Repeat 3. Drop-down menu close [as expected]. Overflow Panel stay open [as expected].

Second Use Case (browser window loses focus)

1. Open Overflow Panel.
2. Click on toolbar button drop marker to show drop-down menu.
3. Click on Overflow panel background. Drop-down menu close [as expected]. Overflow Panel stay open [as expected]. Browser window loses focus [NOT EXPECTED].
4. Repeat 2.
5. Repeat 3. Drop-down menu close [as expected]. Overflow Panel stay open [as expected].

Third Use Case (overflow panel close unexpectedly)

1. Open Overflow Panel.
2. Click on toolbar button drop marker to show drop-down menu.
3. Click on Overflow panel background. Drop-down menu close [as expected]. Overflow Panel stay open [as expected]. Browser window loses focus [NOT EXPECTED].
4. Repeat 2.
5. Click on browser page contents. Drop-down menu close [as expected]. Overflow Panel close [NOT EXPECTED].




Actual results:

In some circumstance (as described above), the Overflow Panel close when a toolbar button drop-down menu is shown.





Expected results:

The Overflow Panel should stay open when a toolbar button drop-down menu is shown.
