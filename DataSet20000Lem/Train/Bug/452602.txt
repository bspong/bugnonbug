The scroll bar doesn't stop when I stop pressing the arrow key. It keep scrolling for either a few millimeters, or keep scrolling ceaselessly. If I press the arrow key only briefly, there is no problem - it is only when I want to go a long way down or up the page that it stop reacting instantly to my release of the key.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open website where considerable scrolling is required to get from top to bottom - a blog, google result or this page for example.
2.Scroll up or down a long way, holding down the arrow key.
3. Release the key after 3 second of scrolling. (3 for a clear demonstration).
Actual Results:
I scrolled up the page from this point. I released the key when I saw the "URL" box, and the page stopped scrolling with 'Step 2 of 3' in the middle of the page. Some of this may be due to reaction time, but I have been using the arrow key to navigate for years, and have never noticed such a delay before.

Expected Results:
Stopped when I released the key, at "URL".
