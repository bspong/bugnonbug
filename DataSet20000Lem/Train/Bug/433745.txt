Context Menus getting messed up in Windows XP and Vista after installing Firefox 3b5

Since installing Firefox 3b5 I have seen right-click menu not paint correctly. In Windows Vista (32-bit) right-clicking an icon would paint menu item when moused over. Windows XP Professional (32-bit) clicking on Desktop toolbar from the taskbar would not paint the menu at all. This began after installing and running FF3b5 on both machines.

Typical tabs/windows open are: Tab1 - iGoogle home page; Tab2 - Gmail; Pop-out Window - gChat (typically only one).

Reproducible: Sometimes

This is something that I have noticed just twice, once on two separate machines. This wa not a problem before FF3b5. I wa running FF2 until yesterday, and saw the bug on the vista box yesterday, and the window box today.

Only a restart wa able to return the machine to normal. Almost like the rendering engine of FF wa jacking up the video driver.
