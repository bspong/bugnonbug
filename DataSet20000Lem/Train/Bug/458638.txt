After updating Firefox 3.0 to 3.03, Some search engine (Flickr, Live.com, Technorati) were missing. Then I went to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:4/cat:all?sort=name and I tried to reinstal them, but couldn't complete the operation because I got the following message (Live.com example):

"Firefox could not install the search plugin from "http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/downloads/file/25767/live.com.xml" because an engine with the same name already exists."

Despite these message stating that the engine already exist, the missing search engine don't appear in the "Manage Search Engines List". I wa unable to re-install the missing search engines.

3. Go back to the aforementioned page and try to re-install the missing search engines.
