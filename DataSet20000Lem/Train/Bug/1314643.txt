[Affected versions]:
Aurora 51

[Affected platforms]:
All

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Open Aurora 51 and type something in Search bar.
2. Right-click on a one-off search icons. (e.g. Wikipedia).
3. From context menu click "Set a default search engine".

[Expected Result]:
The search engine should be set a default.

[Actual Result]:
The search engine is not set a default. Repeating this with other engine doe not set any of them a default engine until the Search bar is closed and reopened.
This happens only for the first time the user start Firefox or any time he open a new window and open the Search bar.

Probably regressed by Bug 1297976 - Fix accessibility for the unified one-off search button in the urlbar and searchbar

[Notes]
[1] This reproduces on Aurora where the oneOffSearches from Awesomebar is disabled.
[2] This wa reproducible also on Nightly if the "browser.urlbar.oneOffSearches" wa set to false UNTIL bug 1297374 wa fixed. So bug 1297374 fixed this issue, but only on Nightly. I think the easiest way to fix this is to uplift the fix from bug 1297374 to Aurora.
