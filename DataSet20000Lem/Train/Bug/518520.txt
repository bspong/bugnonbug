In FF option I have set OPtions>privacy>location bar->When using location bar, suggest from History and bookmark (selected option).

I visited the site everydaytechie.com in one tab and left it at that and opened other tab to continue browsing. Suddenly I remembered I had to refer to this other site and I recalled it had something called 'tech' in the name so I assumed if I start typing tech then firefox would produce this url in location bar/awesome bar. Apparently it doesnt.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See 2 screenshots available in the URL link above (picture gallery - there are 2 picture you need to click next to view the next screenshot) -
Actual Results:
When I start typing 'techi' in location bar it brings up everydaytechie.com in the awesome bar/location bar. When I type upto 'tech' this entry (everydaytechie.com) doesnt appear at all in the awesome/location bar.

Expected Results:
Doesnt 'techie' match 'tech'? (You can see it match 'technology' so why not 'techie')?
