Bon Echo seems to be hanging on me at random interval without any sensible way to reproduce the error(s). It ha been happening to me since B1 wa released to the public. I wa thinking perhaps this wa originally a cousin of #346308 but it doesn't seem to be that way since a fix wa tracked in to fix that (and my issue predates 346308).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Bon Echo
2. Navigate around the web

Actual Results:
Bon Echo will eventually stop working -- most notably around site with a lot of activity such a Flash, AJAX or similar things. The CPU usage on the process list will spike up to 100% and the memory usage will go a high a 128k and it eventually will hang out and die (without TB incident btw!)

Expected Results:
It should not do this?

I am at a *TOTAL* loss for word on how to reproduce this or even get any information back off this problem. All I can say is it started on B1 and ha NOT relented since the fix for #346308 wa checked in.

It is le recurrent now that that fix is in place which lead me to believe I wa suffering from two separate bug with the same symptoms. I'm totally willing to run debug build or anything needed to track this. However, I'm unable to get any reliable information from any possible way I know how so far.
