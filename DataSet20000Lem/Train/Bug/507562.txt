The window close button sometimes doesn't work (keeps flickering and doe nothing)

When trying to close a window by clicking the standard window close button (the red x button on Vista's Aero), the window hang for a moment, the button flicker (as if being pressed multiple times), and nothing happens.
At this point everything is really slow in this window, like the context menu take forever to show up, or sometimes only the outline is shown, etc (however, other window work fine).
Then, the only way to actually close the window is to Ctrl-F4 it, or by right clicking on the taskbar button (and even this sometimes doe not work).
This happens to all browser window (including the add-on preference window), and ha been happening randomly since version 3.5 (or maybe 3.5.1).
Once all the offending window are closed, the remaining window (may) work fine, even without a firefox restart.

Reproducible: Sometimes

1. Open two or three window
2. Open tabs, navigate to some site
3. Try to close each window, by pressing the window close button
Actual Results:
Sometimes a window won't close, and even hang

Should've closed
