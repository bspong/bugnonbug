Firefox slow and constantly loading some site
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0
Build ID: 20140716183446

Steps to reproduce:

install firefox 31.0.0 on o x, have seen the same problem on 10.9.4 and 10.10 preview 6.


Actual results:

home page set to
http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=zmw:80233.1.99999
and
http://www.foxnews.com/

when i first load firefox the two page come up and load well, after some time both are constantly refreshing, page detail do not fully populate. Flash movie on foxnews play with choppy video. this is running on a 2009 mac pro with 16B of RAM and more that 1.6TB of free disk space. every new release you put out it seems to get worse, although flash video is better, hard to tell if thats a flash problem or a firefox problem with the constant update of both.


Expected results:

Firefox should be a great fast browser that doe not need to be restarted multiple time a day to be able to load pages. i have been forced to use safari more and more because firefox wont load pages.
of course it could just be me and this will probably be closed with a worksforme code. but i hope FF get better like it used to be.
