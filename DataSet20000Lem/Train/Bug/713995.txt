User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.7; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0
Build ID: 20111221135037

Steps to reproduce:

I chose:
Firefox>Preferences>Privacy>History>Firefox will [USE CUSTOM SETTINGS FOR HISTORY]

I then checked the following:
> Remember browsing history
> Remember download history
> Remember search and form history
> Accept cooky from sites:
>> Accept third-party cooky
>>> Keep until [THEY EXPIRE]

Closed Preferences window

Reopened Preferences window

Quit Firefox


Actual results:

Cookie setting changed from those set to the following: (see screenshot coming after this)

After closing and then reopening Preferences>Privacy, the option [REMEMBER BROWSING HISTORY] had unchecked itself

After Quitting and then relaunching Firefox the same setting had changed to:
Preferences>Privacy>History>Firefox will [REMEMBER HISTORY]


Expected results:

The setting made in Preferences should have stayed the way I set them, both after closing and then reopening the Preferences window, and after Quitting and then relaunching Firefox
