With firefox already running on another workspace on my desktop:

1) Normally, "firefox http://www" leaf the window where it is, and open a new tab with the given URI. I can then see this page by changing workspace. This is the desired behaviour.

2) If I do some work in thunderbird, running the same command cause the firefox window to pop onto my current desktop. It appears that firefox no longer belief that it is the active application, so feel the need to move it window about.

Exactly the same behaviour occurs with "firefox -remote openURI(http://www)".

Relevant config settings:
browser.link.open_external=3
browser.tabs.loadDivertedInBackground=false
