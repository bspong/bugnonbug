I have been experiencing a significant number of unexplained crash under Vista with FireFox-3 since upgrading, probably at least 3 a day. Some are random, but I am finding that more and more of them are repeatable. This one start on a www.sun.com page concerning their BigBrother admin package. When I click on the link on the page that go to the BB website, FireFox crashes. I tried this twice from a clean restart of FireFox, and it failed consistently, so I figured it might provide you a useful test case if you can reproduce it. Screen shot attached.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto:http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/jsp/descFile.jps?url=descAll/bb4
2. Click on link to: http://bb4.com
3. My Vista Home Premium (SP1 installed) report that FFOX ha crashed.
Actual Results:
Restart & recover, same outcome. FYI, I also did two clean (no-recovery) test with no other tab open, got same thing.

Expected Results:
No crash.

Sometimes, Vista will report that FFOX is "not responding", but if I wait 10-15 seconds, the "not responding" box go away and the session continues. My general impression is that Vista is expecting some sort of "work in progress" message from FFOX, or seeing an abnormal process state when FFOX executes a link. In most cases, this happens when I click on a link to an external website, and may be timing related.
