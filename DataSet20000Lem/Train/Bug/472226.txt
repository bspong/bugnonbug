Attempt to avoid accidental dataloss by removing "saved passwords" from clear recent history dialog (not history and doesn't respect timeframe)
Similar premise to bug 472211 but a different potential problem.

The "Clear Private Data" system ha been changed to a "Clear Recent History" system. The dialog is more flexible and allows user to selectively clear only portion of their data and thus might be used more often by people who don't want to wipe everything. There's one problem here: the price of an accident can be high. Most people don't back up their data and if one wa to wipe everything when they didn't want to it would be quite bad. One way I think would be useful to attempt to avoid mishap (aside from adding more confirmation for "everything" in bug 472211) would be to remove the saved password wiping checkbox from this dialog.

To start, saved usernames and password are *not* "recent history". The placement here is a bit odd with this new terminology. I and many user can wipe their entire history, cache, cookies, form autocomplete, etc. and not have it be a horrible inconvenience. Wipe my saved password and I'll be annoyed. I can visit page again and remake cooky and autocompletes, but I can't guarantee I'll remember all my logins that easily. I could easily foresee a user clearing everything intentionally then a long while later coming back here for a quick history cleanup and not noticing that the saved password box is checked. It's my opinion that this is more dangerous than it need to be.

This data is more important, not necessarily relevant to the currently labeled dialog function, and there is already a button to wipe them all in the password manager. I think it should be safe to remove it from here and could potentially save some user a good bit of unnecessary grief.
