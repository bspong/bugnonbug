I'm a Realtor and have an issue with one Edit button on a Multiple Listing site (no public access).

Strangely, the only difference I can find between all the other button that work and the Edit button which only change it label from "Edit" to "Working ..." is that the value="" field ha blank around the text:

value=" Edit "

whereas the others don't. Also, I can't seem to find where the button's text get changed from "Edit" to "Working ..." in either the frame source or the main page... to be sure, I started wireshark to monitor the link when I clicked on this Edit button; but saw no traffic at all, so the change to "Working ..." ha got to be local...

I've asked the website admin to remove the spaces; but am not expecting a positive response to this request from an non-IE user... :^(



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. get to page which contains frame source (attached)
2. Click Edit button
3. button change to "Working ..."; but doe not request edit mode from server




I have several addons and tried to use the "Edit HTML" feature... sadly, this force a page reload which cause the server to revert to a page from which I must click through to get back to this one -- and each clickthrough cause a reload, so there is NO way for me to get to the point where I can edit out the blank locally...
