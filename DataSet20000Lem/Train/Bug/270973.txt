I use Miva Merchant 4.20(compiled) and OpenUi(OpenUi.org) . It all worked great
until I upgraded to the latest version of the openui 4.953/4.982. Now, everytime
I try to navigate the admin panel for my Miva Merchant store Firefox crashes,
close and I loose all the data a the computer freezes. I wanted to add the
release note but they are obviously copyrighted and too long to be included here.
If further information is needed please feel free to contact me or openui.org.
I have also filed a HelpDesk ticket with them.

I just want to say how happy I am with FireFox. I even added a link to you guy
from my website. Thanks and keep up the great work! Vera Battemarco
