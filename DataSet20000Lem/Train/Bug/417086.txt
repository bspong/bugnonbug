If an add-on attempt to open a chrome URL in a new window and the hash part of the URL contains a colon character (:) then an error is throw and the window doesn't open


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Error console
2.Enter "window.open('chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.xul#a:')" in the Code textbox
3.Hit "Evaluate".
Actual Results:
Error thrown
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMJSWindow.open]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: javascript:%20window.open("chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.xul#a:") :: <TOP_LEVEL> :: line 1" data: no]

Expected Results:
A new window should open, displaying "chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.xul"


The fact that the anchor doesn't exist on the page (or is invalid) should not prevent the window from opening and the "chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.xul" page being displayed.

This bug is NOT PRESENT in firefox 2.0.0.11 (or FF 3.0b2), only in 2.0.0.12 (also FF 3.0b4pre)

bug #415367 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=415367) (fixed?) is very similar, but only affect the query part of the URL.

If the URL is pasted into the address bar (and then [enter] hit) then nothing happens (no error is throw, but browser doesn't navigate to URL either). Is the error message suppressed?

If the colon (:) is removed from the URL (chrome://mozapps/content/extensions/extensions.xul#a) all work a expected.
