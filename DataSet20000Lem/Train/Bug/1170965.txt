Back and forward button not properly working on Linux since v38.0.5
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0
Build ID: 2015052300

Steps to reproduce:

Open any web page in a brand new profile with Firefox and click on any link.
Example: http://www.spamhaus.org/


Actual results:

The back button remains disabled. By right-clicking the back button the history menu pop up, though, and is navigable.

Also, I have opened local page which use iframes and by mean of javascript manipulate the browser history and suddenly the back and forward button did appear and remained there for the rest of the session. However, it wa still not quite normal behaviour, a both button remained visible and active even with an empty history list.

I haven't been able to reproduce the code that lead to the activation of these button (it's not a simple a putting a mere history.replaceState statement somewhere in a script).

But anyway, these button should work a they did up to v38.0.1 without any tinkering.


Expected results:

Back button visible but disabled on opening an new browser window; the button's state changing to enabled once a link ha been followed and the forward button showing up a soon a the active back button ha been clicked.

I don't have the same problem on Windows 7. My Linux distribution is openSuSE 12.3.
