Autosearch should be optional, customizable and disabled by default
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

When entering something different from a well-formed url (i.e.: "macarena") the
browser should NOT go ask google, instead it should report the error UNLESS the
user had stated the oposite in [a new item inside] preferences.
Having a search behavior already in the search-bar component, I see no reason to
have this "feature" in the address bar (thus hiding the actual problem and
exposing the user to security/privacy issues). Instead the search bar might have
a new item, "Google I feel lucky".
Autocompleting with "http://", "www." and ".com" should also be disabled by
default, (eventualy "http://" might stay, because that is the default protocol
for a browser, but the other string are arbitrary).
For many reason DNS resolution might temporary fail, in those case the user
should be informed.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "decideforme" in the address bar and hit the Enter key

Actual Results:
You'll be redirected (probably to google's directory search)

Expected Results:
The user should be alerted of the actual problem
