I have been noticing this problem lately saving pdf document that open in the browser.

First let me say there are many pdf doc on this site, for some reason some open in firefox and some open in the acrobat reader window. This problem only affect the first type. Not the one that open in the reader window, for some reason.

I open pdf doc from link.
Click save a button.

Save dialog appears.
Name of doc is filled in a

C__Documents and Settings_Main_Local Settings_Application Data_Mozilla_Firefox_Profiles_sajtjydx.pdf

Whereas it should have been
2010_Jan_AccountChangeForm.pdf



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open pdf doc which open in browser.
2.Click save a copy
3.Save dialog ha profile name instead of doc name from URL bar.
Actual Results:
Doc ha profile name. This is wrong.

Expected Results:
Doc should have name of the doc a loaded.

This ha occurred in several instances.
It is not confined to this site.

This never used to happen. But it's happening now. Odd.
