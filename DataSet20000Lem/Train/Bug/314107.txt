There wa some fuss about a decision to add language information to the name field of a search plugin (with the exception of English plugins). This wa a bad idea, and fortunately the decision ha been revoked. For more information, see the Trademarks approval timeline and RC1 thread in n.p.m.l10n [1].

I do think it is desirable to be able to make the distinction however, in a way that doesn’t make localisation second-class citizens.

I suggest the addition of a hreflang-like information field to the search plugins, followed by implementing a generic mechanism in the search tool that automatically present this field to the user in the desired presentation for every localisation.

A possible presentation could be to add the language of every search plugin between square bracket greyed out and right-aligned in the dropdown list:

Google [nl]
Google [en]

Another possibility would be to add the locale of the search plugin when it differs from the browser’s current locale, e.g.:

Google
Google [en]
