Doesn't show local image if HTML generated by PHP
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

OK, I'm going to _try_ and describe this a well a I can.

First, I have simplified the step here so it will be easy to replicate.

The problem is that Firefox since 1.0 (1.0 PR and earlier did not show this
behaviour) will not show local image in HTML page if they are generated
PHP/Win32. I have not had a chance yet to try other platform or other scripting
languages.

Let's say I have an image at C:\test.jpg. If i enter the code <img
src="file://C:\test.jpg"> in a standard HTML page and open it locally using
Firefox, the image show up fine. However, if I paste the exact same code to a
new document and rename it ".php" instead of ".html", making my web server
(Apache/2.0.48 (Win32)) parse the file through PHP (PHP Version 4.3.4), the
image will not show up, Firefox will show a blank image instead.

Right-clicking the image and choosing "View image" from the context menu on the
PHP-generated page will show the image just fine.

Since this bug only show up in FF 1.0 I am reporting it here. It is possible of
course that the behaviour is in part caused by my version of Apache and/or PHP,
but FF 1.0PR and Internet Explorer 6 on my computer doe not show this behaviour.

I would imagine that this make it very difficult to develop site using PHP on
any workstation when using local images.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create HTML file with an image-tag pointing to a local image
2. Paste same HTML code into a PHP file
3. Compare.

Actual Results:
HTML document show the image, PHP document doe not.

Expected Results:
Both document should have the image.

Here are my response header from the PHP page:
