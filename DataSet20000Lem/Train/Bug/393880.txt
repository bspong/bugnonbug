After changing window decoration in KDE 3.5.1 Level "a", Firefox and Thunderbird 2.0.0.6 segment faulted at startup (after powering down and back up). Firefox ran ok from a different account and ran ok when desktop manager wa switched to Gnome. Running the KDE Desktop Wizard and accepting all default (thereby resetting window theme and decoration back to default) "fixed" Firefox and Thunderbird so that they no longer segment faulted.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. When failure start it is everytime.
2. Unknown what change in window manager window decoration cause failure in FF and T to start.
3. Unknown if Reinitializing window decoration with wizard (or some other tool) will always fix problem.
4. If problem reoccurs when I change my window decoration again, I will update this report.




Other observation that may be helpful:
1. Segment fault on both Firefox and Thunderbird began the next day after changing the window theme from default to "smooth blend" (i.e. after a power down and back up).
2. During period when both FF and T were reliably crashing, KDE component kcompose wa reporting "KomposeGlobal::initSharedPixmaps() - Pixmap not available" in my ~/.X.err file (there are hundred of these). kcompose wa killed and restarted and the error wa no longer reported. FF and T still crashed at that time. Ff and T are working properly now and error is not being reported.
3. No change were made to Firefox or Thunderbird bit to fix their startup segmentation faults. That is, neither program bit nor any file under ~/.mozilla wa changed or reinstalled.
4. OpenSuSE 10.1, KDE 3.5.1 Level "a", Firefox 2.0.0.6, Thunderbird 2.0.0.6.
5. Seamonkey ran ok during the period that Firefox and Thunderbird were segment faulting.
