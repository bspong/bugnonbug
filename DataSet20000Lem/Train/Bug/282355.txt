thanks!

i just submitted my first firefox bug!

Hi. I'm a tech writer ( http://www.kittyfeet.com/bookingIt.htm ) and ...I
noticed an issue with the CD ROMs that come with all my books.

As I started using Firefox, the CDs stopped working correctly. I can still
browse them through Windows, and the Flash interface still loads, but whenever I
try to click on the link on the Flash-based CD-ROM Interface, they don't open
the folder on the CD. Instead they go online and do web search for the terms.
For instance, when you click the link for the "goodies" folder, it doe a web
search on the term "goodies" through Firefox.

In order to make the CDs work correctly, I had to make Internet Explorer my
default browser.

I think the issue is something with how FireFox block pop ups, because it doe
ship with Flash native, and Flash page work fine in it. Or maybe the fact that
Windows IS Internet Explorer, and Firefox is not.

Is there a way, in future versions, to fix this?

thanks.
