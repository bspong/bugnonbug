Firefox 3.6 Beta 4 can not load the most frequently used Norwegian banking and security applet
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2b4) Gecko/20091124 Firefox/3.6b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

After upgrading to Firefox 3.6 Beta 4, I can no longer access my online banking solution. The authentication through this solution is via a Java applet, and you enter a Norwegian personal number (SSN-equivalent) to be redirected to the login applet which allows you to log in by entering a code from a security chip and a password. The problem seems to be that it no longer properly initializes the applet.

Please note that this ha worked fine in all previous Firefox version, including Firefox 3.5. Not certain if this stopped working in the latest Beta of Firefox 3.6 or in an earlier one. I can find that out if necessary. It doe also work in IE 8, and the latest version of Safari and Opera. This is ONLY a problem with Firefox 3.6 Beta (4).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL - https://www.dnbnor.no/en/personal?LA=EN
2. Enter a valid personalnumber in the "User id" field (A valid number can be found on the following page http://www.fnrinfo.no/Verktoy/FinnLovlige_Dato.aspx - You might need to browse back in time to get a person that's 18+ of age, but not certain if that's necessary)
3. Click the "Log In" button
4. A new page should load, trying to initialize the authentication applet. This always end in a failure with an error message "An error ha occurred. Please try again later"
Actual Results:
The applet give an error message: "An error ha occurred. Please try again later"

Expected Results:
The applet should correctly initialize and give you an applet screen asking you for a security code and a password, possibly also the issuer of the security chip.
