If you copy the History place into Bookmarks, it cannot be deleted, either by context menu from Library or Bookmarks Menu, or by Delete key.

The only way I found to delete it is by creating a new folder, moving it inside, then deleting the folder.

Also,if you copied it into a Menu-Accessible directory (e.g. not Unfiled Bookmarks) And you have lot of History entry (I had 10000), the browser get very slow or even hangs.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmarks Menu > click Organize Bookmarks
2.In Library, left frame, drag the History (top entry), into a bookmark folder, to copy it.
3.Right click on the new History entry. In the context menu, 'Delete' is gray and doesn't work. Delete key doesn't work either, or from Bookmarks Menu.
4.Optional: click on the folder the new History is in. In the right frame, click on History. On the bottom, you can change the Name and Place link to something else, so it won't function a History anymore. It still can't be deleted.

Actual Results:
You cannot delete the History bookmark

Expected Results:
There should be a way to delete this bookmark.
