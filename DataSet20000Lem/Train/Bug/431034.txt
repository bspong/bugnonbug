Remote XSL transform rendering problem

When rendering an XML file with associated XSL transform, there is a wide black border on the right and the bottom of the page. This border vanishes when resizing the window.
I can only reproduce this bug by loading it from http://localhost/.../bug.xml. It doesn't occur when loading it from another website, nor when loading it a file://.../bug.xml. The browser display the source of both the xml and xsl correctly in all case (so it's just the rendering that go wrong).
My computer is running Apache 2.2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create index.xml with the following content:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="index.xsl"?>
<xml>
</xml>

2. Create index.xsl transform with the following content:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<xsl:transform version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
<xsl:template match="/">
<html><body></body></html>
</xsl:template>
</xsl:transform>

3. Load the xml file through your locally running http server.
Actual Results:
A black border on the right of about 10% of the width of the window, and a black border on the bottom of about 10% of the height of the window.

Expected Results:
No border.
