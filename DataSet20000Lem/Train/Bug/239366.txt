crash on startup with talkback enabled build on fedora core 1/debian (with prelinking)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040331 Firefox/0.8.0+

All official linux gtk2 enabled nightly build released after March 27th
segfault on startup with the message '/opt/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 451:
10731 Segmentation fault "$prog" ${1+"$@"}'. I'm running Fedora Core 1 but have
installed some package from the development branch (including the latest glibc
ones). Removing the file "components/libqfaservices.so" (a hint by firefox
developer bryner) make the build work again so I guess this might indeed be
talkback related.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2.
3.

Actual Results:
output:
/opt/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 451: 10731 Segmentation fault "$prog" ${1+"$@"}


Expected Results:
Firefox start up normal.

This seems to be talkback related a it only happens with talkback enabled
build and removing the file "components/libqfaservices.so" make Firefox start
fine again. All build before March 28th work without making any changes.
