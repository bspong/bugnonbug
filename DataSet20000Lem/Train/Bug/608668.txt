We use a java / web based application which relies on mapserver to read and render spatial information in the form of polygons, line and points. To access the page, our application us a tab to access the map. previously in Firefox 3.6.11 this worked fine. After the update to 3.6.12 it is now broken, and immediately log out of the application completley (the apps own 'are you sure you wish to exit' dialog box) and return to the internal apps login web page. If you cancel the login you are presented with a dialog box which contains the text 'Session Timeout' Your mapping session ha timed out. To reconnect, press the button below' (button is labelled 'Reconnect') Pressing this button result in a blank window. This all happens instantly after each user interaction. There is no reason for any time out to occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login to internal java application which us mapserver to render a map in one part of the application
2. App immediatly asks if you are sure if you want to log out Either log out if you hit OK, or return the timeout error listed above if you hit cancel.
Actual Results:
Exactly the same behaviour

Expected Results:
Exactly the same (isn;t this the definition of insanity - doing the same thing and expecting a different result ;-)!)
