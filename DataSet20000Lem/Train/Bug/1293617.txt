[Out Of Date Notification] Notification bar is displayed for partner repack build
[Installation Notes]:
At the date on which this bug wa logged, the access to actual partner build is not available, but we were provided a dropbox link to download and test on a few:

acer-Firefox Setup 44.0.1.exe
aol-en-US-Firefox 44.0.dmg
aol-en-US-Firefox Setup 44.0.exe
webde-de-Firefox 44.0.2.dmg
webde-de-Firefox Setup 44.0.2.exe
yahoo-en-US-Firefox 44.0.dmg
yahoo-en-US-Firefox Setup 44.0.exe


[Description]:
Based on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1280378#c51 , the partner repacks shouldn't be affected by the OutOfDate notification system addon. Our understanding wa that at least for this release, the partner build would be ignored.


[Affected OS]:
We tested on Windows 8.1 and OSX 10.11 and normally it would affect all Operating systems. (not sure if there are partner repacks for Linux distropies)

[Steps]:
1. Install a Firefox partner repacked version 44.*.

2. Set Outofdate notification system add-on required configurations:
2.1 about:config set extensions.systemAddon.update.url to value "https://aus5.mozilla.org/update/3/SystemAddons/%VERSION%/%BUILD_ID%/%BUILD_TARGET%/%LOCALE%/release-sysaddon/%OS_VERSION%/%DISTRIBUTION%/%DISTRIBUTION_VERSION%/update.xml"
2.2 about:config set extensions.logging.enabled to value "True"
2.3 about:config Add string app.update.url.override with value "www.softvision.ro"
3. Set update preference -> about:preferences#advanced and set Firefox update to "Automatically install update (recommended: improved security)"
4. Open Tools/Web console and click on the gear icon to get to settings, then enable the following two options: "Enable browser chrome and add-on debugging toolboxes" and "Enable remote debugging".
5. Force system addons check : Open Tool/WebDeveloper/Browser Console and run the snippet: " Components.utils.import("resource://gre/modules/AddonManager.jsm"); AddonManagerPrivate.backgroundUpdateCheck(); "
6. Restart FF.
7. Click on the Download Firefox OutofDate Notification and check the download link.

[Actual Result]:
Step 6: The OutOfDate system addon is installed and ran. The OutOfDate notification bar is displayed.
Step 7: The OutOfDate system addon download button will redirect you to download a stock Firefox versioned at it's last version.

[Expected Result]:
The Partner Repack build should ignore the OutOfDate Notification bar or the Download Firefox should redirect you in this case to a link that will allow you to download an up to date partner repack.

[Note]:
Not sure how many partner repacks there are out there for the 44.* build or what exactly is the telemetry data with regard to partner repacks and version 44.*.
