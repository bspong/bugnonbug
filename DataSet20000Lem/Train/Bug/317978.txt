In a browser, if u open some standard url like - msn.com it work fine.
Then on tab u open url which is not present a wrong url by mistake, like colbsuite.com
This result in hang and Browser doe not responds even if u wait for some time.
Fow which i have to use Task manager and End task, a it is not responding. This in turn close all Firefox browser that are opened up.

This behaviour is seen mostly wheenever by mistake u enter wrong web address, which doe not exist.
This result in closer of all Firefox browser open, so loosing all other page that were open.

Sometimes by chance u enter wrong url address, always result is hanging, and not responding. End task result in all browser closer.

This should not happen, like in IE , when u enter wrong address, it take to search page and suggest look for correct url.
