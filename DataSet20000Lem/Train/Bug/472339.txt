Firefox 3 not listed in Windows Default Programs

When I had Firefox 2 installed everything wa OK but after installing Firefox 3 I've noticed that Firefox is missing from the Windows Default Programs list. After some researching and comparing registry entry for Firefox 2 and 3 I wa able to fix the problem.
Here's what I found out:
Basically the problem is in the two registry key FirefoxHTML and FirefoxURL.
In Firefox 2 the (Default) value for the key
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML\shell\open\command
and
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxURL\shell\open\command
are set to
"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -requestPending -osint -url "%1".
In Firefox 3 the (Default) value for those key are empty.
Also in Firefox 2 the (Default) value for the key
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML\DefaultIcon
and
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxURL\DefaultIcon
are set to
C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe,1.
In Firefox 3 those value are set to C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox,1.
Changing the value back to the way they were in Firefox 2 fix the problem.
