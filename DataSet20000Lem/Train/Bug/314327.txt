I found something weird shopping on the internet. I placed multiple order on EBgames (www.ebgames.com). I wanted to cancelled some of them but wa never able to do so. The site always return a message saying that it is not able to process the cancellation. I though first that it wa the site that ha a problem. But then I tried with Internet Explorer and everything went fine.

To test my theory, I place a few order using firefox and try to cancelled them. I have never been able to cancel any of the order using firefox. The same test with Internet Explorer work correctly.

It's even a case where Internet Explorer is faster then Firefox. Everything go fast with IE but Firefox seems to be lagging.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Place an order on www.ebgames.com
2. Try to cancel it (it won't work)
3. Cancel it with Internet Explorer (it will work)

Actual Results:
When using firefox, the site say that it is not able to process the cancellation.

Expected Results:
The order should be cancelled.
