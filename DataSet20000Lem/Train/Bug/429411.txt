table column mis-aligned or shifted under wrong header (extra column inserted?)

When I display a table from the N-central application it creates a series of column with header on top. The error is that the data in the column get shifted to the right of the header value. For example, the data under in a column is for HTTP status but the header at the top is for MBSDA 2.0. Also the data for second following column is Memory status but the header above it is Paper Supply Level. It's a if the column got shifted one column to the right but the header remained the same. It's possible an extra column of blank data wa inserted in a column to the left of the shifted ones. (Columns and heading on the far left are consistent. It's not apparent where the error occured.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the application.

Actual Results:
The table wa displayed with the error every time I loaded it in Firefox3b5. The page displayed correctly every time I loaded it in Firefox2.00.13.

Expected Results:
The table should have loaded with the correct column under the corresponding headers.

Note that this behavior cannot be reproduced in Firefox2.00.13. That version work correctly.

The error behavior is consistent with every page load in Firefox3b5. I haven't checked the behavior with the default theme. I will check it after submitting and if the error persists, will upload a screen capture and source for the frame.
