Cookie preference to ask before setting a cookie is confusing in 0.10 (1.0PR)

Maybe I just need to get a good night sleep, but I don't remember being
confused by the wording in the cookie privacy setting until now when I
installed 0.10 (1.0PR) and almost freeked out thinking the cookie management
feature had been cut down from .93.

Basically, the wording "keep cookies" really confused me. I always set Firefox
and Mozilla before it to ask me before setting a cookie. I normally then tell
it to make my decision persistent.

With 0.10 (1.0PR), I got confused because "keep cookies" did not mean the same
thing to me a setting them in the first place. I just happend to look through
it and see "ask every time", but then I wa wondering why I'd want to be asked
every time if I wanted to keep a cookie? I wanted to just be asked if I wanted
the cookie set in the first place. I don't know if the wording changed between
.93 and this new release, but it confused me a to what it wa going to do. When
I read it, it didn't sound like it wa the same feature I wa looking for.
