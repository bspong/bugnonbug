After Firefox ha been running awhile, auto-complete stop working
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6 GTB6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

If I leave my Firefox session(s) up for more than 30 mins, when I try to use auto-complete it fails to work. In other words, when I click on and empty sigh-on / password combination my list of user id's and password is no longer available (but if I type in a userid it will then auto-complete the password). This is extremely annoying and started a few update back. I keep hoping each update will fix this but so far nothing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create multiple account on a site with password
2.Go to the site and click on user if field (all account will appear in dropdown)
3.Now leave Firefox up for 30 min or more and go back to that site and click on the user id field (no list is available)
Actual Results:
No list appears like this site wa never set up for any account or uto-complete is broken or ha lost form data

Expected Results:
A list of account should appear
