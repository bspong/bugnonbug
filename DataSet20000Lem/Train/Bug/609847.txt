today i took in lime wire and while configuring it my computer hang so i restarted it only to find Mozilla would go up in the window task manager barely using enough ram and when it pooped up like a message would dissapear the next second barely enough time to read or see anything then it start gathering ram again and again. i reinstalled it (always keep the installation) then it doe it again, i am now using a different new account so i can deduce if it a virus of some sort so far the same nagging go on till i eject the modem. it doesn't affect Google chrome or internet explorer so I'm guessing a targeted thing since everything else is working well. i am willing to give hack and fix access to this computer whenever you're ready.
