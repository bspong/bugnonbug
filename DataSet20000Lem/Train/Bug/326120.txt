Within the last 10-14 day I upgraded to the following version:

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

After upgrading, when I try to add a bookmark to a folder in my bookmark file, usually you can choose from the last several folder that you added bookmark to, yet now after the upgrade the folder prior to the upgrade are frozen in the Add Bookmarks window. Instead of the most recent folder bookmark were added to being put into the Add Bookmarks window, you have to open the full bookmark folder via the tab in the Add Bookmarks window and scroll down to the folder you wish to add the bookmark to each time. Usually you can do this via the last several "most recently used/added to folders" in the Add Bookmarks window, yet when they're frozen from the last upgrade, it has'nt been possible. Please e-mail me with any question that you may have if I'm not clear enough on this here. Thanks for you help and for having the best browser out there!
