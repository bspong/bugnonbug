User-Agent: Opera/9.63 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en) Presto/2.1.1

W2K3 rc2 domain with roaming profile set up via group policy for client computers.
client computer have window xp sp3 with jan 2009 updates,
domain users' application setting & profile are on the server shared with the right permission for each user.

firefox 2.0.** wa previously used on these machines, after the upgrade to firefox 3.0.** problem started.

i have tried uninstalling firefox 2.0.**, clean install of firefox 3.0.**, installing firefox 3.0.** on top of firefox 2.0.**.
since the client computer were patched in stage (not all computer received microsoft jan 2009 update at the same time ) i do not believe that window patch and hotfixes are the cause of this problem.

i resolved slow loading of firefox 3.0.** by starting (logged in to the client computer AS the user who us the computer) "firefox -P" deleting the profile, while noting down the exact path to profile. copy the user profile from the server to local client computer. then create a new profile and use local path of the profile instead of unc to the server.

now firefox load up fast and store page settings/does not start with "welcome to firefox"



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use w2k3 server with active directory and join a client computer to a domain.
2.use group policy to set up roaming profile on a server eg. //server/profiles/%USERNAME%/
3.install firefox on the client computer with local-admin/domain-admin/power-user/elevated priveleges
starting firefox on the client computer is slow and every time you start firefox, firefox open "welcome to firefox.." tab

Actual Results:
starting firefox on the client computer is slow and every time you start firefox, firefox open "welcome to firefox.." tab

Expected Results:
firefox should be faster - a fast a firefox 2.0.** to start, and not display the "welcome to firefox" tab every time you run firefox.

i assume that either the profile are getting corrupted/not loaded properly, or the updated firefox firefox 3.0.** ha trouble accessing profile via unc path.

this is probably not the right place to reccomend stuff but:

if mozilla would release an msi or some easyli scriptable install of firefox that can be installed via group policy silently and silently updated.
the footprint of firefox in the enterprise would increase dramatically.
