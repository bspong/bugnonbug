I have had recurring problem with JavaScript being completely inoperable. I have JavaScript enabled, and have never installed the NoScript extension. It ha been happening on and off across all site for the past couple week in FF RC1 and RC2. A restart (of browser or computer) doe not specifically fix the problem. However, it doe go away after an unknown time (days usually).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
This work nearly all of the time.
1. Watch long Flash movie (>30mins)
2. Navigate to another page.

However, that isn't the only time it's occurred for me. Beyond the above example, I have not been able to detect any discernible pattern.
Actual Results:
JavaScript doe not work: Flash video don't load; redirects, javascript function don't work, website tag the browser a not having javascript enabled.

Expected Results:
JavaScript working.

I do have the Web Developer toolbar installed. From the latest nonfunctional site (www.dhl.com), I do have the following warning in the error console:

That site is not the problem, a it work in FF 2 on Linux and wa working in the same Windows FF 3 RC2 browser within the past week.
