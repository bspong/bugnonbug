When i login to the website it give message ''Flash player 7 or later plugin required'' However it is already installed

When trying to login to certain websites, such a www.meezanbank.com when i login, it say flash player 7 or greater required. even when I Install flash player latest (10 i think) for firefox, and go to the website it again tell me that flash player 7 or greater plugin required.

This seems some compatibility issue.

Note: this happens on firefox browser running on window vista only. (on Windows XP it worked fine). The problem ha been checked on two different PCS both running firefox . One running window visat business edition and the other running window vista home premium.

On window xp, it work completely fine.

pls investigate.

thanks
