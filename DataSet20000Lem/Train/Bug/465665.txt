When Minefield is closed with a "fancy" web page open, instead of exiting cleanly it say it returned code 11, and sleep for 300 second before exiting with code 11.

I don't know exactly what "fancy" means, because I haven't extensively tested it. However, example of "fancy" web site are Facebook and User Friendly (the webcomic, "userfriendly.org". An example of a "non-fancy" web site (that doesn't cause this bug) is Google.

In case it matters, I ran Minefield from terminal window - ./firefox from objdir/dist/bin

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Minefield.
2. Navigate to a "fancy" web site, see above.
3. Close Minefield. (I've found this bug whether I use the "close window" button or "file->quit".)
Actual Results:
Minefield returned control to the terminal from which I had run it, which said it wa "Sleeping for 300 seconds", after which it exited with code 11. ("echo $?" printed out 11.)

Expected Results:
Normally, including after exiting from non-fancy sites, Minefield would print out message ending with listing mAlloc, mFree, and other counts, and would return code 0.
