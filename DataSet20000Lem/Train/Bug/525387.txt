PDF file are not properly created by Firefox when attempt to print and printer selected is Adobe PDF (running ver. Acrobat 9.0). All line are truncated and print only a abnormally narrowed (excessively wide margins, with information beyond margin lost).

Lines are truncated and the page width is greatly shortened so that line
that otherwise fill a full page when viewed a HTML in the browser only print the first few characters, generating PDF's numerous (narrow) page even when the original document is only a short 1 page.

It would appear that erroneous header information is being passed that fails to set up page margin correctly or correctly size the page.

All page printed are viewed with very large magnification factor (eg. ~ 800%)and with numerous (usually greater than 20-50 pages) page even for very short documents.

Although this problem ha appeared on my system (Dell XPS 1330 laptop) upon
upgrade to Windows7 and to Acrobat 9.0, everything wa running fine on a previous version of Firefox running on this machine under Windows Vista and using Acrobat 8.0.
