Firefox 3.5 beta4 always downloads incomplete files, even though it say downloads have completed successfully
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b5pre) Gecko/20090513 Ubuntu/8.10 (intrepid) Shiretoko/3.5b5pre

I have reproduced it not only in Ubuntu, but within Windows XP, too. The problem is that if I try to download a file using the right-click menu option, "save link as", the file start to download, but it finish too soon. The download manager say the download is successfully complete, but the file is not complete. For instance, a podcast episode of 11Mb and 20 minute long, is downloaded a a 3Mb file; if I play the mp3 file, the show suddenly stop when only 4-5 minute of play have passed. IMPORTANT: If I download the same file, from the same website, using the "DownThemAll!" add-on, the download is completed with no issue at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a website with file to download.
2.Right-click and "save link as" on a link to the file you want to download.
3.Watch the download progress.
Actual Results:
The download process finish before the file is completely downloaded. The download manager tell me that the download is complete, though.

Expected Results:
Firefox 3.5 beta 4 should have downloaded the full file, a all the previous version of Firefox I've used did.

As I said, I've reproduced this bug using Firefox beta 4 within Windows XP SP3. Theme were default, both in Ubuntu and Windows.
