scroll bar wont work with mouse scrolling

Starting with FF 4 Beta 7, the scroll bar at the right hand side wont respond to scroll event from a mouse. One ha to point the mouse pointer on the scroll bar and pull it up/down with a left click on the mouse.

The scroll bar inside a webpage (just a the one that you have in the "Component" row of this page is also not responding)

All other major browser like Chrome, IE and Opera respond to mouse scroll event properly.

I have cleared the cache and cookies, started in safe mode... but nothing works. No google toolbar and most of the add-on are disabled in FF 4 beta versions. Some are still running though. But I dont think the problem ha anything to do with the third party add-on installed.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any webpage which is larger than one screen size.
2. Try to scroll up or down with mouse scroll pointer.
Actual Results:
Scrolling doe not happen

Expected Results:
Browser should respond to scroll event from the mouse.

I have tried with the default theme, different theme installed. No change in the behavior.
