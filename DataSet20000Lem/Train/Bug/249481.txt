The new feature of right-clicking inside edit box in forms, allowing you to
save the search a a bookmark keywords, radically change the way user can
easily save their favorite search-sites.

Mycroft search will probably become le important. They don't work for
form that use HTTP POST instead of GET. They are too complicated to set up
for non-tech users.

So, I think it would be great if the search box on the toolbar wa not
exclusively dedicated to Google + Mycroft searches. I think user-defined
search really should be able to be accessed from that search box a an extra
search engine.

- There would be ONE "saved-search" concept;
- There would be TWO way of setting them up: user-defined by right-clicking
on field in form AND server based pre-prepared Mycroft searches;
- There would be TWO way of accessing these searches: bookmark keywords (for
turbo-geeks) AND an engine icon on the toolbar search box (for home users).

I think the current double-concept (one thing is a Mycroft search, another is
a user-defined search) is un-necessary, un-natural and reduces user options.
