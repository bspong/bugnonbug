i find that 1 or 2 bookmark folder rename themselves after i have exported the bookmark to html. I do this frequently and happens each time and i only observe the bookmark toolbar folders.

It is then hard to rename the changed folder a there is not a contextual menu to do so. You end up having to create a new folder copy the bookmark into that folder and place that folder in the correct place.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have alot of bookmark folder in the bookmark toolbar
2. export the bookmark to html using "organize bookmarks"
3. observe
Actual Results:
i refuse to isolate this bug, hopefully it's just my computer since it is such a long problem to rectify.

Expected Results:
usually 1 bookmark in the bookmark toolbar will have been renamed

need to check bookmark and folder of bookmark stay unchanged after a given operation.

n.b. my screen is almost exclusively folder in the bookmark toolbar.
