Add test to ensure left-pane root are not being uploaded
Last week I wa node reassigned and the validator reports:

The following server record appear on the server but should not have been uploaded:

> parentName bmkUri title type id parentid
> "" "place:type=6&sort=1" "Tags" "query" "xU8oxC8ElvXe" "RNbMfCYexPrO"
> "" "" "folder" "RNbMfCYexPrO" "places"
> "" "place:transition=7&sort=4" "Downloads" "query" "qxzQheWXp8h5" "RNbMfCYexPrO"
> "All Bookmarks" "place:folder=UNFILED_BOOKMARKS" "query" "nzQMCYwycYE0" "1CO3BVLzwdZu"
> "All Bookmarks" "place:folder=BOOKMARKS_MENU" "query" "iJIoapijH2ec" "1CO3BVLzwdZu"
> "" "place:type=3&sort=4" "History" "query" "GquE4bu81hW-" "RNbMfCYexPrO"
> "All Bookmarks" "place:folder=TOOLBAR" "query" "6fAQIVpYcTVz" "1CO3BVLzwdZu"
> "" "All Bookmarks" "folder" "1CO3BVLzwdZu" "RNbMfCYexPrO"

This account ha only been used by 2 device both running Nightly (and Android, but that shouldn't be relevant). Given the node reassignment, these must have been uploaded over the last couple of weeks. Sadly I don't have log for the outgoing record, but do have on for incoming:

> Sync.Engine.Bookmarks TRACE Incoming: { id: 1CO3BVLzwdZu index: 0 modified: 1489475878.79 ttl: undefined payload: {"parentName":"","children":["6fAQIVpYcTVz","iJIoapijH2ec","nzQMCYwycYE0"],"title":"All Bookmarks","type":"folder","id":"1CO3BVLzwdZu","parentid":"RNbMfCYexPrO"} collection: bookmark }
> Sync.Engine.Bookmarks TRACE Reconciling 1CO3BVLzwdZu. exists=true; modified=false; local age=null; incoming age=5990.299999952316
> Sync.Engine.Bookmarks TRACE Finding mapping: , fAll Bookmarks
> Sync.Engine.Bookmarks TRACE No dupe found for key fAll Bookmarks/undefined.
> Sync.Engine.Bookmarks TRACE Ignoring incoming item because the local item is identical.
> Sync.Engine.Bookmarks TRACE Skipping reconciled incoming item 1CO3BVLzwdZu

It appears our attempt at handling these aren't working a we expect.
