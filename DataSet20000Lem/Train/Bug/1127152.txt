Runtime Monitor: Support exporting JSON log of timestamped data point
I work on the Gaia Email app and we get a lot of bug filed relating to the email app being involved in stuff where the OOM killer kill the email app or all the other apps, etc. In these case a screenshot of the Runtime Monitor (or from firewatch) tends to be the easiest way for me to get data from the bug reporter (usually QA people happy to help) to help identify what is going on.

It would be great if in this situation I could have them export a JSON log and attach it to a bug instead of a screenshot. Core reasons:

- Less need to manually correlate the screenshot with the timestamped logcat (and squint and estimate pixel position using gimp, etc.)

- Less worry about the effective scaling level of the monitor's graph. (Unfortunately, on nightly, the monitor hang for me after about 3 minute and the entire WebIDE seems to die a well so I have to restart the browser. So I'm not clear if the runtime is a sliding window like firewatch after a certain point, or if it's always trying to show all the data point all the time. I kinda like the idea of "all the data points", but if so, it could make screenshots pretty hard! :)

If the devtools are already listening for the GC notification that happen, those would be great to include. It is super handy to know when we're dealing with a MEM_PRESSURE gc version a COMPONENT_UTILS, versus etc.

And in the event the monitor ever start capturing logcat a well, they could then both go in the same handy log.


I know the team is pretty busy kicking as already, so if this is something I can help out with, I'd be happy to, just sorta point me in the direction you want me to go. Thanks!
