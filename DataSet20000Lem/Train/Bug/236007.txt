Page take many minute to display when image fail to load

I see this problem often when using google cache to see a page when the original
server is unavailable. The page will partly render, up until the point that
some image need to be loaded from the original site. Then the page will just
sit there for a number of minutes. Eventually, the image load timeout and the
rest of the page is rendered, but that can take an unacceptably long time.

This happens reproducably when the site where the image are located isn't
responding to the TCP connection request. Since the site isn't returning a
"connection refused", Mozilla just wait around in case it eventually responds.
There's nothing wrong with that, but from a usability point of view, the rest
of the page really should be rendered without the image that are holding thing
up. If the image load continues in the background, and doe eventually succeed,
the page could be re-rendered.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit given URL, which is a google cache URL of www.fvwm.org homepage
2. To simulate condition of bug report, www.fvwm.org need to be not
responding to TCP connection requests. (not connection refused, but simply
no response at all) This could be simulated by using firewall or host file if
the site come back up.

Actual Results:
The google cache banner appears, the rest of the page with missing image symbol
appears 5 minute later (I didn't time it, but 5 minute seems about right.)

Expected Results:
The page should render without the image much more quickly.
