everything worked well, but today when starting Firefox all my toolbar setting - except for the navigation toolbar - dissapeared, except 3 items. (Instead of 4 bar only 3 remained.)
However, asking a new window brought all the setting (incl. add-ons) back.(now 4 bar again) Everything work a normal.
Note: I cannot find all of the item back in the customize window(view)in the starting window,though they don't appear in the toolbar. As a result I cannot reset them.

Asking a new window and replacing all of the item in the toolbar back in the customize window (view) wa resulting only in losing all of the toolbar setting in the new window to. After trying to repair it bij closing and restarting Firefox several times, suddenly all my setting were back again, but only when asking for a new window.
