Occasionally right-clicking on link to, say, open a new tab, doe not work within Firefox under Windows 7 x64. From my experience, this usually occurs after about twenty minute of use. Right-clicking in all other program and Windows Explorer continues to work, however.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate website for a while.
2. Attempt to right-click on a link to open a new tab, etc.
3. Right click fails to operate within Firefox, but function in all other program and Windows Explorer.
Actual Results:
Right-clicking fails to work after a period of time surfing the internet.

Expected Results:
The software should allow me to right-click on link and open new tab via that route the entire time I am browsing web pages. I have switched to Google Chrome until there is an update to Firefox (which pain me).

I wa using the default Firefox theme and do not have any extra currently operating.
