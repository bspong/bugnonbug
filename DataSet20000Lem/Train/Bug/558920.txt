Profile Manager only prompt on initial profile after upgrading to Firefox 3.6.3
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Prior to upgrading to Firefox 3.6.3 - I had Profile Manager setup to start per the following
"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" -ProfileManager

Profile Manager would always prompt when starting from the above a long a there were profile available that had not been started.

After upgrading to 3.6.3 the week of 2010_04_05-09, Profile Manager only prompt if Firefox is not running any profiles, i.e. not running.

I did not nor do not have the "Do Not Prompt" box checked in Profile Manager.

Windows Task manager only show the same ProcessID.

Clicking the link from a shortcut or running the link from RUN just open another Firefox window with the same Windows Task Manager ProcessID.

I can no longer get separate Firefox process to start.

It behaves a if there is only one profile and the Do Not Prompt box is checked
in Profile Manager.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Kill Firefox
2.Clicking the link from a shortcut or running the link from RUN just open another Firefox window with the same Windows Task Manager ProcessID.

Actual Results:
I can no longer get separate Firefox process to start.

It behaves a if there is only one profile and the Do Not Prompt box is checked
in Profile Manager.

Expected Results:
I have multiple profile in Profile Manager -

I destroyed all the previous profile and created new ones.

Same thing - only one Profile Manager prompt and after that no more prompt to select other profiles.
