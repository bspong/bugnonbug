If you click on the search bar, and it is not focused, it selects all the text in the search bar, so that you can write over the selected text. This is OK. But the incorrect behavior is that when you put the mouse cursor over the search bar (when it is not focused) it show the IBeam cursor instead of the Arrow cursor. The IBeam cursor indicates that you can click and the input cursor is positioned exactly where you clicked, but in this case this is not what happens, because the whole text get selected. I hope my description is clear. If you don't understand what I mean you can compare how the mouse cursor is when you put it over the search bar on the Internet Explorer. They have correct behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox and put the mouse over the search bar and the cursor should be showing an arrow instead of IBeam
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Mouse cursor show IBeam

Expected Results:
Mouse cursor should show Arrow
