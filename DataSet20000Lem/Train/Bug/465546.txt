if I have say 4 tab open to website and no blank tab open in vista sp1 or xp sp3, different hardware same version firefox (3.0.4) and I press ctrl+t from keyboard, nothing happens. I have to go to the file menu and select the new tab option. then ctrl+t work fine unless I close all the empty tabs. when I close the empty tab and press ctrl+t again, nothing happens. so now I set my homepage to include an empty tab so that I am always able to open a new tab with the ctrl+t shortcut instead of having to use the file new tab menu option. the only thing I recall changing recently is that I had set my start option to 'show my window and tab from the last time'

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox to default homepage
2. close empty/blank tab
Actual Results:
1. press ctrl+t nothing happens
2. file->new tab, then press ctrl+t and new tab open

Expected Results:
well it used to be a long a firefox had focus if I pressed ctrl+t a blank tab would open. it work in ie7 so I've been using ie but I hate it so would like to see firefox working or to know what option I need to set for it to work normally

thank you for your time, I LOVE Firefox!!
