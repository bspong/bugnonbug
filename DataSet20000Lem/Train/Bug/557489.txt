Hi all,

I've been having an issue with Firefox freezing on me (apparently randomly) every time I make use of the browser. It doesn't happen instantly, but doe over time (15 minute or so I would guess). It doesn't matter what website I am browsing, it seems to happen regardless. Same go for uploading/downloading. Firefox doesn't respond at all when it freeze (I left it on all last night a a test to see if it would come back after freezing, but it didn't). So I'm forced to shut down the app using Task Manager & restarting that way.

I have the latest version of Firefox. I'm running Windows XP SP3 on a Lenovo IBM Thinkpad R61e (2.1Ghz dualcore, 3Gb RAM).

I have disabled all add-on to see if they were causing the issue, but that made no difference to the freezing. So I can assume they aren't the problem.

I have uninstalled & reinstalled Firefox, but that made no difference either. So basically I don't know what else to do. This only really started happening a couple of week ago, so perhaps it ha something to do with one of the recent Firefox updates? I love Firefox so I'm really keen to get this solved somehow. But if the freezing continues I'll be forced to use another browser (which I really don't want to do!) to keep my sanity. Many thanks for your help.

Michael.
