Whenever I check for update to my extension and theme manually, the checkbox
to autocheck for update to my extension and theme is automatically unchecked.
Even though I sometimes like to check for update manually doesn't mean I would
like to check manually _all_ the time....

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up DPa1
2. Go to Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Update
3. Check the box labeled "My Extensions and Themes"
4. Click the "Check Now..." button under the aforementioned checkbox
5. Click the "Finish" or "Cancel" button to exit the update window (doesn't
matter if it's done checking or not)
6. Notice that now the "My Extensions and Themes" checkbox is unchecked.


Expected Results:
The autoupdate extension and theme checkbox should have remained checked (FF
1.0.4 doe this perfectly).
