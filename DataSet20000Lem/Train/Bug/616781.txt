Hi...

I got this problem for 2 years.. I still use Firefox/2.0.0.20, only for this reason.. when i update to 3 or higher and I search google image for let say "King Kong ".. the thumb show up blank with little read cross in corner, and i can read in bottom bar that it is loading gstatic1 or gstatic2 or gstatic3 ( this is different each search)After a while the thumb show and keep doing this for a while when looking next result pages..but mostly after 4 - 5 page again it start acting like described above... when go back to Firefox/2.0.0.20 the problem is gone..all thumb show up at once after hitting search button and no problem with the gstatic stuff... I read a lot of solution in forum and blogs.. I tried almost each of them, but it just don't work.... I checked plenty of time for mallware, virus spyware..etc..etc.. I deleted firefox completely..with all subfolders using Your uninstaller.... I don't know what else i can do ... Can someone help me please ???
