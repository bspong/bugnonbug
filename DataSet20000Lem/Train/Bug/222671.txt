Neverending stream of browser window open after attempting to open an octet/stream file when open file automatically option is set and file doe not exist
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20030916

Mozilla Firebird open a never ending stream of new browser window it is
selected a the application to open an unknown file type (octet/stream in this
case).

The file I wa trying to open doe exist but even on IE, it took several
refreshes before the file would load. For that reason, I do not know if this
behavior is caused because the file can not be found or if it happens even when
the file exists. I wasn't able to find any other octet/stream file to test further.

If the "Do this automatically for file like this from now on" is selected for
the file type, Firebird will attempt to open the file, fail(?), and then proceed
to open another browser window. It doe this continuously and without user
input. I tried to use Alt-F4 command to close the latest window so the process
would stop, but it keep going anyway. I eventually ended the task using
Window's Task Manager. I never let the process continue longer than a minute but
even by then, it had opened more than 25 new windows.

The error also exists if the browser is set to prompt you for each download. In
this scenario, simply pressing the OK button on the download prompt with
Firebird selected a the program to use will open another browser window with
yet another download prompt. The user can continue to select the OK button to
repeat the behavior described above but with more control. Pressing the Cancel
button will stop the process.

I wa able to reproduce this error on Mozilla 1.5 but the build is more than two
week old (09/26/2003). This version of Firebird is 10 day old.
