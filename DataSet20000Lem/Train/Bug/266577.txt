FireFox (0.10.1) ha a compatibility problem with CodeTek VirtualDesktop Pro
(3.1) - that I'll call "CTVD" from now on - on my PowerBook 800 DVI (Titanium)
with 768 MB of RAM, running Mac OS X 10.3.5:

If CTVD is running when I launch FireFox, I get lot of memory leak logged to
console.log:

That's what I get when I just launch FireFox and let it log my homepage. Then,
the last line repeat each time I take it to the front. I'm not sure what
trigger the others, but they also happen again and again a I use it, rapidly
filling up my console.log.

When I quit CTVD before launching FireFox, the only thing that's logged is the line:

/Volumes/DOCS_Ti/Applications/INTERNET/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin:
can't map file: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Java Applet.plugin ((os/kern) invalid
argument)



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run CodeTek VirtualDesktop Pro
2. Launch FireFox
3. Check console.log: lot of leak are logged
4. Quit FireFox and CTVD
5. Launch FireFox
6. Check console.log: leak are no longer logged.

Actual Results:
See Details

Expected Results:
It shouldn't have logged all these memory leaks.
