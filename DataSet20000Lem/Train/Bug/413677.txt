Issue started with build 2008011604 and continues through latest trunk a of this report.

When opening link intended for new tab the following behavior ensues:
1. New tab in current window opens, but is blank
2. New full (toobars included, not pop-up style) window open with desired content.

The behavior doe not exist with a clean profile (i.e. no extension installed).

From my observation it is not linked to any particular extension a I have tried narrowing it down, but rather occurs after the 8th or 9th extension is installed. Others have indicated the behavior being resolved by removing a specific extension (though I do not use that particular extension) so is not valid in my case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install latest trunk (2008011604 or newer)
2. Set browser option to open in new tab
3. Test link intended to open in new window to ensure desired behavior (e.g. google reader link to full article).
4. Install 9 extension and restart browser
5. Test link intended to open in new window to see undesirable behavior.

Note: Right click on link, open in new tab work a desired
Actual Results:
new blank tab in current window open
new window open with intended content

Expected Results:
new tab in current window should open with desired content.
