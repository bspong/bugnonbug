I am unable to hear any audio whilst using Firefox at all. This range from simple click whilst navigating in Firefox, to no sound whilst watching video on Youtube, or playing on Flash/Java games. All these sound are present whilst using Internet Explorer, but disappear on Firefox. It is impossible to play MP3 file (using, for example, the Quicktime Plugin), and any attempt to open an MP3 file in a window give a white, blank page, and the tab hangs. When trying to open PDF document inside the browser, they do not display at all, and all that is seen is a white page, and again, the tab hangs.

Firefox also doesn't appear to recognize my sound card, a when trying to load a page with a Sibelius Scorch plugin (see http://www.sibeliusmusic.com for an example), no sound play back at all, and when trying to choose which audio device to have the plugin use, neither my soundcard, nor my keyboard (Yamaha PSR-3000) is displayed in the list. The sound should play back a a MIDI file, and although the plugin display perfectly well, it refuse to play.

Finally, Firefox doe not download .exe file at all (such a a Flash Installer). The 'Save File' dialog box display correctly, but when i choose a location and file name and click OK, the box disappears, the file is not downloaded, and there is no history of this in the download manager. When I right-click the link and 'Save Link As', whereas this allows me to download most type of file, when attempting to download .exe files, I get the following error message:

C:\_Pathname_\application.exe could not be saved, because you cannot change the content of that folder. Change the folder property and try again, or try saving in a different location.

This display no matter what filename I set, or where I try to save it to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. N/A - Always present



I have already tried the Wavemapper registry edit to get audio back in a Flash plugin, but this did not work. I have un-installed and re-installed Flash, Firefox, and my audio card driver, but it ha not helped. The problem is definitely Firefox based, a only this programme is affected
