When I am closing Firefox down I have it set up to ask me before it clear my private data.
It come up with a 'Clear Private Data' window and I have to click on it to confirm that I want the clearing to continue.
The relevant button is dark blue so I should be able to just hit the enter button. However this doe not work and I have to click with a mouse. This is inconvenient for me but for some user will not be possible.
Alos the tab button should work to move to the other button.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run on a Mac OS X
2.On the preference privacy tab tick both box on private data
3.press apple+q to close firefox down
4.Try and hit enter rather than clicking with a mouse
5.Try tabbing to the other button
Actual Results:
Nothing

Expected Results:
Hit enter should clear private data
Hit tab should move to other button
