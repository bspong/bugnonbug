Clipboard, Toolbar customization wont work after automatic update
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2

After Firefox automatically updated to version 1.5.0.2 from version 1.5.0.1 the clipboard ha stopped functioning. Nothing can be copied within firefox, though content copied from outside application can be pasted into firefox.

I cannot customize the toolbar, drag/drop item into toolbar not working.
link cannot be dragged into bookmark toolbar.

I tried doing a clean reinstall after deleting all existing registry key and all application data. But still the problem exist.
This is happening for the first time to me in the last 1 year with firefox.

I am using Windows Xp Pro with Service Pack 2 on a Intel P4 machine



Reproducible: Always




I wa using theme Noia 2.0. But the bug exists with default theme also. I uninstalled Noia to check that.
I am using extension
1) Fasterfox
2) Flashgot
3) Forecastfox
4) Foxytunes
5) Tab Mix plus
6) Google toolbar
7) Gmail Manager

These all were installed before automatic update also. The problem started after the automatic update.

I cannot even copy/paste the about:buildconfig from the adjacent window.

about:buildconfig

Now i did that by saving the page then opened it with IE6.0 and then pasted it here.
