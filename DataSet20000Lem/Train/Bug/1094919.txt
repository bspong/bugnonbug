Can't purge Sync History.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0

Steps to reproduce:

On the pas to switch to upgrade to new Sync, I want to purge the data in the server before I create a new account with a new mail.


Actual results:

I can't get rid of the quota showing 1.1MB of data whatever method I try. No more History data is Sync'd down to the "Laptop". Whatever I choose "Fusion" (locally wiped to 0 bytes, even deleted Places.sqlite in both profiles), or even I check "Deselect item to stop sync and make room on the server", or even "Replace data of my other device with them of this one". In this last case I'm warned to confirm a list of device whose data will be erased, which are 4 different case name for the same current "DESK Home". All this after I ended in downgrading the 2 pc's to FF28 and changed the password on both, I see 3 phantom device from the Laptop ("DESK home","Desk Home", and a second "DESK home") in addition to the current real ok "DESK Home". From "DESK Home" I see "Laptop" ok, and the same 3 phantom ("DESK home","Desk Home", and a second "DESK home").


Expected results:

Just wipe data on server. What is the path please?
