Content preference (Advanced font or language) not saved
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 2013062200

Steps to reproduce:

Using Firefox 22, installed today with OpenSUSE Yast2 rpm update, I decided to tweak two content preference settings. Under Edit/Preferences/Content, I selected Fonts & Colors/Advanced and changed my monospace font from Bitstream Vera Sans Mono to DejaVu Sans Mono and clicked OK. In Languages/Choose... I added Norwegian(no) and Russian (ru) to the end of the list and clicked OK. I closed the preference tab and resumed browsing and soon restarted the browser.



Actual results:

The font and language change were not saved. When the process wa repeated, the font and language setting had their former, unchanged values. Other preference that are changed without popups seem to be saved properly. Changing the font and language setting with about:config also work just fine. Changing, for example, an advanced font setting and clicking OK, and then immediately bringing up the change popup again show the unchanged value. It's a though the OK button is being treated like Cancel.


Expected results:

The changed preference should have been saved.
