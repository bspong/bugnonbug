Suggestion, not a "bug"

Please accept my apology, but I could NOT find where to input suggestions, so I ended up coming here.

If you are familiar with Opera, you will know immediately what I am talking about, namely "remembering" the last set of tab that were open / being used when Opera wa closed; not abnormally closed, but simply closed. I would like to suggest mozilla consider incorporating this into firefox to even remember (presumably cached??) the set of tab that were open when firefox is simply closed, not forceably closed on a crash, etc. Opening with the previously open tab can be a user selected option when firefox is launched.

I know we can go back thru a laundry list of history to do the same thing. but caching this list of URLs is a lot quicker and more user friendly.

I like firefox and it is the browser I use the most. Thanks for a great product.
