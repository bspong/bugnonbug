Computer suddenly forced to restart when bookmark clicked

I installed Firefox about a week ago on my Windows 2000 computer, and everything wa fine.

Today I installed trial version of the following software:

Photoshop CS2
Illustrator CS
iView Media Pro
ACDSee
Dreamweaver 8
Flash 8
QuarkXpress 6.5

I also installed the SP4 service pack for Windows.

A short while after all of this downloading and installing, I opened firefox, clicked on a bookmark in the bookmark bar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), and before I knew it my computer had restarted.

Just before it restarts, a blue error screen come up, but it come on and go off so quickly that I can't read it all. It say something like "unexpected kernel crash".

I've tried uninstalling and then re-installing Firefox but I've had no luck, it still happens.

The restart only seems to happen when I click on my Wikipedia bookmark, but not with the other bookmarks.

I have AVG antivirus software since before I had Firefox, and I just downloaded a firewall because I wa being hacked. I've scanned my computer and found no viruses, and the restart still occurs with the firewall on maximum security.

1. Start computer.
2. Open Firefox.

Actual Results:

For some reason this problem only started after I installed Windows Service Pack 4 and the following program trial versions:
Photoshop CS2
Illustrator CS
iView Media Pro
ACDSee
Dreamweaver 8
Flash 8
QuarkXpress 6.5

I wa not using a theme or a skin.
