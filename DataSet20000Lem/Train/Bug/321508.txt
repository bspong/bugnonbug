Am using "Blackboard" courseware intensively at our institution (Gallaudet University); current build of Firefox on Mac (and several previous builds/versions) on occasion doe not correctly display the font of the menu button that are created by the Blackboard system. Menu button in Blackboard are arranged in vertical list. Out of 10 or so buttons, one, two, or three will not display the font that is used by the system. This problem ONLY happens with Firefox; never with Safari or any other Mac browser. Issuing a "refresh" page command will usually fix the problem. I have ONLY seen this problem with the Blackboard site.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter University=mediated "Blackboard" courseware site: http://my.gallaudet.edu
2.. Select any course available on the Blackboard sytem.
3. If default "appearance" in Blackboard call for menu "button," several button have a completely nonstandard font appearance (small, black, different from normal buttons.



Expected Results:
All button should look the same and have the same font. (User ha no control over font setting for these buttons;)Blackboard system determines font. User can only select color and shape of buttons, not font.

I have a screen capture that clearly show the bizarre font appearance along with standard font. I can send this screen capture to your team if so requested.
