Content-type application/pdf not recognized if no .pdf extension
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11
Build Identifier:

Under some condition (probably when the filename doesn't have an extension), the content-type is not recognized by Firefox and it is impossible to view the file. One can only save the file on the disk, but Firefox doesn't even honor the Content-Location HTTP header (so that the file is saved without an extension).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.vinc17.org/research/publi.en.html
2. Click on the link of the first publication ("Toward the integration..."); this corresponds to the above URL.
Actual Results:
Firefox open a dialog box saying: You have chosen to open casc2004 which is a: application/pdf from: ... What should Firefox do with this file?
* Open with [Choose...]
...

Expected Results:
It should have said "... which is a: Portable Document Format" and "Open with Preview (default)". This is what I obtain when I click on the "PDF" link just below. AFAIK, the only significant difference is the ".pdf" filename extension in the second case.

FYI, here are the header I obtain with wget -S (I don't think they should be much different with Firefox):
