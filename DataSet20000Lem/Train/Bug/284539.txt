Unable to start Firefox after attempted update to version 1.0.1.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier:

On two separate PCs, while trying to install the FireFox 1.0.1 update to
Firefox 1.0, both installation ended with the following error message when
attempting to restart Firefox: "The program must close to allow a previous
isntallation attempt to complete. Please restart". The first PC ha now had
Firefox completely removed (using uninstall) and relies now on IE. The
uninstall for 1.0.1 left the uninstall icon for 1.0. I reinstalled 1.0 to see
if it would recover - it didn't (same error a above), but this new install
allowed me to remove the 1.0 uninstall icon when I uninstalled 1.0. On the
second PC, I attempted the update to check some info gleaned from these bug
report (i.e. that the update must be installed in a new directory). There are
no prompt that tell you that (that I saw or noticed), so I ended the install
prior to it actually replacing bits. When the install ended (aborted), I
attempted to restart Firefox, and I got the above error message. Both PCs were
rebooted to eliminate any potential stealth process running. No difference.
Both PCs are now Firefox-less. This install process need to be fixed - I
rarely, if ever have this much trouble with a Microsoft install.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. download 1.0.1 update
2. run update (and either let it finish or abort it)
3. attempt to start Firefox

Actual Results:
Firefox would no longer start. I continually receive the message "The program
must close to allow a previous isntallation attempt to complete. Please
restart". This message continues even after a reboot.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have started and should have been sucessfully updated to version
1.0.1
