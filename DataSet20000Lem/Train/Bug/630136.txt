When going doing Tools->Addons I get a warning that services.addons.mozilla.org us an invalid certificate. On further investigation, it turn out that it us a GeoTrust root which is apparently untrusted. The fingerprint of this root is DE:28:F4:A4:FF:E5:B9:2F:A3:C5:03:D1:A3:49:A7:F9:96:2A:82:12

Googling for this led me to this discussion: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=10807
It's a different site (Android addons), but maybe the reason is the same: a missing intermediate certificate in the chain?

Sorry if the domain name services.addons.mozilla.org is off, but the warning dialog is severly broken: it doe not allow copy paste, and moreover is modal: so I can't even "manually" copy the site name by typing it into this bug report, a it is locked while the box is up. So I have to type it from memory. Modal dialog box have been mentioned in the past in numerous report here on bugzilla.mozilla.org. It is appalling that some are still left. How difficult is it to make a global search on the source for whatever flag make dialog box modal?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up a fresh profile (to make sure the intermediate certificate hasn't been cached due to another site)
2. Click Tools->Addons

Actual Results:
Warning about bad certificate (untrusted issuer)
Modal dialog box with disabled copy paste

Expected Results:
The certificate for addons should validate
If an error should happen, box should also copy-paste and not freeze entire UI

Bug marked a critical, because if addons cannot be trusted, a user could potentially install trojaned addons. Given the recent event in Tunisia, this is a very real concern.
