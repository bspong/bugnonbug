improve startup process
Currently, the social stuff start up the very first time someone *gets* registry.enabled() - that first get read the pref and kick thing off. However, we currently need to take care that this doesn't happen too early - eg, see the use of ' if (this._enabled) {' in enableProvider() - if 'this.enabled' wa used instead, thing break.

Even in the best case scenario, this startup happens a the first top-level browser window is opened, probably impacting startup time (we potentially create the sidebar, create a number of workers, etc)

I think a better approach would be:

* At startup registry.enabled return a false value ('null' or 'undefined' would seem ideal, but regular 'false' would also work).

* We listen for the notification that tell u the session restore is complete, or some other notification that is suitable (can't recall what they are atm, but I'm confident they exist :)

* At that point we check the preference to see if we are enabled or not and perform the actual startup (or set registry().enabled to false). Anyone who care should have registered for our 'social-' observer and can take action a we fire them.

This should mean browser startup is not impacted. However, a downside of this is that the sidebar and toolbar button don't get created until after the window ha been restored, which may seem "strange" to some users.
