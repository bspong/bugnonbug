High CPU usage on moving mouse over Firefox Window
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b12) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b12

This is not an isolated problem with the actual build since this behavior wa noticed in almost all Firefox version installed on my machine. I decided to post it now maybe someone will fix it once and for all. :)
If I constantly move the mouse over the desktop I get an average 6 % CPU usage, If I constantly moved it over an Explorer Window the same value, if I constantly move it over an Internet Explorer 8 Window I get an average of 15 % CPU usage, and if I constantly move it over an Firefox Window with no webpage open in it I get an average of 40 % CPU usage which I think is pretty much for no reason.
If I open a webpage like Youtube in Firefox and constantly move the mouse on Youtube page I get 100 % CPU usage.

My setup is a follows:
Athlon XP 1500 Mhz
Windows XP SP3
ATI Radeon 9600 PRO DX 9 card pixel&vertex shader v2
USB 2 Genius Laser Mouse 2400 DPI


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Just move the mouse over Firefox Window.
Actual Results:
CPU usage increase too much for no reason.

Expected Results:
I expect someone to fix this.

Since it's not a feature it mean it's a BUG :)
