When clicking a link that point to a downloadable file, I recieve an error stating:

" C:\DOCUME~1\DR\LOCALS~1\Temp\banana.jpg could not be saved, because the source file could not be read. Try again later, or contact the server administrator. "

I have reformatted my machine, installed NOTHING but FF and still get the same error. The ONLY way I can download is to either "right-click > save as" or "open in IE"

This wa also an issue for me with the previous build released for download.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link that point to a download.
2. Get an error...
3. Can't dowload the file unless you choose "save as" from the context menu or open the link in Internet Explorer.

Actual Results:
Pop-up stating:

"C:\DOCUME~1\DR\LOCALS~1\Temp\banana.jpg could not be saved, because the source file could not be read. Try again later, or contact the server administrator."

Expected Results:
Download manager open to download the file.

Fresh install of operating system (latest update only) and fresh install of Firefox. No theme or extension installed.
