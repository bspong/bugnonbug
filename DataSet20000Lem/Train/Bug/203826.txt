When I log into my mail account at http://mail.yahoo.com/, a gray box that is
the size of the pull-down menu when open appears where the box is when the page
loads. Strangely, it doesn't do it for every single box every time. When I
move the window or scroll the page, the box stay in the same place. However,
if I click on the pull-down menu, the box go away.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into a mail.yahoo.com account
2.Click on "inbox" to the left, usually happens there
3.Rinse and repeat (1 out of 10 try get it for me, on average)

Actual Results:
Got two grey box on the fourth try, for the box that have the option to
move letter with checked box or mark them a spam/read/etc...

Expected Results:
Not have grey box when the page loads.

I tried two or three theme to see if the problem persisted, and it did. I have
more than one tab open, and the grey box persists there. I am using litestep,
and if I move the window to a different window, the box still reside in the
original desktop.
