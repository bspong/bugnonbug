window.setTimeout() not executing in the onLoad() event of a <body> tag.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

For many of the page on our web application, we have a <body> tag similar to:

<body leftmargin="0" topmargin="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" onload="window.setTimeout('onLoadSubmit();', 3000);">

This wa working fine in all browser (IE 6, Safari 1.x & 2, NS 7 & 8, FF 1.0.7) until the release of Firefox 1.5. In FF 1.5, the onLoadSubmit() is never being run. I adjusted the time interval to a few different value and it did not change the behavior.

I tested this by adding an alert() to the onLoadSubmit() method. I see the alert on all other browser we support, but not on FF 1.5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a web page that call window.setTimeout('someJSFunction()', 3000) in the onLoad() event of the <body> tag.
2. Have some detectable event occur in someJSFunction() such a an alert() call.
3. Load the page in FireFox 1.5.

Actual Results:
The someJSFunction() function is not run.

Expected Results:
The someJSFunction() function is run.

I also had this same problem for the latest Firefox 1.5 download for Mac OS X. I do not have this problem at all on Firefox 1.0.7 on both Windows XP and Max OS X.
