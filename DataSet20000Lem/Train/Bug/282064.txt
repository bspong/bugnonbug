A particular page on Orbitz (I'll describe reproducible step en un momento)
crash Firefox hard, no passing go, no automagical bug report generator. About
1 out of the 5-7 time I tried this, I wa redirected to my home page (which I
then set to blank a a test). The crash seemed to happen, tantalizingly, at the
**end** of rendering this page, at the footer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
< I doubt the actual city and date matter here, but I'll give you all my
deets, exactly. Also, b/c of orbitz implementation, any actual URLs deeper in
this process would be useless to you. I'm sure you feel me, yo.>


1. Go to http://www.orbitz.com/
2. Click "Find low fare for weekend and flexible trips"
3. Select "Option 2: Bonus Days"
4. You are travelling from AUS -> DFW, 13 Feb -> 17 Feb, select "3 day before
and after" on each leg
5. Click "Find"
6. Profit! (i.e. you get the page which render Firefox into oblivion)

Actual Results:
cf. detail

Expected Results:
um, not disappear.
