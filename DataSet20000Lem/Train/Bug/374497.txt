If a flash movie is inside of a div with CSS position:fixed and the flash movie ha the wmode=transparent property, the caret (text input cursor) will fail to render inside the flash movie's text fields. Text can still be entered into the field.

This bug is new a of Firefox version 2.0.0.2. It did not occur in earlier versions.

Oddly, if a non-Firefox application window is put into focus such that the flash movie is still visible, the text input cursor will start being rendered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Step 1. View a flash movie with wmode=transparent that is positioned using position:fixed
Step 2. Select a text entry field
Step 3. Open a non-Firefox application window such that it doe not cover the flash movie in Firefox (Windows calculator for example)

Actual Results:
Step 2: No text input cursor is visible
Step 3: Text input cursor now show up

Expected Results:
Step 2: A text input cursor should be displayed
Step 3: Ideally, No text input cursor should show up

This bug is new a of the public release of 2.0.0.2 on 2/19/07. It is visible in both standard and non-standard theme (Tested in Default and Whitehard 2.3).

I have provided a demonstration URL.
