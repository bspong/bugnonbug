AppTabs are customized bad. Two thing I've noticed:
a). wrong height (it's smaller than regular tab's height)

b). visible line under FavIcon, that shouldn't be shown (they are hidden for regular tabs)

p.s.: since these 2 bug are related to the neighboring code parts, I filed 1 bug for both of them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
a). 1. Open 1 tab on the tab bar.
2. Make it into AppTab.

b). 1. Make some tab into AppTabs and take a look under them, and compare it to the space under regular tabs.
Actual Results:
a). Compare the two state (regular tab and AppTab) and watch the tabbar losing it's height too due to AppTabs having smaller height, than regular tabs.

b). There are visible line (borders) under AppTabs.

Expected Results:
a). The state shouldn't differ, AppTab's height should be equal to the regular tab's.

b). The border should be hidden behind a plain toolbar space at the bottom of the tab bar.

I don't remember how it look on Win 7 with aero theme, but I know that this bug is present for XP SP3 with classic theme (no themes, no personas).
