After installing 3rc3 in Vista, Firefox won't start
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-3.0rc3&os=win&lang=en-US

This same thing occurred when I tried 3rc1.

I installed 3rc3 and the installation appears fine and finishes. But when I try to start Firefox, the cursor spin for a second and then nothing happens. I checked the task manager for application and process and nothing from firefox is running. If I reinstall FF2, it won't work. I have to uninstall FF3 and then install FF2 and then FF2 work again. I tried uninstalling FF2 before the install of FF3 and it still wouldn't start up. I tried using the tool to create a new account and that had no effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF3
2. Doubleclick on FF3 icon, or indicate "Start Firefox" on final install box.

Actual Results:
Cursor spin for a second and that's it. No FF3, no error, nothing.

Expected Results:
FF3 should start up! Or at least it should indicate an error.

I have a fairly new HP laptop with Vista Home Premium. Everything otherwise work fine. FF2 works. I don't have anything exotic on my system, Office, Intuit Products, Roxio, Photoshop, iTunes, etc. For my AV protection I am using NOD32.
