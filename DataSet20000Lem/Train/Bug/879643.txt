Installing a search plugin (as default) doesn't change url bar behaviour

Custom Search Plugin

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:24.0) Gecko/20130604 Firefox/24.0 (Nightly/Aurora)
Build ID: 20130604031112

Steps to reproduce:

• Installed a search plugin that provides Google's Browse by Name search (once from mycroftproject, once my own custom written plugin).
• In the modal dialog, whilst installing: checked the "start using immediately" checkbox on.
• Reordered the new plugin to be the first (top) plugin in the plugin pref pane.
• Searched using the URL bar (I tried a few site that I know work with GBBN).
• Searched same word in searchbar
-----------------------------------------------
After much experimenting the following will produce the expected behaviour:
• Installed a search plugin that provides Google's Browse by Name search (my own custom written plugin).
• In the dropdown whilst installing checked the "start using immediately" checkbox on.
• Reordered the new plugin to be the first (top) plugin in the plugin pref pane.
• open profile folder/searchplugins
• copy in an unmolested version of my search plugin (replacing the one FF screwed up)
• open about:config
• edit browser.search.selectedEngine and browser.search.defaultenginename to both refer to the custom searchplugin.
• restart FF
• Searched using the url bar (I tried a few site that I know work with GBBN).


Actual results:

Searchbar work a expected, taking me directly to the site I've named.

URL bar doe a normal Google search (uses the standard Google search URL format)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Much bitching and trial and error and looking at outdated docs...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Search work a expected


Expected results:

URL bar should use the search plugin's URL template. ESPECIALLY since keyword.URL is being deprecated.

I shouldn't have to fix FF's mess when I want to set a search URL.
Features shouldn't be removed until the replacement isn't broken.
