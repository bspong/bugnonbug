Caret Browsing is hardbound to the F7 key and is unable to be overridden with javascript like F3, F5, etc.

I have an application that us the function key F1 through F12 for navigation.
I am able to override F3, F5, etc, through use of the Javascript
preventDefault() option, but unfortunatly it seems that the F7 key, which is
bound to a Caret Browsing dialog and the caret browsing toggle, doe not use
Javascript events. It is actually bound in browser.xbl a an XBL handler
(http://lxr.mozilla.org/aviary101branch/source/toolkit/content/widgets/browser.xml#780),
which mean that, a far a I can tell, there is no way to override it and stop
it toggling caret browsing.

The best solution that I can think of would be to move the F7 button to use the
same Javascript event that F3, F5, etc use, thus allowing it to be overridden
if desired.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Rebind F7 by using a Javascript event listener bound to keydown.
2. Use preventDefault() to stop the event from opening a dialog and toggling
caret browsing.
3.

Actual Results:
Nothing - the dialog and toggle still appear.

Expected Results:
Allowed me to override F7 like I have done with F3, F5, etc, by using the
preventDefault() function.
