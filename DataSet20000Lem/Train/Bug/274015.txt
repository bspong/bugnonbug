Well... This is just strange.
I have a nice working document. And a soon a I let php submit
application/xhtml+xml in the http-header, i have to add a display: block to the
div-element in my stylesheet to let it break after, and the <br/> doe not
break, no matter what i do.
Are there two so different render-paths inside firefox? I would not believe it
if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. change your default_mimetype to "application/xhtml+xml" in your php.ini. (if
not possible maybe the php function header() can do it. But then I can't
guarantee reproducibility!)
2. create a document with some <div>s and some text with <br/>s inside it.
3. look at it in your browser.

Actual Results:
In this case I get no break after the <br/>s, and the <div>s look like "display:
float".

Expected Results:
Same look a if the same document would be delivered with default_mimetype set
to "text/html". (Of course the document must be a fully conforming XHTML 1.1
document! [Maybe XHTML 1.0 Strict "works" too?])

P.S.: I don't think it's associated to the case that my firefox crash every 5
minute after i click on something like links, tabs, ... And that it forgets
that i just updated fireftp and the english language pack [i have german
version] :_(
(I also could not find the bug for this... Maybe it's just on my pc. ;) But of
not this is the buggiest mozilla-thing since seamonkey M8 ;P)

P.P.S.: the bug search seems to work improperly. It show me a ton of bug for
the query "xhtml br div break". And the don't seem to have anything to do with
the query. So sorry if this is a duplicate... Could not avoid it. :(
