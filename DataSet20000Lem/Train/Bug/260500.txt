Browser request favicon.ico on every page view

Recently Firefox wa changed so that by default, it will search for /favicon.ico
(in the root web path) on every page request, where a server doesn't have a
/favicon.ico file.

However, under this new behaviour the number of HTTP transaction is effectively
doubled. For instance, every time I go to a new site Firefox will request the
current URL a well a favicon.ico, getting a 404 error for favicon.ico.

Unfortunately, it appears that this behaviour wa implemented for compatibility
with site designed for Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Firefox's current implementation of it is over-agressive and ultimately worse
than IE's. Firefox sends a request for /favicon.ico file on every page load,
rather than just once when the page is bookmarked.

In my opinion, if we are going to add feature in order to be compatible with
site designed for Microsoft Internet Explorer, then at the very least these
feature should not be excessively resource-intensive.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website which ha no shortcut icon or favicons.

Actual Results:
Firefox search for /favicon.ico on every page request.

Expected Results:
Firefox doesn't search for /favicon.ico on every page request.
