HP Speechbot when put in an embedded IFRAME tag, can redirect browser to page (shooting the use of the embedded frame tag)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Don't know if you can help here, but this is a bit bothersome, I've
been generating IFRAME's in my page to get people to look at site I've found..
I tried this with the HP Speechbot site, and the site redirected my browser to
their site.. Somwhow it recognized that I wa placing them in an IFRAME, or in
some kind of frame.. Would be neat if I could somehow disable their access
to the javascript feature that my page ha access to.. Like to give site in
frame limited Javascriupt access over the parent including the IFRAME.


Reproducible: Always

1.put HP Speechbot search in a frame in HTML

3.

Actual Results:
Will now be looking at HP Speechbot site and your site or webpage
is history..

Expected Results:

sub frame from my blog.



BTW, if you like the best 100 top hit from 1976 to 1984, and have rhapsody
