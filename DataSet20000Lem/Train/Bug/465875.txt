Cannot use New Yahoo Mail with 2.0.0.18 and RealPlayer Browser Record Plugin 1.0
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_5; en-us) AppleWebKit/528.5+ (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/528.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.18

Essentially you need to be running FF 2.0.0.18 and have the browser Add-on for RealPlayer Browser Record Plugin 1.0. This plug-in is apparently intended to detect "all recordable content" on the browser. Furthermore, FF 2.0.0.18 ha added security fixes, one of which affect the XML HTTP request event happening being passed on to interested party (listeners).

Looking at the add-on showed the RealPlayer plug-in (that, incidentally get disabled when upgrading to FF 3) and disabling this plug-in immediately fixed the problem. I set it back and forth and wa able to reliably control when the problem occurred.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install RealPlayer Browser Record Plugin 1.0
2. go to mail.yahoo.com
3. click on a message
Actual Results:
blank reading pane or the message “We’re sorry, but there appears to be a problem loading the message, click here to try again.”

Expected Results:
the message shown in the preview pane
