When i visit a website i frequently encounter 404 error and often cannot find a way to notify the creator of the web page that the web page no longer is working. It occurs that this task could be automated by the browser generating a message to the creator including the web link and updating the count number of people who could not get thru. It could also be done at the same time a the attempt so a not to report when the user web connection is shut off. This would have the tendency of cleaning up the whole internet a little bit.

Of course it should be optional to the user to turn this feature on/off so that privacy issue are avoided.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any web page.
2.click on a kink that doesnt work.
3.result 404 error.
4attempt to contact web master of site.
Actual Results:
lot of effort is wasted informing web master whose info is burried on page, ... ... or not!!!

Expected Results:
broken link trigers reprorter program that informs web master of broken link location in page and url. and add to a counter. and report to mt that the link ha been reported. 404- error.

This feature doe not exist in MS product to the best of my knowelege. and would show the superority of mozilla firefox!!!
