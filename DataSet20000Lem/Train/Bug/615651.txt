Text in Flash application is extremely blurry. I have found many report of blurry text in other part of FF, but I do not see this problem anywhere else except in Flash applications. Using Flash player 10.1 and 10.2, the same problem exists. This ha been an issue for a couple of week now.

Using the same Flash player and FF 4.0 B7, Flash look fine. Hardware Acceleration is enabled in B7 and cause no problems, but disabling it in the nightly build make the text look fine. So, it seems this is related to Hardware Acceleration, but ha to do with something that changed between B7 and the nightie to follow shortly thereafter.

Note: Cannot use "Report Broken Website" a per instructions, because this menu item seems to have been removed a while ago, and isn't present in recent beta or the nightly builds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Hardware Acceleration is enabled.
2. Load up one of the chat room at the URL above.
3. Text is blurry and virtually unreadable.
4. Disable Hardware Acceleration and restart FF.
5. Going to same URL and opening a chat room, the text is fine.



I upgraded to the latest nVidia drivers, version 260.99, and problem persists.
