If I use Mozilla online or offline (Mozilla is started), I sometimes want to open a local file (e.g. Bookmarks.html) from explorer. Mozilla fails to open local files, if I dobbleclick on it or select from popup-menue 'open with Mozilla'.
Open a local file work only from Mozilla->menu->file->open or even from explorer, but only if mozilla is not started already.
Drag'n'Drop works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla Firefox
2. Start explorer
3. select a local html-file(xy.htm) (or a link on a html file (xy-html.lnk))
4. open selected file by dobble-click on it or by selecting in popup-menu 'open with .. Firefox
Actual Results:
nothing happens

Expected Results:
Mozilla Firefox open the selected file in main window or in a new tab or in a new window

Drag'n'drop works.
My file are correct linked to firefox.
The same actions, I described, work with MS-Internet-explorer -> it start a new window
