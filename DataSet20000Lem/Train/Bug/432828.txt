There is a very good chance Firefox will crash upon login to the local console after the PC ha been used in a Windows Remote Desktop session. Similarly, there is also a good chance that Firefox will crash upon initiation of a Windows Remote Desktop session. I've not seen this in release prior to 3.0 beta, but it happens to me regularly on two different PCs.

I believe this is typically due to change in screen resolution between use of Remote Desktop and local login (resolutions in use are 1280x1024,1164x864,1680x1050)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Test A
1. Run Firefox
2. Initiate Remote Desktop to the box that ha Firefox already running using a different resolution than the desktop (higher or lower)
3. Crash may occur.
4. Any subsequent restart of Firefox work fine

Test B
1. After Test A, you will have logged into the PC remotely and changed it resolution, ensure Firefox is running.
2. Now log into that PC locally, which change the resolution back to local/native resolution
3. Crash may occur
Actual Results:
Crash

Expected Results:
Should not have crashed

No theme.
