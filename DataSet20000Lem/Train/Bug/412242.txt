I don't know if this bug come from firefox itself or from the flash plugin.
On the provided URL, there are 3 flash applet (flv videos). None of them is visible except in a very specific case :
If a flash applet is not completely displayable, a little bit cut by the top of the visible frame, then it becomes visible.
The URL I provided here is not the only one that ha this problem, I can provide at least one more if needed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go on the the specified webpage
2. Scroll the page

Actual Results:
You can see one flash applet at a time, only if it doesn't fit completely in the page because of the top border of the browser frame

Expected Results:
All the flash applet should be visible at any moment.

I'm using firefox 2.0.0.11 on a new Intel MacBookPro SantaRosa, with OsX 10.5.1 Leopard and the native screen resolution (1440*900)
I have the AdBlockPlus extension which allows to block flash applet (a small "Block" button show on the top of each flash applet) but I checked and these applet are not listed in my blacklist.
