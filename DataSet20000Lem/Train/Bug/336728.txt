hang moving cursor over the local bookmark

I have bookmarked some local folder (e.g. file:///home/frm/work - a normal folder where I have full permissions) of my linux filesystem in Firefox. However when I pas the cursor over these directory links, FF just hangs.
I cannot even use alt-tab to change application: I have to do a ctrl+alt+backspace to restart X.

Note that the problem is caused by bookmarking a local folder: if I bookmark a file this doe not happen.

Also note that if I type the same URL in the FF navigation bar directly, instead trying to access it from bookmarks, the index of the folder is correctly generated immediately.

As workaround of this bug I used the bookmark manager to remove those folder bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type a folder URL in nav bar (e.g. /home/yourusername)
2. bookmark that folder
3. restart firefox and try to access that bookmark from bookmark menu



Expected Results:
A popup menu with the list of the file of the folder should appear
