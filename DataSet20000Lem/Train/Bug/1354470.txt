[UX] Don't make the old Library window the most prominent item in the new Library panel
<mak> so now we'll have a Library panel opening a Library window ;) so confusing
<dao> mak: we should rename one of the two. can the library window just say "bookmarks and history"? arguably downloads could be considered part of history, so maybe this is good enough
<mak> dao: I wa mostly worried about support, plus the fact the Library window is named like that from a looong time, so I'm not 100% sure changing it name will work as-is...
<mak> Note that I think we should also replace the Library with something better...
<mak> but that's another discussion I'd not want to start now :)
<mak> to be clear, I'd have nothing against renaming the Library window. just that it may not work well with user memory
<dao> mak: right, if the new feature could get a new name, that would be preferable over renaming the old feature. I just suspect renaming the old one will be le of a headache in term of design work.
<dao> at this point the library idea already crept into the new toolbar icon design
<dao> also not sure what a good alternative name for the panel would be
<mak> heh, the only other name that come to my mind is "collections" but it doesn't sound so nice :P
<dao> "library" is just a window title right now, correct? we don't use the term anywhere else in the UI, so renaming it won't confuse user in term of opening the window
<mak> no, it will confuse support interactions, when you say to a user "open the Library"
<mak> Edge call it Hub... not great, since it's hard to translate (indeed in italian they kept Hub)
<dao> "open the library" is not a good instruction, a there's no UI entry point using that term
<mak> fair enough. I guess it will be fine to rename the Library window

The "Library" name go back to bug 397411. beltzner and faaborg had settled on "Bookmarks and History" / "Bookmarks & History" before switching to "Library" in order to support a dubious plan that never materialized except for the addition of Downloads: "As we store more information in this window in the future the name won't turn into Bookmarks & History & Web Receipts & Locations, Events, and Contacts."
