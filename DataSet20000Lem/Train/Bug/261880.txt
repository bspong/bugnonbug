GUI configuration of item in about:config, especially print setting

The about:config 'screen' is OK for hacking some thing's into Firefox, but it is
a terrible interface for end users.

In particular, print setting are giving me grief on our network. Firefox
default to 'Letter' sized print jobs, which lock our ( admittedly crap )
printers. To combat this, I enter about:config, filter on the string 'print',
select print.postscript.paper_size and replace 'Letter' with 'A4'.

This is just an example ( the most relevant example for u ). There are many
more item in here that really should have a friendly GUI tool for setting.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter URL about:config
2. Pretend you're a typical user

Actual Results:
Presented with a LONG list of option - some of which were mildly interesting,
others which were quite important, and yet more which I couldn't figure out at all.

Expected Results:
I'd like to see the more everyday-type option have a GUI config tool. I don't
mind these setting showing up in about:config a well, a long a there is an
easy configuration method.
