Feature Request: Multiple Sidebars

Opening something new in the sidebar replaces what is already there. This seems
sort of stupid. I run my computer in a 1680x1050 resolution (widescreen baby)
and there's a ton of wasted space below the information in the sidebar. Even in
lower resolution this is noticeable. Wouldn't it make more sense to be able to
have multiple pane of information in the sidebar? For example, I use the
Download Manager Tweak extension, and put my download manager in the sidebar. I
usually keep my bookmark there (widescreen give me some extra space on the
side) and they go away when the download manager pop up. This seems
unnecessary. I'd love to have my bookmark AND my download manager over there,
along with anything else I decide to add later.
