After running for a while, Firefox get very laggy. After a couple days, these hang slowly grow long enough to have complete "gee, did I have the browser window focused? Oh, there it scrolls" train of thought. This manifest as:

Lag, in the middle of scrolling, especially with the mouse wheel or keyboard, though sometimes by dragging the scroll bar a well;
Long delay before there's any response on many UI event (eg, clicking on another tab);
animated GIFs pause;
flash video freeze while playing;
typing input stops, whether in the address bar, search box, or in a form, and then catch up after a few seconds;
100% CPU consumption by the firefox[-3.5] process during the lag;
user gradually us more profanity.

Watching "strace -p `ps -C firefox-3.5 -o pid=` -e '!poll,gettimeofday,read,futex,writev,select'" show that the lag always occurs during a flurry of madvise(xx, yy, MADV_DONTNEED) calls, sometimes preceded by writing file to the profile. Based on strace, these event are frequently triggered by: mouse in, or click on a link, or click on a tab, or begin scrolling.

Here's a backtrace from breakpointing at an madvise call during mouse wheel scrolling:

Note: this backtrace is from a time when the lag is not happening, due to a recently-restarted firefox. I'll upload a better one when I get it.

Just at a guess, there may be two related bug here: #1, excessive memory fragmentation or inefficient garbage collection; #2, garbage collection being scheduled at the worst possible time (IE, on user-interaction-active events).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox. Web surf for 15 minute to 2 day with normal heavy-web-user habits, until lag becomes pronounced.
2. Open a smooth, looping, animated GIF: http://www.fur.com/~keepiru/DancingPeaks.gif
3. Use strace command above
4. Don't touch anything, and see madvise call correlate with long pause in the animation
5. Try generating event (mouse in, click tabs), and observe madvise call / UI lag



This bug ha persisted across Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.04 with Firefox 3.0 to 3.5b4 (Ubuntu builds), and is reproducible with Firefox 3.5rc${recent} from Mozilla.org.
