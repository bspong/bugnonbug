When I enter few letters, the awesome bar is quite fast to propose me some matching entries. While Firefox is displaying some urls, like "http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/index.tss", sometimes Firefox list also the web site main address, here "http://www.theserverside.com", sometimes not.

Reproducible: Always




When I enter few letters, the awesome bar is quite fast to propose me some matching entries. While Firefox is displaying some urls, like "http://www.theserverside.com/tt/articles/index.tss", I would like Firefox to list also the web site main address, here "http://www.theserverside.com", before (!) listing next all the related url of this web site. Indeed, sometimes Firefox give me only the deep url which are not interesting, because I don't want to return to one article I have already read. But I may want to return to the corresponding web site I have visited, and then retrieving easily it main address would be a welcome feature.
This feature may be enabled through an option.
