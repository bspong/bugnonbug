i just got a new netbook and installed the latest version of firefox a my primary browser. i use gmail for my email and organize them into folder i created within the gmail account. however, when i attempt to place the email in folder (or apply the proper label to the file to categorize them), the folder option just flicker open for a moment before quickly applying the first label alphabetically to any email i try to file and then closing. this doe not happen when i use my partner's computer which us safari. i contacted gmail to report the issue and they said it wa related to my browser.

i also have noticed that sometimes when i am typing an email, the word seem to carry on beyond the parameter of the box and just get lost rather than moving to the next line.

i'm wondering if these two thing are related and if this ha something to do with the new version of firefox?
