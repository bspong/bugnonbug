Nightly build being lumped together with integration build in perfherder
Android nightly build have different characteristic than integration build (e.g. they have multiple locales) but are being lumped in with the integration build by perfherder for the apk size measurement:

(it's hard to select item currently because of bug 1334527, please ignore that)

We should add "nightly" to extra_options in the log for these build to distinguish them. I.e.

PERFHERDER_DATA: {"framework": {"name": "build_metrics"}, "suites": [{"subtests": [{"name": "libxul.so", "value": 17957868}, {"name": "classes.dex", "value": 6861832}, {"name": "omni.ja", "value": 10430384}], "name": "installer size", "value": 38131527, "alertThreshold": 0.25}, ...

should be:

PERFHERDER_DATA: {"framework": {"name": "build_metrics"}, "suites": [{"subtests": [{"name": "libxul.so", "value": 17957868}, {"name": "classes.dex", "value": 6861832}, {"name": "omni.ja", "value": 10430384}], "name": "installer size", "value": 38131527, "alertThreshold": 0.25, "extraOptions": ["nightly"]}, ...

(we may also want to flag these build differently for build times)

Chris, Callek suggested on irc that you'd be a good person to fix this. If you're not, hopefully you know someone who would be...
