Drop the <xul:menulist> support for WidgetMethods
Created attachment 8349360
widget-no-label.patch

Keeping this around is a pain in the ass. There's literally no benefit from doing so, and we're not using it for anything except a potential ChromeGlobals view which isn't even implemented yet and is only for the browser debugger.

Removing this support (and, inherently not expecting string anymore when pushing an item into a widget) will significantly reduce code complexity. It will also allow u to grow the API without worrying about breaking <xul:menulist>s.

Here's a patch. It doe the following:
* make Items always expect an nsIDOMNode
* make WidgetMethods's push() always expect an nsIDOMNode
* remove the idea of "labels" and "descriptions"; Items are only identified by a "value" and a single nsIDOMNode; the use of "labels" and "descriptions" wa removed from everywhere
* remove the idea of "relaxed" pushes; you can't push an item anymore that doesn't have a corresponding node; value are still optional, and it doesn't matter anymore whether they're supplied or not
* add ensureElementIsVisible() a an optional widget method, called when appropriate
* consolidates the "headerText" and "emptyText" widget setters, sharing their implementation
* move the debugger's ListWidget in /shared, renaming it to SimpleListWidget
* remove the ChromeGlobals view
* remove unused code
* update documentation
