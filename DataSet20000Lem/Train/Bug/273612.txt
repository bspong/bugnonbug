I have noticed other bug information on the site about embedded Flash file not
working but I haven't had any problem with other Flash file that are auto-
start, they all seem to play appropriately. A report on the site suggested
upgrading to Firefox v1.0rc1 (I wa running v1.0pr1), which I did to no avail.
Have tried upgrading the Flash player a well. File is set to play in Flash v6
plugin.

There is another embedded Flash file at http://www.muckmusic.com/moses.htm that
is set to autostart and it work fine so it would appear that Firefox isn't
responding to the Javascript start button but I'm not totally sure.
