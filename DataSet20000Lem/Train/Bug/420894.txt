The title say it all, right? Otherwise, here's a longer summary:

"New Bookmark", "New Folder" and "New Separator" should be greyed/grayed out in the context menu of saved search folder items.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the Library, do a search.
2. Save the search in the bookmark toolbar or on the bookmark menu.
3. Click the saved search folder and then right click one of the item in the folder.
Actual Results:
"New Bookmark", "New Folder" and "New Separator" look a if they can be selected.

Expected Results:
"New Bookmark", "New Folder" and "New Separator" should be greyed out/disabled.

If you select "New Bookmark" you do get the New Bookmark dialogue and you can save a bookmark, but (obviously) it doesn't end up in the saved search folder. (And it shouldn't.)

Similarly you can click "New Folder" and get the New Folder dialogue. But again, the folder isn't placed in the saved search folder. (And it shouldn't be.)

Clicking the "New Separator" doe nothing. The saved search folder remains open, and if you open the context menu again the three "New" item will be greyed out.
