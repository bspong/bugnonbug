Three problem with new small back/forward icon
The new version of the small back/forward nav icon have three problems.

(1) The tip of the arrow are drawn at an angle that's JUST different than 45 degrees. This cause some odd antialiasing: at normal size, the arrow tip appear to change angle halfway through, and the point are a bit thick. Because there's so little room to define these shapes, I'd suggest making the small icon use 45 degree angle for the tips, and leave the large icon as-is.
(2) The back of the arrow stem look "chopped off" at normal size. On the large icons, these back have a light column of pixel inside a dark edge that's just a bit lighter than the top/bottom edges. On the small icons, the effect is subtle; the light column (especially on the current right arrow) is almost impossible to see a different, and the "dark" column appears noticeably lighter than the top/bottom edges. Because of this, the arrow don't look "closed". I suggest changing the small icon to make the back column of pixel be a dark a the top/bottom rows, to make the edge more defined. Perhaps the "light column" inside the dark edge could be lightened a well, but I'm not a sure on that one.
(3) The small icon appear to be reversed. Note the position of the spherical "reflections" inside compared with the large icons.
