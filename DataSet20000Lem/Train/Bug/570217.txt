User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3

The problem is a such. Firefox 3.6.3 totally freeze and/or crash when:
1. I open any page with downloadable file link and start downloading a (any) file from there.
2. While downloading the file I close all firefox window apart from Downloader window.
3. Finally I launch a new browser window by double clicking on application shortcut on the desktop/start menu. After that firefox ALWAYS freezes.
Somtimes it then crash immediately, somtimes it crash after a while, and sometimes it just freezes.
By freeze I mean all visible window go "white" (their content disappears), then after a secand or le all the window don't respond any more.
CPU go high, but not always 100%. Don't know the rule here.
This bug is present in window (WinXP SP2/SP3, Vista Premium x86/amd64, Win7) and linux (ubuntu 10.04 x86) firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start downloading a file
2. While downloading the file, open downloader window and close all other firefox window
3. Open a new window by clicking firefox shortcut on desktop/start menu
Actual Results:
Total freeze. After ca. 5 min I had to kill firefox.exe process because of application non-responsibility.


Expected Results:
Open new browser window just the same way a it open i.e. after a fresh computer start.
