Normally, Firefox look to to the userChrome.css file for instruction on how to display GUI elements. I ordered the the Bookmarks menu in userChrome.css. When I display in a tab a site which contains no RSS element, the Bookmarks menu appears a I have ordered it, without showing "Subscribe to This Page." If I open in a new tab a site which doe contain an RSS element, such a addons.mozilla.org, the Bookmarks menu item "Subscribe to This Page" appears correctly ordered, a doe the rest of the Bookmarks menu. But when I restart Firefox with the RSS tab still open, Firefox ignores the userChrome.css file, and display the Bookmarks menu unordered.
