When importing bookmarks, cannot delete updated folder and some bookmark missing
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.16) Gecko/20080702 Firefox/2.0.0.16
Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0

I couldn't use the BUILD INDENTIFIER BECAUSE I went back to 2.0. ON both my XP computers, when I import bookmark --- which I do daily, home to office and back--- after the bookmark folder are imported, I delete the older ones. The page freeze up half the time, the other half it works. But now I noticed that certain bookmark and folder were not included. But they do show up with Firefox 2.0!!! They're hidden in 3.0. From the start, 3.0 bookmark importint is slow, and now partially freezes. I'm using 2.0 on my two XP's, and 3.0 on my Vista's. Should I have uninstalled manually 2.0 before installing 3.0? or do we have a compatibility problem here. Vista import and read the 2.0 bookmark fine.
