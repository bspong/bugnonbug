Get "Unresponsive script" error when accessing PayPal.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

I ALWAYS get an "Unresponsive script" error when attempting to access PayPal at it secure logon address, https://www.paypal.com. The following message appears:
"A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can
stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete."

This wa the case with Firefox 2.x and is still happening with Firefox 3.0. I have tried to access PayPal with IE 7.x on Windows XP and with Firefox 3.0 on Mac OS 10.5, and I DON'T have this problem. I can get into my PayPal account perfectly.

I can't get through the unresponsive script by clicking either box. The Error Console then list many of the same errors:

Warning: Error in parsing value for property 'cursor'. Declaration dropped.

There are several others. Again, I always got this error in Windows XP with Firefox 2.x or 3.0, but never with Firefox with Mac OS 10.x or with IE 7 in XP.
