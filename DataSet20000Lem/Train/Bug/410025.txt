The "About Firefox" menu item Jumps up to the the Apple menu bar, and becomes a drop down menu by it self. It is positioned between the Firefox menu and the file menu. This is most noticeable a it creates a blank space to the right of the Firefox menu. This ha occured IN EVERY VERSION OF FIREFOX I HAVE USED SINCE VERSION 1.5.0.6, a I recall. I have also used both Mac OSX 10.3.x, and 10.4.x with the same results. My current version of Firefox is 2.0.0.11 and my current OS is 10.4.11. Quitting Firefox and relaunching it clear this anomaly. I have looked for a causal action that will reproduce this occurrence, but it seems to occur at different time with no real pattern of action taken, but it doe reoccur all the time. I could not find a listing in your bug list, so I am making this report. I have a screen shot of this anomaly that I will include.
I have had this occur just after I launch Firefox and not occur for hour when browsing the web. I have had it occur just a I am about to quit, and I can not associate this with any specific web site.
I will help more if I can, but this all that I know.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.No pattern I can detect, other than using Firefox to surf the web.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
See Details


I have disabled the extension to no avail. Also, I reverted to the default theme and it is the same. I don't know if this is a security problem, or just a glitch.
It seems that I can not send the screen shot with this bug report, a the form won't accept the .jpg. Please contact me to get this screen shot.
