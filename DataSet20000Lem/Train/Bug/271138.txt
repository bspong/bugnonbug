When I have more than one tab opened and I try to save a file from a link in the
page loaded in the foreground (by just clicking on the link which open a "save
as" file selector window) and that a page from another tab in the background
fails to connect due to a timeout it open a new dialog box (which say
something like "connection failed to the server www.foo.com..."), the browser
hang and it's impossible to close either of the dialog box (the "save as" and
the "timeout") or do anything with the browser, I can only kill firefox.exe from
the task manager.
It happened to me 4 or 5 time at least from different web sites, but I couldn't
manage to reproduce it when I tried.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
1.load a page with contains a link to a file to download
2.load another page in another tab in the background (which eventually will time
out)
3.click on the link to the file
4.choose "save the file" from the opened dialog box and click ok

Actual Results:
A "save as" with file selector window opened.
Then a timeout dialog box (from the tab in the background) opened.
The browser then hanged. It wa impossible to close or select any of the dialog
box or do anything with the browser.


Expected Results:
I should have been able to click the save button in the "save as" window ok
click the "ok" button in the timeout dialog box.
