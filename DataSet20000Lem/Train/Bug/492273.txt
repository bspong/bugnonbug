Firefox crash on URL load. This is intermittent and not specific to any URL, but usually after several day of the browser being open. By the time it crashes, Firefox is running very slowly and usually ha over 2GBs of memory in use.

See attached crash log from 5/8/09 and 5/10/09.

No Firefox Crash Reporter activates ever. 10% of the time Apple Crash Reporter activates.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Leave browser open for several day under active use with at least 200 tab in use. Browser will eventually crash. No specific reproduction steps, although a a side note, loading extremely large image tends to increase instability of browser and cause it to crash faster (as observed by tab load time, rainbow wheel occurrence, text field typing issues, and flash video playback pauses).
Actual Results:
Software crashes, often with no crash dialog; occasionally with Apple Crash Dialog. Never with Firefox Crash Dialog.

Expected Results:
Software should not crash; and when it does, Firefox Crash Dialog should open.
