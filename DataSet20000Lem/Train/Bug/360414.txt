I am going to try to be a detailed a possible but it a very stragne issue.
Ok here goes.
Whenver I go to website like www.apple.com or www.ign.com the page is majorily distorted. Someimes the page halfopens, in the sence that you can only see part of it. With ign.com many of the hyperlink are invisible. But what is worse is that the page itself becomes longer becuase much of the content on the webpage is pushed down and moved left.
This issue is very strange becuase it effect every site differntly. I think that is becuase of the different design of the page. AS in how the grasphics are put up and stuff.
If you would go to these 2 website that I mentioned you will notice that they have lot of stuff to click on and look at> it very graphical. ( I cant rememeber the word used to describe stuff like this but I know you need Macromedia Flash or Java to display it)
Also for some web page the the way it display the page change every time you press the refresh button. a is the case when you go to www.apple.com
Thank you for your time.
