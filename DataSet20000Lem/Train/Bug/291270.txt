This bug only show on OS X.

This function is called in the body tag (onload):

function wiggle() {
window.innerWidth +=1;
window.innerWidth -=1;
}

I also tested this issue on FF 1.0.3 on Windoze XP and none of the issue I'm
having on OS X occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open http://workloft.ch/ueberuns/
2. change the window position
3. klick any other link on that page

Actual Results:
The window doesn't stay at the current position. It move back to where it ha
ben originally opened.

Expected Results:
The window's position should not be influenced by setting window.innerWidth nor
window.innerHeight.


I had to use this hack (i.e. the wiggle()) to circumvent a problem in Firefox
wich ha to do with adjusting the height of divs, after content ha been loaded
into them (like pictures, that need most time to load).
When content is loaded into .contentHolder and the content contains images,
which load after the page ha been rendered, #logoMenu 's height is not adjusted
correctly. One ha to resize the window to get FF to adjust the #logoMenu's height.
This problem can be seen, when turning off js, emtpying the cache and loading
