The e10s slow script notification bar keep spontaneously disappearing and reappearing in cycles.
STR:

1. Navigate to infiniteloop2.html from bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164286 .
2. Wait for several minute and observe the UI visually.

Observed:

After some seconds, the slow script notification bar appears. When no response is given in some amount of time, the notification bar spontaneously disappears. Then, again after a few seconds, the notification bar appears again, and so on; i.e. the bar keep appearing and disappearing in cycles.

Excepted:

After presented the first time, the slow script notification bar should be shown a long until a) the user ha taken his time to respond to it.

A question is what should happen if the script "resolves" (completes execution and yield back to the event loop) itself before the user ha had the time to respond. E.g. if there is a requestAnimationFrame()-based animation that takes, say, 20 second to run through each cycle, then effectively the page is hung, but simply hiding the slow script notification bar after each rAF finish might not be good user experience. Perhaps the slow script notification bar should autohide itself only if the browser ha been idle from running user JS script for e.g. >1 seconds?
