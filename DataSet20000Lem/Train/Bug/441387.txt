I did a comparison of memory usage between FF3 and IE7. Obviously upon first load FF3 us only 1/3 the memory footprint. Wonderful. But this efficiency diminishes once you actually start to surf. Check it out.

FF3 - 5 tabs, memory footprint 70MB. Click 3 link in each tab. --> 103 MB.

IE7 - the same 5 tabs, footprint 167MB. Click 3 link in each. --> 181 MB.

Obviously FF3 is more efficient overall in term of memory usage, however... why is it claiming and holding more memory once site are surfed? It climbed 33MB in this scenario, wheras IE7 only climbed 14MB.

The site I loaded in the 5 tab were:

google.com, yahoo.com, seattletimes.com, seattlepi.com, youtube.com.

In all case I only clicked on link that went to textual page -- didn't load any video in the youtube tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load up the five tab named above
2. click three link in each tab
3. watch the memory usage in Task Manager for the respective process
Actual Results:
FF3 claim 33MB more memory, IE7 claim 14MB.

Expected Results:
I would expect FF3 to claim no more memory than IE7, given how crappy IE7 is at memory usage in general.

These page I am viewing are, saved to disk, not more than 150k. Since the tab are already loaded -- why is it jumping 2.2 MB per click? It ought to jump no more than 150k, and that is only if it is holding those page in memory, something I do not think should be the default behavior. It can store the page to disk, if there is enough cache, otherwise nothing should be cached.
