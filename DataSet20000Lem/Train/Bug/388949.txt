Firefox crashes(Not Responding) when I get booted from a yahoo chess game table by another player. I keep all of my software updated automatically. This problem ha been going on for about 6 months. I usually just end up switching back to Internet Explorer so I can Play Yahoo Chess without the problem. I have a feeling Most people don't report this and just switch back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log on to a Yahoo Chess game room.
2.Click the "Play Now" button.
3.If the player who created the table doesn't want to play you and us the "Boot" button to kick you off of the game table Firefox CRASHES (Not Responding)Then you have to go to the task manager via the three finger salute (ctrl+alt+del) to end the program or it just stay locked up.
Actual Results:
Firefox Crashes (Not Responding)Then you have to go to the task manager via the three finger salute (ctrl+alt+del) to end the program or it just stay locked up.

Expected Results:
when booted by another player from a "game table" you should receive a small "you have been booted" notification window at the top left hand of your screen and then returned to the "Game Room"

It is a Java game, but I keep my java updated and this doesn't happen in Internet Explorer.
