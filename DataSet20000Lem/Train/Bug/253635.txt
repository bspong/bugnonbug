Until a few day ago, clicking on link inside email would first open Firefox
(if not already open) then open tab (I had it set up for this). I could open
the whole list of link in a NewScientist.com emiailing in a string of tabs.

Then it all changed: Clicking on the first link now open a Firefox browser
window. Clicking the second link open a second browser window. Then clicking on
each subsequent link open tab a before.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up Firefox to open external link in new tabs.
2. Click on link in external application
3. Click on second link in external application

Actual Results:
Two browser window opened.

Expected Results:
Twoo tab open in one window.

When this first began to occur I tried uninstalling Firefox and deleting all
reference to Ffx in the Registry. Then I created a new Profile. Still the same
issue. There have been no change to extension during this time.
