When middle-clicking back/forward/reload, the new tab should inherit history from the tab that opened it (using duplicateTab)

After the tab is duplicated it should reload/go back/go forward(depends on which button wa middle/ctrl-clicked). This behavior could also be applied to other item such a home-button/bookmarks/hyperlinks in webpages, but that is for another bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a page and click on a link.
2. Now middle-click the back-button.
Actual Results:
A new tab is opened with the url of the "back"-page without restoring history, scroll position, form contents, etc.

Expected Results:
Middle-click on the back-button should clone the current tab and then go back one page.
