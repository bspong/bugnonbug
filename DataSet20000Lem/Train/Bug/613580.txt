Click action on the back and forward button that will result in a new window, when the tabbar is auto-hidden because there is only one tab, briefly show the tab=bar with a single tab. Then the tab-bar disappears again and a new window opens. This behaviour wa introduced by the fix for bug 609700.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.tabs.autohide true (and optionally set browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick false)
2. Open a window containing a single tab so that the tabbar auto-hides
3. Browse from one page to another to activate the back button
4. Shift-click the back button (or middle click if browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick is false)
Actual Results:
The tab-bar briefly flash a single tab before a new window appears, then the tab-bar is gone again.

Expected Results:
The new window should appear without showing the tab-bar, a happens with shift-clicks and middle-clicks on link and other elements. At no point is there more than one tab in any window and browser.tabs.autohide is true.

A quick loook at the patch for the fix to bug 609700 suggests that the initial click open a new tab which cause the tab-bar to appear, then the tab is cloned out to a new window which cause it to disappear again.
