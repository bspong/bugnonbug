when changing character encoding to central European ISO 8859-2 in order have a web page display properly, it look great, but a soon a I go to another page, it default back to unicode or some other which requires me to change the character encoding again. Is there no way to default the character encoding to what I need in order to view page on the web? The two web page that don't display properly are the weather channel and accuweather.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to weather.com
2.text run altogether
3.change character encoding from whatever it is to Central European
Actual Results:
text is displayed properly

Expected Results:
I should be able to default the character encoding for web page that don't display properly and have Firefox remember

very annoying to have to change the character encoding every time I visit a page. I understand that firefox 2 did not have this problem. Firefox two remembered the setting. I even tried to find firefox two to download so I wouldn't have this annoying problem.
