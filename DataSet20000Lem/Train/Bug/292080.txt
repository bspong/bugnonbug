On the home page of www.classypartyfavors you will see a grouping of pictures.
When you click on the picture, it take you to a product page with order
capability. Some product page work just fine and appear with the "order" button
active, but a selection of product page don't.

Example: First picture of "love" coaster - when you click on the picture, the
product page come up fine, but the order button is not active.

Next picture to the right: This one works.

I can't find a pattern for what product page work and what one don't, except
that ALL of my product that have a color option don't work. To see an example,
click on the 3rd picture down in the left hand column (rose ball candle).

By the way, when you open my site in IE, all product page work.

This site wa launched using Yahoo Sitebuilder. All product information is
