Yesterday I found a problem in MFF. I had 1.5.0.6 on the laptop but some page had a lot of questionmarks. I tried in Opera and it looked a suppose to. So I reinstalled 1.5.0.6. The result didn't change. I deleted MFF completely, including all left map and in the register. Then, with Opera, I downloaded MFF 1.5 from http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/1.5/win32/nl/ After installing 1.5 the page with questionmarks in 1.5.0.6 looked a they are suppose to. I don't know the cause, but it seems with 1.5.0.6 Gecko failed. The problem could only be solved this way.
