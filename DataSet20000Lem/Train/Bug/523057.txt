Dragging a link from Firefox 3.5.3 to another Firefox tab or different Firefox window work fine, when dragging a link from web based email work fine. When dragging a link like http://www.google.com from Thunderbird 2.0.0.23 email to Firefox the URL bar display http://www.google.com/http://www.google.com/ and give a 404 error from Google. This might be a Thunderbird problem, but when dragging the same email link within Thunderbird to Google Chrome 3.0.195.27 or Evil Explorer 8.0.6001.18828, the link work fine. This started about 4 month ago, which might mean it started with 3.5 and still doe this. My Vista 32 bit laptop isn't the only system that is affected by this bug. My desktop doe this too, it's on XP Pro SP2 32 bit and my mom XP SP3 32 bit laptop doe this also. Also when hovering the cursor over the link in Thunderbird, the status bar on the lower left of Thunderbird display the correct URL. Is anyone else able to duplicate this? Are Firefox and Thunderbird sharing the same API for links?

Thanks in advance and keep up the great work,
Derek
