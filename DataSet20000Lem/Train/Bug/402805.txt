For paypal.com, I receive the message "a script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding." Choice is given of "Stop Script" or "Continue". Neither of which works. The page begin to load, but stall out with only half of username appearing. Then, cannot navigate on page to continue.
For constantcontact.com, I receive the message "An unexpected error ha occured." The link given to continue to the site do not function.
These website will function and I can log in on Internet Explorer.
Have cleared cache, checked cookie permission. Nothing helps.
This all started at the time of update to 2.0.0.9.
About this time,there wa a notice to accept or reject some type of certification or validation, but I did not recognize the name and rejected it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to www.paypal.com
2.login to www.constantcontact.com
3.
Actual Results:
Pages will not load or will only load partially, then stall out.

Expected Results:
Pages should load a usual.

I wa able to access these site from another computer, so I am assuming that my own system need some type of adjustment to accept the new update of Mozilla 2.0.0.9. Just a guess. Please give any suggestions.
