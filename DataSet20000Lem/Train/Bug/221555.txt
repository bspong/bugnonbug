I haven't been able to use my Linux recently... but this ha occured for the
last few nightly build of MozillaFirebird... since before October. I thought
it would be noticed right away.. but it wasn't.

This is a compaq 5012us with the intel i810 integrated video.. using the latest
driver... I don't think it happened before I changed the vid driver... but it
doesn't occur on any other apps.

I just got it to re occur on this page,
I switched between tab to get back to this one.

There is an extra mouse cursor just sitting on the page.
It go away if I scroll up and down with autoscroll (middle mouse button) to
get the artifict off the screen.

Also, I just noticed that the text under the artifact (the artifact is whatever
wa under the cursor for a split second when rolling the mouse wheel) is
rendered, and then the artifact is rendered on top of it.

This occurs if either smooth scrolling is on or off.

Also, If I autoscroll so that the page go under the autoscroll gliph, it
repair the screen

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.scroll with mouse wheel
2.flip between tab and scroll
3.

Actual Results:
mouse cursor litter the screen, text and background are taken also littered
arround the desktop

Expected Results:
handle mouse repaint better
