Fonts are sometimes "clipped", which mean that their top is cut off and only
the lower part, to some extent, appears. Larger font are affected more often
small fonts. The clipping appears most often when scrolling page by using the
scrollbar; when using the mouse scroll or key it depends on how many line they
are set to, too many line (3+) won't produce clipping.

This is most easily noticed on the home page of The Register. I will attach a
screenshot. Aside from clipped headlines, also note the "Sun slam Red Hat"
headline, where only the hover is affected by the clipping.

Unfocusing the browser window or hiding it (changing window or desktop) will
magically make the font recover instantly. Selecting the affected font also
recovers them.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://theregister.co.uk/ or browse the CSS2 manual at W3C and scroll
using the scrollbar.
2. If the clipping doesn't occur, increase the zoom somewhat.
3. If the clipping still doesn't occur, try changing the font resolution in
Firefox (the natural one for my monitor is 83dpi, clipping kick in badly at 92dpi).

Actual Results:
Fonts have their upper half clipped off.

Expected Results:
Display full line of fonts.
