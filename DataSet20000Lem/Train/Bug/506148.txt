I have my Firefox set to save all tab and to "show my window and tab from last time". When I restart Firefox, all the tab are missing and it reopens with a new tab (not one of the previously opened sites) to my default home page. This only started happening after the newest version/update wa installed (3.0.12).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Went in to history, re-opened all tab that were last opened
2. Closed down firefox via task manager
3. Reopened firefox - last opened tab not there

This ha ONLY been doing this since the new update to Firefox (3.0.12)
Actual Results:
The last opened tab are not appearing when either opening or restarting Firefox, even though (in my settings) it is set to "show my window and tab from last time".

Expected Results:
To have this issue resolved and have the "last opened" tab and window open when Firefox start and/or reopens - a it did in previous versions.

It should have opened ALL the previously opened tab and window that were on Firefox when I wa last on it.
