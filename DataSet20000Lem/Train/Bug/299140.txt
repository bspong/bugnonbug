Previously Reported to Metacrawler...

Firefox currently is the second most used browser, and the fastest growing in usage.

If this problem is not fixed immediately, many of your user will start using
another search engines-including me!

I did not have this problem with the previous version of Firefox...

to version 1.0.4 recently, and I upgraded both computers.

gave up after 4 minute of waiting, and opened an internet explorer window and
tried it there. IE came back almost immediately, but the Firefox metacrawler
search did not come back after 5 minutes, then at 7 minute I noticed it did
return results.
