Replace setOverLink's use of set/clearTimeout with set/clearInterval for great performance win

patch

Bug 605680 made a large improvement to urlbarBindings's setOverLink performance, but there's room for more. Once that bug wa fixed, I did some more Shark profiling with the test in bug 605680 comment 0 and saw that repeated call to set/clearTimeout and related call like nsScriptSecurityManager::CanAccess were taking up nearly half the test time. It would be better if instead of clearing and setting a timeout for each call to setOverLink, rapid call subsequent to the first were no-ops.

This patch replaces set/clearTimeout with set/clearInterval. The first time setOverLink is called, it set the interval. If setOverLink isn't called again before the interval fires, then it's just like before: the over-link is updated, and the interval is cleared. This is what happens when the user mouse over a single link. But if setOverLink is called again before the interval fires, the interval see that and doesn't clear itself, and a long a the interval is set, setOverLink is basically a no-op. When the interval see that setOverLink ha not been called since the last time it wa fired, it update the over-link and clear itself. This is what happens when the user mouse over many link in rapid succession.

The downside is that when setOverLink is called in rapid succession, the delay for showing or hiding the over link when the user finally stop on a link is non-constant: it's in the range [100ms, 200ms). And I think this approach is not a easy to understand a the set/clearTimeout one.

The upside is that my test on my debug build go from 215ms to 21ms (90% win). In my opt build, 54ms to 2ms (96% win). 2ms is practically nothing and is actually faster than my test on 3.6, where it take 45ms.
