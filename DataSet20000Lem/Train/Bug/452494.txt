If I have an xml file loaded from my local file system in firefox 3 (in xml view mode), then open the file in vim and edit it - hit <esc>:w<enter> to save the file but leave vim open, then refresh the page in firefox 3 I get "Page Load Error" - File Not Found error. I am unable to view the xml any more unless I back out to the parent directory and select the file again. This is repeatable for me on each save in vim, but not with TextMate. I am unable to try this on any other OS/Platform currently.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open xml file from local system (file:///Users/jherron/bugs/ff3/demo.xml)
2. validate that xml is displayed properly
3. open file in vim and edit, save file
4. refresh xml file in firefox
Actual Results:
Page Load Error
----
File Not Found













Firefox can't find the file at /Users/jherron/bugs/ff3/demo.xml.







* Could the item have been renamed, removed, or relocated?
* Is there a spelling, capitalization, or other typographical error in the address?
* Do you have sufficient access permission to the requested item?

Expected Results:
Xml file would have been refreshed, showing most recent change

Using latest ff3 that wa auto-updated on my system. no extra theme or add-on have been added by me personally.
