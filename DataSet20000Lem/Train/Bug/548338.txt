Despite Firefox being touted a the ultimate browser in term of security, I am unable to rid my system of a firefox browser hijack which randomly load a site called iamwired.net when I click on a link... in google search result or even on website i am browsing...

I have used Symantec, Mcafee, Malwarebytes, Superantispyware, spybot, hijackthis, TDSS killer, rootkit revealer, Norman, Smitfraud, Stinger and many more..

Nothing change the fact that click randomly take me to iamwired.net and I am surprised that ther eis SO LITTLE to be found online on Google search that tackle this problem in any sensible and foolproof way...

What the hell??

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on any link... in google search or any other website I might be browsing
2. Takes me to iamwired.net instead of the link I clicked on
3.
Actual Results:
I cannot reproduce it, it is absolutely random..About 30% of the link I click on take me to iamwired.net

Expected Results:
I landed up at this stupid iamwired.net site

Gone to the site I clicked on obviously...
