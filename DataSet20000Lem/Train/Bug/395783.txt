Lack of "Other" option when downloading PDF file

I'm using 2.0.0.6 for Mac OSX. When I click a link to a PDF file to download it, I'm given Acrobat Reader a the default application. All the help documentation I've read indicates that Firefox should offer me "Other" a an additional option if I don't want to use Acrobat Reader. Since I have Acrobat Professional, I'd rather use it for PDF files, but without the "Other" option, I can't tell Firefox to handle all PDF file this way. I don't even have Acrobat Reader on this computer.

I tried the Manage File Types option in Content Preferences, but it will not allow user to add a new Action. It generates it action list from past downloads, which brings me back to the original problem of the lack of an "Other" option in the Download Manager.

I wa able to recreate this bug 10 time with a 100% success rate. For now, I can use OSX's "Open" option in the download manager to circumvent the Firefox bug, but it's an unnecessary additional step in the process.

I'm reporting this a a new bug because I wasn't entirely sure if it wa related to:

Bug 354971 – Insufficient option when opening PDF file
Bug 283038 – Mac: firefox suggests Adobe Acrobat a default PDF app instead
of Preview
Bug 290609 – Downloaded pdfs not recognized a pdfs (edit)
Bug 299849 – Mime type ignored for a PDF or JPEG responses. (edit)

Is it possible that all these bug are related?
