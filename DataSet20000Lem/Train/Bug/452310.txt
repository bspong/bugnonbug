A download that work perfectly in a "normal" window doe not work in a modal dialog window. In the normal operation the right information of the content disposition HTTP header is shown - in modal window (that are opened with the showModalDialog function) a download window is also shown - but with the mimetype "|".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start a download with an arbitrary link in a modal dialog window.

Actual Results:
A download window occurs (as expected) but the "Content Type" (German: "vom Typ") is "|" instead of the content type given by the response header. The dialog cannot be closed by pressing the "ok" or "cancel" button.

Expected Results:
A correct dialog that occurs (with the same HTTP headers) in a normal window.

I've just sniffed the HTTP header with the Live HTTP Headers extension here the header of the request and response ...
