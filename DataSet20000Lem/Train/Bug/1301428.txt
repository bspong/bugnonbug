Cannot open Developer Toolbox - TypeError: this.doc is undefined
Reporting this on behalf of ekyle.

He had hit a breakpoint in his debugger, but continuing failed to work - Javascript execution continued to be halted at his breakpoint.

He reloaded the tab, and the toolbox wa collapsed. Attempting to re-open it resulted in this stack being thrown in the Browser Console:

A promise chain failed to handle a rejection. Did you forget to '.catch', or did you forget to 'return'?
