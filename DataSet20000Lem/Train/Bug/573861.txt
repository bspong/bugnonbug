I wa do a scan via the web site listed in the URL section. The Anti-virus wa running for about 20 hours. It completed it task, but I wa at another location and could not response. Thus, the web site wa patiently awaiting for my return so I can process the result from the anti-virus scan.

During this time, an update for Firefox wa automatically downloaded and tried to install. I think the update installation tried to bring down Firefox, but could not and something reported that Firefox stopped responding.

When I came back to the machine, the only thing I could do wa click on the OK button.
