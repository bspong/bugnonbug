Big memory usage opening a pdf document on Windows, especially "gfx-d2d-vram-drawtarget"
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0
Build ID: 20130409194949

Steps to reproduce:

I try to open this document:

http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/DM00037051.pdf

With firefox 20.0.1 and pdf.js version 0.8.1


Actual results:

Scrolling the document up and down, Firefox us a lot of memory. Expecially, looking about:memory, it seems that a lot of memory is used by gfx-d2d-vram-drawtarget. At the moment is 751.02MB but it increase continuosly scrolling the document and never go down. The only way to make this value lower, is to close the document and press "Minimize memory usage" button. In this way, that value go down to 17MB (in this case, the value can change but it always go significantly down when I press the button).
The video card used (I say this because I read gfx-d2d-vram-drawtarget) is an integrated Intel HD Graphics and the driver version is: 8.15.10.2827.
The operative system is Windows Seven 64 bit


Expected results:

I think that firefox should use a lot le memory since the document is not so big.
