Browser get stuck after using AJAX site

While browsing certain site - especially AJAX site like Google documents, also noticed this happening on Facebook login page - Firefox is getting stuck. The GUI doe not react on any of the command like tab switching, tab closing, etc. However, if I click on "window close" button, the GUI seems to start reacting - i.e. the command that I gave previosly, like switching or closing tab, is executed and I after that I see the "Are you sure" dialog box. After I click Cancel, the GUI return to the "stuck" state - even if I close the tab with problematic page. I.e. no command is executed when I give it, but if I click on "window close" button, previous command are executed and then dialog is displayed.
Also, while the GUI is stuck, the menu behaves quite strange - some menu item can be highlighted and some can't - i.e. when I move around the menu with keyboard, the selection bar is shown on some items, but not others - e.g., in View menu, Toolbars, Sidebar, Text size, Page Style and Character Encoding show selection, while Status Bar, Reload, Page Source and Full Screen don't. In Bookmarks menu, all folder show selection, while all non-folder bookmars don't. It look like only item having sub-menus linked to them show selection bars, and also the triangle (>) on the right side of the menu item having submenu is not drawn when GUI is in "stuck" mode.
The only way to get nrowser back to normal seems to be to restart it by killing the current instance and start the new one. When I kill the browser window, the application doe not exit - it stay in memory until I kill it.
