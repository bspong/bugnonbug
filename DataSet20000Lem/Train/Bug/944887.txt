ReferenceError when disabling add-on
Got this in the error console when disabling my add-on.

I've finished changing the code to use the new CustomizableUI module in Australis. I've not made many test on this (a bit of a lack of time). When disabling the add-on, I'm unregisterArea()'ing custom toolbar from it, physically removing them, and destroyWidget()'ing several custom buttons. The error only happened once, I can't reproduce it.

However I'm not sure this is the fault of my own code, a it pointed to a strange place:

(In isWidgetRemovable())
> if (!widgetNode) {
> // Pick any of the build window to look at.
> let [window,] = [...gBuildWindows][0];
> [, widgetNode] = this.getWidgetNode(widgetId, window);
> }

Also, maybe bug 942581 will influence this a well, if it's the call in unregisterArea() to removeWidgetFromArea() that caused this.

Any clues? Maybe throw in a failsafe in that bit would be enough? When it did error, everything seemed to continue well (everything from the add-on wa removed properly with no trace) and I wa able to re-enable the add-on without causing conflict or further errors.
