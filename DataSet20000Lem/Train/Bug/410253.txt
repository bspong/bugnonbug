Page post data to itself to update a table in a mysql database. when that page load after update it get the data it just updated from the database fine, but after the php script finish executing, the data seems to vanish from the database. VERY strange, i can't see how this could be a browser problem but i tried EVERYthing else and banged my head for hours, then tried it in internet explorer and it worked fine.

initially i made the page on an xp system, but i just got vista and had to make some change to the page. it worked fine on xp and these problem only occured after i "upgraded" (yeah right) to vista.

i'm curious to know what you find out

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load mysql data into a bunch of form that submit to the same page
2. using the new data after posted update mysql table
3. get the data again in the same script, including whats just been updated (works fine)
4. check db once script completes (data missing from db)
