Any "help" related link on eBay site brings up a popup window. This window is
either blank (white) or display for part of a second then clears.
Some URLs are:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/buy/search_tips.html
http://pages.ebay.com/help/account/my_ebay_bidding.html
http://pages.ebay.com/search/items/basicsearch.html
I've tried others and they (help links) all seem to not display.
Displays correctly in IExplorer 6.0.2800 and Netscape Communicator 4.8

Sometimes it fill with color and text, for le than a second, then go blank.

NOTE:
IExplorer 6 fill with color, yellow, and text which remains.

I noticed it originally with build .4 yesterday.
Couldn't find any other help popup window site to check them.
