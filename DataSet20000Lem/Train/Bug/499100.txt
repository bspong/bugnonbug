In firefox 3.0.x it wa possible to use keyboard shortcut (left arrow, right arrow, Home,End) to move quickly between tab (for example:End key to jump to the last tab)

It doesn't work in Firefox 3.5 RC1, and in the trunk(Minefield) . The "End" key for example, will cause a move to the end of the current page, instead of to the last tab.

The reason for the problem is probably because tab are not "selected" like they used to in Firefox 3.0.x .
A mouse click on the tab chooses the tab and highlight it, but in Firefox 3 it would also mark it with a rectangle a if it is selected, and marks/signs that keyboard command work currently on the tab instead of on other object (the current page, for example)




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open many tabs, choose a tab by clicking it with the mouse
2. Try to navigate with the keyboard shortcut between tabs, moving a tab right, moving to the last tab, moving to the first tab, etc.

Actual Results:
keyboard shortcut navigate on the page of the current tab

Expected Results:
keyboard shortcut should be navigating between tab
