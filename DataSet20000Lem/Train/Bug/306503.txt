When Deer Park (at least the last few week of nightly builds) is open, it
crash the iTunes Music Store (and iTunes with it). When I close Deer Park, the
iTunes Music Store behaves normally again. Deer Park only crash the Music
Store; when only viewing the library to play a stored song, etc., iTunes
operates normally--suggesting that Deer Park creates an unstable internet access
environment for iTunes when iTunes try to go out and access the internet while
Deer Park is open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start iTunes and Deer Park (nightly build from anytime in August)
2. Once both program are running, access the Music Store through iTunes
3. The Music Store might not crash at once, if this is the case try browsing the
internet while browsing the Music Store.

Actual Results:
The iTunes Music Store never load and iTunes crashes. Deer Park appears unchanged.

Expected Results:
A user should be able to have Deer Park open while browsing the iTunes Music
Store. Something in Deer Park is breaking iTunes' access to the internet.

Only tested using iTunes 4.9. Additional software environment info: Mac OS X
10.4.2 with latest update (through 8.30.05), Deer Park 20050830 (though last
few week of nightlies break iTunes Music Store), and not surfing by proxy.
