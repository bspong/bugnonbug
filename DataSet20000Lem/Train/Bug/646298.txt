Extra unnecessary space at the very top of the toolbar (normally where tab are) when a window that wa not maximized wa closed, then a maximized window (one that wa set to open maximized by default and pinned to the taskbar) wa opened.

I have firefox pinned to the taskbar, and set it to open maximized by default. I made a window un-maximized (doesn't matter the size, I've checked), closed it then opened firefox from the taskbar again, and found extra space above tab and the firefox button for no reason. (Firefox 4.0)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pin firefox 4.0 to the taskbar
2. Right-click on the pinned firefox icon
3. Right-click on 'Mozilla Firefox'; open property
4. Set 'Run:' value to maximized
5. Open firefox, un-maximize (doesn't matter size)
6. Close this un-maximized window
7. Launch firefox from the taskbar
8. Check the very top of the window for extra space
Actual Results:
Extra space still found

Expected Results:
No extra space; the toolbars are unnecessarily shifted down

Default theme, firefox 4.0, window 7 SP1
