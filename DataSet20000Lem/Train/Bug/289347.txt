Redirection of www.compaq.com fails with status bar indicating "waiting for www.compaq.com..."
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

When entering http://www.compaq.com into the location bar, the browser fails to
navigate to that page. The status bar hang at "waiting for www.compaq.com..."
MS Internet Explorer successfully refirects to http://h18000.www1.hp.com. I
tested on three different computer with the same result. I also tested Mozilla
1.7.6 on two WinXP machine with the same result.

Further testing show that ping to www.compaq.com time out, but the URL doe
resolve to 161.114.19.252. If I enter this IP address directly into the location
bar, I am taken to the Compaq page on the HP web site. Also, if I enter the
redirected URL (h18000.www1.hp.com) this also successfully take me to the
Compaq page.

Doing an nslookup on www.compaq.com return a "Non-authoritative answer" of
161.114.19.252 (same resolution a a ping).

Finally, I have tested both behind a firewalled router on a broadband connection
a well a using a "naked" (non-firewalled) dial-up connection on a completely
different ISP (using different DNS servers). The redirection fails in every case
on Firefox and Mozilla, but succeeds on IE6.
