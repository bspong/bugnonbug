When closing a number of Firefox window (typically > 7) by using the "Close
Group" option on the context menu which is displayed by right-clicking the
Firefox button on the taskbar, my IBM G40 laptop HARD FREEZES. Mouse cursor
cease to move approximately 3 second after button disappears from taskbar and
keyboard is totally unresponsive. No other method of input (i.e. plugging in a
device to a USB port) generates a response, and the machine is unresponsive to
ARP request on the network... it is just plain dead except the screen is frozen
on. I have to hard reset the machine to get it going again.
