I have an F5 SSL accelerator (SSL proxy). It is misconfigured so that it will
accept incoming SSL connection but the server it is proxying to is inacessable.
I open FireFox to any non-SSL page, say http://google.com. In the title bar I
enter the URL for the proxy. It wait for a while and then title bar go
yellow (to indicate a secure connection), and the lock icon appears for the page
I'm currently on ("www.google.com"), even though I never loaded that page via
SSL. If I double-click the lock icon I get a "Page Info" dialog that say "The
web site www.google.com support authentication...". If I view the security
certificate it is the certificate from the SSL accelerator however.
Unfortunitely I cannot give public access to the SSL proxy used here since it is
being used for internal testing at my company. I wa able to reproduce this
many time in a row, but after closing the browser window I wa no longer able
to reproduce.
