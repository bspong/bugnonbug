After browsing 50 course web page on ee.stanford.edu and
downloading 2500 PDF and HTML file Firefox memory usage grows
to 278MB Real and 622MB Virtual memory.

Selecting the URL field of the first browser window to be opened
and pressing the Delete (Backspace) key to delete the URL doe not
work.

Instead of deleting the URL, Firefox display the previous page
from the browser history.

Since 1.5.0 I have noticed that Firefox doe not fully release all
storage allocated for a browser window when the browser window is closed.

Some structure is being overflowed and causing Firefox to misbehave.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any large web site with many downloadable file like ee.stanford.edu
2. open 50-60 course web page
3. download all PDF document linked to the course page
4. go back to the first browser window and select the URL and press Delete

Actual Results:
Selecting the URL field of the first browser window to be opened
and pressing the Delete (Backspace) key to delete the URL doe not
work.

Instead of deleting the URL, Firefox display the previous page
from the browser history.


Expected Results:
The character in the URL field should have been deleted.
