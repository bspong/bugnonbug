MFF4 not responding (XP)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

With the previous update this wa fixed, but now with MFF 4, the browser is again more "not responding" than working.

Most often (3/4), if I disconnected from the i/net, and connect again - MFF will not respond, which mean I have to close it - which take forever, if it is not responding and then I have to reopen it, which always take forever.

But even while working, MFF would just stop working or script (especially? gmail) would get unresponsive. Also moving/opening to another tab/site may cause it to "not responding". Yesterday been "restore session" 3 times, due to this error. Sometimes us up to 99% of CPU usage - which mean I can do NOTHING.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Work in browser
2.Do not work in browser - happens to notice while doing something else.
3. Click on link
4. Move to another tab
5. Disconnect I/net - reconnect - reload page

Actual Results:
The browser becomes unresponsive - sometimes becomes responsive again after 30+ seconds, sometimes not.

Or, script on page becomes unresponsive

Expected Results:
Browser to be consistently responsive. Script to be consistently responsive.
