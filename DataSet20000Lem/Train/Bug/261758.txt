If you click on a link that initiate a download (such a the supplied URL),
then the download dialog box briefly appears off to the right of the browser and
then flick across to the top left corner. This is the box that asks you how to
handle the file type ("Open With" or "Save to Disk"), so the above will only
work if it's not set to automatically download that file type.

Hardly more than a cosmetic issue.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on the supplied URL, observe shifting dialog box.
2.If your browser is set to automatically download or open file of that type,
then try downloading a different file type, or reset the file type handling for
gzip files.
Actual Results:
The dialog box open in one place then quickly move to a different one.

Expected Results:
The dialog box should have opened and remained in a stable position.

This regression appeared between the 20040730 and 20040805 build on the trunk.

As such, I wonder if it's another regression caused by the fix of bug 223545,
and thus related to the context menu problem in bug 257647. The latter bug wa
fixed on the trunk by 20040918, but maybe a related fix is required for this one?
