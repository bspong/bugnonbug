Since i updated from FF2 to FF3 i have a very annoying problem, that all content in firefox is dissappearing, this means, independ from website or kind of content it dissappears after a while, it hard to explain, but if i use another window (any other app) and i "wipe" my screen, it come back, sometimes simple scrolling fix the display, sometimes resizing the window, This ha never happend with FF2, i didnt changed my display driver since then, i really go insane with this, maybe it happens due too very long uptime, but even a restart of FF did not fix the issue, hopefully someone can reproduce the problem or it a known bug on Ati Mob. Radeon 9000 which is built in my Thinkpad. it happens in all resolutions. After a reboot it work 4 a while, but depend on the use of FF it come back after 3-4 Days.

What exactly wa changed in the way how ff3 handle the window API since FF2?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bye Thinkpad T41 with Ati 9000
