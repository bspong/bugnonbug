flicker in address bar after using Firefox for a while (> 30 min)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050421 Firefox/1.0.3 (Debian package 1.0.3-2)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050421 Firefox/1.0.3 (Debian package 1.0.3-2)

When entering new address into the URL bar, the FF-window begin to flicker
and entry becomes sluggish (text lag way behind typing). For me it only happens
under Linux, but the bug ha been persistent from 0.8 all the way to 1.0.3.

I have tried a "naked" 1.0.3 stable a well a the latest nightly build on a
blank account with no extension or theme installed. The problem definately
*is* there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox Browser <= 1.0.3 under Linux
2. Surf the web on various site for a while (about 30 minuts/5 sites)
3. Watch the annoying flickering screen bug when entering new addresses.

Actual Results:
See summary

Expected Results:
The browser window should not flicker and address text should appear a fast a
I can type.

I suspect maybe a problem with the "autocomplete" feature, but it is just a gut
feeling. I cannot find a way (even with about:config) to switch autocomplete off
entirely to confirm this feeling.
