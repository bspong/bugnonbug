Firefox is unusable if it will not retain the Automatically detect connection setting.

Under Tools/Options/Connections settings/ it automatically re-sets itself to "Manual proxy configuration," after being set to "Automatically detect proxy setting." By doing this, it will not find a web site, ever.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link or put in a web site address
2.
3.
Actual Results:
The requested URL could not be retrieved
While trying to retrieve the URL: http://www.webshots.com/
The following error wa encountered:
Unable to determine IP address from host name for www.webshots.com
The dnsserver returned:
Temporary network problem, please retry later
This mean that:
The cache wa not able to resolve the hostname presented in the URL.
Check if the address is correct.

Expected Results:
The reason it can't find the web site address is because it ha re-set itself to manual proxy configuration. I have re-set it to automatically detect proxy configuration a dozen time and the very next time I try it, it ha gone back to manual, and can't find the web page.

Should maintain the setting I put in there. I don't know what caused this. Yesterday both Internet Explorer and Firefox had to be re-set to "Automatically detect proxy configuration." I don't know how they got changed. No one else us my computer, but Internet Explorer ha retained the setting I gave it, and Firefox will not retain the setting. Why not? I even uninstalled Firefox and re-installed from the web site, but the problem continues.
