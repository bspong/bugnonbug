Firefox isn't starting anymore. It's coming up a usual with the sandclocksymbol
for about 3 seconds, then dissapears without haven opened.
Started from cli, it say segmentation fault.
A look into my syslog gave :
320064 kernel: [ 1928.384520] firefox[12126]: segfault at 7fb12ee644e4 rip 7fafa37bf246 rsp 7fffab9d0340 error 4

Next I tried starting with safe-mode option, same
Next I tried a purge remove and reinstall , same
Next I renamded it's workdirectory , same
Next I purged again , same

I did a strace ff, which is found here :
http://paste.ubuntu.com/76219/

Before that, ff worked fine, I closed it and shut down pc a usual.
At next reboot I got this.
Any hint ?
