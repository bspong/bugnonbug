This seems related to the recent bugfixes for favicons and bookmarks. I have a
particular bookmark on the Bookmarks toolbar which ha the incorrect favicon and
ha had since before I upgraded to this version of Firefox.

When I go to the page again, Firefox see that the new favicon for the page is
invalid and remove it. However, it doe not replace it with the generic "Page"
icon. It just leaf a gap where the icon once was.

In addition, if I restart the browser, the incorrect icon will have reappeared.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark a page which ha a valid favicon.ico
2. Change the site so it favicon.ico is invalid
3. Revisit the site

Actual Results:
- Icon next to bookmark disappears and leaf a blank space.
- Reloading the browser cause the old, now invalid, bookmark to reappear.

Expected Results:
- Bookmark should show generic "Page" icon.
- Should "forget" the old icon which is invalid.

Hard to reproduce because the reproduce step I gave involve actually making
change to the website and reloading Firefox.
