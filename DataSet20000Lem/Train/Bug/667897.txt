Error message when I try and open FF5

Hi,

First I’d like to tell everyone that I’m not a programmer. I’m a person that us Firefox 5 and Windows 7 x64. I would like to help with the development of Nightly by offering my general opinion on issues.

I installed Nightly 7.0a1 yesterday. I assume you are supposed to be able to go back and forth between Firefox 5 and Nightly. Since installing Nightly I cannot use Firefox. I do not have Chrome installed on my computer. I get the following message when I try and open Firefox:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: chrome://browser/content/browser.xul
Line Number 448, Column 9: <toolbarbutton id="inspector-previous-toolbutton"
--------^

I use lot of add-on so I’m including a list of them. I have tried enabling and disabling them one by one in different combinations. I hope this help you to fix this problem.
