First off, sorry for essentially reporting a broken web page, but my reporting mechanism doesn't seem to be working for that either.

The problem: Panasonic web browser interface for BB-HCM531A and BB-HCM547A doe not work correctly in Firefox. Video stream from buffered camera data doe not show in Firefox, but doe show correctly in EI for Windows, and Safari for Windows and Mac. I am using Flip4Mac latest version (Flip4Mac WMV Studio v.2.2.2.3) Still photo show correctly, but video not showing up.

The website listed is protected. Let me know if you need a login/password for my cam to see the problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to camera
2. Click on "Buffered Images"
3. Attempt to view any Video stream.
Actual Results:
No video show up... just an empty spot where a video would be. Page shgows a "Done" loading.

Expected Results:
Video normally is streamed into web page from camera, a it doe correctly in Safari and IE for Windows and Mac.

Clearing all cache doe not help.
