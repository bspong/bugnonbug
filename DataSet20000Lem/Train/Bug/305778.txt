When using Firefox on XP with the Multiple Desktop Powertoy from Microsoft
installed a number of problem are present. One such is where Firefox is open on
one desktop and an application trigger a page to open in another desktop.
Firefox open the page by switching it current instance to the currently
displayed desktop. In doing so, it resizes to be really small in the top-left
corner of the screen, even though it wa maximised on original desktop.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Multiple Desktop Windows XP Powertoy. Set the "SHARED DESKTOP" option
to OFF. (No problem occured when I tried this with shared desktop setting to on)
2. Run Firefox and maximise. Set open link from other application to open in
new tab in current window.
3. Switch to different desktop, open application which allows you to click link
which will open in Firefox. (Verified bug opening link from Google Desktop
search and Outlook mail messages)
4. Click on link to be opened in Firefox


Actual Results:
Firefox opened the link in a new tab in the current window. The current window
switched so that it wa displayed on the current desktop. It wa resized so that
it occupied only a small percentage of the screen-space available instead of
being maximised.

Expected Results:
Switched the Firefox instance to the current desktop, while maintaining the size
of the existing window.
Alternatively, switched window to the desktop on which Firefox wa already
opened and displayed the page maximised there.
