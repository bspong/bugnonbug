Heavy CPU load on page load
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

When Firefox is loading web pages, it seems to cause quite a heavy CPU load. If
a page load take longer than usual, due to a congested network or whatever, the
CPU load continues at the same level, which make the computer unnecessarily
unresponsive.

How to reproduce:
1) Start some system monitoring tool that is able to show the CPU load.
2) Point Firefox to a page that is consistently slow to load, such a
<http://www.autark.se/slowpage.pl>.
3) While the page is loading, note the CPU load for Firefox.

Expected behavior:
After a peak when the page start loading, Firefox's CPU usage should fall back
to a lower rate while the browser is waiting for data.

Current behavior:
The CPU load go up to 15 - 50% and stay there until the page ha finished
loading.

It seems to make a difference whether the page is loaded in a foreground tab or
in the background: the CPU usage go down considerably when another tab is
made active and rise when the loading page is brought back to the foreground.

It seems that the problem doe not occur with a fresh profile. When using my old
profile, it doesn't seem to make a difference if I uninstall the few extension
I normally have installed (Web Developer and User Agent Switcher).

The problem seems to be Firefox-specific, a I cannot reproduce the behavior in
Mozilla 1.8a4. Maybe it's also specific to Linux.
