Firefox is stuck "transferring data from" and the page never load
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.5.21022)

After maybe 10 min, firefox will be unable to load web page a it is stuck 'transferring data from' in it status. It's a if domain lookup ha failed, or it is not recieving any data. Internet explorer doe not have these problems, so I do not believe it is caused by anything external to firefox ( broken DNS, lost network connection, etc ). Quit and restart Firefox and it's good for a bit longer, tnen the problem present again. Yahoo mail seems to be good for replicating this problem ( although it is a frequently accessed site, so that may be coincidental )

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into a yahoo mail account
2.Read mail, send mail, and stay logged in for 10-15 min.
3.Eventually Firefox loos the ability to contact other sites.
Actual Results:
If sending mail, Yahoo report a timeout message and say it will keep trying to send the email ( so maybe existing connection are not affected - a data just came back , but it loos the ability to create new one ? ) Subsequently no other website can be looked up and loaded.

Expected Results:
Should have sent mail and loaded the page.

I'd classify it a a critical bug a it's flakiness ha forced me to use internet explorer, which sucks.
