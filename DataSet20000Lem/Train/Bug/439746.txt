I Updated to Firefox 3 and since I had not install the window medium player plug in. I saw there wa a tester for other file format like pdf and then I tried to run it. the document didnt load and a a second not while trying to type up this bug my usb keyboard stopped reacting and required me to unplug and replug it in. I did try to reinstall adobe with no luck in fixing this solution. I don't know the reason for adobe not functioning or my keyboard malfunction but both seemed to start when I installed firefox 3.0 on my window vista 64bit premium pc.
