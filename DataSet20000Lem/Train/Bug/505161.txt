Every time I open my yahoo account in Mozilla Firefox and then each email I go to open (well, each new page in the account), I get an annoying pop-up box saying "You have chosen to open st which is an application/octet-stream from ad.yieldmanager.com" and it ha to be closed 4 or 5 time at once. I'm not about to "Open with" or "Save file" but it is on every next page so it's hard to ignore. It's only my yahoo account that it appears on and only in Firefox. I've done spybot scan and virus scan but it just keep coming up. Any suggestion a to what can be done about it would be greatly appreciated.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla Firefox
2.Log in to Yahoo
3.Go to mail
Actual Results:
Several copy of the pop up box appear, at every page I turn to in my yahoo account.

Expected Results:
No pop up box at all.

I can't tell if it's Firefox or Yahoo that the pop ups are attached to but it doesn't happen to my Yahoo in Opera.
