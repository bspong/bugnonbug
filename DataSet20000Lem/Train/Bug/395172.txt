Once you press Ctrl-D or select Bookmarks - Bookmark this page from the menu, you cannot change your mind: the page is automatically starred and bookmarked. The UI at the star button also doe not have any cancel options.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Ctrl-D or select Bookmarks - Bookmark this page... from the menu
2. Hit escape or click somewhere in the webpage to close the UI at the Star
3. Open Bookmarks menu
Actual Results:
The page is starred and bookmarked in the All Bookmarks folder

Expected Results:
The page should not be starred or bookmarked

Pressing the Star in the address bar twice and the pressing escape doe not bookmark the page, in that case it is only starred. It only happens when using the bookmark menu or the keyboard shortcut.

By the way, the Star UI should probably have a "Close" or "Cancel" button or something, to make it more visible for a user not to add a bookmark. But that may be another bug.
