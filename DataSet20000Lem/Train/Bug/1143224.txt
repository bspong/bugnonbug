Steps to reproduce:

1) install this j app from web
git clone git@github.com:cegeka/library_app.git
cd library_app
git checkout 03cb865
cd spa
npm install -g grunt
bower install
npm install
grunt server

2) open app in Firefox and Chrome (fresh profile, addons disabled and safe mode) and point both browser to http://localhost:8000/

3) go to network tab for both, clear the result and edit the file "library_app/spa/app/index.html" Each edit reloads all the file in both browsers. In FF it is much slower than in Chromium 2.27 second v 268 miliseconds

Actual results:

Firefox load the file much slower than Chrome. This is a normal web developer workflow. Each time I hit save in my source code this happens and sometimes it even go to 5 seconds. I seen this happen even with fewer 404 request (this example and this commit wa specially crafted for this bug but this is common on a normal project).

Also Firefox load the same file several times. There are more request on FF than on Chromium.


Expected results:

Firefox should load file in a few houndred miliseconds
