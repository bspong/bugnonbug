I visited some website don't remember it. A message poped up that a malware is detected in my computer and it suggested that it will scan my computer. I have three option:
1. "ok"
2. "cancel"
3. click on the x to close it.

I choosed option 3-close the window. Then another window opened and started to install some files. Luckily I wa quick enough to close firefox via task manager. In one of the the window that flash wa a firefox version 3.5.4. I checked and sure enough some file wa in the firefox directory wa there. I compressed the file and deleted them.

I then started firefox again and check your website for the latest and sure enough 3.5.3 wa the latest and I do have firefox version 3.5.3.

Due to issue with malware in the past I did not store history of website I visited and turn off system restore.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Actual Results:
I closed firefox in the task manager then deleted the firefox update version.


Possible malware browser hijack. The majority of the downloaded file are called 1.patch to 39.patch
