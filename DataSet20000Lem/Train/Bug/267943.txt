With multiple tab open, if I create a new tab and enter the URL of a site that
doe not exist, the Firefox window will disappear. The process will still be
running and the program still show a "Running" under Task Manager. I have not
found a way to bring the application back to the foreground, so I always have to
"End Program" in Task Manager. This last time I tried entering
http://www.icfai.edu (the correct URL is http://www.icfai.org).

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open multiple tab (usually three, usually Autozone.com in first, Yahoo! Mail
in second, Slashdot in third)
3. Create new fourth tab
4. Enter URL of a site that doe not exist, such a http://www.icfai.edu

Actual Results:
Firefox lock up, then window disappears. Program is still running a shown
under Task Manager. Have to force the program to end.

Expected Results:
Give an error message to the effect of "Server not found."
