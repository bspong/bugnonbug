(Tried to find my previous reports. Can't. I have a life.)

1) randomly firefox ignores normal mouse button activity, notably
window normal cut/past dropdowns do not activate. More so for
right mouse button functions?

2) New info:
Seems to misbehave more on win2k than XP. (different PCs)
(XP may in fact not exhibit problem????)

Seems to be more to do with not recognizing 'right' mouse
button clicks.

Same Sites fine with ie, olde netscape.

Seems to be 'invoke menu dropdown' that misbehaves:
eg menu for 'save image as', etc, doe not appear.
Same site, mouse, OS, HW, menu appears when site accessed
with ie, etc....

www.gocomics.com

exhibit the image save function misbehaviour, work fine with ie.
DO NOT think it problem with page...

'many' page show the 'text cut/won't paste' misbehaviour.

(Yes: this is vagueish. I have a life outside reporting bugs.....)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.good luck. Wish i could be more exact.
3.
Actual Results:
1) dropdown sometimes not invoked.
2) if invoked for text past, paste function grayed.

Expected Results:
routine normal standard cut/paste

good luck
