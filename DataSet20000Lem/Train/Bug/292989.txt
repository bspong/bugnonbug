The "Disable Common Annoyances" setting for JavaScript is good except that if
you want to create a popup window with no toolbars and no statusbar using
JavaScript, then the statusbar cannot be turned off on these popups if this
setting is ticked. This can be a little bit annoying on XUL applications, where
I would not want a statusbar on all my popup dialogs.

For an example, see the Mozilla Amazon Browser XUL application, and go to help
-> about, if the Common Annyances setting is ticked, there will be a status bar
on the about dialog, if it is unticked, there will not be a statusbar.

If possible, it would be good to change this behaviour, and make it possible for
the statusbar to be hidden only on popup windows, but not on the main browser
window, if the "disable common annoyances" setting is ticked.
