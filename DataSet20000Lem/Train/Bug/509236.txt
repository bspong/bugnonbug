Upon opening a new tab the cursor position is on the button "before the "verified" button" instead of in the address bar

This is very annoying a upon opening a new tab (ctrl-t) you will then either have to click in the address bar to go to a web page, or hit tab on the keyboard twice. It always used to default to being in the address bar which made thing alot quicker!

NB: It seems that the first new tab you open the cursor will be in the correct place, however for subsequent new tab it'll go into the wrong place.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox
2. Ctrl-t - open new tab
3. Go to web page...
4. Ctrl-t - open another new tab
5. Cursor won't be in the address bar!! Most annoying
Actual Results:
Cursor wasn't in the address bar and I had to hit tab twice to get it there

Expected Results:
Cursor should be in the address bar for best ease of use
