If you look at the image that separate the post in
http://80.33.68.219/demencias/ you'll see that (in firefox) it's height seems 1
pixel. But if you look at the blog with another browser (or you save the image
and open it with a graphic manipulation tool), the image's height is clearly 2
pixels. The code that 'displays' the image is a follows:
<center><img src="imagenes/sep.gif" style="float: none"></center>

What's funny is that if you point directly to the image
(http://80.33.68.219/demencias/imagenes/sep.gif) it appears "as is". I tried
both .png and .gif, having the same problem. I noticed the problem when using
Firefox 1.0.4 (in Linux (Debian), Windows XP and Windows 2000 Professional) and
waited until 1.0.6 wa out, but the bug wa not corrected, so here it is.

I use the default theme, both in Linux and Windows.
