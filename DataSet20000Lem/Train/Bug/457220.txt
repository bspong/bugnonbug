Misaligned header & header value when displaying "Full Headers" in Yahoo email "classic"

When displaying "Full Headers" while reading a Yahoo email (using "Yahoo mail classic"), the header "key" and "value" component frequently don't align. For example, the "from" address information (i.e. value) sometimes doesn't align with the (key) header tag "From: ". Same with "Received: ", "Date: ", "Message-ID: ". The font used for the "key" and "value" don't seem to have the same vertical sizing. The problem is **most** visible and annoying if the browser window is made very narrow, requiring many linefeeds in the header info.

I'm using Firefox 3.0.2 on a Dell Inspiron 8600 laptop running XP Pro w/SP3.

I tried MSIE 6.0.2900.5512.xpsp on the same system and the misalignment still exists, but is not a annoying. Even with a very narrow browser window, the line more-or-less line up properly.
