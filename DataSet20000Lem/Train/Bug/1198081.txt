v40.0.2 ha now made Facebook, Google Calendar and lord know what else not display properly.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
Build ID: 20150812163655

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox wa working perfectly earlier today...I even think it wa 40.0.2, but not sure. I ran it in safe mode to rule out add-ons, but still the same problem. Then with a bit of research, I read that Mozilla decided to make Java NOT run by default and the only way to make it run wa to use about:config and also actually go to the directory on my computer and choose Java.exe to run and it still doesn't show picture and several button are missing...What are you thinking????? I have used Firefox and Thunderbird for more year than I care to remember, but this ridicule stunt make Chrome look allot more appealing by the hour. Do you even test your product BEFORE you release it???? Can you tell, I am NOT happy???


Actual results:

Still doesn't display properly, even in safe mode.


Expected results:

Not to have been bothered by you screwing up a browser that I count on daily. You need to get v40.0.3 out to fix your previous screw-ups (which this version wa supposed to fix...) You have truly disappointed me and I am sure THOUSANDS of others a well.
