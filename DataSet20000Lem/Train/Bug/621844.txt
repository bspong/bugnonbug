i tried to search for a site i used yesterday and firefox just hung up with the list dropped down, mouse pointer wa text select, had to close it by right click -> close on the taskbar button, closed after 30 sec or so with a crash notice; when trying to restart firefox the window kept appearing for 1-2 second and then the program closed by itself - repeatedly, at least 3-4 times.

I opened firefox 3, did some browsing, closed it and then started ff4 and now it works; doesn't lock up when typing an address, not even the one that did it before

couldn't make firefox lock up so i can see if this happens again
