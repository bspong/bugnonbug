On visiting the indicated website, http://www.glitnir.is/, nothing is painted, or only random scattered element of the page are painted. When I switch to another tab and back to this one, the other tab remains displayed, until I mouse over the element of the page. Some of them repaint on mouseover, while others continue to show the other tab's contents.

Happens under safe mode a well. Persists across tab reloads, browser restarts
and zoom changes.

Resizing the window down to the content width (the http://www.glitnir.is/
website ha a centered fixed-width layout) get some repainting going, but it
is broken; the whole page content appears on the left in the window (it should
be centered), and when I mouse over it, the same element get repainted where
they should be in the correctly laid-out page (so they appear in two places).



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.glitnir.is/
2. Mouse around
3. Switch to another tab and back
Actual Results:
Very broken rendering/repainting.

Expected Results:
Normal website display.

I reproduced this in beta 4, beta 4 rc1, and beta 3, but not in beta 2. In beta 2 the specified website displayed without problems.

The website in question is a fairly-high-traffic banking website and ha been working fine in Firefox 2.0.0.* and the other major browser for years.
