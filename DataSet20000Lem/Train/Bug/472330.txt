Firefox stop responding to Launch Services request from other apps

After running Firefox 3.1b2 (or nightlies) for some period of time, it will stop responding to Launch Services requests. For example, if I click on an URL in Thunderbird, it will switch to Minefield, but no new window or tab opens. Likewise if I try to "open text.html" from Terminal.

I've run with NSPR_LOG_MODULES=all:5, but I see no log entry at all at the moment I click, and there are no JavaScript message in the console. It didn't happen with Firefox 3.0 release. I'm happy to try some debugging steps, but I don't know where to start.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox >= 3.1b2 for a few day
2. Click on an URL in another application


Actual Results:
The Firefox/Minefield menu-bar appears, but there's no new tab or window with the URL you clicked on

Expected Results:
A new tab or window open up with the URL you clicked on
