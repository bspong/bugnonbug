bad rendering of text anywhere on page when selecting text with mouse
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050730 Firefox/1.0.6 (Debian package 1.0.6-2)

Text, especialy text on page (but AFAIR also sometimes text in the mozilla UI,
like menus) is missrendered - text is padded 1-2 pixel randomly.
This is especially visible when selecting a text with mouse, the selected part
is redrawed, each time with randomly shifted 1 or 2 pixel randomly.

I thought it wa fault of my XFree86, but this bug is still visible, even if I
upgraded:
1) firefox 1.03, 1.04, 1.06
2) on both debian sarge and debian sid
3) on both xfree86 and xorg

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a www page
2. select text with mouse few time

Actual Results:
Text wil "move" while selecting it and will be missrendering - moved by 1-2 pixel

Expected Results:
Correct rendering
