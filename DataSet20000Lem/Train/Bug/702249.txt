Long UI freeze on PR_WaitCondVar() of libnspr4.so
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86_64; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0
Build ID: 20111104165243

Steps to reproduce:

For example, open this URL: http://www.showmethegames.com/sales.php

(But this happen many time during a session (almost every minute if I open and close tab a a normal navigation).


Actual results:

Firefox UI freeze during long time (almost 10-20 sec). On 7.0 it wa also freeze but in a short time (2-3 sec). I can't do anything during this time.

The site given a example freeze multiple times, I can't navigate on it actually. I must close the site tab during the 2-3sec Firefox give control because it freeze again after this short time.


Expected results:

The site should work perfectly, without freezes.

There is the GDB backtrace I made during freeze:

Program received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
0xffffe430 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb) bt
#0 0xffffe430 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
#1 0xf77c6f62 in pthread_cond_timedwait@@GLIBC_2.3.2 () from /lib/libpthread.so.0
#2 0xf72ee309 in PR_WaitCondVar () from [...]/firefox/libnspr4.so
#3 0xf687ae0e in ?? () from [...]/firefox/libxul.so
Backtrace stopped: previous frame inner to this frame (corrupt stack?)

The problem seems to came from PR_WaitCondVar() function...

But I have no idea of what it is waiting for... Don't hesitate to tell me if you want I test something, I give you log etc... Tell me what to do and I will.

Good luck team! You do a great work! :)
