Can't do Popup whitelisting from window opened without status bar
In Phoenix 0.4 you can't whitelist a site for popups from a (requested) popup
window, because the window doesn't have a status bar, so you can't see the "i"
icon. Perhaps you could make the status bar visible if a (requested) popup tried
to create another ("unrequested") popup.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Enable popup blocking
2) Go to www.dabs.com
3) Click one of the "More Info" link (doesn't matter which) to open the
"Product Information" popup window for a product.
4) Click the "Reviews" 'tab' in that window.
5) Click the link "Read a customer review of this product"
6) This brings up a (requested) popup ("You are leaving dabs.com!") which itself
try to open a new window which contains the actual review. The code is:

<script language="javascript">
<!--

window.open('http://www.dabs.com/referer.asp?http://www.consumer-reviews.co.uk/dabs/read.asp?code=16YG','newwindow');
window.focus();
//-->
</script>

Phoenix display the message about popup blocking and tell the user about the
"i" icon, but the "i" icon is not visible because the popup window doesn't have
a statusbar.

I can get round this easily enough by adding www.dabs.com to the whitelist in
the preferences, but it would be nice to have the icon for newbie ;-)

PS. Keep up the good work, the whitelist is a great addition. I've only had it
10mins and already I miss it when it's not there! :-)
