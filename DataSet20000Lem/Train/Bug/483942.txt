It take a lot of time to open multiple tab webpage when you start firefox, I don't understand why they can't fix this problem because for me it is the #1 bug I see with this browser, I hate to open firefox with multiple tab set a my home page and wait a lot of time for every webpage to open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set a lot of different home page on the main options, for example: http://www.yahoo.com|http://www.news.com|http://www.cnn.com|http://www.msnbc.com|http://www.autoblog.com|http://www.pcworld.com|http://www.microsoft.com|http://www.apple.com|http://www.digg.com|http://www.reddit.com|http://www.youtube.com
2. Open Firefox
3. Go to any tab and try to click on a link, you will not get any response until you waited a lot of time.
Actual Results:
I can't access immediately any webpage until every tab is loaded, something cause tab to stop loading the webpage and this problem is not releated to a web page not working because I always have this problem even if all the web page are working without any problems.

Expected Results:
Load all tab webpage immediately without any wait, on version 2 this problem doe not appear. I can set a lot of tab a my homepage and I don't have to wait any time for viewing any page or pressing a link and view that webpage.

This problem appear with the default theme and also if I disable any option like warn me when site try to install add-on or the tell me if the site i'm visiting is a suspected attack or forgery option.
