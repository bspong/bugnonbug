Creating a new Bookmark folder under Organize Bookmark option. I name the new bookmark folder 'Ruby'. Click OK... everything is look good. Close Library. When I go to add the website to the bookmark folder the folder name is not 'Ruby' but rather 'New Folder'. I go back to the bookmark Library and the name of the folder is 'Ruby'.

So, the created bookmark folder take on the name 'Ruby' in the Library but in the actual folder outside the library (for easy to add bookmarks) the name is not consistent i.e. New Folder.

Somewhere along the way an Update is missing or something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Bookmarks Option.
2.Click Organize Bookmarks
3.Click Bookmarks Toolbar, right click and select New Folder.
4.Name folder 'Ruby'. Exit.
5.Go to Bookmark Toolbar and search for 'Ruby'.
6.No 'Ruby' folder found but there is a 'New Folder' name.
Actual Results:
The new folder created doe not take the name given by the user. The name the new folder take is 'New Folder'.

Expected Results:
The user should expect the name of the created folder to be what they specified. In this case I specified 'Ruby' but the newly created folder doe not take the name outside the Organize Bookmarks window.
