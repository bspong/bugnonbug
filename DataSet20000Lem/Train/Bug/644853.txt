Should be able to restore previous session. Does not do it on it own. Tried about:sessionrestore & session list is displayed, but will not restore. Have Session Manager add-on & it will not restore sessions, either. I re-booted the operating system & no change. Can't find any way to recover lost session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start FireFox
2.Try to use about:sessionrestore
3.
Actual Results:
No action performed by FireFox.

Expected Results:
Session should be restored.

Prior to update to FireFox 3.6.16, FireFox would display a session restore tab & when the session wa selected & the button to restore the session wa selected, the session would be restored. [ I wa also able to restore session with the Session Manager add-on]

Not sure what else is broken. Have not gotten past attempting to recover lost session.

Also, the TooManyTabs add-on is no longer operating properly. When you send tab to TooManyTabs, they don't show up.
