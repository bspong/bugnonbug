Firefox 1.0.7 with content negotiation doe not go from / to /contact or from
/contact to / where / initiate file index.php and /contact initiate file
/contact.php (directory must be root and web address with no prefix i.g.
www.site.com or bugs.site.com. site must be site.com) on http://nexuslite.org/ I
put a menu link on the side for bug reproduction. also
