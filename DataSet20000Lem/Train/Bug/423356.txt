Forgive me if this issue ha already been reported or solved, but I could not find the exact problem in other tickets.

I have noticed that the navigation history is not working properly for website using Ajax tech, such a Google's Gmail. For example, when we navigate on search or opening emails, you can go back by pressing the back button (or ESC in keyboard), but this action in Firefox 3 beta for doe not work. Instead, the following happens (read Steps to reproduce).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Open Firefox, homepage: www.google.com
2) Click Gmail
3) search "l:unread" in Gmail
4) open an email
5) press Back button -> nothing happens
6) press Back button again -> return to www.google.com

Actual Results:
As written in "Steps to Reproduce", it return to the first page, showing that no action of my navigation ha been properly saved.

Expected Results:
Firefox 2 work fine. Every action inside Gmail is saved in navigation history, so that we can go back and forward on page already visited.
