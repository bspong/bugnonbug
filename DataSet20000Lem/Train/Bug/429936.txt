This ha happened to me many times, but not all the time. Often after viewing about 2 or 3 embedded YouTube video on the same Web page, my system freezes: the mouse doesn't work, ctl-alt-del doesn't work. I have to press the power button, and the system go through checking all the file (interminable). Maybe it is a memory leak or something?

BTW the URL might be members-only.

My Mozilla (Firefox browser) is totally uptodate! I remember the most recent automatic update happened the day before yesterday or something.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View a Web page with several embedded YouTube videos.
2. Play 2 or 3 of the videos.
3.
I am careful to let each video finish.
Actual Results:
System froze, and the mouse stopped working, and ctl-alt-del stopped working, too. In other words, the system didn't allow any input.

Expected Results:
The system should not freeze. It should let me continue browsing.

Nothing special. I had probably no other application open except this one Firefox browser window.
