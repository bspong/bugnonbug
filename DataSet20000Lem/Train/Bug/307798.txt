1.5b1 look for -bin file based on symlink name, not symlink target's name.

Symlink exists a follows:
/pkgs/mozilla/bin/firefox-1.5b1 -> ../firefox-1.5b1/firefox

$ /pkgs/mozilla/bin/firefox-1.5b1
run-mozilla.sh: Cannot execute /pkgs/mozilla/firefox-1.5b1/firefox-1.5b1-bin

The intended -bin file is /pkgs/mozilla/firefox-1.5b1/firefox-bin, without the
-1.5b1- present in the filename itself (as opposed to the path). Released
version of both Firefox and Mozilla do not have this issue -- making a symlink
named by the version of the browser being invoked work correctly, without
requiring one to also modify the browser directory to have a new -bin file.

The following patch (which is certainly not portable enough for inclusion)
solves the problem for me:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a symlink to the "firefox" launcher script with a name other than
"firefox"; say, "firefox-beta".
2. Attempt to invoke Firefox via the symlink.


Actual Results:
Launch script try and fails to find an application binary with it name based
on the symlink itself, rather than the symlink's target

Expected Results:
Launch script should have looked for a -bin file based on the target of the
symlink, rather than the name of the symlink itself.
