The "Recent Tags" Smart bookmark "place:folder=4&group=3&sort=12&applyOptionsToContainers=1&maxResults=10&queryType=1" no longer return URLs in the form of a tag folder, nor doe the (Manually created) tag sorting folder "place:folder=4&group=3&sort=1&applyOptionsToContainers=1&maxResults=100&queryType=1"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Simply click on the smart Bookmarks folder on the bookmark toolbar and highlight Recent Tags;
Actual Results:
This now return a single website for each results, with no obvious information showing any correspondence between the tag folder originally returned, and the single website returned now.

Expected Results:
in Beta Three, this returned (and the manually created folder) folder for each of the tag that contained link to the website that met the criteria.

This may be an intentional/expected change, but I'm not seeing it documented a such - the new returned value are much le useful than the tag folder format IMO.
