Unquoted path to Firefox executable written to HKCR\FirefoxHTML\shell.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040704 Firefox/0.9.0+

When Firefox writes the default value to the registry key
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML\shell\open\command], it doe so without quotes.
On some system it us a short path, but when there is no short path the full
path will be used unquoted, even though space can appear. This means, for the
default installation path, that something called C:\Program.exe or C:\Program
Files\Mozilla.bat, etc., would be executed before C:\Program Files\Mozilla
Firefox\firefox.exe. This ha minor security implication (hence the restriction
on regular user writing to these location under modern version of Windows).

Regardless of the security implications, there are bug here. I'm bothered that
the short path is written to the registry by default. It also pop up in error
message (like those due to the annoying default-registration bugs). The
registration a default browser doesn't seem to report errors, by the way, even
when ran without admin permission (where it didn't work properly). Probably,
the whole of the registration code should be reviewed by a professional Windows
developer.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on a a user that's a member of 'Administrators' or 'Power Users' or ha
appropriate permissions.
2. Delete the HKCR\FirefoxHTML registry key, if it exists (make a backup, yadda
yadda - other apps get here, so maybe restore it later).
3. Set IE a default browser to subvert the Fx check, then set Fx a the default
browser.
Actual Results:
Unquoted filename are written to the value under the key mentioned above, such
a the icon path and the shell\open\command key (and print, etc?).

Expected Results:
Nothing left to chance.

As mentioned before, the short file name seems to be written to the registry on
some systems. I haven't investigated this (it could be caused by something the
installer does, or something the OS does, etc.), but that doesn't seem right.

Short filename can be disabled under XP by running:
fsutil behavior set disable8dot3 1
or by setting the appropriate reg key (see the KB). The regkey exists on Win2k
at least. Read about this before changing anything.
