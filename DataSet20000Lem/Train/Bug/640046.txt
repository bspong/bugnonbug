With "Hard Blockers Counter", closing one single-tab window trigger a "Confirm Close" dialog in another window
STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
0. Do some *magic* with your profile to make it susceptible to this bug. (Not yet sure what magic is required -- all I know is I can't reproduce in a fresh profile.)

1. Start Firefox, which brings up "Window A". Open multiple tabs.
2. File | New Window, to generate "Window B".
3. Close "Window B" (a single-tab window) by clicking the 'close' button on it titlebar.

ACTUAL RESULTS: Window B close (good), but then a dialog appears over Window A, saying:
> Confirm close
> =============
> You are about to close 6 tabs. Are you sure you want to continue?
> [x] Warn me when I attempt to close multiple tab
> [Cancel] [Close tabs]

EXPECTED RESULTS: No dialog should appear.


As noted in Step 0, I don't know what make a profile susceptible to this, but I can't repro in a fresh profile. khuey hit this a well, on his Windows nightly, so it's not platform-specific.

I hit this for the first time about 7-10 day ago, I think, so I believe it's a relatively recent regression.
