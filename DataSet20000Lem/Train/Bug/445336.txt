Hotmail, msn webmail, "the classic version of Qwest Mail"- which is just the classic version of hotmail/msn webmail.
Once in the inbox or another folder, the folder to the upper left, Inbox, Sent, whatever custom ones, will not open in tabbed browsing. Right click and the choice are, "Bookmark this link. Copy this link. Properties". This worked prior to FF 2.0.0.15. Tabbed browsing *does* work with IE 7 on these folders. May be an MSN FU to FF, I can't really tell. The status window state javascript; There is nothing in the error console when changing folder or trying to tab browse. I have disabled NoScript. No change in behavior. Sun Java Standard Ed. 6 Version 6 update 5 build 1.6.0_05-b13

Hotmail already force one to type in their password twice when logging in a the first attempt *always* fails. This I'm convinced is a MS FU to FF.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to hotmail using firefox
2.click on the inbox to display message
3.right click on a folder and look at the choice
Actual Results:
No choice to tab browse. All but the above mentioned three menu choice are gone from a right click on a folder in hotmail.

Expected Results:
Should have the usual number of choice when right clicking on a link.
