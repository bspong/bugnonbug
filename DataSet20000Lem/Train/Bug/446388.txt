I have noticed the following multiple time in Firefox 2 and Firefox 3 when developing JavaScript application on Linux (64-bit Ubuntu 8.04):

Timers in JavaScript behave erratically on Linux. Sometimes the timer fire at a completely wrong time; much too early or much too late.

For example, I'm trying to develop a slideshow application. After displaying an image, I set a timer with setTimeout(...), to display the next slide after a certain time. Sometimes the timer fire a few time very quickly, and sometimes it take twice a long a the timeout value that I passed to setTimeout(...).

It's also noticeable when using JavaScript library that provide animation support, for example MooTools or YUI: animation are sometimes not smooth; they suddenly jump.

On Windows XP and Vista with either FF2 or FF3 it work without any problems; I've only noticed this on Ubuntu.

Maybe this ha to do with bug #291386 ?

It's very annoying, JavaScript timer are nearly unusable in Firefox on Linux.

Reproducible: Always
