I have a folder in my bookmarks. It this folder is a bookmark which doesn't have it own icon. This bookmark is the second bookmark on the list of bookmark in this folder. When I use the bookmark menu and enter the folder pointing the folder menu first and then I move my cursor onto this bookmark, BUT NOT POINTING THE FIRST BOOKMARK ON THE LIST FIRST, only the default icon is highlighted, but not the full name.

I'm using Aquatint Black Gloss theme, which ha it own bitmap for highlighting bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create folder in your bookmarks.
2. Create two bookmark in this folder. The 2nd one cannot have it own icon.
3. Go to this folder in your bookmark menu
4. Point the second bookmark in the menu being careful not to point the first bookmark.
Actual Results:
Only the icon of the bookmark is highlighted

Expected Results:
Both the icon and the name should be highlighted.

Theme: Aquatint Black Gloss
