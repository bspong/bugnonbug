my usage of firefox is open many tab (maybe 50+), just because the network maybe not good for sometimes, I need to open many tab for many reading in advance, but in fact till I shutdown the computer, some tab may have been read while some not, and some I need to keep it to read the next time, I don't want to save so many item in bookmarks, so I just use the sessionrestore: I just quit firefox and restore them on the next time,

from firefox 3.0 to 3.5, the sessionrestore ha gotten much usability improvement already, indeed,

but there is still a feature to improve usability,

which is to make sessionrestore item can be open seperately,

then in so many item in sessionrestore, I don't need to decide which item should be open, which should be closed, immediately after launching firefox,

even I can keep the sessionrestore tab a a temporary bookmarks,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open 50+ different tab of different URLs;
2. quit firefox;
3. start firefox again;

Actual Results:
4. then you will see sessionrestore tab, you must decide which to resume, which not at this time, otherwise you can not see the to be restored URLs,

Expected Results:
5. It should make every item in sessionrestore can be opened seperately;
