Currently, Firefox 2.0 ha nearly-full-featured session saving functionality, including the
ability to save and name/rename/edit sessions, and restore the previous
session on startup. However, it is missing three things:

1. "Open All in Tabs" is misleading, particularly the "in Tabs" part.
It doe not suggest or imply the current behavior. Removing "in Tabs"
would actually be more suggestive of the current behavior, making it
appear similar to "File > Open" in most programs. It should be changed,
perhaps to "Open this Folder" or "Open these Tabs".

2. The "Bookmark All Tabs" menuitem should be renamed to "Save this
Session". This would make it much more clear that
Session saving can be done through bookmarks.

3. The ability to set Firefox to open a particular Bookmark folder on
startup. Trying to delete this folder should warn the user that this
will delete their next session. If they delete anyway, set the startup
option to load the window and tab from last time. Deleting individual
bookmark in the folder should not warn, however.

With these two fixed, Firefox would be a full-featured session saving
browser.

Reproducible: Always
