When attempting to use the Live Search facility on the MSDN website, instead of entering the search box to search, it highlighted the background text. The search did not work.

I attempted to enter a new URL in that tab location bar, adn that malfunctioned (no cursor). I tried to enter the URL into a new tab, same issue. This affected all open tabs.

A restart of the browser fixed the issue, but using the Live Search break it again.

It's OK if I do not try to use the Live Search feature.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit msdn.microsoft.com
2. Click in the Live Search bar at the top
Actual Results:
Instead of clearing the box and displaying a cursor, it highlight the background text of the search box. No text can be entered. Once this occurs, you can't enter text into either the search bar or the location bar of any tabs, new or existing.

Expected Results:
The search box should clear and display a cursor.

Using default theme. Win XP Pro SP3.
