Steps to reproduce:

I created a very simple html page with some text, and an IFRAME whose src wa set to "http://wiki.com" (any other site that allowes to be framed would work, anyway)

code:

<!doctype HTML>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body{
background-color: #ccc;
}

.iframe{
width:900px;
height: 800px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>TEST</h1>
<small>smallText</small>
<iframe src="http://wiki.com/" frameborder="0" class="iframe"></iframe>
</body>
</html>

This wa saved to an .html file (test.html).

The page wa then:
1) opened directly from file system using file:\\ protocol
2) uploaded to web server and opened using http:\\ protocol

Note that the IFRAME src is always loaded via http.


Actual results:

Two problem were apparent:
1) the whole content of the page loaded via http ha a smaller size than the one loaded via file protocol (fonts look smaller and the iframe size is smaller too).

2) when the page containing the iframe is loaded via http, the whole content of the iframe (an external website) is scaled (smaller), too. This doe not happen if the page is loaded via file protocol.

This mean that any Iframe in a web page (loaded via http) scale the content to a smaller size than the original.

See attached picture.

Performing the test in Chrome (45.0.2454.99 m) show the page and iframe content always at the same size.


Expected results:

1) the page should have looked the same in the browser

2) the IFRAME content (external website) should always have the same dimension no matter if within the iframe or in an own page.
