When I try to view embedded youtube video in any websites, it buffer extremely slow -so slow that the video stop about every 10 second or so. When it get halfway to 3/4 of the way through the video, the red progress bar on the video start zipping back and forth without stopping, the video stop playing, and FF freeze for a few seconds. Note that the problem doe not occur in IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any website that contains an embedded youtube video
2. press the play button on the embedded video

Actual Results:
slow buffering, video stop and starts, red progress bar move quickly back and forth about 1/2 to 3/4 way through the video, video stops, FF freeze for a short period of time

Expected Results:
the video should buffer at a normal rate of speed, the video should play all the way through without stopping and starting all the time, the video progress bar should continue at a normal pace through the end of the video, and FF should not freeze.
