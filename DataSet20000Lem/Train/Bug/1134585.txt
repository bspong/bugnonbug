[e10s] "View Selection/MathML Source" in remote browser cause unsafe CPOW usage warning
+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #1133577 +++

STR:

1) Visit a site in an e10s window, optionally one with MathML
2) Select some page text/find some MathML
2) Right-click on the page/MathML, and choose "View Selection/MathML Source"

This cause lot "unsafe CPOW usage" warning in the Browser Console.

In browser/base/content/nsContextMenu.js:

// View Partial Source
viewPartialSource: function(aContext) {
var focusedWindow = document.commandDispatcher.focusedWindow;
if (focusedWindow == window)
focusedWindow = gBrowser.selectedBrowser.contentWindowAsCPOW;

var docCharset = null;
if (focusedWindow)
docCharset = "charset=" + focusedWindow.document.characterSet; <-- Causes CPOW warning

// "View Selection Source" and others such a "View MathML Source"
// are mutually exclusive, with the precedence given to the selection
// when there is one
var reference = null;
if (aContext == "selection")
reference = focusedWindow.getSelection(); <-- Causes CPOW warning [selection]
else if (aContext == "mathml")
reference = this.target;
else
throw "not reached";

// unused (and play nice for fragment generated via XSLT too)
var docUrl = null;
window.openDialog("chrome://global/content/viewPartialSource.xul",
"_blank", "scrollbars,resizable,chrome,dialog=no",
docUrl, docCharset, reference, aContext);
},

in toolkit/components/viewsource/content/viewPartialSource.js

[far more than I care to list right now, at least 31 distinct source lines, just selecting <a>text</a>, and even more console message due to loops. It get distinctly worse the more complicated the source of the selection/with MathML]
