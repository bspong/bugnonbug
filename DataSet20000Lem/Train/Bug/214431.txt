In the Privacy preferences, I would like to be able to select the following:

- silently accept cooky for the current session only
- ask before accepting for all other cooky

This give me a better balance between automatically accepting all cooky
(which allows long-term tracking by arbitrary web sites) and being prompted to
accept every single cookie (making web browsing cumbersome).

I suggest a preference GUI such a the following. This would still allow all
the behaviour which are currently available, a well a supporting the
behaviour I am looking for:

[x] Enable Cookies

For cooky that last only until the end of the session
[x] Accept only from the originating web site
[x] Ask permission before accepting

For cooky that are saved between session
[x] Accept only from the originating web site
[x] Ask permission before accepting
