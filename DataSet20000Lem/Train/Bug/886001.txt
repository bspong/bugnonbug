Steps to reproduce:

most of the site that I visit , load weirdly , for example, multiple image are loaded or the content is wrapped and if it contains social networking icon , it get messed and displayed multiple times, I formated my system, did re-install even, the page get loaded properly in Chrome , and IE , but problem with FF, this happened after the upgrade only.
Example : http://www.templatemonster.com/
Upgrading from older firefox... I observed that the problem wa corrected when the pop wa enabled .

I will attach the screen shots...

In older version , thought the pop up is disabled the page used to get displayed properly .



Actual results:

Explained in step to reproduce.

When pop up is blocked major site content is not being displayed properly .
The older version are fine.


Expected results:

Though pop up is disabled, how should it impact the loading of page, and why should it mess with the content, there were many site , where the button are being displayed in other part ...
