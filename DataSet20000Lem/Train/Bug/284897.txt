failure to correctly load/render graphic navigation button on Amazon site
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050302 Firefox/1.0.1 Fedora/1.0.1-1.3.2

The nativations button containing text on the Amazon site check out page do
not appear. The work around is to blindly move about with the mouse pointer
until it change to show that it is on a link. However, that is troublesome and
in some case I have not been able to find the links, a fact which may indicate
that this workaround doe not always work(around). This only happens on the
secure page at the time of checking out. For security reason I altered the
link in the URL field above.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. put a book in the shopping basket (a good one)
2. go to check out and pas through the secure portal
3. try to place the order and check out in the usual way that one doe these
thing on Amazon... you know, clicking button and such like.

Actual Results:
I do not see the graphic button links, and also do not see the text which
normally appears in them. I cannot complete the transaction which, sadly I must
say, is contributing to reduced turn over for Amazon.

Expected Results:
The graphic link (containing text which seems to be ascii generated) are not
visible.

Konquorer on the same platform (RH Fedora 3/KDE) doe not have this problem.
