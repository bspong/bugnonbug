If you design binding and name them with the .xbl extension, they will not load
if .xbl file are associated to an editor in Folders Options.
Nothing show up where the binding should be, and nothing appears in the DOM.

Please note that if you name them with the .xml extension, it will work even if
.xml file are associated to an editor.

This behavior ha been checked on version XP and NT of Windows, and on FireFox
release 0.8, 0.9.3, 1PR and 1.0


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Design a xul file that refers to a .xbl binding
2. Associate the .xbl extension to your favorite editor (xmlspy, vim, whatever...)
3. Load the xul file on Fire Fox : the binding content doe not appear.


Actual Results:
The binding content doe not appear in the browser, nor doe it in the DOM
explorator.

Expected Results:
The binding content should appear.

If you remove the window association with .xbl files, it work again.
If you leave it but rename your binding file .xml (and it reference too, of
course), it work too.
