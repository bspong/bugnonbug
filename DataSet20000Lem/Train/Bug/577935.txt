on Pogo.com game wont load, had error saying the browser is out of Memory. They explained how to clear cache on Fox then disable add-on ( disabled about of 90% of the add-on I have on here ) then they gave some instruction on how to change the Java and change the memory on Windows computer which i cant do because iMac doesnt have these settings. Also wanted to let you know that I have iMac 10.6.4 and I am using Java SE 6 - 32 and 64 bit. Since contacting Pogo I no longer get this warning, what happens now is when i click on a game and it take you to a listing of game room and then you choose a room and a new window open and the game never starts.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. choose game to play
2. window will open with the name of game room
3. click on a room & window will open and game will never start
Actual Results:
window open and say the name of the game you are playing but game never start

Expected Results:
it should say the name of the game and then on the right hand side of the window it tell you who the player are in the room and also ha a chat box below that. On the rest of the box it will show the game and then you start playing it.

when window open after you enter game room it says, the name of the game ex. Boggle Bash and on that window on the right side a box appears that tell you what player are in that room and there is a chat box underneath this and on the left side of this the game come on and you start playing it by clicking on the letter in the box to make word
