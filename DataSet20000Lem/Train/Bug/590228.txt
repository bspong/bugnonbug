Firefox 4.0b4 temperately non-responsive/hangs during page load
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b3) Gecko/20100805 Firefox/4.0b3

When I open a page in a new tab

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear the cache. (optional but make the issue more apparent)
2. Pre-load a handful of tabs. At least one.
3. Open a new tab that contains to a page with a link to another page with a large DOM count and poor YSlow score. Example: Google search page for "fail blog"
4. Open the link in a new tab
5. Try changing tab or scrolling on any pre-loaded tabs, and/or try accessing the menu
Actual Results:
Firefox will temperately be non-responsive during some stage loading and rendering process. Firefox is responsive during some stage of the page load.

Expected behavior is restored after the new page is fully loaded.

Expected Results:
The user experience should not be effected on the current page on other pre-loaded tab while a new tab is being loaded.

Issue is NOT seen, at least not noticeable, running Firefox 3.6.8

Issue doe exist (less noticeable) on site with smaller DOM counts. I mostly tried to recreate with various news sites.

Having an ad blocker (specificity Adblock Plus 1.2.2) doe not make a significance difference. Often seems to be shorter non-responsive time with ad blocker enabled.

All Extensions Used for testing:
Adblock Plus 1.2.2, both FF3.6.8 and FF4.0b3 (tested both enabled and disabled)
Xmarks 3.8.7, both FF3.6.8 and FF4.0b3
Add-On Compatibility Report 0.6, FF4.0b3 only
Feedback 1.0.1, FF4.0b3 only
