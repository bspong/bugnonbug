click and hold contextual menu ha extra triangle at top, even when it's already
at the top. The top item is no longer hilited by default. Selecting the top
item (open link in new window) doesn't work. Others that I've tried (save link
as) also don't work.

This is new, a it all worked just a few week ago!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.using a link in any window, click and hold.
2.the contextual menu come up.
3.there is an extra triangle at the top, tho' the menu is currently at the top.
(change from previous behaviour)
4.the first item is not highlighted.
(change from previous behaviour)
5.dragging and hiliting the top menu item (open link in new window) and
releasing doe not cause any action.



Expected Results:
expect link to open in new window.

This bug appeared recently, and wa not fixed in the past several days. I've
downloaded a new nightly every day recently hoping this would be fixed!

I've checked the bug list, and didn't see any new bug report, but the list
wasn't sorted by date, so it's hard to be sure. There are a lot of outstanding
contextual menu report going back years....

But I've used this feature every day in the past, and this problem is new.
