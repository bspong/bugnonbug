Moin Moin.
Since some Firefox 3 Update, maybe for about two months, it is impossible to drag and an url from the urlbar onto the explorer/desktop.
Despite of bug "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471955" bearing a similar title, this bug is different ans, opposing to "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=471955", where still some action is being taken, here a simple "forbidden" sign (a circle with a bar like "http://www.bias-inc.com/php/images/verboten.jpg") is being displayed by windows, indicating, that this object maight not be dropped there (in this case a folder, where IE is capable to drop it, and ff 3 used to be capable of, at least some month ago.). .
