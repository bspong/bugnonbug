Firefox and Minefield shred page formatting.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a4pre) Gecko/20070424 Minefield/3.0a4pre
Build Identifier: Starts with Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.3 and continues into Minefield 3.0a4pre

In many website I visit, page will lose all their formatting and default to Times New Roman. All tables, frames, etc, will disappear and only text will appear with the graphic in random places. I have to press CTRL+F5 to make it load right.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox/Minefield at one of the example page (www.wikipedia.org, www.gaiaonline.com, or www.deviantart.com. It happens to far more site though.)
2. Navigate the page for a while.
3. Soon the page will garble in the way displayed in example shots.
Actual Results:
Please see the attached images.

Note that these are not the only site it happens to; However, they are the most common cases.



Expected Results:
Displayed the page correctly.

I use Windows XP with Service Pack 2.

Here are screen shot of the page in question.

I have looked at the pages' source code and noticed a proliferation of the use of <div> tag in page that do not display correctly.

I chose not to use a Broken Web Site Report due to the fact that it happens on so many sites.

I have been having this problem since Firefox 1.5.0.7.
