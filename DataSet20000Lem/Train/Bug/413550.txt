Build Identifier: All Gecko browser back to Netscape 7.2

With all Gecko browser back to Netscape 7.2 including Mozilla Suite 1.7, current versio of SeaMonkey and Firefox up to 2.0.0.11, accessing http://www.santaluciaflyfishers.com/index2.htm for the First time with none of it's content in the local cache cause the browser to hang requiring a force quit. I have checked this on Windows98, 2000, XP and Mac OS X 10.2.8 and Ubuntu Linux 7.10 and Redhat 9 from the original site and also on my local network on both Apache and IIS server and the result is the same with screen size of 800x600 and 1024x768. If the image file in the center of the page is smaller (http://www.santaluciaflyfishers.com/index3.htm), the problem doesn't happen. It also doesn't occur on screen size above 1152x864.

Firefox 3B2 doe not seem to have this problem.

This wa going to be the home page on one of my sites. Obviously I couldn't use it because it locked up Firefox when you accessed it for the first time like most people would. On Windows, hanging the browser essentially lock up the computer until you 'force quit' the program. I consider this a somewhat important if obscure bug because the general scenario of using js/xmlHTTPrequest to load a page is fairly common and I have not found any way to actually predict when the page will fail to load except when the center image file is too large. I can't tell whether it's the size of the image or the size of the file that trigger the problem.
