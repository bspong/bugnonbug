Titlebar right-click system menu missing entry added by 3rd party software?

When Firefox 4.0 is run in a virtual desktop manager (Virtual Dimension or Dexpot are two examples), and one right-clicks on the title bar, the name of the virtual desktop manager is supposed to be in the menu that come up. This allows the user to select a different virtual desktop to move the instance of Firefox to. This ha worked correctly in all past release of Firefox that I've used with virtual desktop manager (for every release for about the last 5 years).

For Firefox 4.0, this doesn't work. When you right-click the title bar of Firefox 4.0, the current virtual desktop manager name doe not appear in the pop-up menu. This is broken.

I don't know what need to be done to Firefox 4.0 to make this work, but please take a look at this and fix it.

Thanks very much.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot Windows 7 system that ha virtual desktop manager in installed (Virtual Dimension or Dexpot are examples).
2. In a virtual desktop, bring up Firefox 4.0
3. With your mouse, right click on the Firefox 4.0 title bar, and you will not see the name of the virtual desktop manager in the right-click menu.
Actual Results:
Name of virtual desktop manager is not in the right-click menu when right-click is on title bar.

Expected Results:
The name of the virtual desktop manager should be in the right-click menu when mouse is right-clicked on the Firefox 4.0 title bar.

This is a major feature for me, it allows me to easily use Firefox 4.0 in my normal work flow. Without it, Firefox is still usable, but I have to use work-arounds for this breakage. So I've classified it a "Major" in Severity. I can see how you might downgrade this to "Normal", but for me it is "Major".
