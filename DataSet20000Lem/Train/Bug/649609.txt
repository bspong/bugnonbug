Frozen on a particular website with the FF4+FB1.7.0+GM0.9.1 combination
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

=== Test Case ===
Configuration:
* Windows 7 SP1
* Firefox 4.0
* Firebug 1.7.0
* GreaseMonkey 0.9.1
* JS can be enabled or not
* All others are unrelated

Replication Steps:
1) Have Firebug 1.7.0 enabled but not turned on (ie firebug icon stay gray)
2) GreaseMonkey 0.9.1 enabled and turned on (ie the greaseMonkey icon is with color)
3) (Regardless if JS is enabled or not) Go to the following website: http://www.softtennis.org.tw/maincontent.php
4) Frozen with full untilisation of CPU. Therefore no crash report

More explanation/information:
* If enabled with only Firebug or GreaseMonkey, the webpage at least loaded
* Always throw an error about "gradient" object regardless JS is enabled/disabled (before it get frozen)
* Same tried to load on Chrome 10 (with no plugins or addons), loaded
* Same tried to load on IE 9 (with no plugins or addons), loaded
* Chrome return with the following error
>> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] ha no method 'gradient'

* Attempted isolation test, that's why come up the Firebug and GreaseMonkey combination
* Same issue will be entered in GreaseMonkey and Firefox's bug tracker using the same title

Reproducible: Always
