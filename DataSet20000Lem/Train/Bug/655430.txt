Message text is wrong when changing update channel using channel switcher.

When you use the option to change update channel from Aurora to Beta, a soon a you click the "Apply and Update" button, the "About Aurora" screen tell you that "You are currently on the Beta update channel". This is before the update (or even the download of the update) ha completed.

As part of the update process the user is presented with an "Apply Update" button but the message below the button - "You are currently on the Beta update channel" - wrongly suggests that the change ha already been performed.

The same sort of thing occurs when changing from Beta to Aurora.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Aurora.
2. Click Help > About Aurora.
3. Click the "Change" link.
4. Choose the option to switch to the Beta update channel.
5. Click The "Apply and Update" button.


Actual Results:
The message below "Downloading update ..." read "You are currently on the Beta update channel".

Expected Results:
The message should not say you are on the channel you are changing to until the update ha actually taken place.
