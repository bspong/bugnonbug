Fix session restore test for compartment-per-global
This is one of the last two test failure blocking compartment-per-global. The test fails when run standalone with both trunk and c-p-g. However, the entire suite collectively pass on trunk (but not with c-p-g).

STR: TEST_PATH=browser/components/sessionstore/test/browser_705597.js make -C $OBJDIR mochitest-browser-chrome

about:home is throwing here, because localStorage['search-engine'] hasn't been set up, and JSON.parse doesn't expect that: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/abouthome/aboutHome.js#181

This seems to be set up in loadDefaultSearchEngine, which is only called by the defaultArgs getter:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/nsBrowserContentHandler.js#865

When Jared ran the whole subdirectory, the failure went away. So one of the previous test is probably triggering the necessary setup here.

Presumably the failure on trunk and the failure with c-p-g are linked: we're relying on some sort of lazy setup of localStorage['search-engine'] that isn't guaranteed to happen. But either way, this bug is about making thing worth with c-p-g.

Dolske, can you make sure this bug get traction?
