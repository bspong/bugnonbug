When the attached test case is loaded, say in tab 1, it us window.open() from a load even handler on the document body to open a second tab, say tab 2. The test case loaded in tab 1 also ha an onunload handler on the document body that invokes "window.close()" on tab 2 when tab 1 is unloaded. The intention is that closing tab 1 will also close tab 2. However, in the current trunk build closing tab 1 cause the entire browser to exit even if other tab are open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached test case - this will cause an additional tab to open.
2. Open another at least one other tab so you now have at least 3 tab open.
3. Close the tab with the test case loaded it it.
Actual Results:
The whole browser exit

Expected Results:
The tab with the test case in it should close along with the additional tab the test case opened - however any other tab should remain open.

Regression since 3.0.2.

This is nasty - it's most disconcerting to have the whole browser go away unexpectedly.
