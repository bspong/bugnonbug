Installing some extension break FB
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031003 Firebird/0.7

I have been working with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US;
rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031006 Firebird/0.7+ (aebrahim) and a brand new profile.

Link Toolbar cause FB to hang.

The following cause a crash after installation on next attempt to restart:

Smoothwheel (no choice of installation location)
SearchThis (no choice of installation location)
Text/Plain (profile installation option selected)
TTLO (profile installation option selected)

Interestingly, after the crash if I simply delete the FB installation directory
and reinstall FB I can proceed to install more extensions. More interesting is
that following deletion of the installation directory and reinstallation of FB,
Text/Plain and TTLO work fine(!).

The following extension work without causing a browser crash on next startup
(all installed to profile and not FB installation directory):

All-in-One Gestures
Autoform
Copy Image
Context Close Tab
GoTo
Linkit
Linky
Mozcalc
Mozilla FBRH
Paste and Go
Quicknote
Toolbar Enhancements

What I don't know is if these problem are due to a FB flaw or a regression in
the Moz 1.6 trunk, or if it is due to permanent change in FB or Moz.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension that by default installs itself in the application
directory.
2. Close browser.
3. Attempt to start browser

Actual Results:
Crash on invoking (e.g.--double-clicking on icon) application

Expected Results:
Open browser

Application crashed.

This is a problem with both 2003-10-06 and 2003-10-07. Aebrahim's explanation of
how he compiled the build sound like he wa making ordinary build in place of
the absent window build machine.
