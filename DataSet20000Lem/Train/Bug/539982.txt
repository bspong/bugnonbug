I've found that Firefox is a little inconsistent when it come to handling large number of onerror event attached to img tags.

In both http://dev.signpostmarv.name/pub/twitter-avatar-display/really-huge-grid.html and http://dev.signpostmarv.name/pub/twitter-avatar-display/really-huge-grid-data-uri.html , javascript is used to apply a background image when an image fails to load. The former us a src attribute of "http:" while the latter us "data:image/png,".

data URIs result in the expected behaviour, though I have suspicion that a really, really big list might still trigger the problem.

using complete url (e.g. "http://example.org/" instead of "http:" make no apparent difference.

enabling the cache make no apparent difference

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load or refresh http://dev.signpostmarv.name/pub/twitter-avatar-display/really-huge-grid.html
Actual Results:
Not all img tag that fail to load have a background applied e.g. error event doe not fire for all relevant img tags.

Expected Results:
All img tag that fail to load (regardless of HTTP status code or specified attribute relating to a valid image) have a background image applied.

Number of event fired seems dependant upon free resources/device performance, since there were fewer background image being applied when I wa running game etc.
