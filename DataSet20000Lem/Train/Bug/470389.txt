Ok sorry about this being hard to test since it on an internet banking website but this is what happens.

The bank us digital certificate previously downloaded to your machine to enable you to authorise payments. To properly use these cert you need java enabled. What happens when you want to make a payment is that java load within the page, then you browse to the cert on your hard drive, then you need to enter the password for the cert and click authorise. Problem is that the password box remains uneditable and blank. Clicking on it doe nothing thus the authorisation cannot continue. I tried multi-clicking, typing my password anyway, just messing about and then the box wa filled with password stars, far more than I typed. At no point did a text cursor appear. (Vertical bar.)

I know this is a firefox and not a java problem because I can do the exact same operation using firefox on a windoze machine without issue.

I realise testing this will be problematic unless any of you guy happen to be client of FNB a well. Otherwise I can install any update and test them out myself.

Oh dear, I have just tried it again and it all worked perfectly! A mini-bug then?

Thanks!
