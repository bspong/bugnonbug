When posting on mentioned forum [ vBulletin 3.6.8 ] I have no cursor. I can input text, but neither the arrow key nor the mouse can place a cursor. I also can't select text either with <Shift-Arrow> or with dragging the mouse.This mean I cannot edit text except with <Backspace>, which doe work.

On other forum I can edit text on 3bFF3, and with other browser I can edit text on said forum. 'Safe mode' and 'new profile' make no difference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto forum
2.Login
3.Post
Actual Results:
No cursor movement, no text selection; i.e. can't edit text (except with <Backspace>)
So it ha le functionality then 'edlin'

Expected Results:
Blinking cursor; mouse or <Arrow> move the cursor
Text selection; mouse or <Shift-Arrow> select text, Ctrl-x|c|v doe it's usual


Obviously there's no error message.
It only happens on this board with FF3b3 a far a I can tell. But I'm not member of any other vBulletin 3.6.8 fora, so i can't tell how they fare.
Workaround: OpenOffice.org, multiple desktops, copy&paste, short-keys :-p
