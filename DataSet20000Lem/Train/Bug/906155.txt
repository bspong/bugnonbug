Add Menu button to "Customize Toolbar" library

Steps to reproduce:

Request: Could you add menu button to "Customize Toolbar" library which would have same functionality a default Firefox button (top left corner). Clicking on it would display menu frame, like Bookmarks button does:

How Firefox button looks: http://fii.cz/watqbnzm
How Bookmarks button looks: http://fii.cz/vrwyq

As you can see, I have addon which make Firefox button movable, but it doesnt look native in the navigation panel. What Id like to see is same menu button a any other button in navigation panel (Bookmarks, Downloads, Home Page etc.) and being movable.

Ive seen your reaction to similar request that you dont want to change Firefox button because it something what differs browser from other ones. Just let the default button a it is and add another menu button to library so ppl who would prefer it being somewhere else can do it.

We will handle the rest of the job (removing default button) via addon. If you want to be perfect, you could add option to hide default Firefox button to option / or via about:config.
