All other “credit card web page statements” can be drag copied correctly (using Firefox) into a spreadsheets. Drag copy from the DiscoverCard page place data incorrectly in cell of spreadsheet. (Safari doe the same thing, Microsoft IE v5.2 Macintosh place the data in the correct spreadsheet cells).

Can this be fixed in Firefox? I’m ready to contribute to the cause. I love Firefox. Please help. I’ll send money.

Thank you,

Actual Results:
1.Data is not usable, incorrectly placed in spreadsheet cell

Expected Results:

As you can see there is no "crash" just make Foxfire unusable for gathering web data at certin site like "Discover Card."
