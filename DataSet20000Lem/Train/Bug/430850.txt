After latest upgrade

The retracing back or forward drop down history list are not there at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Browser
2. Visit more than one page, like Google.com : Yahoo.com : Weather.com
3. Click the arrow on the Back Button and no longer get the drop down retracing step menu. Can not skip straight backwards from Weather.com to Google.com
4. Have to go back one page at a time, instead.

Actual Results:
A small square box appears in lower left corner of both Back and Forward button and do nothing but flash the button a if highlighted. The small square box doe not show the retracing step menu. Have to go back/forward one page at time instead of being able to quickly go back more than one page at a time.

Expected Results:
To be able to have access to the menu like I used to with previous versions.
