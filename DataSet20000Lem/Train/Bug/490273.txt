After saving a zip file, save a dialog treat zip file a directory to save next file

I found the regression range:
3-11 - work
3-12 - broken

This is obviously due to: Bug 464795 - Persist "save as" directory during private browsing, but restore previous value after

Save a zip from http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/, then wait for the download to complete, find a image file (type of file may matter eg. exe, html, avi, wmv, etc), right-click > Save Image As, see that Save As dialog is inside zip archive and attempting to save image in this archive. I never went all the way thru and saw if the image actually saved there.

I assume any archive will do, not sure if it's limited to just zip. Someone else should try jar, 7zip, rar and so on. Also I've only been trying to save image afterward, so I'm not sure if the file type matter but it may.

My setup ha the permanent private browsing pref turned on. But this should also happen when switching on & off PB when starting with this pref off.


Reproducible: Always
