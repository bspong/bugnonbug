If the server serf a SSL certificate where the common name != host name Firefox just show a blank page.
I think we should give the user at least a message that the Page won't load because of the broken certificate. Maybe there is also a way to bypass this security setting to view the page despite the invalid certificate.
I had this problem with Firefox 1.5 Beta 2 while trying to access my domain control panel. Trying to download the page with wget got me the message

--[snip]--
ERROR: Certificate verification error for xxxx.evanzo-server.de: self signed certificate
ERROR: certificate common name `plesk' doesn't match requested host name `xxxxx.evanzo-server.de'.
To connect to xxxxx.evanzo-server.de insecurely, use `--no-check-certificate'.
Unable to establish SSL connection.
--[snap]--

Maybe there is a --no-check-certificate Option (via Dialog) for Firefox too?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page via HTTPS that sends Firefox 1.5 Beta 2 a certificate where the common name doe not match the requested host name.
Actual Results:
about:blank open

Expected Results:
At least an error message that tell the user that the certificate is broken.
Or, better, an option to view the page anyway.
