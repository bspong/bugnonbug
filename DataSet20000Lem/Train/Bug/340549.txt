Firefox freeze without warning and shuts down after a window warning.

Since installing free version of Avira anti-virus and (at the same time) Mozilla ad blocker (from Firefox menu, so an approved, not-too-strong version), Firefox ha become unpredicably unstable -- it worked almost flawlessly before that. Freeze announced by message with "!" in yellow triangle and text: "Program Error/ Firefox-exe ha generated error and will be closed by Windows. You will need to restart the program. /An error log is being created." (Sorry but I don't know how to find this log.) This happens often -- though not invariably -- and usually after 5-10 minute of opening the browser. Easy to reproduce. Wasn't affected by latest (.4) update. The freeze often triggered by sending of email, often with attachment, or by returning to Firefox from various other program in other windows. Any unsent or unsaved[as in, to Drafts]text is lost.
One other problem: for scrolling up or down a page, the mouse drag the bar without problem but switching to arrow down or page down sends me right to the end of the page -- a hassle at /.! Clicking on the text before moving from mouse to keyboard doe not help.
Apart from these trouble Firefox is great!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use browser for 5-10 minute
2.(sometimes:) sending email
3.(moving back to Firefox from other open windows, sometimes with Firefox also running, sometimes other programs)

Actual Results:
Warning from Windows a described in detail and if I fail to click "close" button Firefox will close itself in a minute or 30 seconds.

Expected Results:
not crashed

Wish I could help you by a deeper IT knowledge than I have.
