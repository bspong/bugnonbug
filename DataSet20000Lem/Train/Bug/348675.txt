I have the same version of Firefox on two different computer that I will call Computer 1 and Computer 2. On Computer 1 Firefox work like a champ. However, on Computer 2 two odd thing are occuring. First of all Google Toolbar doesn't appear even though it show up in "Extension" under "Tools". In fact, the only tool bar that are available are Navigation and Bookmarks. So there is no Edit Option that allows to check if Google Toolbar is being blocked. The other thing is that even though I have Windows Media Player 9 on both computers, when I try looking at a CNN video for example, on Computer 2 it say that Windows Media Player 9 is not installed.

I wa looking at both my computer and the only real difference I can see is in the OS. On Computer 1, where Firefox work just fine, the OS is Window XP, Professional, Version 2002, Service Pack 2. On Computer 2, where Firefox ha these two problems, the OS is Windows XP, Media Center Edition, Version 2002, Service Pack 2. Computer 1 is an HP Pavilion dv1000 and Computer 2 is HP Pavilion dv8000.

Both problem are are always repeatable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. First problem: Open Firefox and no Google Toolbar. Uninstall and reinstall, still no toolbar after closing and opening Firefox window.
2. Second problem: Clicking on a CNN video, for example, and error message stating that Windows Media Player 9 not installed
3.

Actual Results:
1. No Google Toolbar

2. Error message saying Windows Media Player 9 not installed

Expected Results:
1. Google Toolbar should be visible on Computer 2 a it doe on Computer 1.

2. Video should play on Computer 2 a it doe on Computer 1.
