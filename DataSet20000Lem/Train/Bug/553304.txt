When I close my browser (even force-close the process with Task Manager) while streaming video from YouTube (I don't know about the other streaming video websites), there will be an unknown process keep downloading something (and, no, it's not from my other processes; I've triple-checked it). The unknown process cannot be killed, and will always download something, even though I've logged off from Windows and logged in again. I must restart my computer to shut this process down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open YouTube, and play any video
2. Open any network traffic monitoring software (I use Network Traffic Monitor), and notice all the process which are downloading something
3. In the middle of streaming, close the browser
4. Take a look in the network traffic monitoring software, there's a new unknown process downloading something (no firefox.exe).
5. You'll have the process ID, but the process with the same process ID won't show up on your active process list (I use What's Running to see the active processes); so, you cannot kill the process.
Actual Results:
An unknown process "replaces" firefox.exe and keep downloading something.

Expected Results:
No unknown process. My Network traffic decreased.

Even with all plugins disabled, the problem still occurs.
I don't know whether the problem still occurred in fast Internet speed; try to lower your speed. I use (up to) 512 kbps internet bandwidth.
