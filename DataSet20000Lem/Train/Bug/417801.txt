This is not a Yahoo mail problem, for it doe not occur when using Internet Explorer. When composing a new message using a pasted text from another message, the draft display correctly, but after the message ha been sent, when read in the SENT mailbox or the cc. to sender, the patch will display only one word per line. The Yahoo mail version is the latest one (mimics Outlook format).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Yahoo Mail, compose a new message. From another message, copy and paste some text into the new one. Send the message, with a cc. to yourself.
2. Read the copy sent to you, or saved in the SENT mailbox.
Actual Results:
Any passage copied from another message and pasted into the new one will display a one word per line.

Expected Results:
Message should have read with normal line length.

There is a very awkward workaround: If the text to be pasted in is first copied and pasted into a WORD document, and then that document is copied and pasted into the new message, the result will be normal line-lengths.
