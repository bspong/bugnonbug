Default file type association is broken on Windows 8
Before Windows 8 RTM, we had file type association working a of bug 764515 which is on Beta right now. As of Windows 8 RTM, prompt that we do for file type default no longer set u a the default for those file types. So right now on Beta file type association like .html are completely broken. Windows 8 will already be shipped once we release Beta.

In Windows 8 pre RTM, protocol association wa protected by a cryptographic hash but not file type association. As of RTM both file type association and protocol association are protected by a cryptographic hash. The only way to set the default browser when there is a cryptographic hash is by asking the OS to prompt the user.

you can set protocol association which set the cyrptographic hash with a little flyout window that list all the browser and the user just selects one. This is what we were doing a of bug 764515, and we we're setting the file type association via helper.exe. I should mention that you can also produce a flyout for file type association, but only for one at a time, and it doesn't include protocol defaults.

What IE10 does, for default browser is it show that protocol association flyout on the startup check, but if you go to option and set the default that way, it launch control panel which can set both protocol + file type association at the same time. (Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set Default Programs)

I recommend that we do the same a IE10 here, and that we also uplift it to aurora + beta so that file type default are not broken in win8.
