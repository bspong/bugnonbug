5.after a day, I restarted the same browser.
6.I checked the WebIDE
7.go to the ""Select runtime"



Actual results:

It didnot show any result such a Firefox OS simulator in the simulator section.when the firefox developer edition browser is restarted, in the webIDE section the pre-installed Firefox OS simulator is gone. previously on the previous running time of browser the "install the simulaor" wa pressed and the firefox OS 20 simulator stable release ha been properly installed and run to test an app. but on the next attempt the firefox OS simulator is gone missing from the browser.


Expected results:

Ideally It should show the Firefox OS simulator in the "simulators" category after pressing the "select runtime"option in the WebIDE.
