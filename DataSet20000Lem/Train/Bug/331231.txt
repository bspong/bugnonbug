Canon iR PSv1.50 printer driver for Canon ImageRunner b&w photocopier
The Canon printer driver requires that job accounting info be entered when submitting a print job to the queue. This dialog appears after pressing the Print button in the Print dialog in all apps. However, in Firefox 1.5.0.1 you cannot enter anything in the dialog even though the text entry cursor is flashing in the correct field.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Canon printer driver and set up to print to Canon ImageRunner via LPR/LPD
2. Start Firefox and load any web page
3. Select Print from the file menu
4. Click the print button
5. Job Accounting dialog appears
6. You cannot enter a job account and thus must click Cancel to continue without submitting a print job to the queue.

Actual Results:
No printsky

Expected Results:
Printsky

We can enter job accounting data in all other apps tested including Thunderbird 1.5
