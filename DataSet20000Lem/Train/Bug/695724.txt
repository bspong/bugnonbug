Getting a Connection Reset Message

Steps to reproduce:

Trying to go from one game to another game while playing on POGO.com. This only started happening within the last 2 month or so and doe not happen all the time.


Actual results:

Keep getting this message when trying to play game on POGO or switching from one game to another and a box come up and it says:

The connection wa reset
The connection to the server wa reset while the page wa loading.
The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.
If you are unable to load any page, check your computer's network connection.
If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the web.

Try again


I will try again several time and I keep getting the same message. I have to shut down Firefox and start back over. I do not have the same problem with Internet Explorer. This problem did not start until I had been using Firefox for a couple of months.


Expected results:

I should have been able to load the next game and keep playing.
