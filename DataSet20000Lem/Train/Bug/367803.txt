I've had this problem with ubuntuforums.org before and have now taken the time to consistently reproduce it for allmusic.com. It's where I'll create a keyword search for the site, it'll work fine, I'll restart the browser, and then when I use the keyword in the location bar to do a search, I'll get sent to google.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to allmusic.com
2. Right click in the empty text box next to the "GO" button, and select "Add a Keyword for this search..."
3. In the dialog that pop up, enter "All Music" into the name field, and "music" in the name field.
4. In the Firefox location bar, type: "music Sonny Rollins" and you see the All Music page for jazz saxophonist Sonny Rollins pop up in your browser. The keyword search is working a expected here.
5. Close all open Firefox windows, make sure the Firefox process is killed in the XP task manager.
6. Launch Firefox
7. In the Firefox location bar, type "music Sonny Rollins" and you see the result of a Google search for the phrase "music Sonny Rollins" in your browser, instead of the result of an AllMusic search for the phrase "Sonny Rollins".
Actual Results:
A web page showing the result of a Google search for the phrase "music Sonny Rollins"

Expected Results:
A web page showing the result of an All Music search for the phrase "Sonny Rollins"

This problem is being reported under XP because that's the platform I happen to be on, but I've also seen something similar to this problem under the version of Firefox Ubuntu ha packaged up for their Edgy release.
