I'm experience a problem with a tool's UI in Windows version of Firefox and
Mozilla (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.3)
Gecko/20040910) and I can reliably get both these browser to crash. A Windows
dialog come up that say

Program Error
! <firefox.exe | mozilla.exe> ha generated error and will be closed by
Windows. You need to restart the program.
An error log is being created.
[OK]

Firefox SafeMode didn't help. I will attach the drwtsn32.log.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
I have a tool that ha a web interface.. and there's a SELECT input that doesn't
work: the DOM inspector show that it ha OPTIONs, there are no script error in
the Javascript console, but the browser doesn't supply a dropdown with I click
the SELECT. If I use the keyboard to change the value of the SELECT, once I
leave focust of the SELECT element the browser crashes.

Actual Results:
Browser crash. No feedback agent!

Expected Results:
The SELECT should have displayed it's OPTIONs, and changed a I indicated.
