=============================================================

Firefox us 50-100% cpu while idle, even when the only loaded page is about:memory. When closing, the window closes, but firefox.exe remains active and with the same cpu usage. After a couple minutes, firefox crash and the crash report window pop up. This is reproducible, and antivirus scan do not show any malware. This occurs in FF46.0.1, a well a 45.0.1 from before I updated to try to fix the problem. I have also fully updated flash, java, and silverlight.

These are two nearly identical crash report of this problem

And yes, I know I have add-ons. I also know you people like to ignore problem and use add-on a a scapegoat. You say "turn off your add-ons" and assume the problem is fixed. If you have no intention of helping, then don't bother responding, because I don't need your automated "I'm too lazy to decipher the crash log" response of blindly blaming add-ons. Just move on and let someone who will actually try to help respond to this.

And I will tell you right now, disabling add-on is not an option. You have made every effort to make firefox a ugly and hard to use a possible; hiding menu buttons, mutilating the UI, etc. As well a website making extremely intrusive a well a dangerous ad and popups. I. Will. Not. Use firefox without classic theme restorer and adblock plus. Because without them, your browser is garbage, and I will stop using firefox despite adamantly hating chrome. Either I use firefox with those add-ons, or I do not use firefox.
