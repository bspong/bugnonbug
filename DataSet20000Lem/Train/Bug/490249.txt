Use one feed icon instead of three

In feeds, the audiofeedicon, videofeedicon, and feedicon png's are all exactly the same. It doesn't make sen to put those extra images, their css, and build them when we could just declare feedicon for everything.

This patch combine feedBackground, .videoPodcastBackground, and .videoPodcastBackground with the same cs properties, take out the old stuff, remove the images, and deletes them from jar.mn.

The only reason I can see keeping separate image is if a bug appears when we try to use the same image for these different things. I really don't think that would happen, but it is possible. Or, if we decide to make different icon for video, audio, and feed, then we will need to keep separate style for each.

This patch is a WIP, if we decide to go ahead on this, I still need to take out the 16X16's and aero, and linux and mac style a well. This just cover XP to get the idea.

This benefit u by cleaning out some stuff from the feed css, and taking out these duplicate images, saving size and cleaning out this portion of the tree a bit, making it a bit easier to work with. Also, if we make a change to the feed icons, we just have to change one, instead of three.
