5) telephone

Actual Results:
Firefox collect and store two entry in auto-complete

Expected Results:
One entry would suffice


it varies from site to site, and is hard to duplicate with a fresh profile since
you usually need to re-visit a site.
Sometimes, it carry over login/password from another site (assuming you use
the same password).
It doesn't seem to matter which auto-complete entry you select to auto-fill
password (but if you have the same login with a different password, it go
with the most recently typed password--non-duplicates don't suffer from this).
It only seems to collect two of any field.
Sometimes, even though it auto-filled the password, it asks if you want to save
the password.
