The "QA companion Info Page", produced by clicking on Tools->Options in the " [Testing] Tab" area, take a very long time to load such simple info.

The first time this info is determined it can take over 20 second and repeat attempt to get the info still take 2 or 3 second (on a fast computer).

The "Platform", "Operating System", "Product", and "Branch" info are determined much too slowly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Namaroka and install "QA Companion".
2. Click on "Tools->Options" and click the "QA Companion" pane.
3. View the "[Testing]" Tab (default).
4. See the "Platform", "Operating System", "Product", and "Branch" area load very slowly (and ONE at a time, no multi-tasking?).

Actual Results:
Slow loading of trivial info.

Expected Results:
This information _could_ be determined and displayed almost instantly, one second waiting would be slow but half a minute is much too slow.

I can visit a Website like BrowserSpy and get some of this info about my Browser _faster_ than the "Browser's Info Page" can tell me information about my own computer.

Is something blocking these subroutine from determining this simple info in a reasonable amount of time (less than a 1/10 of a second).
