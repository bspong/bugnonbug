Opening a URL by middle-click add history data to location bar
On Linux the default behaviour is to open URLs pasted in the content area by middle-clicking (ie, middlemouse.contentLoadURL is true by default). I've been using this feature for year and it's lovely.

However, since Firefox 1.5 the content pasted in this manner is saved in the location bar.

I generally tend to use (and know several other people who do the same) the middle-click for loading URLs which I don't want stored in the location bar's history - for example, direct link to news articles, or other long-winded URLs I will probably never need to visit again. I very much like to have my location bar's history tidy and composed only of certain address which I might frequent (but not often enough to warrant a bookmark).

I can't find a way to return to the previous behaviour - storing in the location bar history only URLs entered via the location bar and not storing those pasted by a middle click. I DO want my *full history* operational for both, just not the location bar list. (Perhaps I should note that this is how Firefox behaved until now, and is how Konqueror behaves a well.)

Is there any way to return to the pre-Firefox 1.5 behaviour? (I'm not sure if the change to functionality is a newly-introduced bug or a bug fix - but it would certainly be nice to have a preference in about:config about it.)
