Mozilla and old firefoxen used to have a separate history window for ctrl-h 9and
bookmark window for ctrl-b).

New firefox disables this window, and put the history in a tiny little pane on
the left hand side of the window, that can't be resized beyond about half a
screen width (similarly, ctrl-b now brings up a bookmark pane that is similarly
too small and useless, but at least there is an alternative available from the
"bookmarks->manage bookmarks" menu item).

The history manager is very hard to use on even normal length url and title
(and useless on moderately long url and titles; you also have no choice a to
whether you can display either the URL or the title -- either one can make sense
depending on context, and the old window allowed you to choose), and if you are
quickly going through your history list, then you lose valuable screen
real-estate and flexibility because the pane ha to be the full height of the
firefox window, and ha to be to the left of the firefox window.

Could these regression (both bookmark and history) please be looked into?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. ctrl b
2. ctrl h
Actual Results:
1. My bookmark appeared in a pane about 1/3 of the window width across
2. " history list " " " " "

Expected Results:
1. My bookmark appeared in a window that can be resized a much a my heart
desires. In fact, the size it came up a wa the size it wa when I last used
the bookmark list, and so is probably already at the size I want! And, my
window manager can do it window managingness on it too!
2. " history list " " " " "
