In attempting to download a .doc file from a commercial site (I wa downloading a label template from the Avery site), once the download started, window kept opening, and temporary file (e.g. FA4E58ri.doc.part) were written to the downloads folder, in an endless loop that couldn't be stopped except to force quit Firefox. Subsequently, I successfully downloaded the file in Safari with no problems, which is why I'm suspecting there's a bug somehow in Firefox (or Firefox interacting with a bug in OS X 10.6.2? Some other combination?). I have no way of testing to see if the problem is with the website, but it did download fine with Safari.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to website (with same OS, and all other variable the same, of course)
2.Click on the download button for the Avery 5164 label
3.Watch your screen go crazy
Actual Results:
As explained above ... once the download started, window kept opening, and temporary file (e.g. FA4E58ri.doc.part) were written to the downloads folder, in an endless loop that couldn't be stopped except to force quit Firefox.

Expected Results:
The .doc should have downloaded to the downloads folder. Period.

The name of the download file (if this had any effect on triggering the behavior) is U-0091-01_P.doc. I don't know why they didn't name it, say, Avery_Template_5164.doc, but only they understand such mysteries.
