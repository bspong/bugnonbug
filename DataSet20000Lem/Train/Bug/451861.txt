Ok. I have uninstalled FireFox 3 time and reinstalled it 3 times. Why you may ask? Here is why:

The icon at the top with the address bar just simply don't work. The Home button is the only icon that is lit up and can be used. The Go Back, Go Forward, Refresh, and Stop button don't work! They are gray and can not be clicked. My bookmark disappear too! In the bookmark section, there is an icon which look like a mini business card to the left and an expandable arrow to the right. It really is hard to explain but it is real aggravating. Plus, another issue.

FOR EXAMPLE:
If I go to someone's MySpace profile, the address bar used to always say "profile.myspace...etc"
But now it only says, "www.myspace.com" It wont show the exact webpage you are on. It only show the base of the webpage you are visiting.


OVERALL: FireFox ha become non-functional in almost all of the address bar function and is being glitchy.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox
2. Simply use FireFox and you will instantly get angry because all the function don't work and your bookmark disappear too!
3.
Actual Results:
Stuff just doesn't simply work!

Expected Results:
When I want to press go back to the previous page, it should, GO BACK!
When I want to press go forward, it should, GO FORWARD!!!
***The button shouldn't turn gray and unclickable!***

I am using Mozilla FireFox's default theme.
