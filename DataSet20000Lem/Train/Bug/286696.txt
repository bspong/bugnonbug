Outlook 2003 fails to launch firefox when Group Policy Object ha been applied only.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

Hi,

I have a GPO that restricts application that user can run. Firefox is in the
ALLOWED list. When in Outlook 2003, a user click on a URL and the GPO is in
effect, then outlook display a dialog box with "This operation ha been
canceled due to restriction in effect on this computer. Please contact your
system administrator." The user can launch Firefox properly from the desktop.
When the GPO is removed, firefox launch corectly when the link is clicked on.

PC is running XP+SP1 + Jan05 patches. Firefox 1.0.1 is the default browser.
If i change the default browser back to IE then Outlook will launch IE ok.
There is a MS article (Q310049) but it doesnt help.

I found that rundll32 is laucched according to the registered file type for a
URL. I've added it in the allowed application in the GPO. The same result.

I've disabled dde and put firefox manually in the URL file type and again the
same result.

Any suggestions?

George
