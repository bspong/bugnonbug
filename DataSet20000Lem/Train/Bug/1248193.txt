Firefox appcrash when opening link from outside firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:44.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/44.0
Build ID: 20160205155049

Steps to reproduce:

Clicking, opening http(s):// link from Outlook, Microsoft Word or possibly anywhere outside Firefox.


Actual results:

Sometimes crashes.
Might be related to (I think buggy) behavior that started about same time a the crash (v.44) a every link I open, new process is created but in reality the link open in existing Firefox new tab not new window. When I close that tab, the process still remains. Every process is about 10MB and when opening a lot of link this might also start to be a problem. I can force kill those process without any effect on the newly opened tab or Firefox in general.

Still, crash appears to sometimes happen even after Firefox restart and first link opening.

This behavior - particular crash and also ghost processes, started after FF 44 update.
