Yahoo (finance) message board message (and message lists) intermittently (~20-30% of page reloads on about 10% of message pages) white-out the whole width of the document window, obscuring legitimate content, for a range of pixel Y position value of an image advertisement (from PointRoll.com). It's a if the ad block were stretched to an infinite width and painted entirely white, overwriting other content.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up a message or 'List a Individual Messages' list from a Yahoo message board.
2. Observe a horizontal swath of document window is all white (background) instead of showing the intended content.
3. Reload page a needed to see intermittent nature.
Actual Results:
On some page (somewhere around 10% of message pages), about 20-30% of page reloads, a full-width swath of the document window is all white instead of showing the correct content.

Expected Results:
The ad should occupy only it intended width and not obscure other content on the page.

This ha been duplicated with two setups.

Setup 1 is Firefox 1.5.0.9 compiled by me, using GTK1, with the patch for bug #20573, Flash plugin installed, FlashBlock extension installed.

Setup 2 is the mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.9-1mdv2007.0 package supplied by Mandriva with or for Mandriva Linux 2007 (using GTK2), brand-new fresh profile, no plugins or extensions.

I switched from Firefox 1.5.0.8 to 1.5.0.9 on January 12, which is about when I started seeing these symptoms. It is possible this might be a regression.

I'll try to attach an HTML file that show the problem fairly reliably.
