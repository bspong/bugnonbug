Pheonix overwrites bookmark file on quit - possibly overwriting external change
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20030117 Phoenix/0.5

Just after installing phoenix 0.5 I decided to symbolicly link to my mozilla
bookmark file so they could share the same bookmark file. I quit phoenix and
then my mozilla bookmark were overwriten with the bookmark that phoenix wa
currently using.

The bug is not specific to symbolic links... that wa just my first experience
with the bug.

This bug only occured to me in linux but I never tested it anywhere else and
expect that since bookmark shouldnt be platform specific the bug occurs on
other platform a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
While phoenix is running:
1. Backup bookmark file
2. Add 1 or 2 new bookmark
3. Remove bookmarks.html and replace with the backed up file
4. Quit phoenix
5. Start phoenix
6. Look at bookmark menu and see that the bookmark that were added to the
non-backup copy now exist in the backed up (now put back into place) copy

Actual Results:
New bookmark file wa overwritten with bookmark currently in use.

Expected Results:
Left the bookmark alone.

Maybe I am just anoyed that I lost ALL my bookmark but I think that the
bookmark file should be written to disk every time a change is made. This isnt
a huge cost because bookmark arent modified so often that it need to be cached
for later.

This would also ensure that any bookmark that were created and then if phoenix
crashed, would have been saved still.

However, if despite my thoughts, it wa implemented this way for some reason,
just mark this bug a resolved.
