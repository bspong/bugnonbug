Konqueror and Internet explorer have been doing this for a long a I can remember.

When the scroll bar on the side is gripped, and then moved, the page scrolls... when the cursor go significantly away from the scroll bar, the page should jump back to where the reader started.

This is a essential featuer for "cat proof computing" because a reader can easilly loose a couple of minute trying to find where ve wa .

(I'm specifically comparing a list of graphic cards, and am comparing the top one with a few selected one on a non-disclosed web site).


I looked in about:config for option to turn this feature on, and found none.
Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load long page
2.scroll with scroll bar to item far down in page
3. move curosr away from scroll bar

Actual Results:
page doe not jump back to begining

Expected Results:
page position should change... (the new location can be brought back by simply moving the cursor back over the scroll bar)

Not marking a minor, a the work arround is tedious.
