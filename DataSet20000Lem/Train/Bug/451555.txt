If updtates are found to addons in the background while firefox is running, you are not notified and when you close the browser normally it remains running a a process. When you try to open firefox again it wont allow you because it is already running in the background. After manually ending the firefox.exe process and opening firefox again the addon installation window pop up and allows the update to the addons. Works normally from there until update are found again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Updates to addons found in the background without notification
2.Close browser
3.Open browser
Actual Results:
After step 3 above an error message pop up saying firefox is already running.

Expected Results:
The software should have ended the firefox.exe executable when closing the browser in step 2.
