There seems to be a memory issue with firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4

When ever i check the Windows Task Manager for Memory usage, my firefox normal eats up 200MB-300MB of my 2GB of ram. After getting firefox 3.0.4 however, those number will surge at to 1,450,000MB. Completely eating up my RAM. i took a screen shot of the incident if you'd like to see that, it happens a lot.

This error occurs no matter how many tab i have open, 20 tabs, or just 5. And it doesn't matter if it a clean install of firefox, or after doing suggested tweak to the about:config you'll find online (i can provide link if you're interested)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Not sure, but it happens with my firefox. I like a lot of add-ons, but i've never had this problem before so i don't see why it should start occuring now. If you'd like i can provide you with a list of the add-on i use.
Actual Results:
see the "details" box.

Expected Results:
i would expect firefox to run normally and eat up around 200MB-300MB consistently... not over 1,000MB....

nope. Please email me on the issue.
