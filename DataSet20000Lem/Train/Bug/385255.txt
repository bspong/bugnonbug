After the last update to the Firefox Browser, I have experienced problem with the browser being very slow to switch from one page to another, and when trying to open and/or switch to tab or new browsers, and sometimes the browser completely crashes. Certain functions, such a 'Define xxxxx', simply are not working, at all.

I've spoken with several others who also use Firefox, some of whom I'd told about Firefox and convinced them to switch, and even with the friend who first introduced me to the Firefox browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Browser
2. Press link in the page, or CTRL T or CTRL N to open new link or tab.
3. Page is extremely slow in changing, and sometimes crash during the extended period of time it act a if it's trying to switch to pages, tab or other occurrence of browser.
Actual Results:
Browser either freeze while attempting to switch or crashes, altogether.

Expected Results:
Move to the new page, tab or browser occurrence

Occasionally, if I get lucky, I can press the Tab key and force the page change or view to the new tab or browser.

As stated, previously, several friend who use Firefox have also reported problems; one ha the same problem I do, another stated his browser simply crashed every time he tried to refresh, switch to tab or switch to new browser occurrence.
