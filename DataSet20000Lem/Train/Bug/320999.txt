I have bookmark for manual surfing site which I open every day. There are no more than 16 URLs in any of them. Since I downloaded the new version of Firefox I just start to surf each site then all of a sudden only one tab is available and the others are frozen. The tab that can be refreshed doe not progress the timer and the status bar doe not completely clear from the bottom of the Firefox browser but sometimes another tab will open after the refresh and it will be the only tab available. This did not occur in the previous version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open multiple tabbed bookmark for surf site
2.Log in to each one
3.Start manual surfing each tab

Actual Results:
After the first few iteration only one tab became available and the timer locked up

Expected Results:
Each tab should be available to be updated for each site.

I have looked at all the current bug and couldn't find this specific problem.
