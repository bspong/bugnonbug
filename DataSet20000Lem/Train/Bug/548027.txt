New Toolbar Button Dimension/Style Tweaks

There are some tweak I would like to make to get the new toolbar button to match the mockups.

-- Size/Spacing: --
* Default button size for stand-alone button should be 30px and 40px for button with a dropdown arrow. The forward button attached to the back button is 29px. The height is correct already and the big back button is the right size. The spacing between element should be 7px.


-- Styling: --
* Darker outline and shadow (especially on the bottom): This might be kind of tricky since the outline/shadow is a gradient from le transparent to more transparent.

* Darker or more opaque gradient at the start of the bottom transition: Hard to explain but at the start of the gradient after the glossy top half it need to be a little darker so it ha more dimension on lighter backgrounds.

* Darker/Light shadow between back/forward buttons: The shadow cast on the forward button from the big background button appears too light on lighter background and too dark on darker backgrounds.

* Don't darken disabled buttons: The dark tint on disabled button make them seem a little heavy and out of place. If the 40-50% transparent glyph isn't obvious enough maybe just making the button(but not the shadow) more transparent. I think I might need to make the actual glyph darker because they tend to get lost on black backgrounds.

* More opaque/brighter gradients: The highlight part of the button gradient aren't quite bright or opaque enough. This is sort of the same a the darker bottom half maybe the correct description is that is just need to have more contrast.

* Slightly softer edge highlight: The edge highlight in the mockups ha a hard(er) 1px outer edge but a second softer/feathered 1px inside.

* Labels under of button: With text turned on the button should remain the same but the text should act more a a label instead of becoming part of the button.

* Hover effect should be more blue/brighter: The hover effect is more blue and the outline also take on a blueish tint. It is also still contrasty instead of washed out.
