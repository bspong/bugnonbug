If you customize the toolbar to create a new toolbar and move the address field
to that toolbar and the GO button is not to the immediate right of the address
bar field, the autocomplete dropdown appears off the screen to the left. This
happens if the GO button is completely removed from the toolbars a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Customize toolbar, add new toolbar (called address for example)
2. Move the address field/box to the new toolbar
3. Place the GO button anywhere except to the immediate right of the address
field box.
4. Type in a URL that autocomplete would respond to.

Actual Results:
The autocomplete dropdown list appeared to the far left of the screen so that
only the very right of the list could be seen.

Expected Results:
The autocomplete dropdown list should have been directly beneath the address box.

I have configured the address bar a a separate toolbar to facilitate the
transition away from IE where the address bar is separate from the navigation bar.
