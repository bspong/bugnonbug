When we try close last tab when the option "Always show the tab bar" in dialogue [Tools] -> [Options] -> [Tabs] is turned on, the location bar loses focus.

It make big sense at this situation to focus location bar -- a it take place both on Firefox start and when we create new tab with CTRL+T. It is useful and it really make sense.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Before reproduce make sure that the option "Always show the tab bar" in dialogue [Tools] -> [Options] -> [Tabs] is turned on.

1. Start Firefox with one tab open. One (empty) tab is open and the location bar ha focus.
2. Press CTRL+W. One tab is a before open and empty, but location bar isn't focused anymore.
Actual Results:
The location bar loses focus though visual and functional status of browser and of the tab are the same a right after Firefox start.

Expected Results:
Location bar must (or very useful/expected-by-user at least) still have focus when user ha tried to close last tab.

This bug affect Firefox 2.0 at least build of 2006-09-18, 2006-10-03, 2006-10-10.

Probably it may be easily fixed before final Firefox 2.0 ships.
