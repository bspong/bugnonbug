Frequent Instability -> freeze or crash with OOM. No identifiable cause.

Was running 3.6.13, have been for a long while no probs, suddenly became unstable. Wonder if due to number of tab (> 1,200 at the moment) which get restored at startup.
Upgraded to 3.6.16 manually (seems that automatic updating had not occurred). Does not fix. (note - also did an uninstall before upgrade rathe than just install over the top).
Typically just freeze up very soon after starting, often with paint/redraw oddity just before, sometimes run for an hour or more before bombing. Has started to 'crash' properly today with crash reporter being invoked (reports were sent in), but this is new behaviour. Also sometimes report of jscript error apparently in FX itself (not on page). Examples below. Note that some involve noscript. Don't know if noscript is culprit.
Machine is window 2008 R2 standard, dual core xeon + 7 gig ram, fully patched.
Browser string a above. No antivirus running (don't need it). Jscript on page is blocked via noscript for security. No flash or java is or ha ever been installed. Connections are proxied through squid with a large blocklist of adware/malware. Also run a user not admin, so I really doubt it's malware.

Disabled all addons except noscript - doesn't help.

What more info do you need, how can I help to fix this? Can send list of tab over that reproduce it if you *really* need it, please provide personal email for htis.
Do you have a debug build of FX?

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FX
2. Browse
3. Crashes sooner or later, often sooner.
Actual Results:
Freezes up. Redraw/repaint go wonky just before. Has to be killed via process manager.
