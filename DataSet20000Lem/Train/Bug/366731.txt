Originally, in firefox, you can drag a picture into a directory. (For example, desktop) And firefox will save that picture there. But in this website, there is a flower's picture. There is a bug. After you drag the file into your local directory. Firefox will save the file. But when you right click the file and go to property. You will see the file is 0kb. Firefox did not save successfully. I checked a little bit. This website is using javascript to show that picture. Seems like firefox cannot save file if it's coding through javascript.

This website ha right click menu disabled. But you could go to Tool-> Option-> Content-> Advanced behind Enable JavaScript-> uncheck Disable or replace context menu. After that you can do right click on this website. When you do right click on that picture in this website and do save image as. File can be saved correctly.

The bug only happen when you do drag into local directory.
