The error message said "Installer corrupted: invalid opcode"
FireFox ha been running slow and locking up recently, so I was/am optimistic that this update (install of new version) will correct my problems, but I am uncertain that it even installed correctly, given the error message. What should I do to make sure I have an uncorrupted version, try the download and reinstall it again... and see if I get the same error message? Please advise. Thank you guy for all your great work!!! I love FireFox and have been using it for years. This error message happened the last time I tried to update. Greg 404-831-0951 (cell phone)
