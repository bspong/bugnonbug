browser ha neither HISTORY nor BACK BUTTON, for last quarter of a year, only on this machine. Have browser on 6 other MS Win XP Pro SP2 machines, one Mac OSX, three SuSE 10.x machines, none show similar problem. All the "*.dat" file on this machine are assigned to Windows Media Player (WMP) a CD Movie files. May be that appropriate inquiry is, are they corrupted DAT files? Does WMP try to open all the files, and corrupt them (opening or closing incorrectly)?
second part of the problem is that the address in the address input box doe not change, no matter where browser navigates.
Next corollary: browser crash often, and take whole machine down with it. This with only browser open. This machine's no wimp, CPQR3240US with 1.25GB RAM and still 32.5GB storage available, I don't think it's crashing due to having run out of system resources. Actually, happens often when at Yahoo! watching one of the news videos, but happens often enough elsewise that it's apparent it's a more generalised browser problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Normal operation
2. inception seems to have been during version upgrade for browser
3.
Actual Results:
I can go to History and select last address from list. very cumbersome, a kluge, but survivable. almost worst not being able to have the URL in the address window, because one sometimes want to navigate by editing URL rather than selecting a site that's got a button pointing at it.

Expected Results:
should enable BACK BUTTON, should show current URL in Address window.
