webpage try to maximize already maximized browser window

(these step trigger the bug on window only, linux work just fine)

1. open this url: http://reddit.com/info/66uxr/comments/
2. maximize the browser window
3. right-click the main link titled "A380 cockpit (OMG!)" and select "open link in new window"

Expected results:
The A380 page should load in a new TAB of the already maximized window.

Actual results:
A cheezy script on that page explicitly set the size of the browser window with the intention of "maximizing" the window size. But my window is already maximized so the net effect is that my window go from "cleanly maximized" into "a 'non-maximized' window which ha the same size a the screen". This is extremely annoying, and it also affect all the other page I have loaded in other TABs and when I open new window they are "as big a the screen but still not maximized". Yuck!


Some kind of sanity is required here. I'm not sure what the javascript standard say about this behavior if it doe say something explicit. I would rather like ff to just stay maximized if a javascript try to set window size to screen width/height while the window is already maximized.
