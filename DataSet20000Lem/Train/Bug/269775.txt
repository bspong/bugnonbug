If the bookmark toolbar item is placed to the right of the location bar (on the
far right of the navigation toolbar) and the window is restored (from
maximised), re-sized, maximised (from 'restored'), or moved into or from full
screen mode, the location bar appears to 'squash' the bookmark toolbar so that
chevron appear. Every time the window is re-sized it shrink some more.

Correct layout is restored if you open the customise toolbar thing, or if you
edit a bookmark or restart the browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. I have just a menu bar, tab bar and navigation bar visible, though I don't
think this make much difference.
2. On the navigation bar i have back, forward, refresh, stop, location,
bookmark (containing 2 folder and 2 links).
3. Resize the window, enter / exit full screen or 'restore' the window.
Actual Results:
Bookmarks toolbar shrinks, chevron appear in place of missing bookmark items.
Location bar 'grows'.

Expected Results:
Location bar should have re-sized to allow space for the bookmark bar.
