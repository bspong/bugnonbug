Since updating to FireFox 3.6, I notice that the browser is adding 1 pixel of spacing around a flash movie which cannot be removed by CSS properties:
border
outline
margin
padding
float
position

You can see the problem here: http://89.16.185.23/ (please note that this URL will change in the near future).

Many people are reporting the same issue:
e.g. https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/forum/1/568476#threadId621132

In my example above, the flash movie is being inserted using the flash satay method.

I am not sure if the problem is limited to the Mac OSX version of FireFox 3.6 or not.

This is a very important issue to many developer since we are experiencing complaint from client who cannot understand why we can't fix the issue.
