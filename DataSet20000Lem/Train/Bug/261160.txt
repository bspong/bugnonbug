Each time I double click that lovely Jon Hicks logo on my desktop, I cannot see
any Jon Hicks icon in the product. Even worse, the logo on my desktop is
obscured by the Firefox window! I am sad about this a are all of my friend
(both of them). After his great work on the project logos, I feel it is a
travesty of great proportion that a Hicks theme doe not exist within the
product. *tear*

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Look for a Jon Hicks designed theme
3. Fail to find one
4. Feel sad

Actual Results:
Sense of emptyness. I wa left wishing Jon Hicks had design a Firefox theme.

Expected Results:
Sense of fulfilment. My desktop should have been enlivened by a Hicks Design
Firefox theme.

Everybody know that freelance developer cannot afford to always work for free.
I suggest that the Mozilla Organisation set aside a small sum of cash to
commision Jon Hicks to design a new theme set for Firefox.

If necessary could we set up a fund for donation just to this cause. I know a
large number of fan of Jon's work and I'm sure they'd all contribute something.
I know I would.
