Lots of ad showing up in History menu since upgrade to version 3.6

Since upgrading to Firefox 3.6 I have noticed that after visiting the forum where I am a moderator, the history menu is clogged up with link from the ad banner (described only a "ads"). The link to the banner ad were never opened. This never happened in earlier versions, and since I never opened the links, they should not be listed anyway.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to GHPF (see url).
2. Move to another site or the home page (I use blank).
3. Click on History to get the drop down menu.
Actual Results:
Links to several banner ad (described only a "ads") appear on the history menu that were never visited are listed.

Expected Results:
Only link to place that I actually have visited should have been listed.

The history setting that I use are:

Use custom setting for history

Automatically start Firefox in a private browsing session (unchecked)
Remember my browsing history for at least 999 day
Remember download history - (Download Statusbar)
Remember search and form history
Accept cooky from site
Accept third-party cooky / Keep until they expire
Clear history when Firefox close > Settings > Cache is the only one checked
