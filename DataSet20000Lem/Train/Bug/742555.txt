Inspector bar will not close
I wa actively working on other thing so I didn't pay very much attention to the odd thing that were happening at the time. It wasn't until later that I couldn't close the inspector bar that I asked in #devtools.

I recall seeing a couple of odd things:

1) When no inspector wa open, I right-clicked on a anchor element to inspect it. The inspector opened and I saw RDF XML in the inspector window where HTML usually is. When I clicked one level up the DOM stack, it returned to HTML.

2) At some point I opened another inspector menu via the context menu and saw 2 inspector stack on each other. At first I thought this wa Firebug + the native inspector but then realized I had uninstalled Firebug a few day prior. Might be related to 708643, although that is supposed to be fixed for Firefox 13.

In the error console there are some error which I'll share:

The above are repeated a few time but that's the unique set of error in my console.

Once I restart I'll try to reproduce.
