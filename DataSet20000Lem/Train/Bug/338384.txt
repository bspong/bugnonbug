In this first example,
http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~dlong/software/offsetheight/strange_1.htm
offsetHeight corrects return the height of a span node.

However, when it get wrapped in a tag like "font", "b", "i", "em", "strong", or anything that change rendering (but not a "span" or "div"), a in this example
http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~dlong/software/offsetheight/strange_2.htm
offsetHeight return the wrong height. It seems to only return the height of the first line.

IE return the same value for both pages. Mozilla exhibit this problem in both Windows and Linux. Is there at least some work around?
