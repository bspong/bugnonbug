Can't get rid of the Go/Star button (browser.urlbar.hideGoButton is ignored)

I built RC2 from source for a PPC machine (despite 64-bit capability, the OS and the Fx build are 32-bit) running Ubuntu Gutsy. None of the source wa modified in any way, and the only build option I used that wa out of the ordinary wa --disable-javaxpcom. If it's relevant I can post my .mozconfig.

Is it possible to get rid of the go/star button? I never use them and want them gone. This wa a trivial task in Fx 2.0 (set browser.urlbar.hideGoButton to true). Fx 3.0 completely ignores that preference. The "Customize..." window cannot remove it (it want the whole URL bar).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.urlbar.hideGoButton to true
Actual Results:
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:
Go/star button should disappear.

I thought this might be a conflict with Phoenity (which had a problem with the Go button in Fx 2.0), but it occurs with the default theme a well. This happens is safe mode, so it can't blamed on any extension or theme conflict/bug/Fx 3 incompatibility.
