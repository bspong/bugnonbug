Location bar exhibit broken behavior with non-OpenDNS DNS system

Mozilla Firefox relies on certain behavior which is unspecified in the DNS system in order to attempt to automatically find thing like missing "www." prefix and TLD suffix on URLs. It is the user’s responsibility to know what site they are visiting, not the user agent’s responsibility to attempt to find out for them.

This behavior doe not work under the OpenDNS system. I switched my home network to using OpenDNS because of it reliability, and now I have (note: a single user) complaining that they can no longer use the Firefox address bar to automatically resolve certain keywords into proper URLs when entering them. For example, this user belief that she should be able to simply type “juploadr” when she intends to go to “juploadr.org”. Not only is this broken behavior (what happens if there is a .com instead? I suppose she would get annoyed but that is beside the point.)

This functionality break the Internet experience by providing a false idea of how thing on the Internet work. This is similar to America Online and their subscriber-only enhancement that their user *think* is the Internet or the World Wide Web but is not.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use non-OpenDNS server and type random keywords. Get to a site.
2. Switch to OpenDNS. Use same said keywords. Get a keyword search, like you should.
