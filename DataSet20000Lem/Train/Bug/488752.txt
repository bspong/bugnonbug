The new Privacy Preferences Pane misfire an <enter> keypress into a check box
The new privacy preference panel (bug 462041) introduces an odd error in keyboard navigation that ha some serious consequence for testing and disability access.

Essentially what happens is that an <enter> keypress is fired at a checkbox instead of selecting the option from a <menulist> control. That ha serious implication because the checkbox that get checked in this case is "Always start Firefox in Private Browsing Mode", which ha deep implication for test infrastructure and session state.

= STR **Follow these step exactly** =
1. Open a Shiretoko (anything later than Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4pre) Gecko/20090416 Shiretoko/3.5b4pre)
2. Open the Preferences panel
3. Use the Mouse to clisk on the "Privacy" icon
4. Use the Tab key to focus the historyMode <menulist> dropdown
5. Use the Down Cursor (arrow) key to select the "Use Custom Settings for History" option
6. Hit Enter with the "Custom settings" option selected

= Expected =
That should simply bring up the deck containing the detailed custom history setting *the same way it would if you'd used the mouse to make that selection*

= Actual =
The enter keystroke in step 6 somehow selects the "Always start in private browsing mode" keystroke which immediately throw you into PB mode.

If you reset the preference window to the way it wa and re-run the step using nothing but the mouse a your selection mechanism, you will see that when you select "Use Custom history settings" from the drop down you are presented with an entirely different list of default and the "Always start in private browsing mode" is unchecked in that list of defaults.

Also happens in Linux, except you do not need to hit the <enter> key in step 6 on linux: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1b4pre) Gecko/20090416 Shiretoko/3.5b4pre

= How doe this affect testing =
If you have any state listener using sockets, those socket are destroyed upon entry into PB mode. We use a socket mechanism to allow jsbridge to remote control a mozmill test running in "automatic" mode. That's how we originally found this bug, in fact, the mozmill test stopped working. I don't think this would affect a mochitest run.

= How doe this affect A11y =
Many A11y us use the keyboard exclusively for navigation. So, that path need to work the same way a using a mouse to navigate through the software.

I'm going into such great detail here because I'm going to ask for blocking because of the last two points. I really think this is a basic navigational bug and ought to be fixed before we ship 3.5.
