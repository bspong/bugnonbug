Some text implies the Firefox logo is under a non-free copyright license

Apparently when the Firefox binary wa changed to being distributed under the MPL, this include the icon too. However, no documentation wa changed to reflect this, nor wa a specific announcement that the logo now had a free copyright license made.http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2010/01/packages_and_trademarks_an_observation.html

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Look for the license on the Firefox logo
Actual Results:
other-licenses/branding/firefox/LICENSE say "You are not granted right or license to the trademark of the Mozilla Foundation or any party, including without limitation the Firefox name or logo." which to me implies copyright and trademark licenses.

about:rights say "Mozilla doe not grant you any right to the Mozilla and Firefox trademark or logos."

Expected Results:
It say something like "The logos' copyright is licensed under the MPL/LGPL/GPL, but use is also subject to trademark licensing". about:rights say the same thing in respect to the logos.

Gerv ha changed http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html to reflect the above, but apparently further change require a bug, so here we are.
