Javascript is not working properly in the sidebar.

To test this bug you can use this code.

1. Open page in Firefox. Might have to use http://. Does not work from file://
for me.
2. Click on Add to sidebar link.
3. Access the link from the Bookmarks menu. This should open the sidebar with
the page.
4. Click Test bug. You should get a Javascript error.
5. Open page also in main window. So that you have the page open in both sidebar
and main window.
6. Click Test bug. This should now work.

At least on my machine clicking the Test bug in the sidebar give me the
following error:

Error: bug is not defined
Source File: javascript:alert(bugs);
Line: 1


<script language="JavaScript">
<!--
var bugs='There is no bug';

function addSidebar(url)
{
try
{
window.sidebar.addPanel ("Test bug", url, "");
}
catch(ex)
{
alert("Error adding sidbar");
}
}
//-->
</script>
Actual Results:
Javascript should work in sidebar. The Javascript variable defined in the
sidebar should be accessible. But Firefox seems to access the variable from the
main content window instead of the sidebar. You can verify this by opening the
page in both the sidebar and the main window.

Expected Results:
Javascript variable defined in the sidebar should be accessible from the
sidebar not the main window.
