Steps to reproduce:

I went to Biblos.com website and selected the "KJP" version of the Bible from the choice listed across the top of the website page, and then, after the "KJP" version of the Bible opened, and I selected a book and chapter, some random word that should appear in black non-underscored font display in underscored blue font.


Actual results:

Random word within the body of the text of the selected book and chapter, that should appear in black non-underscored fonts, display in underscored blue font.
In addition to random word within the body of the selected passage being displayed in underscored blue font, which is not really predictable, the second heading line above the text body also exhibit this underscored blue font error. It should appear a “King James Bible: Purple Letter Edition” – and does, briefly. Then, after a moment or so, the second heading line, change to “King James Bible: Purple Letter Edition”; and at that same time random word in the body of the chapter will also change to underscored blue font. This bug reporting medium doesn't support font or underscore, so I can't show that the word “King James Bible:" in the heading are now underscored blue font.


Expected results:

The word that change to underscored blue font should remain non-underscored black font, a the HTML source for this text doe not contain tag calling for underscored blue font treatment.
