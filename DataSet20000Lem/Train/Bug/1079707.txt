Accessing IPv6 URLs without typing the protocol and the first bracket throw a JS error in the Browser Console
Note: this is a follow up bug for Bug 494092.

Reproducible on:
* Nightly 35.0a1 (2014-09-15),
* Windows 7 64-bit, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 32-bit, Mac OS X 10.9.5.

STR:
1. Launch Firefox with a clean profile.
2. Open the Browser Console.
3. Select the Location Bar and type in the following IPv6 address: '[FE80::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329' (w/o apostrophe).
4. Press the <enter> key and look at the log displayed in the Browser Console.

ER:
There are no error or unexpected warning displayed for that request. A search is performed for that invalid IPv6 URL.

AR:
A search is indeed performed for that invalid IPv6 URL, but the following JS error is displayed in the Browser Console:
> NS_ERROR_UNKNOWN_HOST: Component returned failure code: 0x804b001e
> (NS_ERROR_UNKNOWN_HOST) [nsIDNSService.asyncResolve]
> in browser.js:10658

Additional notes:
- This issue *might be a regression*, but so far I wa unable to find a reliable regression window.
- Per Bug 494092 Comment 36, a potential regressor might be Bug 1048618.
- This issue is reproducible across platform (Windows 7 x64, Ubuntu 14 x86, OS X 10.9.5).
