Under W7, clicking the taskbar icon of an application toggle between opening/bringing to front and closing an application's window.

With Firefox 4b2 and browser.taskbar.previews.enable=true (default value) this no longer works; instead clicking toggle the display of the tab preview and one explicitly ha to select one of the tab for the (single) FF window to open.

When browser.taskbar.previews.enable is set to false, Firefox doe correctly open it window when I click on the taskbar icon.

Note: this concern the situation in which there's only one FF Window; the behavior is correct when there are two or more (windows apps also require a window preview to be clicked on in that case).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF, with one window and >1 tab open
2. check that browser.taskbar.previews.enable = true (default value)
3. click the taskbar icon to minimize
4. click on taskbar icon to re-open the window
Actual Results:
clicking the taskbar icon only toggle the tab preview on/off

Expected Results:
I expected it to open the window again.

What work with all other window apps (thunderbird included), i.e. clicking the taskbar icon to re-open the app's window or move it to the front doesn't work with Firefox with the default settings.
I discovered a possible link with an about:config setting while searching bugzilla, but this default is unexpected and non-trivial to correct.

Pretending that each tab is in fact a different window may make it easy to obtain the tab preview in the taskbar, but a described it change the application's behavior in an unexpected way.
