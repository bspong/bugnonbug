Show a fixed order list in addition to MRU list for tab preview
One particular use case of the "list all tabs" button seems to be to access a 'well known' tab. Perhaps tab #1 ha mail and tab #2 ha rss, etc. The old behavior required just clicking the list and selecting the first entry. With only a MRU list, people now need to search for that tab.

Instead of only showing a MRU list, we can show another ordering of tab that behaves like the old list. A few way to make the list:
1) tab order (tab 1 first, tab 2 next)
2) oldest tab first (first tab keep it spot even if reordered)
3) adaptively track tab picked from the list

One potential way to show two list is to keep the same layout with some visuals to separate them. Keyboard press can explicitly move between the lists.

/------------\
| |search| |
|_F1__F2__F3_| <-- fixed list
| M1 M2 M3 | <-- default ctrl-tab focus
| M4 M5 M6 | <-- MRU list
\------------/

Pressing ctrl-tab will focus M2, and multiple press to tab after M6 will load the next page of tabs. If the user explicitly press up from the M list into F, tabbing from F3 will load the next page. Searching would just show a single list of matching tabs.

Perhaps when tabbing off the last F3 or M6, the next page can be filled with just the fixed list or just the MRU list. Or maybe show 2 row of the "current list" to allow switching into the other list.
