Pop-up Blocker block whitelisted sites, give no option to unblock

Happens on all whitelisted site using popups; I'd whitelisted the sample site several version of FF ago. Firefox block popups I'd set to be allowed, then only give the option of blocking--which, of course, it's already doing. How do I UNblock, and why is it suddenly blocking now anyway?

Incidentally, I've seen seen this behavior off and on in the past couple release of Firefox, but never prior to, a a guess, a couple or three month ago.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to 4chan or any other similar imageboard which ha been whitelisted a an exception to blocking
2. Click on an image thumbnail
3. ???
4. PROFIT!

Can be done in other place which normally open new windows, like clicking news link from Yahoo! Mail.
Actual Results:
Clicking on an image show the popup blocker dialog at the top of the page reading "Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window." Clicking on the Options button give the choice of: "Block pop-up from img.4chan.org"," "Edit Pop-up Blocker Options", and "Don't show this message when pop-up are blocked"

Expected Results:
The full size of the thumbnailed image should be displayed.
