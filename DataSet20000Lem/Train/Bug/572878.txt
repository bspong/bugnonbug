Unchecking "Load image automatically" would not work on Google search.

I want to turn off image displaying in Firefox so I tried to disable that function by unchecking the "Load image automatically" in the Content tab of Firefox's Options. I unchecked it (there are not any exceptions) and click OK.
When I surfed the web, I saw there are not any image appeared on the web I went in.
However, it doe not seem to work well on Google search.
I went to Google.com and I did not see the logo. It wa nice, however, when I typed in a key word (for example, in this case, I used "tiger" for testing). I pressed enter and looked at the results. I wa so amazed when I saw there were some picture displayed on the Google search results.
I think there are something technically wrong here . :)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.google.com (do not go to search Images, this is search Web).
2. Type in the search textbox a key word. Not all key word will make Google display the image this way. For example, a good keyword for this case may be "tiger" or "pictures". Press enter or click Search.
3. Now you would see Google search result a usual, but Google would display some image related to the keyword. Those image are not hidden a expected.
Actual Results:
Some image of Google still appears on Google search results.

Expected Results:
Those image should not be displayed due to unchecking "Load image automatically".
