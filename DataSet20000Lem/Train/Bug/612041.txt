The history entry for a previous month disappears after I double-click it in the Library or click it in the History sidebar. It should not disappear from the previous month's listing. Restarting Firefox cause the previous month's listing to be restored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Library with History > Show All History
2. Select a previous month in the left panel, e.g. October if it's now November.
3. Double-click any one of the history entry displayed in the right panel.

Actual Results:
The history entry disappears.
If I restart Firefox, select Show All History, and select October again. The history entry is correctly displayed.

Expected Results:
The history entry doe not disappear.

Problem also occurs in Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101113 Firefox/4.0b8pre

Same problem occurs with a single-click in the History sidebar.
