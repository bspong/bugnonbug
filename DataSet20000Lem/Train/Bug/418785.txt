trying to identify what it is about FF and this site's page [and other sites] such that when a minimum font size is set, the rendering engine kill part of the visible page. In this case, particularly, the second row of button end up underneath content which is normally just below it on the page.

In my case, I chose a minimum font size of 14, avoiding issue with reading glasses.

Is this a defect in the layout engine, or is there something inherently wrong with the way the site's author[s] code the page?

This layout issue happens on other site in similar form; this happens to be a common site I visit, and show the layout error/issue simply.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set minimum font size to 14, instead of none
2. go to www.lsba.org
3.
Actual Results:
title area [after first line of buttons], and the second line of buttons, end up underneath subsequent content on the page. The title and button are not visible.

Expected Results:
The title area and the second line of button should expand vertically, and push subsequent content further down the page.
