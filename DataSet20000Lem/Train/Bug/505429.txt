Build Identifier: Shiretoko, Firefox 3.1a2

My version is outdated (been abroad, finally updating..) but I just wanted to report that uninstalling the old Shiretoko install from Add/Remove program completely removed my profile from my regular Firefox install without checking the option to remove any of it. I wanted to keep all my setting and bookmarks. After uninstalling and restarting my computer, I clicked on Firefox and it loaded the first starting page. I checked the folder in Application Data and everything wa removed besides for the new profile made on starting Firefox.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Firefox installed with profiles/bookmarks/etc and then also Shiretoko installed.
2. Uninstall Shiretoko.
3. Check profile folder in application data.
Actual Results:
Upon starting Firefox after uninstalling Shiretoko, it come up with a new install page.

Expected Results:
Prompt to choose which profile to start up with. Should still have all bookmarks.

3.1 version of firefox. Outdated, but couldn't find any report of it in listing. Don't know if it wa fixed in newer versions, but wanted to report just in case for others.
