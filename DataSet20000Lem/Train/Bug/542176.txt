When I drag a file from my desktop to firefox and drag over a DOM element with the "ondragenter()" event defined, the event fires, however the DOM doe not repaint with updates.

So, in the ondragenter() event handler, you change an element's background-color, for example, the background color doe not actually change until you drag the file outside of the firefox window or drop the file. This is weird because in Firebug I can see the DOM updating, and the dynamic style getting applied instantly, but the screen doe not repaint (so there's no timely user feedback). This only happens when dragging file and not when dragging other DOM element a you can see in this url: http://decafbad.com/2009/07/drag-and-drop/api-demos.html#newschool

(This is a small bug, but the feature is awesome for drag n drop uploading btw!)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Define an ondragenter() method that visibly change the dom (like text color change)
2. Drag a file onto the element with the event define
3.
Actual Results:
The screen doe not update with the visual change (like text color change)

Expected Results:
The screen doe update with the visual change (like text color change) a soon a you drag over the element with ondragenter() defined.

I'm using Firefox 3.6 on a Windows XP SP3 computer.
