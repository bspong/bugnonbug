This is probably a repeat of 319196. It's disappointing to see that this bug wa reported on 6/24 but nonetheless my system automatically downloaded the screwed up version and auto-installed it on my system on 7/7, long after that date. My bookmark and personal toolbar have been wiped out a a result.

A little more vigilance in the future on the part of whoever is responsible for launching these bomb towards user would be a service to users.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start program
2. Bingo! No bookmark
3. Shut down program and copied most recent bookmark backup file to the D:\Documents and Settings\Me\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ "salt" folder, replacing 1K skeletal file found there.
Actual Results:
4. Restarted the program - bingo! - no bookmark and the newly restored file ha been reduced from a valid 461K bookmark file to another empty 1K skeletal shell of it former self.


Expected Results:
5. What are backup bookmark file for?????

6. Good work, guys!
7. I will now disable automatic checking and downloading of update on all machine on which FF and TB are installed. Given that once they download they will automatically install when the machine is restarted, this ha taught me that if the machine crash and must be restarted, the automatic installation will deny me the opportunity to back up my profile manually before approving the installation of the update.
