Browser doe not remember "Always do this..." plugin choice when viewing local file
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0
Build ID: 20130409194949

Steps to reproduce:

1. View a local web page that contains Flash content.
example: file:///C:/MyFolder/bin-debug/Viewer.html

2. Click the red plugin icon next to the address bar.

3. Click the pull down menu and select "Always activate plugins for this site".

4. ( Nothing happens )

4. Click "Activate All Plugins".

5. The Flash content plays.

6. Reload the page (exact same local URL), or open a new tab with same URL, or open new browser with same URL, etc... In other word "view the same site"




Actual results:

The "Click to Activate" state appears again and user must make activation selection again even though they selected to "Always activate all plugins" for that URL.


Expected results:

The browser should have remembered the preference for the URL, even though it wa a local file.

WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
At our company, we developer test Flash content dozens, if not hundred of time a day. The plugin activation step impact our efficiency.

WHY DON'T WE JUST UPGRADE THE PLUGIN?
Our software is made for kiosk installation and is designed with Flash Player 11.3 a the target player. We have a "code freeze" (AKA "version freeze") at 11.3 to prevent unforeseen bug and issue resulting from change Adobe decides to make. We cannot just blindly upgrade a that would cause dozen of completed software product to go back into QA for sanity test and potential bug can and do appear.

So for u guy who do local testing, can you put in a setting somewhere to allow u the CHOICE of how plugins behave? THanks.
