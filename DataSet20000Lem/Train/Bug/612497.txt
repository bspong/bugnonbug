Firefox crash every time I try to attach a file to an e-mail (in both Yahoo Mail and Roundcube). I get message
that my plugin container isn't working. I am not computer savvy enough
to know what to do to fix this. Everything wa fine until Thursday, but
now it is totally screwed up. I can still use Internet Explorer to
attach file to e-mails, but I want Firefox, which ha been my browser
for many years. I need step-by-step help to fix this a if I know
nothing at all.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open e-mail program
2.generate a message
3.try to attach file
Actual Results:
can't select a file....Firefox program crashes....message appears that plugin container is not working.

Expected Results:
to be able to attach file to e-mail like I used to before Thursday, when this started happening

I've been trying to attach documents, photo and mp3's, but I can't even select them now, much le attach them. I have broadband ethernet connection and wifi from AT & T (fiber optic), Vista, Core 2 Duo, 3 GB RAM, 360 GB HD on a Gateway laptop. I am still able to use Internet Explorer to send attachments, but I would prefer Firefox to remain my browser of choice.
