it appears the flash player is not properly processing left-clicks. With video on hulu, audio on pandora, and assorted flash game i've tried, the visual cue are being triggered, both on mouse-over AND on left-click, however the actual left-click ACTION is only very rarely being taken, maybe 1% of the time. I.E. clicking "full screen" while watching hulu vids, the button "lights up" on mouseover, and "dims" in response to the click, but no full-screen! same with the transport button in the pandora player. Notably, typed command (space=pause, rt-arrow=next, up and down = volume) work fine, and SOMETIMES (but quite rarely) the click ha the desired effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. view flash content with button or mouse-click action (games, etc)
2. try to click in the flash app
3. GOTO 2
Actual Results:
flash element blink or change color or whatever appropriately, but desired ACTION is not being taken

Expected Results:
flash player/game/app should respond to the mouse-click

this behaviour started when i upgraded to moz 3.5
