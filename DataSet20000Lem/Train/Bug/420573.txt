When I click on the Reload button, the page isn't reloaded though it ha been modified on the server. I don't know under which condition this occur, perhaps if the page hasn't expired yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a URL.
2. Modify the page on the server.
3. Click on the Reload button.
Actual Results:
The page is reloaded from the cache (it can clearly be seen after enabling "Work Offline": I don't get any error; the Page Info also say so).

Expected Results:
Firefox should connect to the server in order to see if the page ha been modified (and in Work Offline is enabled, Firefox should give an error instead).
