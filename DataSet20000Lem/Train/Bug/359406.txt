User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

In Windows Vista RC2, using Firefox 1.5.0.7 and 2.0, menu generated by the popular AllWebMenus package render incorrectly. When viewed in IE7 on Vista, a well a Opera9, they appear correctly. All browser work properly in WindowsXP, even Firefox 2.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using Windows Vista RC2 with clean Firefox 1.5 or 2.0 profile, visit any site using AllWebMenus DHTML/JavaScript menu system (eg. http://www.likno.com)
2. Hover mouse over main menu option (eg. products)
3. If you are able, hover over submenu option
4. Repeat procedure in IE7 or Opera9 to see expected result

Actual Results:
Submenus are rendered in the wrong places, and if set to disappear automatically when the mouse is removed from the parent item, are completely unusable.

Expected Results:
Submenus should be placed next to their parent elements, with tertiary navigation option placed relative to their secondary parent elements.

Note: This bug is present in 1.5 and 2.0 builds, but only on Windows Vista RC2.
