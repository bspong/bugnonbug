Java applet "leaks" out of boundary when scrolling rapidly

When viewing a Java applet that frequently redraws it screen, and rapidly scrolling up and down the same time, Firefox fails to properly redraw below and above the Java applet, leading it image to "leak" out of the original applet boundaries.

See the attached video to get a better idea of how it looks.

This is probably related to the other Java-related redrawing bugs, although none of them seemed similar enough so I decided to report a new one.

Reproducible: Always

3. Scroll up and down rapidly with your mouse scroll wheel.

This computer ha the Intel GMA965 graphic chipset; I seem to notice redrawing problem more often with it (in various applications) than on other computers.
