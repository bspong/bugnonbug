Some of the web pages, which linked on the E mail I downloaded by IncrediMail, cannot be opened by Firefox, but it open Home Page, instead. It started to happen after I upgraded Firefox. If I changed the default browser to IE, it open the linked page. Or if I open from Web Mail, it works. Just from the clicking the link of the E mail, it open my home page by Firefox, instead of the linked page.
It wa very fine until I upgraded Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Clicking the link on E mail I received by IncrediMail
2.Firefox open my home page, instead of the linked page
3.I upgraded IncrediMail to see this is the problem
Actual Results:
Firefox (default browser) open my home page, instead of the linked page
Changing to the default browser to IE, it open the linked page-no problem.


This is nothing to do with the E mail program, but Firefox itself, because if I change to IE a the default browser, it works.
It used to be fine until I upgraded Firefox.
