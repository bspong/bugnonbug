Personal toolbar dissapeared from bookmark manager
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

This problem occured in Firefox 0.9. I'm running Win98. My personal toolbar
still appears in Firefox main interface, but it folder is no longer present in
the bookmark manager. It disappeared from the manager after I had done some
drag and drop change to the personal toolbar while in the main interface. I
noticed that one of my folder on the main interface toolbar had dissapeared. I
found it two layer down in another personal toolbar folder. I don't believe
this happened a a result of my drag and drop actions. I cannot return this
folder to it correct position as: (1) My entire personal toolbar is gone from
the bookmark manager (my drag and drop did not include any "deletes" or involve
the moved folder), and (2) I cannot drag and drop it in the main interface a
this appears not be permitted.

In short, personal toolbar appears in the main interface, but is gone from the
bookmark manager.

P.S. I installed Firefox 1.0, no change.
