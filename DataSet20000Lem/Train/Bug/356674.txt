I'm not sure if this is a Google or a Firefox bug...

I'm using Firefox 2.0 RC2 on a Win98SE system. The default search option for the Google search engine is "Use moderate filtering". This option can ordinarily be changed using "Global Preferences (SafeSearch Filtering)". In both IE6 and previous release of Firefox, this option worked a designed and intended.

From "Preferences", in "SafeSearch Filtering", if I select either "Use strict filtering" or "Do not filter my search results" and then click on the "Save Preferences" button, I receive a "Your preference have been saved" dialog box, a expected, however, when I click on the "OK" button, instead or saving my selected filtering preference and returning to the Google search, the filtering preference is reset to the default (Use moderate filtering) and Firefox remains on the preference page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From the Google search page, click on "preferences".
2. In "SafeSearch Filtering", select either the "Use strict filtering" or the "Do not filter my search results" option.
3. Click on the "Save Preferences" button.
4. When the diaog box appears with the message ... "Your preference have been saved" dialog box, click on the "OK" button.

Actual Results:
The search filtering preference is reset to the default (Use moderate filtering) and Firefox remains on the preference page.

Expected Results:
The selected search filter preference should be saved and Firefox should return to the Google search.

In both IE6 and previous release of Firefox, this function worked a intended by designed.
