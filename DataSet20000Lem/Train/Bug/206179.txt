Firebird (0.6) doe not run with Linux distribution Knoppix 3.2 (Phoenix (0.5) work fine)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.1; Linux 2.4.20-xfs; X11)
Build Identifier: 0.6 Milestone & nightly build from 2003-05-17

While Phoenix (0.5) work in my Knoppix 3.2 distribution, trying to start Firebird (0.6)
using the "MozillaFirebird" command result in this error message:
" /ramdisk/home/knoppix/MozillaFirebird/run-mozilla.sh: line 454: 4132
Speicherzugriffsfehler "$prog" ${1+"$@"} "
("Speicherzugriffsfehler" is the german word for "memory access failure")

Running the command "MozillaFirebird-bin" result in the error message:
" MozillaFirebird-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libmozjs.so: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory "
But the file "libmozjs.so" exists and is not empty...

I tested Firebird with Debian Woody (stable), everything work fine with this distribution.
It should be mentioned that in the Knoppix distribution many part of the filesystem are
read-only, including the directory containing Mozilla 1.3. But since Phoenix (0.5) work
fine, this should be probably irrelevant.
The directory containing Firebird allows write access, and i deleted the ".mozilla" and
the ".phoenix" directory before trying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
