VMS-OpenVMS TCPIP FTP server with long directory or file name -- many not shown

Apparently, Mozilla's interpretation of a directory listing (LIST)
provided by an HP VMS (OpenVMS) TCPIP FTP server is defective, if the
listing includes long names, that is, name long enough to cause a
file's listing entry to be split onto two lines. The problem seems to
be old, and remains in Mozilla 3.0b5 (tested on Mac OS 10.4.11).

Simple test suggest that the parsing algorithm used need to see one
complete (one-line) entry before it belief that it's gotten past the
header, and this is not correct. In my experience
("http://antinode.org/dec/sw/wget.html"), it is sufficient to skip blank
lines, the "Directory" header line, and any blank line which follow it.
Thereafter, any non-blank line are actual data, until the next blank
line, which delimits the "Total" trailer.

For example, these directory each contain three files, but Mozilla
show all, some, or none, depending on where the first short name
appears in the listing:

ftp://antinode.org/moz_test/dir_all
ftp://antinode.org/moz_test/dir_some
ftp://antinode.org/moz_test/dir_none

Visiting the same place with a simple-minded FTP client should show all
the file in each directory. Alternatively, the same directory may be
inspected using HTTP:

http://antinode.org/ftp/moz_test/dir_all
http://antinode.org/ftp/moz_test/dir_some
http://antinode.org/ftp/moz_test/dir_none


For a different problem, VMS TCPIP FTP server also have a peculiarly
unfortunate way of displaying ODS5 extended file name (longer names,
multiple dots, funny characters, and so on), and an amazing inability to
accept a input the name they provide in their own listings. The code
in (my modified) wget src/ftp-ls.c show how to cope with this annoying
behavior, and I'd be happy to explain the details, if anyone is
interested. I don't have a convenient test server configured to
demonstrate this problem, but I can arrange one if it would be helpful.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Mozilla to visit the FTP URLs provided above.
2. Use a simple (stupid) FTP client (or HTTP) to visit the same places.
3. Compare the file shown in each case.
Actual Results:
Defective file listings: missing some or all files.

Expected Results:
Correct file listings.
