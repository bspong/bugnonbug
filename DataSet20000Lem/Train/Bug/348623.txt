While using Virtual Desktop Manager ( http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/xppowertoys.mspx ), when I switch to a different desktop, then back to the desktop with Firefox, the Firefox window is no longer present on the desktop. I am unable to restore it by manipulation of the context menu in the taskbar. However, if I choose "Move" from the taskbar menu, I am able to get the window, now resized to barely large enough to hold the minimize/maximize/close buttons, to slide onto the desktop from off the screen in the top left corner, and then manually resize it to it previous dimensions. This occurs intermittently, maybe six time in a day of normal usage. The only application (I've found) to which this happens is Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install VDM.
2. Open Firefox on desktop 1.
3. Navigate back and forth between different desktops.

Actual Results:
Intermittently, the Firefox window will be hidden on return to desktop 1.

Expected Results:
The Firefox window will remain visible at it former size on desktop 1.
