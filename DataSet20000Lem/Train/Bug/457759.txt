Since this morning, both Firefox AND Seamonkey close completely without any alert when trying to load any page containing any kinf of Flash content (video or audio)
Even in safe mode for Firefox.
At first I wa running an old 1.1.9 Seamonkey release and an old 3.0.1 Firefox release, I upgraded both of them to the last release, respectively 1.1.12 and 3.0.3 but the result is exactly the same : a soon a I click on a link toward a page containing any kind of flash, all the tabs, and all the window close without anymore information.
When I deactivate shockwave flash plugin, they don't close, but I cannot see any flash content
