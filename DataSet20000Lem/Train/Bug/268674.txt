Our company ha a website www.crew.swiss.com which requires a logon. The Logon
go via a seperate Notes-LDAP-Server which is done on awp.atraxis.com.

Is the access is granted, a memory cookied is saved at the actual browser
session. Only with this memory cookie (which is not written to any disk) the
logon completes. With IE this works, but with FireFox not. After Logon, for a
second the portal page is displayed, but after le than a secound the user will
be redirectes to the logonpage. This is because each page on the website check
if the memory cookie is stored in the actual browser session.

Changing all the cookie-settings did not help.

I guess there is something wrong with memory cooky in Firefox. It look the
memcookie is not stored properly.

Thanks for fixing this.

the check fails.
