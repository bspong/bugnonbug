Window scrolling Javascript only work after the page is completely loaded (was working fine with Firefox v3.5.8)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/532.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/4.1.249.1045 Safari/532.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The javascript (http://www.exabytedesigns.com/scripts/eXabyteScroll.js) executes properly only after page load. While it wa working fine on all version of Firefox before v3.6

I looked for help at support.mozilla.com (https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/forum/1/630194) but couldn't find any real solution.

http://www.exabytedesigns.com/test/ work great on Firefox v3.5.8 and all other major browser including the buggiest Internet Explorer!

Please test this link (http://www.exabytedesigns.com/test/) using Firefox v 3.5.8 and v3.6+ and you'll know the difference.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.exabytedesigns.com/test/ using Firefox v3.5.8
2. Then http://www.exabytedesigns.com/test/ using Firefox v3.6+
3. Notice the page scroll error!
Actual Results:
The script doe not execute if it is called any where in the body. It only work if called in the body's onload attribute. But that mean the the user will have to wait for the page to center until it is loaded completely!

Expected Results:
The script should execute just after the body tag starts.

To get around this bug I used PHP to check the user browser version and execute the script on page load, here is what i did...

if (!strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'],'Firefox/3.6')){ echo '<body>'; } else { echo '<body onload="setPosition();">'; }

This made the page viewable after the page load at least. But it not how it should be. To view this result visit (http://www.exabytedesigns.com/)

I also took screen shot of this page using Firefox v3.5.8, v3.6.2, Opera, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer... here is the link to the image (https://support.mozilla.com/tiki-download_forum_attachment.php?locale=en-US&attId=14755)

Please look into this issue. It ha caused me and a lot of my visitor a lot of trouble.
