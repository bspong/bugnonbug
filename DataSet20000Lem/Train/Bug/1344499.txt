Apostrophes are not percent encoded when copied from address bar
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170303084134

Steps to reproduce:

Open https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently%27s_Holistic_Detective_Agency

Alternative URL: https://example.com/%27

Copy URL from address bar.

Paste into search bar, input box, or external application.


Actual results:

URL is not percent encoded:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently's_Holistic_Detective_Agency

https://example.com/'



Expected results:

URL is percent encoded:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_Gently%27s_Holistic_Detective_Agency

https://example.com/%27

Note that this doe not occur in query strings. For example, this page is correctly percent encoded:

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%27&redirect=no

Percent encoding apostrophe is encouraged by RFC 3986,
where they are listed a "sub-delims".

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.2

As a practical matter, this break copying and pasting URLs from the address bar into other application like email, IRC chat, etc.

Reproducibility of this bug may depend on operating system. I have reproduced on several Linux machines, but reproducibility on Windows is le clear.
