About 3 or 4 time now i've ended up with something like 600-->400MB change when closing to everything but download manager. This only happens when i have used extensive flash video. There believe medium on closed page is often not closing properly.

This bug is often, but not always encountered with Bug 289873, even if i close down and reopen page i cannot get flash sound(in videos) to play. This tell me video are not closing with their windows.

Flash wa downloaded about 2-3 month ago, just upgraded to latest.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.watch a lot of flash video
Actual Results:
major memory use, sluggish computer, memory cannot be freed without closing firefox, this act being quite painfully slow.


I've tried switching to using profile to load multiple instance of firefox up so i can reduce downtime in restarting. Also the only way to store multiple window on restart is to use task manager to kill firefox.exe first.

there is no plug-in catagory
