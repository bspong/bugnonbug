If you save a file (say, an image) a a certain file type (say, a JPEG), but change the name of the file you are saving in the save a dialog (say, "imagename.jpg" to "Some Image Name"), the file type is lost even though the dialog claim the file is being saved a the indicated file type.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://interfacelift.com/wallpaper_beta/D14a0fe3/02175_illuminated_2560x1600.jpg
2. Right click
3. Save Image As...
4. Actual file name is displayed in the save a dialog: 02175_illuminated_2560x1600.jpg
5. I want a different name, so select all, change it to "photo"
6. Notice that the file type is still shown a jpeg in the dialog box.
7. Click save
8. File appears in the correct location with the given name, but without the appropriate extension. OS X display the file a an unknown file type. You must manually add the file extension back to open it through the Finder.
9. For comparison, choose another program and do the same thing. The file type information will almost certainly be preserved. For example, you can do the same thing to a Word document, and even if you wipe out the .doc in the file name in the dialog box, a .doc file is still saved.
Actual Results:
Files saved without the extension explicitly in the name are saved a unknown file types, rather than a the indicated file type.

Expected Results:
The extension should be added onto the name, although the attribute to display the file type could be hidden. The file should always be saved a the type indicated in the dialog box.
