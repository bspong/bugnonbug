This may be related to the infrastructure of new zoom feature:

I use babylon pro a my dictionary and it capture the word to be translated when i press ctrl+rightclick on the word. This feature work in everywhere (IE, notepad, word, most of pdf files) and used to work in older version (2.x) of firefox.

When a word is ctrl+rightclicked sometimes the next word or a nonsense character like double quote (") / single quote (') is captured.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Obtain a babylon-pro trial and install.
2. Open a web page with firefox
3. ctrl+rightclick on some word to translate and see the word is not captured.
4. Try the same with firefox 2.x or IE and see the word is captured correctly.
Actual Results:
sometimes the next word or a nonsense character like double quote (") / single quote (') is captured.

Expected Results:
ctrl+rightclicked word should be captured.
