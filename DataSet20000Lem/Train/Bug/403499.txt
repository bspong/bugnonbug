The text cursor is not always visible in toolbar search fields, even when the field ha focus. This bug applies to Firefox add-on toolbars like Google and Yahoo. It appears to be a Windows Vista-specific problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the Firefox browser on a Windows Vista PC with the Aero interface enabled.
2. Install the Google or Yahoo toolbar on the Firefox browser.
3. Click on the Google or Yahoo toolbar seach text field.

Actual Results:
The text cursor is visible only when one or more character ha been typed and the mouse cursor is still hovering over the text field. If the mouse cursor is moved off of the text field, the text cursor disappears, even though the text field still ha focus.

Expected Results:
The toolbar text cursor should be visible a long a the field ha focus, regardless of whether the field contains text, or whether mouse cursor is over the field.

This bug is reproducable on Windows Vista with the Aero interface. I haven't tried to reproduce it with the Aero interface disabled.
