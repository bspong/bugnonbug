Setting enableHighAccuracy to true and false in geolocation API randomly cause location is undefined error
User-Agent: Opera/9.80 (X11; Linux x86_64; U; en) Presto/2.6.30 Version/10.60
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100628 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.6

Enabling and disabling high accuracy option with W3C's Geolocation API enableHighAccuracy for navigator.geolocation.watchPosition() function cause following error in Firefox 3.6.6 in Ubuntu 10.04:

Error: location is undefined
Source File: file:///usr/lib/firefox-3.6.6/components/NetworkGeolocationProvider.js
Line: 91

If I don't change the accuracy request during browser's lifetime, I always get some location result. I have tested this on 3 machine with 3 different operating systems. With Ubuntu 10.04, Firefox 3.6.6 and Wlan enabled this happens. On Mac OS X Snow Leopard and Firefox 3.6.6 I had to disable Wlan to get this happen more easily. With Debian testing and IceWeasel 3.6.4 I only have IP based location searching and this is also easy to induce. All error point to line 91 in NetworkGeolocationProvider.js on every machine. Restarting Firefox help to alleviate this problem until a few reloads but after this error ha happened, I need to restart Firefox to get it working again.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://uguu.no-ip.org/geo.html with Wlan disabled, if necessary.
2. Reload page a few time until you get timeout message (wait for 30 seconds).
3. Error console should have "location is undefined" error pointing to line 91 in NetworkGeolocationProvider.js

Actual Results:
Sometimes I get my location and after this error happens, I need to restart Firefox to get my location again.

Expected Results:
Geolocation API should not crash and it should give some kind of a location.
