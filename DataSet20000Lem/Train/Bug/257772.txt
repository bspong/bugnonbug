If you load a page with a favicon, this favicon will be shown in the URL adress
field. Rightclick on an image on the page and select View Image. When you, after
viewing the image, click "back", the favicon is not reloaded and instead
substituted by the standard icon and will not re-appear during the session.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://www.zedcon.se - note the b/w favicon in the URL address field.
2. Rightclick on the upper left image and select View Image.
3. View the image in the browser (same window) and click "Back" in browser.
4. The previous page is relodaed but the favicon is reset to standard.

Actual Results:
I have to clear the cache and then reload the page in order to get the favicon
back in the URL address field.

Expected Results:
Show the favicon each time a page with proper tag for favicons is reloaded.

The bug is trivial, but may be at least little important for web publisher who
want their site to be unique and have choosen a favicon of their own....
