Slow page loading in version .13: slower then in the previous version

Hello,
I just upgraded to Firefox 3.0.13 and having a problem loading webpages.The data doesn't seem to stop loading. The mouse is in the sand clock mode. The status bar say this:
Transferring data from b.staticlak.fbcdn.net

Or this:
Read i.ytimng.com

Is anyone else experiencing this?

I tried www.youtube.com/oksanakoval


After first 10 or so attempt the page finally loaded and appeared to work faster. But it took a lot of persistance. Though it is nearly impossible to load the videos.

I also experience slow loading when I tried:
www.facebook.com
www.watchdogsblog.com
www.incea.org
http://news.google.com
mail.yahoo.com

Result: sand clock + transferring data taking minutex vs. second in the previous version of Firefox.

I restarted my computer (twice), it didn't help.


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Result: sand clock + transferring data taking minutex vs. second in the previous version of Firefox. The page eventually loads, but most user would not be so patient to wait that long..

Expected Results:
Load page fast: within 3 second
