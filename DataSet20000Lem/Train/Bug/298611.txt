If you open a mailto link in another tab, there are some sometimes predictable
and sometimes random problem with it.

First Case (reproducibility: always)
1) open the mailto in another tab
2) close the new mail window
3) move to the new tab
4) attempt to close
^^^ I wa unable to close the tab by clicking on the default "close tab X
button", "ctrl-w", or "right clicking the tab and hitting 'close tab'"

Second Case (reproducibility: sometimes)
1) open a mailto in a new tab
2) navigate to the new tab (ignore the new mail window)
3) attempt to close the new tab (before closing the new mail window)
^^^ sometimes it doesn't work... sometimes it doe work

Third Case (reproducibility: sometimes)
1) open a mailto in a new tab
2) navigate to the new tab
3) close the new mail window
4) attempt to close the new tab


NOTE:
sometimes after you get a "stuck" tab, if you change tab and come back to it
you can close it.

Reproducible: Sometimes
