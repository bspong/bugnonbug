r stuck forever after a while (live bookmark loading...)

Using Firefox 3.0b1, with my migrated profile from Firefox 2, I use several r feeds.
I'm using a laptop so I often :
- change of network (using wifi, lan, home, work,..)
- hibernate without stopping Firefox

Firefox 2 doesn't have this problem.
At Firefox Startup, feed are working and update.
After a while, feed stop to work
At this moment, I've got 3 feed stuck

Slashdot :
http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot
and 2 security focus :
http://www.securityfocus.com/rss/vulnerabilities.xml
and
http://www.securityfocus.com/rss/news.xml

The first entry is "Marque page dynamique en cours de chargement" (in English, Live bookmark loading)

I can't click on this (bug 278247 is about forcing a refresh in this case)

The following entry are clickable and contains real stuff but in fact it is very old content (on the slashdot r feed, I see content from several day ago !)

I have reliby 1.2.0 installed (was also installed with firefox 2.0)
It used to reload all the r feed
when the r are stuck, it doesn't work.

At the moment, I still have one of the r working while 3 others are stuck
I have already seen this r stuck.

r stucks seems to be the one with content regularly updated.

So I think something with the r loading regressed between firefox 2 and 3

I don't know if it's related but I see error message related to the stuck feed in the javascript console :
For exemple :
urchinTracker is not defined http://slashdot.org/ Line : 2687


Reproducible: Always
