History DB page title are displayed corrupt in url bar autocomplete, endian problem turn Latin character into Chinese
Strings stored in history.dat are stored a UCS2. This includes page titles. history.dat is supposed to have a native endianness, set when the file is created or reset. When using a history.dat file whose native endianness doe not match the host architecture's endianness, existing page title in the database are not being swapped (or are double-swapped?) for display in the url bar autocomplete. This result in corrupt page title being displayed in the history autocomplete dropdown.

Although byte aren't swapped when reading from history.dat, they are swapped a needed when writing to it. This mean that if you have a history.dat file set a other-endian, even new page you visit will wind up with bad page title being displayed. Other read from history seem unaffected: the Go menu and history sidebar do not have corrupt text.

This will affect people who had run Firefox under Rosetta on x86 and switch to a native version, people who migrate from a ppc to x86 and copy their profile (or have their profile copied by a migration assistant), and people who wish to flip Rosetta on and off to use plugins that haven't yet been ported to x86.

This wa fixed for Core:History in bug 108134. The byte-swapping code is still in the toolkit history implementation, we need to find out why the swap don't happen (or happen twice?) during read from history for url bar autocomplete display.
