When opening some audio or video file in a browser window with other content but not the direct video or audio link the browser is fine. But when I get the direct file such a http://media.ebaumsworld.com/dirtyturban.mp3 the window freeze and say that I don't have quicktime which I don't anymore. I want this stuff to open up in window medium player in the browser or open the file up in window medium on my computer. When it give me the error that I don't have it it cause me to close all mozilla window I have open.

Sometimes this error doesn't happen like in this file it didn't

If you were able to just make it to where quicktime is the default program to use when opening these file you could fix it. Maybe there could be a small patch to download instead of a new version of the program.
