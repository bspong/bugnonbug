B) Set layout.css.devPixelsPerPx -> 1.2
2. Open new firefox window, open 6 tab in it.
3. Pin the first 5 tabs, click the 6th tab (to make it active).

STR_2:
1. Set DPI -> 125% :
A) Set that DPI level -> 125% in your OS [OR]
B) Set layout.css.devPixelsPerPx -> 1.25
2. Open new firefox window, open 6 tab in it.

Result: [screenshot 1] Pinned tab separator are sometimes too thick. Bug 1189212 isn't fixed
Expectations: Pinned tab separator should have normal width

Note: How could one _EVER_ hope to fix that on all possible HiDPI level by changing border-width?!
The root of the problem is wrong border scaling on zoom / transform:scale()
(see bug 477157 / bug 890383). Well, there IS a way to avoid fixing that bug: the devs could
handle all possible DPI level separately, setting appropriate border-width in each case.
But that sound really bad.
