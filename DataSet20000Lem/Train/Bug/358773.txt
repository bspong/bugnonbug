I am unsure if this is a bug or more just a symptom of memory leak. Firefox 2 nearly immediately cause a 50 degree increase in temperature on the Macbook. I had been plagued by the random shutdown that Apple recently released a firmware update to address this. 4 day later and no shutdowns. I have a temp monitor app running in the menubar and after upgrading to Firefox 2, Firefox is nearly unusable after about an hour of useage. It run slow, it open page slow and the temp of the machine reach 180-190 degrees. If run SMCFanControl wide open at 6200 RPM it still run that hot. However, if I shut down Firefox, the temp plummet to 130-140 degree using Safari. That is the range Firefox 1.5 operated at. If I run SMCFanControl, the temp will fall even further. At first, I thought it wa the new firmware from Apple, but the temp only go that high with Firefox 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a temp monitor application in MacOSX 10.4 on Macbook
2. Launch Firefox 2
3. After about 1 minute, temp jump to 180+ without surfing or any other application open
4. Close Firefox 2 and about 1 minute later, drop back to 125-130 degree range.




I assume this is a memory leak problem or perhaps related to problem with the Macbook the are already well documented. Never encountered this with Firefox 1.5, but this happens everytime and without any other application open in Firefox 2.
