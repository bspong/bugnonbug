I played with the open-source weblog system WordPress translated to Hebrew, and suddenly I found this bug.
I removed all of the irrelevant code and try to make the code smaller.
Software crash after clicking the left key on the keyboard.
Totally closed.
If I run firefox from the terminal it say "Segmentation fault" and then close immediatly.
This bug is very annoying and cause me to loose data I have wrote for more than a hour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter the link I gave here
2. Press on the input box using the mouse
3. Press on the left key on the keyboard
Actual Results:
Software crash and closed.
In the terminal it say "Segmentation fault"

Expected Results:
moved to the next character in the text, or do nothing if there is no text inside the input box
