Slow performance and large places.sqllite

Over a period of week or month I've noticed Firefox getting progressively slower. Today I traced the problem to the presence of a 144M "places.sqllite" in my default profile. Removing/renaming this immediately restored performance to normal level a did creating a new clean profile.

I have a zip of the profile but it's rather large - 16M (unpacks to about 150M). Not sure if you'd want me to attach it here.

With this profile what I noted wa slow performance opening file:// URLs under a specific path file:///C:/starteam/Construction/software/BPTM/BPTMPresentation/code/source/com/bt/util/logging/presentation/*. I could dramatically improve performance by changing any part of that path, e.g. move the file to file:///C:/starteam/Construction/software/BPTM/BPTMPresentation/code/source/com/bt/util/logging/presentationXXX/ or file:///C:/starteam/Construction/software/BPTM/BPTMPresentation/code/source/comXXX/bt/util/logging/presentation/. So my guess is that there are a lot of duplicate database key record matching that first path or something like that that's resulting in heavy database activity.

The slowing ha the nature of occasional pause of a couple of seconds.

Reproducible: Always




If there's sufficient interest in this I can try to prepare a test case and/or attach the zipped profile here.
