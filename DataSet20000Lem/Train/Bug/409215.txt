Closing tab quickly in succession cause the close button to "get stuck" (Minefield 3.0pre3, browser.tabs.closeButtons = 1)

When I want to close a lot of tabs, but not all of them, I typically just hit the close button really quickly (FF automatically highlight the next tab, which then expose the close button, so I basically click in the close button of the rightmost tab).

This ha worked fine in a trunk build from Dec. 05, but a of the trunk build of the 16th, when I attempt to rapidly close two tab by this method, the first one close but the second doe not respond to the button click (the "depressed" icon is shown when it is clicked, but it fails to close).

Ctrl+W still work rapidly in the same circumstance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have browser.tabs.closeButtons = 1
2. Open around 10 tab in a new window (hold Ctrl+T is a good way to get this)
3. Repeatedly click (quickly) in the close button of the (currently) active tab: this will close the current tab and attempt to close the other tab -- n.b. you should not move your mouse pointer, let the tab and their close button come to your cursor
4. Note that the second tab refuse to close, unless you wait between click -- seems to be a double-click event which isn't working
Actual Results:
Continually clicking the second tab's close button fails to close the tab.

I suspect this may be a misfired double-click or something similar.

Expected Results:
The second tab and all subsequent tab (until the close button is no longer at the very right) are closed.
