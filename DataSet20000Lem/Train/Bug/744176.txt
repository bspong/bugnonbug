Steps to reproduce:

Browsing an image gallery on a website, clicking Next to move from picture to picture.
Firefox wa using about 400 MB of memory, after about 10-15 picture viewed, clicking on Next to get the next picture.


Actual results:

About half way into the page load it started to use more and more memory until about 10-15 second later it stopped at about 1.5 GB of memory.
It's now at 1.5 GB and slowly increase by about 200 KB/s.

Oh I'm not sure if it matter but after this memory increase the status bar wa saying on the page that triggered it "connecting to [url]..." - not sure if the domain wa unresponsive or it wa a consequence of this issue.


This happened once again a few hour earlier but the trigger wa simply clicking on Full Screen button of a Youtube video, Then, it went up to 2.3 GB of memory or so and after about 30 second of freezing, it went back to 300-400 MB of memory usage.

I managed to open a new tab and entered about:memory - I'm attaching here the "more verbose" text dump. When it happened for the first time, I used "Save a page" but no text wa saved, so I just selected all text and pasted it into Notepad this time.


Expected results:

Not get tab frozen or memory go up by 1 GB and stay there...
