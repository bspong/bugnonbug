When you type in your Master Password you see it a a stars, so it's
hard to get know what is the current keyboard layout is chosen. That
lead to more mistake caused by writing password in the wrong layout.
Showing password with plain text (not a a stars) is insecure.
The only way - is to look at the windows' language bar/language
indicator, but what if a user, in order to save some screen space,
disabled showing the whole window taskbar or is browsing the Internet
using Firefox in a full-screen mode (F11)?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press F11
2. Do something to make firefox show you an "enter master password" prompt.
3. Play a game trying to guess which is current layout, since all the entered symbol are shown a wildcards and there is no layout indicator. So in case you have 3 (or even more) layout enabled in your system - this game will take a long.
Actual Results:
You will make many attempt trying to enter the correct password.

Expected Results:
Current keyboard layout indicator should be drawn, so you'll easily type your master password correctly from the 1st time.

Another "who the hell will fix this?" bug.
This time I bet that at least 6 year will pas until it get fixed. (Or cheat like "WONTFIX" will be applied.)
