If the bookmarkbackups/ directory in your profile is unreadable (not chmod +r), Firefox will crash on startup.

If it is readable, even if it's not writable or executable, it won't crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. chmod 000 bookmarkbackups/
2. Start Firefox
Actual Results:
Firefox crash

Expected Results:
Firefox would start up normally, though it certainly wouldn't make a backup of bookmarks.html.

Standard Firefox nightly, empty profile.

It wa also confirmed on a trunk CVS build by Mook in #firefox.

Here's what he had to say about what cause it:

<Mook> http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/bookmarks/src/nsBookmarksService.cpp#4395 backupFileNames.mImpl is null
<Mook> strange, hasMoreElements is 0...
<Mook> hmm, existingBackups->mRawPtr is null
<Mook> Peng: file it a http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/bookmarks/src/nsBookmarksService.cpp#4377 existingBackups need a null check.
<Mook> Of course, you probably know better than I do :)
<Mook> well, existingBackups is null, so http://lxr.mozilla.org/mozilla/source/browser/components/bookmarks/src/nsBookmarksService.cpp#4383 crash due to dereferencing a null nsCOMPtr.

That's mostly over my head, of course. :P
