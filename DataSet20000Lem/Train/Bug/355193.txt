I am trying to set the src attribute of an img to a very long string (a data:URI) and then save the document's html to a file.
The new data URI attribute appear fine only up to about 1-2kb (I haven't found the exact limit) but for attribute of more than 4kb all that appears is: src=
(without even quotes).
This is running from inside an extension; manually setting a long (>10kb) attribute from the j console update the image properly, but in it property window a blank source appears (unlike for shorter attributes).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.set the src of an image to a long (>10kb) data URI
2.for comparison, set the src of an image to a short (<1kb) data URI
3.save the inner html of the document to a file
4.open the file and view the source...

Actual Results:
the src of the short data URI appears
the src of the long data URI is empty

Expected Results:
the src of the long data URI should have appeared fully
