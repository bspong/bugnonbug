It happens on some Facebook Games I play (most annoying on Treasure Isle). On some game all the time and on some other game it happens not at all.

I load up the game, which is flash-based. Then the loading of icon and item ingames begin to stuck, in other words, they aren't loading. At this point I cannot change between tab with a mouseclick.

Now come the scary part ... if I open a tab through hotkey STRG+T some of the missing thing ingame will load, but then it will break down again, until I open another tab through hotkey.

I played around with a bit and found a better workaround for keep on playing ... drag the FF window around or resizing it. You can literally see the stuff loading if you drag the window around.

Only happens since FF4 b7 and any version of Flash Player, latest FF 3.6 version work normally.

Guess it's a bug in combination of bad game scripting + flash player dumbness and out-of-process plugin handling.
