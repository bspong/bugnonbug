Whenever I use firefox and click anywhere on a webpage, a blinking text editing cursor appears a if I'm viewing the page in a Word document. The text isn't edited, but when I try to press the down-arrow to scroll down, the cursor just move down to the line under it (still, a if the web page were a word document); needle to say, the scrolling is difficult and annoying. Pressing page down is mostly useless; on most pages, the page snap back to wherever the cursor is whenever I press PgDn.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Opened FireFox browser.
2. Clicked anywhere on the webpage
3. Blinking cursor is permanently shown on that page; scrolling is more difficult
Actual Results:
The same thing happened.

Expected Results:
When a blank space on a page is clicked, the blinking line normally doesn't show up. The page should normally scroll easily and not behave like Notepad or a Word document.
