option marked a selected doe not get selected in drop down when selected="value"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Whenever a dropdown is coded a :

<select name="testselect">
<option value="1">First option</option>
<option value="2">Second option</option>
<option value="3">Third option</option>
<option selected="selected" value="4">Fourth option</option>
</select>

The fourth option doe not appear a selected in the webpage. Instead the first
option appears a selected.

The selected="selected" (or some other value instead of the word selected for
the attribute's value) cause the problem.

From searching the web I have found that FireFox 0.8 worked correctly (although
I have not confirmed this). It doe not work in 0.9

Firefox need to be able to accept an value for this attribute - even though it
is not standard HTML) because several of dynamic language automatically code
this into the page (one example: ASP.NET)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a select box and mark an option other than the first option with the
attribute selected="somevalue"
2. Open the web page
3. The first option will be selected regardless of which option ha this
selected attribute present

Actual Results:
First option wa selected

Expected Results:
indicated option should have been selected
