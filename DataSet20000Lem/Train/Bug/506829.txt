Firefox 3.0.12 doesn't render certain graphic at the noted website.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I can't use build 3.5.1 at this time due to another "bug", and had to keep 3.0.11. When I upgraded 3.0.11 to 3.0.12, certain graphic at the above-noted website no longer render correctly, or disappear entirely, so I've downgraded back to 3.0.11. In order to simplify matters, I will only provide *one* example of a 3.0.12 incompatibility "bug" with the Askville website.
