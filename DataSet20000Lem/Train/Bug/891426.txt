Firefox becomes extremely slow or non responsive since upgrading to v22.0 (20130618035212)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130618035212

Steps to reproduce:

I had approximately3-5 window open with lot of tab on my MacBook Pro v10.8.4, and all of a sudden I wa unable to navigate anywhere else, whether it wa Firefox or a different app. It simply took a long time to navigate between the Firefox tab or Windows, but once I wa able to get to another application it quickly worked a it should




Actual results:

I checked Activity Monitor and saw Firefox wa using about 43% CPU, while Firefox (I believe it was) Add-ons wa using about 40%.

I closed each tab, then each Firefox window. It took anywhere from 10 to 45 second to close each of the Firefox tab & windows. I closed whatever other apps I had open including Mail app. I then rebooted by Mac

This ha happened about 3-4 time since I upgraded to v22. I only checked Activity Monitor on the first time it happened.

I didn't have this problem before I upgraded to v22.


Expected results:

Navigation between Firefox tabs/windows should happen quickly
