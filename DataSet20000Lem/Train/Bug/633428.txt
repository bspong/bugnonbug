When restoring a 3-windows session, some toolbar button disappear on some window
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b11) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b11

I customized firefox' navigation toolbar; I dragged the search term highlighter and search word from my google toolbar to the right of firefox' search box on the navigation bar (and hidden google's toolbar). When I close my 3-windows session and restart firefox, 2 window restore with the correct customization, and 1 with the default firefox navigation toolbar layout. It reproduces consistently.

This look like a firefox issue rather than a google toolbar issue, since i'd expect firefox to restore customized button consistently across windows.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install google toolbar
2. open up 3 or more firefox window
3. search for anything, see the search term in google toolbar
4. customize toolbars, drag search highlight tool and search term from google toolbar to firefox navigation bar
5. hide google toolbar
6. restart firefox
7. button do not restore correctly and consistently across firefox window



I tried disabling all addons and extension but google toolbar, still reproduces.
I erased the file in my profile directory holding the user settings, which reset all toolbars to the default (i forget it name), started off from a "clean slate", didn't help either.
