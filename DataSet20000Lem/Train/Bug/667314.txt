According to an acquaintance, this also occurred in 4.x, and may be present in the current 6.x/7.x development version a well.

A "non-responsive script" warning may sometimes also be given, in which case stopping the script will recover the browser's operation. If this doesn't happen, however, the only way to solve it is killing the app.
This script error point to browser.js @ line 3929
