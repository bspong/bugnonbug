In my website I have a menu that hide and show with a javascript function that us setTimeout to create an animation of the image. When my page wa empty and only the menu wa present, all ran ok in Safari, Camino and Firefox but while I wa writing text in the page, the menu got slower and slower and I discover that if I use text-align: justify in that block of text it get really slow... consuming almost the 90% of the CPU. If the quantity of text increase and it aligned with "align: justify" it get slower and slower. I dont know why. My script is quite simple.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox and Safari
1. Go to http://www.charlos.net on both browser
2. Click in the link that say "menu" at the top of the page.
Actual Results:
You will see that in Firefox the menu show and hide very slowly but in Safari it doe it at normal speed.

Expected Results:
Normal speed in both browsers.

I have tested in Firefox 3 beta and this bug ha gone. I dont really know what wa it.
