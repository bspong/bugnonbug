Video swf is embedded in an html file and called to an iframe. If mouse is moved anywhere the movie interrupt to the point of complete pause if movement is continuous.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the site (my site test page)
2. Click link in left side bar "Emily Movie" or Bobbi Movie"
3. When video plays, move the mouse anywhere OUTSIDE of the video.
Actual Results:
If mouse is moved anywhere (except over the movie)the movie interrupt to the point of complete pause if movement is continuous.

Expected Results:
The movie should play smoothly. When mouse is stationary, it doe not flicker/pause.

I built the site in Dreamweaver Pro 8 Suite,

Since IE& run it a expected, I suspect something in the FireFox doe not like this. I run a Javasripted slide show in the same iframe, but I pulled the html file with the video and tested opening a new window and experienced same error.

Thanks for help
