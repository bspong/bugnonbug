The primary navigation of our site us a float and clear technique with Z-index, but on Ubuntu only the browser incorrectly render the navigation layout after the first page load.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.8) Gecko/20100214 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.8) Gecko/20100214 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When you first enter the site you will notice that the "Shop" button appears normal, (for example if you enter the site directly by entering the URL, or are referred to the index page directly from another site or search engine). Once you refresh or navigate to a new page, however, the button sag lower than the rest of the navigation, even if it is the active button. It is still accessible, but definitely annoying and different. I confirmed that this is a bug by viewing the site in the other Ubuntu browser Epiphany.
May have something to do with the font embedding?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Direct entry to the site yield a correct layout a presented by the Firefox on Windows.
2. Simply choose another page to navigate too.
Actual Results:
The last button in the navigation seems to be pushed down by the cart. But no amount of CSS can correct this, and that would only mess it up on other browsers.

Expected Results:
The navigation should be consistently lined up like in other browser and Firefox on Windows. So long a it is not the active page.
