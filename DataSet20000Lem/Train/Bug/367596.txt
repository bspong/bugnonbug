Create about:support page with troubleshooting information (e.g. list of extensions)
As discussed at <http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/browse_frm/thread/93d5c6843e14c2fd>...

Most user don't provide enough information about their setup, and we need to fish it out of them. In many cases, we need to know what extension are installed, and there's no way to simply copy and paste that info into a support post (They would need the info-lister extension). If I need a user to do something in their profile folder (eg. restore a bookmark backup file), I can point them to a web page that list the default locations, but the web page can't list the exact path for that specific user.

As a method of improving user support tools, it would be nice if we (support volunteers) could direct user to a single about: page, that listed all the info a user need for user support; and create a "Copy my support info" button on that page.

Originally intended a a way improving the about: page, it may be better to put this on a new 'about' URL. (about:support, about:setup, etc.)

Filed under Firefox:General, but if this could be done in the Toolkit, and make it so Thunderbird user could also utilize a support info-lister, that would be twice a nice. :-)

Some info that it would include:
- version
- user-agent sting
- installed add-on (and their version numbers)
- installed plug-in (and their version numbers)
- profile location
- and maybe the cache location
