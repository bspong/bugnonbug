Firefox process key event too much.
Hello,

Windows XP.
Firefox 3.0.1.
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; fr; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

I have isolated and reproduced two bug scenarios:
A Firefox window listens to some key event(s). In another window, I press some keys, which get finely processed: they close the window. So now the front window is the eager Firefox window. She process the key events. But she must not process them, they are not for this window. They have already been processed, correctly, by the other window.

Scenario 1:

1.1. I open My Computer, with Windows Pause.
1.2. I create a new Firefox window, by clicking Firefox in Quick Launch. It is maximized. I go to www.toknowmore.net/e/1/javascript/javascript-onkeyup.php .
1.3. I click on "Touch this".
1.4. I press A. The dialog jumps. OK. I click OK.
1.5. In the task bar, I click on the window My Computer.
1.6. I press Control W. The window My Computer closes. Fine. The story must stop here, but it doe not: the eager Firefox window incorrectly think that Control and W were for her too. So she display the dialog, twice!

Scenario 2:

2.1. I create a new Firefox window. It is maximized. I go to www.toknowmore.net/e/1/javascript/javascript-onkeyup.php .
2.2. I click on "Touch this".
2.3. I press A. The dialog jumps. OK. I click OK.
2.4. Menu File: New window. The new Firefox window appears, maximized.
2.5. I press Control W. The new Firefox window closes. Fine. The story must stop here, but it doe not: the eager Firefox window incorrectly think that Control and W were for her too. So she display the dialog, twice!

The problem is a data loss issue: the Web page can process the Return key which wa not for her, and clear a form or erase data.

The problem is a security issue: the Web page can process the Return key which wa not for her, and confirm a shopping order or a bank transfer.

Thanks for correcting that,

Nicolas
