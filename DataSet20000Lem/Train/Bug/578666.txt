OK Just today i got onto Firefox 3.6.5 and it wa fine, got off then got back on and the search bar wa gone, WTF? So i restarted Firefox and the LOCATION BAR wa gone too!. Now i don't mean it not there, the space where it should be is there, but the bar itself isn't. So i tried updating to the current 4.0 beta build. SAME PROBLEM. I cant see tab ether. I tried using Google chrome but it give me the kill page when i try to load any web page. I'm using the messed up Firefox atm and it hard to use without tab and knowing where you are. Here are some screenshots:
