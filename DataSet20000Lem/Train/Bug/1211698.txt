Sync Error.jpg

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20150929144111

Steps to reproduce:

I have a firexfox sync account. I declined to login.


Actual results:

Over the course of a day or two firefox filled my whole browser window with one line sync error messages, stacked one on top of the other. "Sync encountered an error while syncing: Incorrect account name or password. Syncy will automatically retry this action."
I did not enter any sync password. Nontheless, sync repeatedly tried to login and each time added another error message on top of the one before.
P.S. I had deleted about 2/3 of the error message before I snapped the enclosed jpg.


Expected results:

Maybe, one error message.
Furthermore, I don't login very much because every time I quit Firefox I need to log-in to sync again, and my password wallet program (Roboform) doe not recognize the Firefox login window.
It would make sense to require a login each time if Bookmark sync were a high security service such a a bank, brokerage, etc. This is not the case.
Firefox should at least offer the option of storing the login and password in an encrypted form on the hard drive somewhere( i.e. the registry, the app folder) and allowing automatic login when the program start up.
