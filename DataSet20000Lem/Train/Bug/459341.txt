For the past couple of years, since my switch from IE to FireFox, I have always made sure the check box next to "Change Status Bar Text" in the advanced Javascript options. However, since FireFox v.3.0.0 or 3.0.1 (not exactly certain) but certainly since 3.0.2 I get no email address when I hover over the sender part of my email. I have unclicked and reclicked several times, rebooted several times, nothing reactivates my hovering info in the Status Bar. This problem is both in IE and Firefox occurs both on my laptop and on my work computer (same systems) and versions. I have also tested mail.yahoo.com, but the hover function in yahoo.mail produce an info bubble so it's not comparable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click tools/options/advanced javascript, click "Change Status Bar Text"
2.Go to netaddress.net, open inbox and hover over over email contact.
3.Nothing change in the Status Bar so I'm unable to hover/read over my email
Actual Results:
Nothing, whether the box is checked or not, email do not show in taskbar

Expected Results:
With box checked, I would see actual email address
