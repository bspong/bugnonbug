When using Virtual Desktop Managers with multiple Firefox window open in different workspaces, moving between workspace cause some of the Firefox widow to disappear. I believe the window size and position (x,y) ha gone to 0. The window can be maximized and minimized, but nothing in between. If I try to "Size" the window from the right-click context window on the taskbar, the "re-size crosshair" appears at the 0,0 x,y location of my screen (this is why I think the window size and position are = 0). This ha been happening for year (many version of firefox) but seems to occur much more often now. I have used different Virtual Desktop Managers, but currently use Microsoft's "MSVDM".

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open multiple firefox window in different virtual desktop
2.move between the desktop
3.at some point, one of the Firefox window will disappear


Expected Results:
??. Not disappeared. :)

I looked through the about:config value for a "browser.minimum.size" (or some equivalent) but did not find anything relevant. Not all window "play nice" with virtual desktop but most do. I have tried some of the "size" plug-in (like Firesizer) hoping that it would force the minimum size, but that did not help. This issue happens a couple of time a day to my system and when I have 10-15 tab per window becomes annoying. I have looked for better (lower level) windows-resizing software but have not found anything that had helped yet. I am willing to help (i.e. a it happens a lot on my system, I can run any information gathering apps you have) to gather troubleshooting information.
