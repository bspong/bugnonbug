Firefox 3.6 RC1/2 ha a problem with the forum on avforums.com. I have about 30 tab open from about 20 different site but when i try switching between tab on avforums.com the displayed page doesn't update, you need to scroll up and down for the content to be refreshed. Restarting firefox fix this problem but if you use firefox for a few hour this will likely happen again (assuming you have "show my window and tab from last time" enabled), this ha happened every day for the last few day for me, it only affect this website for me, all other website except that work fine.

Here is a video to demonstrate the problem: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AObZ3rtbNjI
