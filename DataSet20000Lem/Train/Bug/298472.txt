Long string of random character have display issues. In the example page the
string wrap without a newline, so the page render looking like there wa a
printer jam (the wrapped text appears on the same line a the unwrapped text).
By decreasing the length of the DNA sequence it's possible to get it so the
line doe not appear at all (though view->source show that the string is still
there, just not being displayed) Possibly related to bug 280104, where long
string are not displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to view a page consisting of a long string of random character (example
included)
Actual Results:
The second half of the text (wrapped text) appeared on the same line a the
first half.

Expected Results:
Either the line should not have wrapped or it should have wrapped on a second line.

I checked this on Suse 9.3 and Redhat with the same results. On window there
were also display issue but not identical one (the line wa not displayed but
appeared when text wa highlighted)
