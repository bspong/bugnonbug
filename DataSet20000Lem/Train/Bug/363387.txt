The location of the mouse is the tip of the arrow. But when I move the tip of the arrow to a place just above the tab border, a click there still register a being on the tab (so the tab becomes active). Even more crucial: when I move the mouse to an area on the tab slightly above the tab close button, I can click to close the tab.

However, if I try this on the toolbar buttons, I notice that the button is highlighted only when the tip of the mouse pointer is on the button. This is how it should be.

Reproducible: Always
