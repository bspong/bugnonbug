Incorrect link colors, weird hover behavior, underline borked

I've run across a puzzling problem with link color in Firefox 3. I've seen it in a couple of different places, but the test case I'm referring to here is at:

http://instructors.cwrl.utexas.edu/

The page at that location validates to XHTML 1.0 Transitional, and ha valid CSS 2.1. The link color are behaving oddly. The style sheet say that the link should be color #CC5600, which is a light orange. But when I load the page, some of them are showing up a #0056CC -- the red and blue value have been flipped, and so the link come out blue. But not all of them are affected. Here's a screenshot:

My first thought wa that there must be a conflicting style rule somewhere which is selectively setting the link color to #0056CC. But I checked, and there's not. The page ha seven style sheets, and none of them contain the text "#0056CC". The color might have been specified using rgb notation, that is a rgb(0, 86, 204), so I checked for that too -- but none of the stylesheets contain any rgb() notation at all.

The link sometimes change color on hovering, and sometimes do not. I've identified two distinct sequence of events. The first work like this:

1) I move my mouse over one of the affected links;
2) The link turn the correct orange, and ha an orange underline;
3) I move my mouse off the link onto an area of the document which is NOT a link;
4) The link remains orange.

The second work like this:

1) I move my mouse over one of the affected links;
2) The link turn the correct orange, and ha an orange underline;
3) I move my mouse off the affected link onto one of the unaffected link immediately below it, without passing over any non-link portion of the document;
4) The link reverts to blue;
5) I move my mouse back onto the affected link without passing over any other section of the document;
6) The affected link REMAINS blue, but ha an orange underline;
7) I move my mouse off the affected link;
8) It turn orange again.

When the affected link is orange, I can move my mouse on-and-off it and it'll stay orange, a long a I don't hit any other link. BUT, if I scroll the page down so the link go off screen, and then scroll back, then they revert to blue. If I switch tab and come back, they revert to blue. Some more screenshots:

And a if that's not weird enough, I've observed the same behavior in Opera 9.5, but not in IE 7 or in Safari 3.1. It make me wonder whether there's something wrong with the OS -- Win XP, fully updated, running under Bootcamp on two different set of Mac hardware, both recent iMac machines. I've got a hundred and fifty machine showing this behavior -- but when I tested with Firefox 3 on other computers, like my Win XP laptop or my dual-boot Ubuntu/XP box at home, it work just fine. It's only affecting the mirror we use at my workplace to maintain identical workstation across several classrooms/labs. As I wa submitting this bug, I noticed that it also affects:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi

As you can see here:

I note that all the affected link in both Bugzilla and my test page are link inside H2 elements. Could that have something to do with it?

At this point I have three theories:

1) Something about my install of Win XP is borked, and it's affecting Opera and Firefox 3, but not Firefox 2 or any other web browser.

2) There's some sort of weird interaction with Bootcamp which is causing it.

3) Evil pixies.

I don't know what else to do to diagnose the problem. Bug 424249 look similar, but it look a though they thought it wa fixed.

Has anyone else come across this? It's driving me nuts. I've had student commenting on how weird it is that the hover color don't behave consistently, and it irritates me every time I have to look at it.
