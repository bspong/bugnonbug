case of the p00fing browser

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.load that url
2.or other one in the parent directory..
3.http://dsl-cda-411.icehouse.net/tutortools/

note, one or two of these actually work in Internet Explorer on window 98 and
window XP

Actual Results:
click on link, and P00f

(note, instead of dsl-cda-411.icehouse.net , I had it a localhost)

Expected Results:
render the page possibly... but error message saying that it came across a
horrible error is ok too...

anything but die die die.. actually die die die isn't that bad... well die die
die is better than what I think happened...



possible security breach...

Note,

flashplayer.xpt javaplugin_oji.so libjavaplugin_oji.so libnullplugin.sox
nppdf.so
java2 libflashplayer.so libnullplugin.so mplayerplug-in.so
npsqueak.so

are the plugins installed on my computer... I suspect that mplayerplug-in could
be part of the problem...

I would guess that most crash are also security problems... but I have no idea
how to exploit it further than a crash, so I don't think it qualifies
