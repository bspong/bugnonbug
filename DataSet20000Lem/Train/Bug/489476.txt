When I tried to sign up for an account at Passaporte Abril (by the way, today is not April 1st), it didn't work three time on Firefox, but it worked on Internet Explorer.

When I had tried to sign up for account on other sites, sometimes, according to Firefox, an email or password copied and pasted from one field to an other (probably email and emailconfirmation or password and passwordconfirmation) wa unequal.


There are really odd thing going on with my browser!


I installed and uninstalled many extension including some Tab Extensions and I read that a Tab extension wa not compatible with an other Tab Extension. I'm wondering if that is the problem.

Also, I backed up and restored my default Firefox profile with MozBackup and it is taking a long time to back up the extensions. I think it started taking a long time after I installed Java Quick Starter or Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant. I'm wondering if that is the problem too.

My extension are:

Add to Search Bar
Autofill Forms
CustomizeGoogle
Firefox Showcase
Fission
Greasefire
Greasemonkey
Informational Tab (deativated)
Java Quick Starter
Microsoft .NET Framework Assistant
Secure Login
SkipScreen
Snap Links Plus
SpellBound
Stealther
StumbleUpon
TabKit (deativated)
TabGroups Manager (deativated)
Tree Style Tab

Reproducible: Didn't try
