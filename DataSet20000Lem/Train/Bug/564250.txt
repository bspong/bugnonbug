On a page(Page 1), I have an iframe with a new page(Page 2) that contains a picture inside a Div. By default I set the overflow-x and overflow-y of the body tag on Page 2 to hidden. If the picture is larger than the iframe, I set the overflow-y to scroll. But it doesn't show the scrollbar. If I take out the overflow-y:hidden; from the body tag, it work fine. Worked in all previous FF, a well a IE, Safari, Chrome, Opera, etc..

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a page with an iframe
2.In iframe, display a page that ha the overflow-y set to hidden in the body tag and add content larger than iframe display
3.at the bottom of the page inside the iframe, set the overflow or overflowY to "scroll" using Javascript. The scrollbars do not show.
Actual Results:
Showed same problem described above. I used step to create the test site mentioned above.

Expected Results:
setting the overflow-y or overflow in javascript should override the style tag and display the scrollbars
