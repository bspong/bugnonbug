On most windowing systems, an application window can be maximized, or not. Firefox should remember the size of the window when it wa not maximized. Instead, it remembers the last size of the window a the non-maximized size.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Steps to reproduce:
1) Size firefox to 1/4 your desktop size
2) Maximize firefox
3) Close and relaunch firefox (It remembers that it wa in maximized mode)
4) Un-maximize/Restore window (System Menu->Restore)

Actual Results:
Actual results: The maximized size at last shutdown is used a the non-maximized size. So the restored size is still almost maximized. The window size only change by a pixel or so at each edge, causing the user to have to resize the window again to 1/4 desktop size.

Expected Results:
Expected results: The non-maximized size of 1/4 the desktop size should have been remembered.

This is a simple matter of remembering the window size before it wa maximized, and persisting *that* size instead of the current size in the case where firefox shuts down in maximized mode.
