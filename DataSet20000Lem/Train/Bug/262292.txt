I've always been a Mozilla lover, and I'm doing my best to spread the Fox on
Fire, so I decided to join a couple of day ago on www.spreadfirefox.com ^_^

Apart from Campaign&Challenges (I do love them, don't get me wrong, I wa happy
to see the 2 million mark reached in 10 days), I think we should also set up a
"Firefox 1.0" Party worldwide to market the best browser on the planet...

I do remember the Mozilla 1.0 party webpage, where you could post to organise an
"official" party in your area (me and Lapo were the organizer for the Milan,
Italy meeting), or enroll for one of them near you!

It wa wonderful, and it wa a fun way to spread firef... ehmm mozilla! :-) I
think a similar thing would work perfectly for Firefox 1.0 (which is very close,
so we should start ASAP).

Don't you agree? Let's do it! ;-)
