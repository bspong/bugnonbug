1. Have just downloaded from Mozilla the latest Firefox.

2. Can reproduce propblem any time cache ha not just been cleared.

3. From http://my.yahoo.com/ with a yahoo setup that includes "Mail Preview" I
click on "Inbox".

4. Firefox take me to Yahoo Mail page (with tab "Mail Plus", Addresses",
"Calendar" & "Notepad" instead of "Inbox".

5. As a symptom, I briefly see an old content of "Inbox" flash on the screen
and disappear.

6. Odder still is if I clean cache, the problem go away. At step 3 I am taken
correctly to "Inbox".

7. Does not happen with IE and not until recently. May coincide with latest
release but I am not sure.
