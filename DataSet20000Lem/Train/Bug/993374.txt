Screencast showing the issue

Reproducible on Firefox 29 Beta 6 (BuildID: 20140407135746):
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Open Customize.
3. Drag all item to Panel Menu, including the Search-bar, until the scrollbar appears.
4. Hover with Search-bar over the remaining item from Panel Menu.

Expected results: The Search-bar can be moved to every line you desire.

Actual results: The Search-bar jump two line and is unable to get positioned where you desire.

Notes:
1. This issue is not a regression.
2. Is reproducible on all platforms.
3. Also I noticed another issue here, if the Panel Menu is overpopulated (the scrollbar is present) there should be a way to move an item from top to bottom with drag drop. To automatically scroll when hovering over top or bottom edge.
