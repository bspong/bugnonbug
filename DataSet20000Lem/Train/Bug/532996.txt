A group of about 3 pixel appear every time you right click on an image within the carousel located on the bottom of the provided page. If you disable the image's source via Firebug, and give it dimensions, the same set of pixel show up below the first, and at a distance equal to the height of the image. Upon disabling anchor outline, the pixel will disappear. This however is not an option for u due to accessibility reasons.
