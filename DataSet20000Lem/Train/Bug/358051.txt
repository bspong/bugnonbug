When closing or opening entire windows, the menu bar (Apple, Firefox, File, Edit, View, ..., Help) becomes entirely highlighted in blue, a if each of those menu were selected. This happens when using menu command or keyboard shortcuts. Note that closing or opening mere tab doe not cause the highlighting. Only closing or opening entire window will reproduce it.

If I hide the Firefox app (command-H), the highlighting go away, but it come back when I switch back to Firefox again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox to a single Web page (one tab only)
2. Click red "X" button or press command-W keyboard shortcut

Alternately:
1. Open Firefox however you wish
2. Press command-N or select "File / New Window".

Actual Results:
Window closes, but all menu bar item turn blue. Note that no menu display their contents. They simply become highlighted.

Expected Results:
Window should closes, and menu bar should remain un-highlighted.

I am using Mac OS X 10.2.8 (Jaguar). This problem doe not occur with any other software, including Firefox 1.5.
