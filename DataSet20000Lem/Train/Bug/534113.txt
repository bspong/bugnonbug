Most time when I type something a simple a Mozilla Firefox into the
Google search I have to click on the try again icon on the page not found
error message, a many a five time to get the expected page to load, then
it sometimes three min. for the page to fully load.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Had older version Firefox

2.Cleaned out Avast anti virus downloaded Microsoft Essentials computer ran
very fast and presented almost every page instantly.
3.Downloaded Firefox 3.5 three day later now have to hit the try again icon on
the time out warning five time to get a web page to enter.
Actual Results:
Completely removed Firefox from registry and reinstalled 3.5 and now still
have the same try again page load problem a above. The contacting message
seam to go to a different server and many time a server from a different country. This ha turned my high speed into slower than dial-up.

Expected Results:
Need a patch or instruction to get my high-speed downloads back.
