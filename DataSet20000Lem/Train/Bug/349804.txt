It's not a pretty solution to distribute only pre-configured firefox packages. It's to restrictive for administrators!

I miss an opportunity to install an xpi (plugin) via command line like:

c:\firefox> firefox.exe -i plugin.xpi

So it's possible wo write very easily some batch script to install only the neccessairy plugins for an individual user in the system. The plugins should be installable from any ressource in the network (or the internet), like this:

c:\firefox> firefox.exe -i http://192.168.2.50/firefox/plugins/plugin.xpi

I hope you can realize such a great enhancement a soon a possible, to make it more attractive for administrator of big corporations, to distribute firefox and it plugins.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
plugins are only distributeable via a preconfigured deployment version.

Expected Results:
more flexibility for network administrator

the unattended setup is very bad solved at the moment.
Any other software installer give this important opportunity of silent switch for a unattended setup and roll out in big networks.
