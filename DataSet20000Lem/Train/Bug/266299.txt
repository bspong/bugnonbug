"Force link that open new window to open in:"
This option badly need an exception for javascript links, especially when "new
tab" is selected.

Example cases: online game site like pogo.com and zone.msn.com that open a java
applet game in it own little window are forced to use a new tab in the main
window. This new tab is then resized by the applet, messing up all the other
tab that are open.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.pogo.com
2. Make sure the Force link that open a new window to open in... is turned on
and that "a new tab" is selected.
3. Pick any game and enter a game room. Firefox will freak out.

Actual Results:
Firefox resized itself to the game (Sweet Tooth in this case) according to the
applet's instructions, rendering the web page open in other tab nearly
unreadable until I resized the window again, correcting the other page but
making the game look rather silly.

Expected Results:
In this case, since the game is opened via a javascript link, it should open in
a new window.
