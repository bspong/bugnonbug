I've been having trouble with losing my connectivity with FF. I can still access my mail and p2p apps and the like, but FF can't connect to the outside world. I've been having this for the last week or two and have started to notice it having some connection to using google maps, especially when zooming out.

The way to get around it is to disconnect the router and cable modem. There might be another way, better way, to fix it, but I know that this works, so it's what I've been using. I can do some troubleshooting on this but I can't do it too much a it's not my net connection that is going to be taken down. Can someone make a suggestion a to what I need to check when I get the connectivity to go south?

I realize that this might be a modem/router issue but it's only failing on FF, but how do I try to isolate the problem. If it matters, I'm connecting via wireless
