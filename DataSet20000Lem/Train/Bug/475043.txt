(originally filed a https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=480349 ; not that I, bug triager of Red Hat, cannot reproduce it)

About a year ago I registered a new Yahoo! account and received a welcome
e-mail in the new e-mail address. Now I wanted to see what's there, but I can't
see that because my computer freeze every time Firefox begin to load the
message. The mouse usually stop working and if it work I can't click on
anything, I can't restart Gnome so I have to "manually" reboot.
It also happened in another websites, but I wa thinking it wa an isolated
case.
Obviously, I don't want Firefox to work, I want to close it! Or should I?

-----

I've found another "public" site to make Firefox crash; so what I have to do
is:

1)go to www.labmacs.diiga.univpm.it;
2)click on "Courses";
3)reboot.

Now I have the backtrace (I kept the Needinfo flag set), but it isn't
interesting at all: it simply say "No registers.".
I tried to see what gdb writes, but before the bad click many thread are
launched and closed, after that nothing happens. (if you want, I have the
entire incoming/outgoing process list, but I don't think it may be helpful).
Anyway, I'm going to attach a file with the gdb output before the run command.
What can I do now?

> Meaning, you were able to reproduce this with upstream binary?

Yes, of course. I've downloaded the Linux version from the site above, but I
still have the same issue (in safe mode).
