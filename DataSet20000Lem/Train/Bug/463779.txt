I'm not exactly sure how to describe it, but you can see the problem if you use firefox and compare the result with IE7 or Opera etc. I hope you look at this fairly quickly because this is a work in progress. Also, this page work perfectly on an XP OS. I have only noticed these problem in firefox using the vista OS.

Problem 1: Proportional text increase using em measurement.

If you look at the left hand side of the page, there are some scrolling divs with choice of movie to watch. If you increase the text size, the text doe not expand properly, causing text to overflow and overlap. Note: there are at least 3 (and probably more) nested divs are used to create the structure in this example.

Problem 2: "Jumpy Text"

When you increase the text size on the page (three time for me with the firefox "text increase" feature), other text and element on the page move when using my cs fixed positioned menu at the top of the page. It happens when the menu are absolutely positioned a well and regardless of z-index.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure to use the vista OS.
2. Increase the text size using the firefox "increase text size" option under the view menu 2-5 times.
3. Look at the scrolling movie div box on the left hand side of the page. Use the custom cs menu at the top of the page.
Actual Results:
In the case of the div boxes, text overlaps, inner divs are not increasing in size proportionally.

When you use the custom menu at the top of the page, element of a variety of type further down on the page jump up and down slightly. It is subtle. Look at the text "Video Viewer" on the left hand side of the page.

Expected Results:
In the case of the scrolling movie divs the surrounding inner box should expand with the text.

In the case of the "jumpy text" the text should not do that.

I would say that this is cosmetic but should be fixed a it can interfere with accessibility features.
