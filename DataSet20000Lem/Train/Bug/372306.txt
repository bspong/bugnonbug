Originally raised by me against FC6 with mozilla-1.5.0.9. Also seen on 2.0.0.2 and 3.0a3pre.

I've noticed that when firefox wait for a page to load the X server often take
30%+ CPU. After trying a lot of combination I think i've finally narrowed this
down to a problem with the tabbed window support.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch firefox -ProfileManager
2. create new profile with default option and launch.
3. try accessing a page which doe not exist. For me http://10.0.0.1 is a good
one. This cause the browser to try loading the page for ~30 second until timeout.
4. While firefox is still trying to load the page, open an xterm run top. Look
at X cpu usage.
5. After a few second of activity X will show ~1% CPU usage (i.e. everything
look normal now).
6. Stop page load in firefox.
7. Go into preferences->tabs. Enable the "show tab even when only one window
open" option so that the tab bar appears.
8. Try going to http://10.0.0.1 again.
9. Watch X CPU usage. For me X jump to 30%+ and stay there for the 30+ second
that firefox try to load the page
Actual Results:
Having the tab bar open seems to cause firefox to hammer the X server while
loading new pages.


Expected Results:
This is running FF on an AMD64 3000 so I don't expect the X server to need 30%+
CPU in order to tell me that FF is waiting for a page to load. When the tab bar is not visible the same page load cause X cpu usage <1%.


I'm using an NVidia FX5200 with the open source 'nv' driver.
I tried disabling pango with no effect.
The high X CPU still occurs even with firefox minimised so I don't think it is
due to the X driver code trying to repaint the screen.

Also the same occurs when 2+ tab are open, but only if the page waiting to load is in the foreground.

I tried using xmon to see what Mozilla wa doing and I think it wa creating and destroying pixmaps very rapidly, but this wa the first time i've tried running this tool so i'm not certain about understanding the results.
