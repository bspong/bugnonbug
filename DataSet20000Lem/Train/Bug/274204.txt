drag and drop from location bar to another application includes extraneous character at end

When you drag and drop URL's from the location bar to a new mail message being
created in Eudora 6.2 the result includes extraneous extra character after the
URL. Here are a couple of example of the incorrect result produced:
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1630837,00.asp p">
http://my.yahoo.com/ >

These URL's should have produced:
http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1630837,00.asp
http://my.yahoo.com/

When I use Internet Explorer 6 or Netscape 4.78 with Eudora I always get the
correct results. Funny thing is that when I perform the same test between
Firefox and MS Word 97 I always get the correct result too.

Therefore I can only produce the incorrect result between Firefox and Eudora
which might indicate that it is a Eudora problem yet when I use the other
browser with Eudora there is no problem which indicates that it is a Firefox
problem. Why doe the drag and drop work correctly with MS Word but not Eudora?
