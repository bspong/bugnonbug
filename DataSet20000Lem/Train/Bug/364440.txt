Back up prefs.js to avoid situation where Firefox "forgets" my option

I realize that a number of firefox update are for security. Nonetheless, after 45 year a a programmer and having been clobbered numerous time by update to product that broke them, I prefer to decide for myself if I wish to update.

So, of course, I have firefox set up that way. Nevertheless, from time to time firefox surprise me and I curse mightily because it declares that it ha downloaded an update.

It seems to be very easy for the automatically check for update flag to get set without the user realizing it. I think this probably happens if firefox loses it context data, or whatever you call it, if a system crash or loses power a happens to mine out here in the boonies. Sure, I am slowly training my brain to remember that I have to go back in and set this, but it is very easy for it to slip by if you don't have a distinct home page or just happen not remember that firefox is going to pull the rug out from under you.

Firefox save bookmark in a backup area. It ought to save the setting of various option also, and if when it start up it can't find the flag and bookmark wherever it looks, it should restore the most recent ones.


Reproducible: Always
