FireFox Nightly 39 fails to restore recently closed window.png

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0

Steps to reproduce:

I needed to manually restart FireFox. But since it take forever to close, and I clicked on FireFox icon too early, and the damn thing ha opened me a blank window with empty tab before actually unloading (can we prevent this? It annoys me for years).

So, the next stage is to check if the useful window wa yanked for good (as sometimes happens), or it still recoverable, so I go to "History" menu and "Recently close windows" submenu.

Luckily, a see that my window still exists, and nothing is greyed out, so I supposedly can click on the item (or use keyboard combination) to restore useful window -- see the attached screenshot of this moment -- and then try to close the darn thing again and wait until it actually unloads to then finally open FireFox anew again.


Actual results:

Instead of all of this, nothing happens. You can click on the item with the listed closed window, you can use keyboard, you can restart Nightly -- it will not work. Console doe not show a thing. The restoring function worked just fine after I loaded the session with release version of FireFox, so it is not the issue with session itself, it did not get corrupted.


Expected results:

Nightly should just restore the closed window a it was.
