Since upgrading to Firefox 3 Release Candidate 1, on several occasion (and on two different PCs) CPU usage ha suddenly increased to very high level after Firefox ha been sitting open but idle for 20 minute or more. Windows task manager showed that Firefox wa using almost all of the CPU resource (up to 100% on one occasion). Exiting Firefox didn't solve the problem, so I had to kill the Firefox.exe process from the task manager. No problem if I'm actually using Firefox, and I didn't hit the problem with the beta version

I usually have google mail open at the inbox (http://mail.google.com/mail/#inbox), but am not sure if I have on all the occasion I've hit the problem - it's happened with a single tab and multiple tab open
