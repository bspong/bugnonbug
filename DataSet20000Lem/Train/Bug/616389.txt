While using the web, 2 different web page each loaded on a seperate tab, not window, cause the memory of plugin_containter.exe and firefox.exe to soar, and a far a I am aware, continues to rise. The page include twitter and another site which includes flash video.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you have only these two website that are about to be mentioned open in seperate tabs! No other website open in different windows/tabs.
2.Once Firefox 4 Beta 7 is opened, go to www.twitter.com, sign into an account and leave the vertical slide bar all the way at the top. Make sure twitter is done loading before continuing to next step.
3. Second, after twitter is done loading up, open up a new tab in the SAME WINDOW a the one that twitter is in, and open up this website: http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=542138&navid=DL|TOR|home
4. Assuming you never touched anything else on either of the pages, you should have reproduced the bug.
Actual Results:
If you look under the process tab in the task manager in windows, you should see plugin_containter.exe and firefox.exe memory usage soar. Closing firefox.exe through task manager doe not close plugin_container.exe or vice-versa.

Expected Results:
The memory shouldn't have gone up. Memory usage by both should have stayed same instead of soaring. Closing firefox.exe should have closed all other firefox processes.

Addons/Themes used at time:
-LiteFox (Although I wa still able to reproduce this bug with the default theme on.)
-Adblock Plus
-Feedback 1.0.3
-Java Console 6.0.21
The default Windows Vista Aero theme wa not used, instead I wa using a downloaded theme. Not sure if it make a difference.
