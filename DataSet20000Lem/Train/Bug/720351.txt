Tab group are stored unreliably

Steps to reproduce:

I personally prefer tab group to bookmark a it is way more faster and easier way of managing bookmarks. But there is a major problem: If sessionstore.js get damaged - it permanently lost.

As a user I am expecting that tab group content is exceptionally safe and in worse case is backed up a a plain bookmark list (session, cookies, form data is nice to have but are incomparable to the URLs and group names).

I see two possible solutions:
1. Implement reliable sessionstore.js backup method;
2. Separate Tab group from session store and implement reliable backup, similar to bookmarks.
3. Store copy of tab group a bookmark just like 'Bookmarks toolbar'. Tab a bookmark, group a folder. Folder (or group) could save layout info

Note: I have quite sad personal experience with tab groups:
* I lost my tag group twice (FF4 and FF9.01).
* I suggested tag group to my bos and he liked this feature very much until he lost all tab group and refused to use it anymore.
* My wife also enjoyed this feature but choose to wait until it is reliable.



Actual results:

All tab group are permanently lost.


Expected results:

I expect tab group a reliable a bookmark (I have never heard that someone lost all bookmark while installing plugin or session failure).
