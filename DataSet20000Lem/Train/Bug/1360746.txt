Split Forms and History engine prefs so each are able to be enabled independently
The "form autofill" work planned for 56 is going to add 2 new sync engine - one for "payments/credit cards" and one for "address/profile" information (user-facing name for these TBD).

UX ha decided that "History" and "Form History" will be split in all part of the UI (eg, in about:preferences#privacy, instead of "Firefox will remember your browsing, download, form and search history, and keep cookie ...", there will be "Firefox will remember your browsing, download, and keep cookie ..." and new option for the existing "form and search history" and the new "profile/address" features.

They would also like a corresponding change for Sync prefs - "history" will be only browsing history (possibly with a user-facing string change), and there will be a new checkbox called "Forms" (exact string TBD) which will control the existing form history and the new "profile/address autofill history". (There will also be a new checkbox specifically for payments/credit-cards, but that will be a different bug.)

So tl;dr - we'll need a new preference specifically for form (it is currently piggy-backed on the preference for history), which we can implement now. As the new sync engine are developed, they in-turn will be piggy-backed on the new "forms" preference. We'll obviously need to "migrate" the default value for this new form preference based on the current value of the history pref. I believe no change will be needed to the "declined" logic, a the engine are already separate there.

Is there anything else I've forgotten?

cc: Grisha and Steph a this may impact how mobile expose these options, even before those platform get the new features.
cc: rfkelly a a heads-up to expect an issue on the content-server to implement the above for the signup-flow, where these preference are implemented on the web.
