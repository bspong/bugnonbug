Need a container for Developer Tools box
Some background: Currently our developer tool are misplaced. When we open the Page Inspector and Web Console together, the Console is "Inside" the Page Inspector. This is particularly noticeable if you place the Console at the bottom of the window and it appears above the Inspector's toolbar.

This will be compounded with the Debugger.

Currently the console and debugger live inside the browser's notification box area. This ha some nice properties, the UI is tied to the tab and we don't have to deconstruct those container on tab switch. The browser DOM handle all of that for us.

We're considering option to deal with proper nesting.

a) Create another XBL layer outside the notification box inside each tab. We'd nest the notification box inside this layer. This let u keep notification near the content where they belong and give u more control over what we do with the content area. Adding an extra level could break some extension that rely on the current arrangement.

b) Move everything into browser.xul and manage the state of each tool using some form of tab watcher the same way we do it with the Inspector. This feel messy, we have to track a lot of state ourselves. (I'm only mentioning this for completeness, I don't think we want to do this).

c) we could stash *all* of our tool inside the notification box with the noted exception of our sidebar which need a vbox which doesn't exist at that level.

d) reimplement the notification box to give u what we need. Could create a sidebar here, and a bottom box to stash our panel in.

Our current favorite option is (a) - create a new XBL container for our developer tools. This get u outside of the notification area, allows u adjust the position and size of content if needed (for a mobile screen size for example) and allows u to control the content of this layer without affecting anything beneath it.

I fully expect this bug to become a meta bug for individual piece of work.
