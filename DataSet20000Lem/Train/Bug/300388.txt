Plethora of animation on website crash Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050710 Firefox/1.0+

The version of the Firingsquad website a of 3:00 AM, July 11th, completely
brings Firefox to it knees, due to all the animation. CPU utilization get
maxed and Firefox becomes unresponsive (to user input) and must be terminated
via Task Manager. While Internet Explorer is also subjected to this violent
thrashing, IE 6 remains fully responsive throughout the affair and can be
gracefully shutdown.

Rather than simply going to the Firingsquad site, which is guaranteed to change,
I inquired and received the OK from Firingquad Legal to submit archive of the
main page on which the problem occurs. Thus, use the attachment when testing.
Firingsquad_com_Firefox_test.zip is for Firefox and
Firingsquad_com_IE6_test.mht is for Internet Explorer.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and launch the attachment in the respective browsers. Use
Firingsquad_com_Firefox_test.zip for Firefox and Firingsquad_com_IE6_test.mht
for Internet Explorer.
2. Observe that Firefox quickly becomes unusable (at least on my system)
3.

Actual Results:
Firingsquad becomes unusable and must be terminated via Task Manager.


Expected Results:
I should still have been able to use the Firefox application (i.e. navigate
menus, right-click items, etc) then gracefully shutdown the application - Much
like what happens with Internet Explorer.


My System Specs:
Intel P3 933 MHz, 512 MB RAM
