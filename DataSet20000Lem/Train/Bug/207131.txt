While Fb (current nightly a of 2003-05-25) is fetching and rendering pages,
there's a small amount of time (sometimes it's going to be up to 6 seconds) when
Fb hangs.

While fetching a single page it is hard to see but you'll notice the animated
(tab-) icon is hanging for a short time period. While the animated icon is
hanging, no mouse click or keyboard input is being processed (will be processed
when the page either completed rendering or will continue fetching). While Fb is
hanging you even can't switch to another open Fb window.

It's getting really worse if you fetch multiple page at the same time a all
opened browser window are hanging once in a while!
Nightly 2003-05-25 ha been considered unuseable (for me) by that bug.

This behaviour ha been noticed the first time using a nightly from mid of May
(03 and 04 nightlies didn't show that appearance) but the latest nightly
(2003-05-25) is doing it really bad and the delay (time while hanging) seems to
be extended (compared to mid May nightlies).

I've had to switch back to nightly 2003-05-19 which is at least useable with
that bug.

It _seems_ like page without lot of graphic aren't causing _that much_
trouble but long page or page with lot of graphic appear to load with a
badly hanging browser for a few seconds.

tested using W2k SP1 US-EN, using squid 2.5-stable and wwwoffle at the LAN border.

Installed extensions: LiveHTTPHeader (disabled), NukeImage, Tabbrowser
Extensions (latest, 2003-05-20), TextLinks

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open several tab
2. load URI
3. while fetching, switch tab or scroll on an already loaded page and you'll
