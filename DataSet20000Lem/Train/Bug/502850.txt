The site http://www.dar.nl/ fails to send a pdf, because it require a pop-up to fire. However, after the popup, the page quickly reloads, effectivly hiding the 'pop-up' blocked message. It display so shortly that it took me some time that the pop-up is the part that fails.

The pop-up from this site ha been blocked message should stay there longer, just like the remember password message does.

To reproduce this problem, go trough the following steps:

1. Go to http://www.dar.nl/ (Sorry, dutch site)
2. Click on 'Gemeente Nijmegen' on the left
3. Click on 'Afval & Papierkalenders'
4. Write '6541XK 401' in the white box on the middle of the page.
5. Click on 'Download afvalkalender'

Expected results:
Popup with PDF downloads

Actual Results:
Nothing happens (page quicly refresh with no effect).

Work around:
Add http://www.dar.nl/ to the list of allowed pop-up site

Expected Results:
A yellow warning 'bar' on top of my screen that ask if i want to enable pop-up for this site. And one that stay for more then 1/10 second.

Reproducible: Always
