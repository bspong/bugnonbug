I'm using Sun Java 2 Platform version 1.5.0 and the crossword applette look and
work fine. However, if I mouse over the side menu (i.e. 'Family Matters' menu
link on the left hand side) the popup menu cause the Java crossword applette to
jump. Also the menu appears under the crossword rather than on top.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://thinks.com/daily_crossword.htm
2. Make sure Sun Java 1.5.0 is installed. This is the latest version and wa
installed automatically by FF 1.0.4. (Other version of Java or FF may show the
same problem; I haven't checked).
3. With the applette active and showing the crossword, move the mouse over a
left hand side menu. Clicking is not required.
Actual Results:
The side menu is autoexpanding and this cause the Java applette crossword to
jitter. In addition the expanded menu appears underneath the Java applette.


Expected Results:
I expect the Java crossword to remain static and the expanding side menu to pop
up over the applette.
Note, the same Java platform run from IE6 doe not jitter and the menu sits
above the crossword a expected.
