When the browser attempt to load the HushMail.com Encryption Engine, it sliently crashes.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6b) Gecko/20031125 Firebird/0.7+ (daihard; XFT+GTK2; optimized for P4/SSE-2)

HushMail.com us a Java-based Encryption Engine to encrypt and sign e-mail
through it web-based interface. When you log into your HushMail account, the
browser start the Java VM and load the engine. When I try to do this with this
particular build, upon loading the encryption applet, the browser simply dies.
This is on a glibc 2.3.2-82 system, with Java SDK version 1.4.2 and the
appropriate plugin.

I have experienced this problem on all nightlies past 20031103, optimized and
unoptimized. I checked bug 225423, but that bug affected Windows nightlies and
did not fix my problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the enclosed URL.
2. Log into HushMail with a valid HushMail account.
3. Pass the cover page.
4. Wait for the page to signal Firebird to load the Java VM and the encryption
applet.
5. The browser crash when the applet is loaded and the passphrase dialog appears.

Actual Results:
The browser silently crashed - no error message output on stderr, no pop-up
dialogs, no nothing.

Expected Results:
It should have locked up while the Java encryption engine parsed the passphrase,
and then unlocked and allowed access to the HushMail web interface.

In build later than 20031103 but earlier than the current one, the browser
would not even reach the passphrase dialog page; it would crash during the
loading of the Java applet. In the referenced build it load the applet but
crash immediately afterward. The strangest thing about this bug is that
simpler Java applet are completely unaffected -- the ticker tape on the
Transport for London web page at http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl load perfectly fine,
albeit with some lag. I have been to Java-testing URLs a well and the test
applet load every single time.
