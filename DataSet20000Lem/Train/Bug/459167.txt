Firefox is not allowing the cooky to site like Yahoo to work properly since the update to 3.0.3, If I leave Yahoo(not log out just close Firefox), and close out Firefox, I have to re-logon to Yahoo again when I re-open Firefox, didn't do this in its' previous form. I have set cooky to be kept till they expire, have even gone to exceptions, and put Yahoo on allowed sites, still nothing, and the cookie is still there. I have even deleted the cookie thinking it might be a problem there, but Firefox is not keeping this info like it use to. Unless you have changed how it works, I have to assume that Firefox is compromised, and untill it is fixed, will feel safer using IE, though I prfer Firefox

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log on to yahoo
2.close Firefox after you have
3.then re-open Firefox, and go to Yahoo, you will be asked to logon again


Expected Results:
I expect to be going to My-Yahoo page without logging in everytime, unless I have actually logged off it.

Don't feel secure with Firefox if it is not working like it should, also have noticed a number of crashes, but only reporting this problem.
