bookmark toolbar shortened by 1px (hovered item seems to overflow the toolbar)

After the landing of the Native Theme Rendering for Windows XP (bug 243078, bug 337771) the bookmark toolbar wa shortened by 1px. Now, when hovering an item on the toolbar the button-style-borders seem to overflow the toolbar and that doesn't look very good.

I'll attach a screenshot to explain:
I compared branch and trunk before and after Native Theme Rendering bug landed.

From the image you can see that the bottom of the bookmark toolbar ha always been slightly darker on trunk than on branch (I guess it wa implemented differently on trunk). So when hovering a bookmark item it seems like it doesn't fit on trunk.

This is only a small visual glitch (which nevertheless should be fixed) but when Native Theme Rendering landed the dark line on the bottom of the bookmark toolbar vanished. This increased the visibility of this glitch.

I suggest to reintroduce the dark line (if possible) and make item-hovering fitting better visually.


Reproducible: Always




Trunk "Before" and "After" mean
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a7pre) Gecko/2007071405 Minefield/3.0a7pre ID:2007071405

respectively.

The only bug that should have had influence on this are bug 243078 and bug 337771.
