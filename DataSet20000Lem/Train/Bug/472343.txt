Hello,

I recently upgraded to Firefox 3.x. I found the following bug. It stayed even after disabling the bookmark extension I had.
Drag & Dropping bookmark into another folder in same left pane is very slow, take 5-7 second and all of firefox freeze over.

This did not happen with Firefox 2.x

Maybe the size of bookmark matters, my places.sqlite is 13 MB+ and ha 24,363 bookmarks. There are 1839 folder in the bookmarks, many of them about 6-9 level deep and about 10 folder at each level. The result of using netscape\mozilla\firefox for more than 8 year and collecting a lot and organizing.

I did not find any bug mention this a a new bug in 3.x, hence I filed this one

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Organize bookmarks. Select a bookmark folder, about 2 level deep with about 20 URL bookmark and a few folders.
2. Select 5-10 bookmark using mouse in the left pane
3. Drag them into another folder in the same left pane.

Actual Results:
Everything will stop and it will take a while, about 5-7 second to start using firefox again.

Expected Results:
About 1 second response time would be great.
