Since Firefox 1.0PR, if not earlier, Firefox thrash CPU at 100% until process is terminated in Task Manager, (which take 5-30 minute to accomplish). It begin at any point from instantly upon loading the program to after several minutes' useage. According to Task Manager, the CPU is being run at 100% and the memory used rise steadily while the problem completely lock the entire system up. Sometimes there is enough left to close Firefox via Task Manager's end process - IF TM is already open this generally take five to ten minute to accomplish. If TM is not already open, and more and more often even if it is, the only option is to remove the power source(s). This bug is consistent across all four of my machine and four that I know of belonging to other people that operate XP Home and XP Pro both SP1 and SP2 and Intel and Athlon CPU's.

It manifest with no plug-ins, extension or theme of any kind installed and even when there is only only one tab/window open. It is not related to updates, (I have turned all automatic update to Firefox and extension and theme off.) The problem persists through multiple uninstall/reinstalls, HD format and fresh Windows reinstalls and even DBAN wipe followed by complete reinstalls. The problem is somewhere in Firefox itself and ha gotten much, MUCH worse with each release since 1.0 PR or before. AS of version 2.0, Firefox ha become 99% unuseable. It is 100% reproducible, occurring every time I try to use Firefox. At some point, whether a few minute into the session or instantly upon startup, the problem becomes untenable and cause a complete loss of data/downloads/open tab(s), etc.
