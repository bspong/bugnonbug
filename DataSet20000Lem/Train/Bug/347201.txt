Generally, when I copy and paste information such a address or line of text on multiple lines, firefox is unable to carry out this simple command. Internet Explorer, on the other hand, is perfectly capable of doing this.

This site, http://www.quiznos.com/storefinder/results.aspx?CountryID=1&StateID=61&City=Vienna&Zip=&Proximity=10, is just one of the numerous site that ha an address on multiple lines. When I highlight
"
320 Maple Ave W
Vienna, VA 22180
"
and copy it to paste it into Google Maps in another tab, the text shown is only the first line.

This is extremely infuriating since it take multiple time just to copy an address.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any site. For example, go to a store and find it location. A sample is provided at http://www.quiznos.com/storefinder/results.aspx?CountryID=1&StateID=61&City=Vienna&Zip=&Proximity=10
2. Highlight and copy the address (two line of text).
3. Go to Microsoft Word or any text field on the internet (in Firefox, of course) and paste.

Actual Results:
After performing these steps, the same problem still occured - in that only the first line of text wa copied.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have copied the full address (both line of text). This work in internet explorer
