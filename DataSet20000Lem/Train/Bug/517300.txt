If I start firefox when no application ha been using the network for a while (say 5 minutes), it will start in offline mode.
If I cancel offline mode and 'try again' everything is fine.
If I close firefox (once it is working) and restart it, it doe not start in offline mode.

If I start firefox and it say I am offline, then I close it, ping my router and then start firefox, it doe not start in offline mode.

I am on a LAN, with a permanent internet connection. I am never offline. The network link is NOT reporting itself a disconnected.
What is firefox looking for?

There is no power management.

I have VMware installed, which add virtual network adapters. Is firefox confused about which is the real network interface ?
