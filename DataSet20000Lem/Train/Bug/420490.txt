The new visual refresh of the Icons for Vista on Firefox 3.0 are inconsistent with what I see are established 'Standards'.

1. The RSS Icon seems out of place and doe not reflect what ha been adopted by all browsers, even established by Mozilla originally.
Comments like: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=414389#c46 reflect the feeling of testers/users.

Its the 'Standard Icon' in the Bookmarks sidebar - Livemarks, Library and Bookmarks Menu drop-list, therefore the Icon in the Awesome bar should be the same. Its been also pointed out that in Tools-Options-Applications the 'Standared' Icon is used, so why can't we just leave the RSS Icon set to the accepted 'Standard'

2. On Vista the 'blue' X for Stop is just wrong. There are no 'blue' stop sign anywhere in the world, and if RED is good enough for IE 7, which we seem to be wanting to emulate then RED should be used here a well. The XP theme us a RED X, and there is no reason to use a Blue X for Stop in Vista.

Several poster agree the Stop should be RED.

Could we please use some common sense here and correct these two issues?
