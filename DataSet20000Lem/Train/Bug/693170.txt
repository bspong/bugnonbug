Firefox unexpectedly didn't recover last session (opened tabs), and history doesn't help
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928134238

Steps to reproduce:

I had a lot of opened tabs, then clicked the close button and then powered off the computer. I presume that I did it too quickly and ff wasn't properly closed.


Actual results:

Next time I launched firefox, I just saw a single tab with homepage, the all other tab were missing. Then I closed ff and opened it again to see if wa a failed session restore, but it happened the same.

As to intend recover all my tabs, I went to Menu -> History -> Recently closed tabs, and the list wa empty, so no way to restore.

Also, I went to ff profile and looked up for sessionstore.js and sessionstore.bak, but both of them had the same size, about 493 bytes. Obviously the second time I launched the ff it overwritten sessionstore.bak with sessionstore.js losing all my opened tabs. Also didn't receive any message of crash or something.


I solved it by brute force, went to history, clicked on "Yesterday", and selected "Open all in tabs". It warned me about opening more than five hundred tabs, and I had no other choice than say yes and then close one by one the one I had already read.

I noticed too, that the remaining tab when firefox exit are not saved a most recently viewed in history, but are saved a viewed when first time were opened. For example, Google Chrome behaves more coherently and always show the tab saved in sessionstore a the most recent viewed in history, that I think ff should do a well.


Expected results:

The open tab at the moment of closing firefox (or if closed via window process manager) should be show a last viewed in ff history.

Firefox set the time and date in history of a URL when the tab wa first opened, and not when wa last seen. This problem only is noticeable for tab automatically loaded when opening firefox.
