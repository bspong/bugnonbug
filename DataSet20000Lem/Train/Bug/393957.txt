When clicking a "mailto:" link on any webpage, Firefox launch iexplore.exe but not Outlook.

Moreover, iexplore.exe doe not appear on the desktop but rather is only evident in the Task Mgr. Prior to this moment, iexplore.exe wa not active.

The CPU consumption quickly rise to over 50% and the desktop becomes completely unresponsive, except for the ability to ALT+TAB and view the icon of active apps ... yet no specific app can be activated / given the focus.

If you are able to access the Task Mgr and cancel iexplore.exe, the desktop remains hung. Firefox.exe also consumes approx 45% of CPU at this moment. Eventually, CTRL+DEL will no longer respond.

The only remedy is to LOG OFF or, if not possible, force a reboot.

Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 (11.8118.8132) SP2 is the default mail client.
IE7 (7.0.5730.11) is installed while Firefox is the default browser.
