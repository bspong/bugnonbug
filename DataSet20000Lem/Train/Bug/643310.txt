These button in the message window don't work in my intranet

In my intranet I have a code like this:

<td>
<div id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_MainContent_MainContent_upDownload">

<input type="submit" name="ctl00$ctl00$ctl00$MainContent$MainContent$MainContent$btnDatosDownl" value=" Download section
" id="ctl00_ctl00_ctl00_MainContent_MainContent_MainContent_btnDatosDownl" title="Download section" class="btnTabInactiva" onmouseover="javascript:MouseOver(this);" onmouseout="javascript:MouseOut(this);" style="height:36px;width:151px;" />

</div>
</td>


When I click in that link, a message window appears that says: "Do you really want to go to the downloads section?" with 2 buttons: "yes" and "no".
-If I click no the message window is closed and I continue in the same webpage.
-If I click yes then a new tab is opened with the downloads section
These two button don't work in firefox (nothing happens when I click one of them). I can't find the code related to the message window (is it in another file?)

Well, I don't have a lot of html knowledge, but if you ask me about these button I will try to explain the details.

Moreover, I don't know if it's really a bug or a site bug (I'm sorry if it's not a site bug).

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
Clicking yes-> opening a new tab with the Downloads section
Clicking no-> closing message window and continuing in the same webpage

Once I click to the link, I can't return to the webpage, because I can't close the message window, which get the total focus.
