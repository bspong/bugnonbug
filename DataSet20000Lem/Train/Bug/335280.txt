Windows Plugins are not scriptable if they are installed before Firefox is installed.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)

My plugin installer copy my plugin dll and xpt to a subfolder of the "Program Files" directory, then register this location in the Windows registry so that Firefox and other Mozilla browser can find it (according to spec). When I browse a web page that us the plugin, the plugin dll load fine but it is not scriptable via javascript. I've reproduced this problem with 2 different plugins.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy npScriptable.dll and npScriptable.xpt into "C:\PluginSample\"
2. Register this plugin location by importing the attached npScriptable.reg file into the Windows register (just copy it locally and double-click)
3. Open the attached test.html file in Firefox.
4. Click "Show Version"

Actual Results:
Nothing happens

Expected Results:
You should see the plugin version number in the box on the page.

Now copy npScriptable.xpt and npScriptable.dll into the Firefox plugins directory, restart Firefox, and browse to Test.html. This time the "Show Version" button work a expectd.

Firefox doesn't seem to be reading the "XPTPath" registry key find the plugin xpt file. This mean you can't install a scriptable plugin before installing Firefox or other Mozilla browsers.
