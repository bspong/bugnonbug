If I link to something that I want to open, Mozilla, my default browser choice opens, but internet explorer open also on top of Mozilla. Mozilla will open to the correct page for the link and internet explorer open to a blank page. It happens 100% of the time on both of my computers. I have not checked that IE should check whether it is the default browser. I tried your fix, but it did not solve the problem. I tried checking all of my internet choice and all are set correctly. It is annoying to have to close IE after a link. Always happens if Mozilla is not open first when trying to link from Eudora.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.There is an email in Eudora with a link. Mozilla is closed.
2.Click on the link.
3.Mozilla open to the link, but IE open on top of Mozilla to a blank page.
Actual Results:
IE and Mozilla are now opened

Expected Results:
IE should not open at all at this point.
