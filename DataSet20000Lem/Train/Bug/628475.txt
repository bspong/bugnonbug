Bugzilla Bug#605745 already exists with this exact problem, but the version of Firefox reported in this bug wa for 3.6. I just tested this functionality in Firefox 3.6.13 and I wa able to successfully attach files, photos, video, and emoticon in 3.6.13 therefore, Bug # 605745 is resolved. I am opening this bug again for Version 4.0b9 a the functionality in version 4 is broken again in the beta version. I have submitted screenshots and video showing where it fails in version 4 but work in version 3.6.13 attached in the uTest bug documentation
