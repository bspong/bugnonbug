Firefox 48 Beta 6 - Scrolling Jerky When Images are Loading
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

(1) Loaded the webpage such a flickr or pinterest or google images.
(2) Scroll up and down using any method.


Actual results:

These site load more image a the scroll bar reach near the bottom of the page. As more image are loading it cause the scroll bar to go up a you are scrolling down. This cause the scroll bar to jerk up.

I also tested this in Google Chrome and the same jerky scrolling behavior happens. So, this look to be "normal" behavior. However, I wa advised to fill out a bug to see if there is any fix that can be done. Maybe the issue is cause due to cacheing or something along those lines?


Expected results:

This seems to be "normal" browser behavior even in other web browsers. The question is, is there a way to prevent the jerking of the scroll bar when more image load. I suppose a quick fix would be not to have more image auto load a the scroll bar reach the bottom of the page which is annoying anyway since sometimes I want to get to the links/info at the bottom of the page but if more image are loading I can't get there. Just sayin. :)
