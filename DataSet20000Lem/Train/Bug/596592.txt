nsISessionStore::setWindowState resurrects a window that wa closed at the time of the getWindowState.

The browser-chrome mochitest browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode.js
doe something like this:

let stateBackup = ss.getWindowState(window);
// do a bunch of test ...
ss.setWindowState(window, stateBackup, true);

the problem is that when restoring the 'stateBackup' a window that wa
closed at the time of the 'getWindowState()' is opened.

This is what bit me in bug 449734. The test I add in that bug create
a tab, detaches it using 'replaceTabWithWindow', and finally close
the new window. My test work fine when run individually, but when
running the whole browser-chrome suite "browser_privatebrowsing_popupmode.js"
which run some 40 or 50 test later, resurrected a window from my test.

I have combined the essence of the two test into a new test to demonstrate
the problem, see the attached patch.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. apply the attached patch
2. rebuild browser/base/content/test/
3. run "mochitest --browser-chrome --autorun
--test=browser/base/content/test/browser_setWindowState_BUG.js"

WORKAROUND
After you 'close()' the window created by 'replaceTabWithWindow' you can do:
Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"].getService(Ci.nsISessionStore).forgetClosedWindow(0);
to avoid it causing a problem with 'get/setWindowState' later.
