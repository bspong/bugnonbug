SP4 computer. After installation, the 1.0 final release release hang

menu do not drop down, the window cannot be dragged to a new position, nor
closed using the standard close box.

Same behavior occurred after uninstallingand removing all extension in the
previous version, then re-installing.

The browser wa installed using a custom install into d:\Program
Files\MozillaFirefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install to custom location.
2. Start browser.
3. Observe hang after home page displays.
4. Kill with task manager.



Expected Results:
Browser load and responds to keyboard and mouse input.

I hate to report this with no information to help with the diagnosis, but I
don't know how to find out anything more to report. I have used
Phoenix/Firebird/Firefox faithfully since v0.4, and this is the only time I
have had any problem like this. I will try it on my personal computer this evening.

However, even if this only happens once in a while, it is not acceptable for the
official release. If someone can suggest way I can come up with more
information, I will be happy to try them out.
