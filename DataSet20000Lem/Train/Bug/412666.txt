(the exact number in these repro step will probably be different depending on how wide your screen is)

First off all, the "sliding TABs animation" is a very good solution to the hidden TABs problem. I have been annoyed about this so many time in ff2. I wa amazed and delighted that the devs had also noticed this and introduced this TAB slide animation feature.

Note that the current ff3 behavior I'm describing below doesn't have to be characterized a a bug. It's just that I think that the behavior change I'm suggesting below at the end would improve UX. I'll see if you agree with this or not (I hope you do).

1. Start firefox with a new empty window
2. Press CTRL-T four time so that you have 5 empty tab (on my screen this fill up the whole screen width)
3. Press CTRL-T another 8 time so you got a total of 13 empty tab open (on my screen this still only consumes one screenfull of width because the tab get more arrow and squeeze in there)
4. Press CTRL-T again. this trigger an animation where the existing tab are slided to the left and the new tab is inserted in the right most position (the tab that wa previously left-most becomes hidden but there are arrow-buttons that allow the user to access hidden tabs).
5. (just a a note; if you click a link a IRC program or in thunderbird at this point it switch to firefox, run the sliding animation while the new tab is inserted)
6. Now, in this right-most empty tab open cnn.com (or some page with links)
7. Right-click any normal web link on the front page and select "open link in new TAB"

At this point the new TAB is created but it's hidden to the right of the right-most TAB. Usually I open link "in a new TAB" because I'm going to be looking at that particular page very soon so I'd actually prefer this behavior:

When "open link in new TAB" is used the slide animation run so that this new tab becomes visisble-and-clickable but not active (i.e. so I can click it to switch to it fast without using the arrow-buttons to first make that TAB visible and then click it to show that TAB).
