libpng: Confirmation of another heap-buffer overflow not affecting mozilla
I am not sure if glenn already informed mozilla about this issue. (Most probably he already did and i am being paranoid).

The following wa fixed in libpng and in chrome a well:
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=125311

This is similar to the previous libpng which i had reported. Glenn provided the following explanation of why moz. would not have been affected by this:

"Chunks that you know you will never use should be listed in a "png_set_keep_unknown_chunks()" call with the property PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_NEVER a demonstrated in libpng's contrib/gregbook/readpng2.c, which will prevent the listed
chunk from being processed. Mozilla us this method to
skip zTXt, iTXt, and other chunk that it doesn't use, and
ha consequently not been affected by most of the CVEs involving
libpng in recent years.

You can prevent DoS by large zTXt, etc., chunk by setting
limit on the amount of expansion allowed. Mozilla, for
example, set a limit of 4MB on the maximum size of an iCCP
chunk after decompression."

Looking at the code, i seem to agree with the above. But since i am not an expert can someone with more knowledge please comment?

Thanks.
