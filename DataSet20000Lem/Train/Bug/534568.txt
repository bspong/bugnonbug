I had a few issue like this with explorer a few month ago, and took my computer to be looked at by tech support at my school and they said to clean it frequently with malware software and to use Firefox.
Since then I have not had any issue until a few month ago when I would have about three or four tab open on one window, but sponanitously the whole thing will close on me. It will start a report to Moxilla, but there would always be an issue with the report, so it never got sent in.
