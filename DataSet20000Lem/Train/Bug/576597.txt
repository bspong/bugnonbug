Tiger's dark gradient metal style differs from later OS X version in that it ha a slight bezel running around the top and side of the window. However, Firefox us the Leopard/Snow Leo style which is missing this element.

This mean that, application-wide, the titlebar containing the bezel join the rest of the chrome which doesn't have it and the visual style clash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run on Mac OS X 10.4, or:
2. disable the NSUseLeopardWindowValues global preference on 10.5 and run Firefox;
3. disable the NSUseLeopardWindowValues and AppleUseCoreUI global preference on 10.6 and run Firefox.
Actual Results:
The titlebar ha a distinct native visual style a opposed to the rest of the window which look like it came from Leopard, creating an ugly result which is especially noticeable on the Add-ons and Preferences windows.

Expected Results:
A different style titlebar that match the rest of the window (like Safari), or a Tiger style on -moz-mac-unified-toolbar (which cause the issue on all theme that use it) and the rest of the theme elements.

The issue occurs on all window with a metal style, a long a the theme us -moz-mac-unified-toolbar and disregard the bezel on the rest of the elements.
