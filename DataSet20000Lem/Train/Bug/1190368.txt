Focus is immediately grabbed by the AutoComplete/tags or bookmark suggestion list when you start typing in the awesome bar
This is a recent regression. When one start typing, and the list with search engine, tag or bookmark suggestion appears, focus is immediately grabbed (e. g. the first item highlighted) by the autocomplete list. It used to be that one had to explicitly down arrow into the list to take focus off the actual text field. Similarly, when an autofill suggestion appears, and one press RightArrow to jump to the end of it, focus is not returned to the text field either, so a screen reader user can no longer verify what they typed. Keyboard input might still be accepted by the text field, but because focus sits on the list item within the autocomplete list box, those change in the text field are no longer observed.

To reproduce:
1. Run Firefox with NVDA.
2. Open a new tab and start typing b u g z (for bugzilla).
3. Two thing happen: AutoFill suggests bugzilla.mozilla.org, *and* a list of suggestion appears.

Previously, one could press RightArrow, and the highlight would be taken off the auto-filled text, and cursor placed at the end. *or* one could DownArrow and highlight the first search suggestion.

Now, the first suggestion geets highlighted/focused, and focus control is taken off the text field, so the auto-fill can no longer be used in a controlled fashion. Press right and left Arrow, and you won't hear NVDA announce the character the cursor move over.
