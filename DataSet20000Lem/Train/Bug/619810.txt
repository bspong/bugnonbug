Plugin check doe not see my Firefox plugins when using Firefox 3.6.13
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I keep all of my program updated.
I just updated to Firefox 3.6.13, and then tried to check for plugin updates. The plugin check program said that it could not find any plugins. Firefox say that all my plugins are present, and the one I tried seemed to be working fine.
I uninstalled and reinstalled 3.6.13 with the same results.
I uninstalled 3.6.13 including deletion of personal items, and did a fresh download and reinstallation - same result.
In summary, I have about 10 plugins enabled in Firefox 3.16.13, but plugin check can't "see" any of them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools
2. Add Ons (Plug Ins)
3. Find Updates
4. No plugins were detected
Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
I have been using plug in check (plug in update) for several years, and this is the only time it ha failed to show all of my plugins and give their status.
Apparently a major bug in 3.6.13, especially when Mozilla is strongly urging all user to keep their plugins up to date.
