For a page having an input element with onblur handler, and a hyperlink with onclick handler, and with the focus on the input element, if the hyperlink is clicked, both the onblur and onclick handler are invoked simultaneously. If the handler have alert and/or confirm, then a stack of such alert/confirm box are rendered. The following HTML can be used for reproducing the issue.

Shouldn't a handler be invoked after a previous handler ha finished execution?

<a href="javascript:alert('onclick');">Click</a>
</form>

</html>
