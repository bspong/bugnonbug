Layering an absolutely positioned block element with CSS opacity of le than 1
over a Flash object cause the the Flash object to become invisible. The Flash
object must have it wmode set to transparent. Removing the opacity result in
correct rendering. Removing the wmode=transparent result in a visible Flash
object, but the block element is shown behind it, even if the z-index of the
element is higher than the Flash object.

Opacity On: <a

Opacity Off: <a

This wa first noticed on the following page, where the "About Tisch" dropdown
menu slightly overlap the Flash movie: <a
