Yesterday, after closing the whole Firefox browser and reopening some time later, Firefox updated by itself because of the availability for the new version.
When I tried opening this new version, is showed me the message "Error: Platform version '1.9.0. 15' is not compatible with minVersion >= 1.9.0. 16 maxVersion <= 1.9.0. 16".
I wa then forced to use Internet Explorer and download the Firefox 3.5.6 setup which didn't work either and said "File is corrupt" when I tried opening it.
Finally, I had to download the Mozilla Firefox 3.6 Beta 5 which works, and I am currently on this browser filing this bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on computer
2. Click on the icon for Mozilla Firefox

Actual Results:
The same error window show up.

Expected Results:
The Mozilla Firefox browser is supposed to open a new window.

Note that this happened after the automatic update for the new version which wa December 16, 2009. This could be related instead of a coincidence since this ha never happened before.
