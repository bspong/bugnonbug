this page make Firefox hang

The summary say it all. Same thing happens in Netscape 6.2, but it work in IE
6. Probably something is wrong with the page, but even so, Firefox shouldn't hang.

The URL redirects to http://planet.nana.co.il/0090/, Firefox hang there, too,
so it's not the redirect.

Other page on the site, e.g http://planet.nana.co.il/00901/index.htm also hang
Firefox.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. just visit the site.


Actual Results:
Firefox appears in Task Manager a "Not Responding". Nothing work but Alt-F4.

Each time this happens, a new Java Console icon appears in the system tray,
moving the mouse over the icon make the old one vanish. I don't know what
the Java Console can do, I've never tried to use it, but I can't get it to do
anything once Firefox is hung, so perhaps it's hung by whatever hang Firefox.

Expected Results:
Displayed the page, or if the page is faulty, displayed an indication of the
problem (which I could send to the page maintainer) but not hang.

This is not my website. I am also emailing the contact for the site,
aplaton10@hotmail.com about this.

I set severity to Critical, because Firefox hangs.
