First, you need to be aware that MySpace cluster will give you a different Flash Jukebox more or le randomly, depending on luck of the draw and what version of their jukebox you get.

That right there is not gonna be fun.

Next, it only seems to crash SOMETIMES, and it's not real common.

So, let's focus on this: How about getting the audio to actually work consistently. The same band page, one re-load to the next may or may not work, depending on the Flash movie you get.

Oooooh. The audio not working is way way way more common on Linux. Maybe focus effort there first.
I've tried ReHat 8, RedHat 9, FC3, and FC4 with the last two version of Flash player.

The more recent version of all that "work" more often, but not always.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Surf to MySpace.
Listen to lot and lot of music (mostly bad, unfortunately)

Actual Results:
Sometimes the audio doe not work.
Sometimes, le common, it crash the browser.


Expected Results:
Audio should always work, and Firefox should never crash.
Yeah, okay, that wasn't real useful, wa it?...


Apologies that this report isn't a specific a it could be, but there it is.

PS I have a Talkback Agent report queued up, but it's not getting out to your server, and I can't find a way to get the stack trace out of it. :-(
