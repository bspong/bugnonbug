Firefox ha suddenly stopped displaying colored box on some web pages. For
example, on weather.com, there should be an orange background behind the words:
Today Tonight Tomorrow
under the 36 hour forecast at
http://www.weather.com/weather/local/22201?lswe=22201&lwsa=WeatherLocalUndeclared.

Likewise, on mail.yahoo.com, firefox is not displaying any colored background
after I log in. (It display text, but no backgrounds.) This behavior started
occuring on 1/22/2005, and occurs even with all extension disabled. Note: This
doe not seem to occur on ever web page
(https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox display correctly,
for example.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to
http://www.weather.com/weather/local/22201?lswe=22201&lwsa=WeatherLocalUndeclared

3. For comparison, display in IE.

display.
