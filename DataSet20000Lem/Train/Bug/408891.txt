With new urlbarBindings, feed:http(s):// URLs show a feed://http(s)// while loading
The FeedProtocolHandler is scary-bad, see bug 408599 and bug 355473. However, prior to bug 366797 it managed to hide it badness, at least from the addressbar - despite the fact that it turn feed:http://example.com/ into feed://http//example.com/, it used to not display that abomination while loading.

STR:
1. Load feed:http://example.com:449/ (which will time out, but not before giving you plenty of time to enjoy the view)
2. Note the "feed://http//example.com:449/" in the addressbar
3. Comment out http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=/mozilla/browser/base/content/browser.css&rev=1.45&mark=5-8 to disable the new binding
4. Load feed:http://example.com:449/ again
5. Note that it display a feed:http://example.com:449/ in the addressbar

feed: URIs on their own are an edge-case (and horrible, even in 2.0 hovering one would show the feed://http// in the statusbar), but I'm not entirely sure whether bug 335457 comment 1 meant that there *are* other thing hiding their track with an originalURI the same way feed: doe that are also now displaying the wrong thing, or for that matter whether or not that's what confuses the new binding.
