Body of new Hotmail message slow to load, rest of page ok

OS: Windows XP
Browsers: Firefox 3.5.3 [Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)], IE 7.0.5730.13

When choosing New, Reply, or Forward a message, the header/address/subject area load immediately and data can be entered there. The body where the message may be entered is taking up to four minute to load and accept text in Firefox. I am not seeing this behavior in IE, so I don't think it is a Windows issue except in a much a they probably changed some code to screw with your browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Hotmail
2. Select "New" to compose a new message
3. Wait for the cursor to appear
Actual Results:
If you wait long enough, the cursor will appear and the page work normally. Before that, it's completely dead.

Expected Results:
When the page loads, the body field should load with the rest of the page, or at least within a short time thereafter. Four minute is entirely too long.

Since Hotmail no longer change the URL when you go from page to page, it is a challenge to give you more specific information. I apologize for that. I am sure this wa not a mistake on Mozilla's part, but a case of Microsoft changing their software without notice.
