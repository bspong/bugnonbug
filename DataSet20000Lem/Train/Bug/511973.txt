Using Max 2009 on Vista x86, SP1, I created and exported a simple scene with a knot, 3 light and a camera.

Here is the scene on this website. http://www.windyweather.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Blue_knot_01002/Blue_knot_01002.html

The model doe not play in Firefox 3.0.13, or 3.5.x either from the file system or from this website.

It doe play in MS IE 8 both from the file system or from the website.

The sample on the hypercosm website play in both MSIE 8 and Firefox 3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a hypercosm file by exporting simple geometry from 3dsmax.
2. Attempt to display the file using Hypercosm in Firefox. Fails.
3. Samples do work in firefox, so the plugin is ok from Hypercosm. ALso the exported file work in MSIE, so bug is in Firefox somewhere.
Actual Results:
