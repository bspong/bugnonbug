Standards-compliant embedding of realplayer in a web page fails to pas parameter to the realplayer plugin during object initialization.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; AOL 9.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0.4

When I embed the realplayer plugin in a web page using the OBJECT tag, the
following code works...

<object id="ExampleOfPluginEmbed"
data="xxxxxxxx.ram"
type="audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin"
width="230"
height="230"
controls="ImageWindow,ControlPanel,StatusBar"
console="Video1">
</object>

Rename "xxxxxxx.ram" above to the URL of any .ram file that contains a URL to
any .rm file. "Video1" console can be any name. The code above will not
validate because "controls" and "console" are private, plug-in-specific
attribute and are not valid HTML or XHTML attribute of the OBJECT tag.
Firefox ignores those attribute when parsing, but still pass those value to
the realplayer plug-in. The result is that the embedded realplayer display a
it should with the image window for the video and the control which have the
play button and volume control, etc. a well a the status bar which show data
transfer rates, etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next block of code will validate, but the "controls" and "console"
parameter and their value do not get passed to the plugin a it should. The
result is that only the default realplayer control get embedded, but not the
image window. All of the control get embedded by default and not just the
control panel and status bar and they take up the entire width and height. The
name and value for the real plugin parameter are not case sensitive.
Realplayer allows you to also specify exactly which control to use a well. In
my example, I only embed the control panel and the status bar plus the image
window for the video.

<object id="ExampleOfPluginEmbed"
data="xxxxxxxx.ram"
type="audio/x-pn-realaudio-plugin"
width="230"
height="230">
<param name="controls value="ImageWindow,ControlPanel,StatusBar" />
<param name="console" vlaue="Video1" />
</object>

From what I understand, Gecko pass the value of the OBJECT attribute to the
plug-in using the arg parameter of the NPP_New call that creates the plug-in
instance. I thought that the PARAM value were supposed to be sent in this
array a well a the attributes. Obviously they are not.

If PARAM value could be passed to plug-in in the same manner that EMBED
attribute are passed to plug-in then this will enable web author to write
valid code and use all plug-in just a effectively a with the non-standard
EMBED tag.

I could create functional test page to demonstrate this if you need me to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a web page that embeds the realplayer plugin with the method
explained in my details.
2.View in Firefox
3.

Actual Results:
The non-valid code work a it should, but will not validate. The valid code
will not display the image window...it ignores the private, plug-in-specific
parameters.

Expected Results:
Firefox should pas the parameter name and value to the plugin.

I am embedding the realplayer plugin that is installed with Real Alternative
v1.40.
