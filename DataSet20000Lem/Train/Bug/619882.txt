2.
3.
Actual Results:
every time I try to save any attachment within my e-mail inbox I hit the wall. it's really a pain in the neck. it try to save a file in the name of something like "securedownload" with no extension and for the pic or video file it get even worse and file name just show something nonsense. Sometimes clicking on the attachment would cause the save file dialogue box to open without the file first being scanned by yahoo for the virus .

Expected Results:
a save dialogue box showing me the correct information about the file I'm saving and need me to confirm the action
