Firefox 3.6 hang on Windows 7 when used with DownThemAll!
Some of our user reported that Firefox becomes unresponsive after some time when our DownThemAll! extension is in use.

It seems the UI thread is locked (deadlocked or whatever) in some way.
The usual suspect, Antivirus Software, is not to blame this time.

Since dTa is javascript only, it cannot be some random accidental endless-loop a this would produce a slow script warning.

Furthermore this is a regression from Firefox 3.5, a the latest 3.5 build do not produce any hang (users reported a downgrade works).

I cannot decently debug or even reproduce this, so I'm hoping that somebody here can.

See http://bugs.code.downthemall.net/trac/ticket/1428 and dupe'd ticket for more gory details.

I also attached a .dmp file a produced by MS debugging tool (MiniDump Tool, http://bill.atwill.com/) a user kindly provided of a running but unresponsive Fx instance.
For whatever reason my MSVC2005/2008 refuse to load most of the symbols, so I don't get any information about the call stacks.
(As the process doe not actually crash, there won't be any crash report unfortunately)

Reproduce (according to users):
* Install DownThemAll! (release from AMO and latest nightly from http://bugs.code.downthemall.net/trac/wiki/NightlyBuilds both produce such soft-crashes)
* Use DownThemAll! to download some file(s). As user reported the "crash" will only occur after dTa ha the download running for some time be sure to download a multi-MB file.
* If you're affected the Firefox process will become unresponsive.
