I use KlipFolio for RSS and usually I click many link fast to get them loaded
in FF. I have the prefs set so that FF should load link in new tabs. But when I
do this, sometimes thing go wrong, and the result follows below. I will attach
a screen shot.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. FF is not loaded
2. click two link in KlipFolio in rapid succession

Actual Results:
I get two windows, one with the broken GUI and one not broken with a webpage
corresponding to one of the link I clicked.

The window with broken GUI look like this:
1. there is no webpage loaded
2. contains the green update icon
3. the bookmark toolbar is empty, and a right click on the bookmark toolbar
result in a miniscule 4x4 context menu containing zilch.

Expected Results:
Given me one window with two tab containing the webpage I wa trying to load
by clicking the two links, a fully functional bookmark toolbar and no green
update icon.

Using FF 1.0
Default theme
No extension
