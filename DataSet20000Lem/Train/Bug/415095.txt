The "inline" method of specifying a password should be remembered mean that on a framed site, the only opportunity to save a password is after all of the frame have loaded, which mean if the site requires authentication, you'll have to enter authentiation credential for each frame.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a site that us authentication and frames. A site using Zope is a good example (and what I'm using).
Actual Results:
I'm asked to authenticate for every frame. Only after all the frame have loaded is the bar that allows me to save my password displayed.

Expected Results:
There should be a checkbox on the authentication username/password entry sheet indicating the password should be saved. I could check this on the first request (the frameset), then the username/password would be available for all the frames. This is how Firefox 2.x works, and I only have to enter my username/password once.

I would imagine this is on all platform but I've only tried it on my Mac.
