Much memory usage for a few loaded and dozen of not-loaded tab

I have dozen of tab (about 500), and when I open the FF it try to load it from the cache, so it take a few minute to become accessible. However, then I'm not connected and the majority of page cannot be loaded a my cache isn't that big. When FF becomes available, I get connected and start using it. But the issue is that FF take about 300MB of the memory for page that simply have not loaded anything, and accordingly, it slows down. I wonder whether the FF could manage the tab more efficiently, so that my space and time is not wasted.

Thank you.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open FF (my cache-size is about 250)
2.Load it with a few hundred tab addressed to some page
3.Close and save tab
4.Disconnect
5.Open FF
Actual Results:
Consuming much memory while a few of the hundred of page are actually loaded. Normal operation is slowed down.

Expected Results:
Memory consumption and operation performance be linear to the amount of page that actually are loaded.
