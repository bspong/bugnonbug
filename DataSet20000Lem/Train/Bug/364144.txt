Copy/Paste is Broken When Focus is Shifted Using 3rd-Party GUI Navigation Programs

While using Otaku Software's TopDesk application-switching program (http://www.otakusoftware.com/topdesk/), if focus is given to another window, then returned to Firefox, the Copy/Paste functionality is broken:

1) Copying text from an outside application to Firefox work
2) Text copied from within Firefox is not added to the clipboard, and when one try to paste, it usually refuse to paste anything
3) Pasting into the Search box at all is impossible when such symptom are being exhibited after changing focus
(Sometimes these symptom seem to manifest themselves differently, ex., pasting into the Search box paste text onto the focused page instead)

Minimizing the Firefox window using the Windows GUI and not TopDesk fix the problem instantly.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. With a Firefox window open, copy test from a page ("test1")
2. Switch window using TopDesk to any other application
3. Switch back to Firefox in the same manner
4. Copy new text ("test2")
5. Try to paste it

Actual Results:
1. Refuses to paste either text into the text box on this page
2. Same result for the Search bar
3. Newly-copied text DOES copy into other application correctly (formatting and all)
4. Text copy into FF from outside application just fine a well

Expected Results:
New text should copy-paste into all FF windows/boxes the same
