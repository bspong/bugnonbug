Using a testwiki under WAMP with Windows Firefox, Firefox error trying to save edits if internet connectivity is not available.

The circumstance of the error were very particular.

In more-or-less plain English, I wa running a test wiki with Mediawiki 1.14.0 software using XAMPP 2.5 installed on a WinXP platform. I wa logged into the test wiki a User:Wtmitchell, had just edited the wiki userspace page named User:Wtmitchell/Sandbox, and wa trying to save the edited page. In order to do the save, Firefox wa attempting to open URL http://localhost/mediawiki-1.14.0/index.php?title=User:Wtmitchell/Sandbox&action=submit.

In more specific language, under XAMPP Version 2.5 (9 May 2007) Windows 5.1 Build 2600 Platform 2 Service Pack 2, Firefox v3.07 wa attemptng to open URL http://localhost/mediawiki-1.14.0/index.php?title=User:Wtmitchell/Sandbox&action=submit. when the error occurred.

The key circumstantial point which appears to be the crux of the error is that I wa not online with an internet gateway at the time. I have seen this error previously, and it seems not to occur when I am online with the internet. It should not be necessary to be online with the internet in order to navigate to URLs under http://localhost/, or so one would think.
