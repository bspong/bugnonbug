On some sites, user cannot open up another instance of the exact page they are
viewing, like URL - http://www.nwrealestate.com/nwrpub/index.cfm.
If user want multiple window (or tabs) open at the same time to view different
listing easily, they have to start from the beginning and enter in all of the
info again in each window. This is tedious and time consuming.

NOTE: In IE, user can click File --> New --> Window and open up the exact same
page in another window. This is very convenient so that user can open up
multiple listing at the same time without having to go through all of the step
from the beginning for each one.

Another note:
http://www.homeplanfinder.com ha disabled the right click menu in IE for each
house listed.
- In IE, go to http://www.homeplanfinder.com, take the defaults, and click
"Search".
- Right click on one of the listing (house picture). (No menu to open it up in
a new window.)
User can get around this in IE by clicking on File --> New --> Window.

On this URL only, this doe not occur in FireFox (Yet).

There need to be a way to create multiple instance of a particular page in
FireFox by selecting a menu item. Preferably, being able to open it up into a
new tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.nwrealestate.com/nwrpub/index.cfm.
2. Click on a county.
3. Select anything from the drop down list box, or leave it at the default
"Residential Single" and click on the "Search" button.
4. Select "Redmond" and enter in "500" for the max price (to get many listing
without maxing it out, which is limited to 250).
5. Click on the "Search" button.
6. Scroll to the bottom and click on the "Next 5" button.
7. Again, scroll to the bottom and click on the "Next 5" button.
8. Do one of the following:
- Click File --> New Window
- Click on "Bookmarks" --> "Bookmark This Page" --> click OK
9. If you Bookmarked the page, open a new tab, click "Bookmarks" --> click on
this bookmark you just made.
Actual Results:
User is taken back to the default page, not the page that wa bookmarked.

If File --> New Window is selected, a new blank window is opened. Copying and
pasting the URL into the new blank window take user back to default page
because the page specific info is not part of the URL.

Expected Results:
To be able to open up multiple tabs/windows with the exact same page by clicking
on a menu item.
