After double-clicking on some text to select it, page scrolling will be much slower when drag-selecting the text. Scrolling speed is not conistent, except that it is always slower than simply inserting the cursor and dragging.

This also seems to affect Thunderbird message - both plain text and HTML.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select a word in a browser window by double-clicking the word.
2. Drag down or up far enough that the browser window is forced to scroll.

Actual Results:
Scrolling speed will be inconsistent, but always slower than a single-click-and-drag.

Expected Results:
Same scroll speed a single click.
