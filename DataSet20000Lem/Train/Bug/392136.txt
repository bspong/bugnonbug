Crash for Unknown reason

This problem started after I put on the FF 2.0.0.5 update (I had been running 2.0.0.2?) immediately after installing SuSE 10.2.

Problem is: I can go to Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) and it may crash (as in gone, completely). Or I can go to Yahoo! and do a search and everything works. Select a web site and FF is gone. I can't determine exactly what cause this.

I have uninstalled FF and reinstalled and get the same behavior. I have disabled all plugins. I've uninstalled them. I've re-installed them. I've uninstalled SUN JRE 1.5 and gone back to 1.4. I've disabled Java and Java script and enabled them.

Meanwhile, I can use Konqueror and fake out web site by having it tell them it's W/2K and IE. NO PROBLEM. Flash doesn't crash it (doesn't play either), PDF display works.

I've looked around and I haven't found any diagnostics. Right now, I am doing this bug report with FF 2.0.0.5.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start up FF on SuSE 10.2 at 2.0.0.5
2.Go to Yahoo!
3. If that doesn't crash it, go to Yahoo Mail. If that doesn't do it, go to a page that ha flash... Eventually, it will just suddenly be gone.
Actual Results:
FF dy and doe it so fast that it is a if you did an ALT+TAB and immediate release of the keys.


I have recently installed gnome bug-budy in an attempt to capture some diagnostic info. Talkback appears to not be available from SuSE.
