User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/125.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/125.8
Build Identifier: Can't Get browser to run correctly... it's version 0.9, downloaded 6/15/04

Brower sometimes come up and only ha "Firefox" menu... no File, edit, etc. By clicking back and forth
to other running applications, I sometimes can get the browser to take focus, but when I have Firefox
open a second window, anything I type in the URL bar go to the URL bar of the first window that
Firefox opened... NOT the window I'm typing in.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run browser
2. Open a New (second) browser window
3. Click on URL bar of new window and type in it.
Actual Results:
text I typed went to the URL bar of the first window

Expected Results:
Text should have shown up in the URL bar of the window that had focus.

I'm running on OS 10.3.4. When this bug appeared, I removed my whole ~/Libraries/Application
Support/Firefox directory... this did not fix the problem. I also quit the Application "Virtual Desktop
Pro," which I usually run. Neither of these action fixed the problem. I run the 3rd party system
extension "APE Manager" and "Menu Meters." Otherwise, my system is pretty standard.
