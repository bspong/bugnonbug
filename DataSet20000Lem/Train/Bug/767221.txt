Dig deeper into DataCloneError in FrameWorker.jsm
Frameworker.jsm ha a work-around for what appears to be a platform bug. We should make an effort to reproduce it and reference a platform bug in the comment, opening the platform bug if one doesn't yet exist.

From bug 762569:

Sadly I couldn't manage to reproduce it either (although I didn't spend a huge amount of time on that). It ha only been seen when using the real Amigo code, so I don't have full visibility on the underlying cause. My and Amigo's best guess is that some of their prototype change which could cause that. I asked on #developers and there wa a vague recollection by someone that property accessors on an object could cause a similar problem, but I never got a far a an actual repro I could add to tests.
