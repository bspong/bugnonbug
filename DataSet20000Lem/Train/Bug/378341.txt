can't access my email account with Hotmail
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0.0.3

When I try to open my Hotmail account I get the message:
Windows Live ID is unavailable from this site for one of the following reasons:
• This site may be experiencing a problem.
• The site may not be a member of Windows Live ID.
You can:
• You can sign in or sign up at other Windows Live ID site and services, or try again later at this site.

I don't have a Windows Live account. It's just a regular Hotmail account. The problem just occurred today. For at least 2 year I've had no difficulty getting access to my email account thru Firefox. How can this problem be corrected? Hotmail open fine with Internet Explorer.

Thanks. Tom
