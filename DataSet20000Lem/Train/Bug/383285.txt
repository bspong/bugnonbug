The latest Firefox Release 2.0.0.4 seems to have problem when accessing site by http that contain html form elements.
We have a webapp which is built with JSF 1.2, Tomcat 6.0.13.
If I access our app by http and enter value in the field and select element from a combo and the submit the form, sometimes it happens that the value of an input field is empty although I entered the value. Another example is that the selected value of a combo isn't being submitted to the server.

The whole stuff work most of the time but if I submit the form many time (maybe 30 time or so), the value of e. g. an input field is empty. The submit before that one however contained some text in the input field.

This issue only occurs if I access the page by https, if I try it by http everything work fine.

For testing purpose I installed Firefox 1.5.0.4 where everything work fine - no input field loss, even with https.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Submit the form (sometimes 3x and sometimes > 30x)
