Specifically, I had Adblocker Plus installed, and installed Download Helper while I wa in private browsing mode. Upon restarting firefox, Adblocker had disappeared, and needed to be downloaded and installed again.
Also, the Norton Toolbar, which wa previously disabled, wa re-enabled upon restarting the browser.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Adblocker Plus addon (from Mozilla's website)
2. Begin Private Browsing mode (Ctrl+Shift+P)
3. Download and install Download Helper from Mozilla's website.
4. Restart Firefox when instructed.
Actual Results:
Adblocker Plus had disappeared (uninstalled, no trace). The new addon, however, wa correctly installed, a well a the previously disabled Norton Toolbar

Expected Results:
Norton Toolbar should have remained disabled.
Adblocker Plus should have remained installed.
Download Helper wa correctly installed, a it should have.

Thank you to everyone for their continued work into this fantastic browser!
