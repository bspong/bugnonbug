This is an intermittent issue, but it's frustrating that it happens. Sometimes when I start typing something in the location bar, it simply doesn't perform any searching of bookmarks, history, etc. On top of that, the text in the location bar flicker while I type, and I often lose character a I type. For example, I'll type "scala-lang" to bring up a website and nothing happens (it's bookmarked). When I look at what I typed, it will show "scal-lng". If I clear the location bar and I type again, I'll get "salalan", etc. If I wait a few minutes, it will work again (no exact timing on this). Also, if I open a new window (not a new tab), it works.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new tab
2. Hit Ctrl-L
3. Start typing

Usually it works, but when it stop working the three step above consistently don't work for a few minutes.
Actual Results:
No search result are displayed (see screen shot)

Expected Results:
Search result should have been displayed

This ha actually been going on for a few version of Firefox for me, my apology for just getting around to submitting this now.
