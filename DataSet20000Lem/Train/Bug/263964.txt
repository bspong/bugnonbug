Current tab briefly display before new tab is opened with "open link from apps in new tabs" set
Bug 172962 introduced single-window mode, which is a great convenience and
represents the next logical step in tabbed browsing. However, it's not quite
polished yet. Specifically, when a user ha option set such that external
application that open link open them in new tabs, Firefox will steal focus
from the original window before it ha started loading the new tab. A
step-by-step description might help:

1. Have the "external apps open in new tabs" pref set.
2. Open up Firefox with a a web page already displayed (e.g., Google).
3. Click on a link in your email reader of choice.
4. Firefox will steal focus, but Google will still be displayed.
5. A very small fraction of a second later, the new tab will open and the link
will start loading.

It's the "Google will still be displayed" and "new tab will open" part that are
the bug, and it can be rather disconcerting to see Google, just barely
understand what you're seeing, and then have it disappear on you a the new link
loads.

Here's what should happen:
1. Have the "external apps open in new tabs" pref set.
2. Open up Firefox with a a web page already displayed (e.g., Google).
3. Click on a link in your email reader of choice.
4. Firefox will open the new tab and start loading the link.
5. Once the tab ha started loading and is active, Firefox will steal focus.

Basically, Firefox should start loading an external link in a new tab and should
select the tab *before* stealing focus.

As this wa just recently implemented and is therefore relatively fresh in
danm's mind, I'm going to request blocking-aviary1.0 for this. Hopefully it's
just an issue of switching the order of code execution around in app logic.
