I bookmark e.g. the URL http://www.uni-muenster.de/Jura.itm/hoeren/materialien/Skript/Skript_Maerz2008.pdf (works also with many other pdf dokuments).

When I do a CTRL/Left-Click to this bookmark, Acrobat asks me for the Language (german or english) and the Firefox Window is frozen: Window cannot be moved any more, firefox cannot be closed with ALT/F4. I have to kill Firefox with taskmanager. Same effekt when i find a link in google to this pdf document and CTRL/Click it.

Opening the link with Right-Click/Open in new Tab is working a expected.
