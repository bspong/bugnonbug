In custom install, create a page to select the toolbars style

okey I know see this coming from aza - and others - and I think they are right
in one way but would be totaly wrong to impose a new default look (anyone
telling me it's not long to customize the toolbar would have a point but still...)

I think it would be a feature addition, a nice one, and would satisfy everyone
to add a page in the custom installation process to select what kind of toolbar
setting the user want ... could be something like

"Firefox is highly customizable, so is it toolbar, blablabla right click blabla

What toolbar arrangement do you want by default:

(x) Firefox Default UI; light and functional
( ) Internet Explorer UI; anyone switching from IE will find it easier with this
( ) Opera UI; Lots of buttons, without the banner
( ) Minimal UI; self-explicit
etc.etc.etc."

I don't think it would be long to add and I think that would be a good move from
the team to show respect to old user who got in firefox a while ago, and also
offer easier transition to other type of browser (opera, kmeleon, seakmonkey,
whatever)
