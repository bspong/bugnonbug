When a new tab is opened offscreen, there is supposed to be an indication that the action ha occurred. Bug 343251 introduced a behavior whereby the "all tabs" menu flash three time to show this. However, this flashing doe not occur when you open a folder of bookmark in tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open enough tab so that some overflow and are no longer visible.
2. Middle-click a bookmark so that the new tab open
3. Observe that the "all tabs" menu flashes.
4. Middle-click a folder so that all of the bookmark in that folder open. (You can also use the "Open All in Tabs" menu item.

Actual Results:
The "all tabs" menu doe not flash, even though the tab have opened.

Expected Results:
The "all tabs" menu should flash.

Although it wa fixed in a different bug, Bug 342900 "open tab in background give no indication that tab opened in overflow area" give background a to why this indicator is important.

I do not know if the indicator should flash if some of the tab open on-screen and others open off-screen.
