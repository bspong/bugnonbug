fix aero styling in service window
It seems suboptimal to allow the provider to specify the "features" for the service window. For example, one provider specifies:

"resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,width=400,height=300"

However, serviceWindow.xul also specifies:
width="300"
height="300"
screenX="20"
screenY="20"
persist="screenX screenY width height"

The end result is that on Windows, there seems an inconsistency with the size when the window is created - there may be a transparent area at the bottom below the status bar area. As soon a you resize the window, this area vanishes. I think this is due to the discrepancy between the sizes.

If the provider change to not provide width and height, thing work correctly. However, this then leaf just "resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes". If you remove these, then the layout again get screwed up. There are almost certainly other "features" that could screw us.

So we should consider not allowing the provider to specify any feature directly and have the service window add whatever feature are necessary for correct operation. If we do decide that some thing should be customizable, we should allow them to be specified generically in "options" - eg, width and height, for example, which may or may not translate into feature strings.
