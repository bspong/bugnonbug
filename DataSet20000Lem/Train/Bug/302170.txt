Problem with solaris and linux build (under solaris 9 and redhat 9)

IMPORTANT: This is no duplicate of the bug 246650, 259978, 272324, 294049

REASON:
- New behaviour since 1.0.6, no problem with e.g. 1.0.4. No problem installing
mozilla suite since the 0.9-versions until this new firefox.
- I have full filesystem access at installing time (admin acl-rights),
changing unix-rights (chmod) help nothing. Tried all known hint descriped in
some readmes or in the other bug-reports.

SPECIALS:
- I'm installing into a AFS filesystem, at installing time i use only one
RW-volume, the readonly-volumes would be added later after the installation is
working full. The user-homes are also in AFS. Only ACL-rights are relevant.
