Following a Google search result, I clicked the above URL. A box like a flash player appeared on my screen and and then a Javascript popup box told me I needed to download a new Activex control to play the video. It wa not possible to close the box without downloading whatever horror wa waiting at the other end. I couldn't close the box, and I couldn't close the tab. I think I might have had to use the task manager to kill all my Firefox windows.

I finally went ahead and downloaded the object. My virus checker intercepted it immediately and killed it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://mikro.allbisexual.com/743819.html
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Javascript popup appeared which could not be killed.

I would like to have been able to click the X in the upper right corner to kill the popup, but when I did, the popup just kept re-appearing.

Expected Results:
I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. Allowing me to prevent the download seems necessary, but maybe there should be stronger protection? Maybe one of your security guru can figure out a good thing to do.

I'm marking this a "major". It doesn't exactly fit the definition since I'm not sure anything is "broken", but it doe seem to be a security hole that will catch unsuspecting users.

It may have already been reported, but I couldn't find it in my search.

Thanks.
