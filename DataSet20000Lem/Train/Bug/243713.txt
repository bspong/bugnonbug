If you click on any of the image thumbnail on this page, a window should open
which load the image. This doe indeed happen, but the image load in the main
window a well, which shouldn't happen.

Safari and MSIE both behave correctly on this page. I have seen this happen on
other image sites, but this is the most recent ocurrence and finally decided to
report the bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit above URL
2.Click on any of the thumbnails.


Actual Results:
A window will appear which will load the image. When the image finish loading,
it will load in the main window (the window in which the thumbnail wa clicked)
a well.

Expected Results:
The image should only load into the new window. The main window should still on
the page with the thumbnails.

I thought this might have to do with blocking target_new_window, but the
behavior remained the same when I turned it off.

Apologies if this is a dupe, I did about five search and came up with nothin'.
