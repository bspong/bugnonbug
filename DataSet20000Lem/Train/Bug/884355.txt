"Warn me when closing multiple tabs" should warn when "Never remember history" is enabled

Steps to reproduce:

In the Privacy preferences, configure Firefox to "Never remember history". Keep the default "Warn me when closing multiple tabs".

Go to some site. Middle click on a link to open a new tab. Secondary click on another link and Open Link in New Private Window. (Note that because of the Privacy setting, there's no entry to Open Link in New Window in the File menu.) Middle click on a link in this window.


Actual results:

There are now two window with two tab each. Close one of the windows, using the mouse or the keyboard. It close with no warning. The remaining window will present a warning if you try to close it.

The same happens if you have two (or more) window started from the startup window, and you closed the startup window. All window except the last remaining window close without warning.


Expected results:

I suggest there should be consistency. My preference is that all window should respect the "Warn me when closing multiple tabs" setting. Failing that, I suggest: (i) the last window should also close without warning; (ii) the multiple tab setting should be greyed out.

(This follows on from bug 884241, the 8th comment. I'm making the argument.)
