Hi,
I have a rather large, yet modular JavaScript app I run on FireFox a a platform. It is based on the ExtJS javascript/css GUI framework which contains some optional animation for GUI elements. These animation are crisp and smooth in chrome beta on my linux desktop. But in Minefield 3.7pre5 they are still a bit choppy. Also, there is a noticeable delay after I click a GUI element and it response time.

I posted two screencasts showing my app in chrome and firefox. Although the video animation itself is not entirely smooth, some of the difference can be seen. What can't be seen in the firefox video is the delay between my mouse click and the responding animation.


Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Slight delay in GUI/CSS/JavaScript response after mouse click. Slightly choppy CSS rendering during animations.

Expected Results:
No noticeable delay between mouse click and smooth GUI response. CSS/JavaScript animation of element should be smooth, not choppy.

My application is kind of large and make heavy use of dynamically loaded, eval'd code. It is based entirely on ExtJS.

My computer ha 3GB memory.
Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Desktop 32 bit
23% disk partition used.
CPU and memory utilization are low during my test. No interference from the OS, scheduler or other apps.
