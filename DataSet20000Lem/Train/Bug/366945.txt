middle-clicking on a page start a load based on clipboard content (on unix-like hosts)

the middle-click behavior in firefox is mind-boggling...even for those who fully understand the unix middle-click.

first of all, it doe make sense that middle-clicking in a form paste the clipboard content into that form. it also make sense that middle-clicking on a link open that link in a new tab.

however, it make absolutely no sense that middle-clicking in arbitrary space on a page attempt to load a url based on the text in the clipboard. oftentimes i am trying to middle-click on a link, but miss slightly, and am taken to a 404 not found because the clipboard text is not a url. i hadn't meant to use the clipboard text to take me anywhere, but inadvertently, i was.

i really think that middle-clicking within a page should not attempt to parse the clipboard text a a url. instead, that click should just be ignored. let the user middle-click in the address bar, then press "go" to use clipboard text a a url. that make sense.

thank you for your consideration.
