I have 2.0.0.11 and 3.0b1 (gran paradiso) installed. When I open one (say 2.0.0.11) and then the other (beta), the title bar of the second instance display the same text a the title bar of the first - Mozilla Firefox.
If I open beta first, it title bar say Mozilla Firefox beta 3.1; when I open 2.0.0.11, it title bar say the same thing - Mozilla Firefox beta 3.1, which it isn't. The about box show the same information a the first session for all versions. The task manager show only one(!) instance running - the executable of the first session. I renamed all firefox.exe to firefox20011, firefox3b1 to differentiate between them, but new window use the first executable, even if I double clicked on a different executable all together.
I just tell me that I cannot have two version of firefox running side by side.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start executable of one version of firefox (e.g. stable)
2.start executable of a different version of firefox (e.g. beta)

Actual Results:
The second executable never starts. Instead, the first executable is used to open a new window.

Expected Results:
two different executables running side by side, showing their proper version in title bar of respective window and about box.

I understand having one executable for all window of the same versions, but if I want to test a page on different versions, tough luck.
