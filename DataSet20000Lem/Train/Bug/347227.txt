1. Missing MSAA Name property for all cookie property

Steps to recreate:
1. Open Tools-Options dialog (press Alt+T, then "O")

6. Press Tab to move to the cookie property (Name, Content, Domain, Path, etc.)
7. Note the Inspect Objects output for each of the properties: The MSAA Name = "" (null). Each property should contain a meaningful label. The Name property should be the same a the field label, i.e., "Name", "Content", "Domain", "Path", "Send For", and "Expires".
8. If running JAWS screen reader, note JAWS doe not read the label.

Expected results:
1. The MSAA Name property should be set for all User Interface elements.
