Background: The password manager is incapable of storing zero length password a the password field is mandatory in nsILoginManager [1].

When a user enters a username but no password into a BasicAuth dialog, the password manager still appears asking if the user would like to store the password. Clicking 'Remember Password' doe nothing and the Remember Password bar doe not disappear.

The eror reported in the JavaScript console (when signon.debug is enabled) is:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "'Can't add a login with a null or empty password.' when calling method: [nsILoginManager::addLogin]" nsresult: "0x8057001e (NS_ERROR_XPC_JS_THREW_STRING)" location: "JS frame :: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox%203/components/nsLoginManagerPrompter.js :: anonymous :: line 628" data: no]

The password manager should either not offer to remember zero length password (possibly offering a friendly notice saying that it cannot store zero length passwords), or it should be modified so it can accept zero length passwords.

2. Enter the username 'guest' and a blank password.
3. Click the 'Remember' button when the password manager asks if you'd like to store the password.

You can view the error in the Javascript console by setting signon.debug to true in about:config.
Actual Results:
The 'Remember' button ha no effect and the remember password bar remains.

Expected Results:
Either the password get remembered, or the browser reminds the user that blank password cannot be stored.
