When i visited www.beeld.com, firefox, for some unknown reason, resized to a
rectangular shape that wa had a short length, however covered the width of the
screen. I managed, by exiting and entering Firefox, to return the browser to
full screen, however all pop-up window are resized rectangular, and I'm unable
to resize these manually since "resize" in the right-click menu is disabled on
the pop-up windows, and nothing fit in these pop-up window
