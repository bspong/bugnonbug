I connect to Cisco 3000 series VPN concentrator for system administration purposes. One of the option on the admin page is to view a 'live event log' window that load a small java app.This worked fine in FF2 but when I upgraded to FF3 it doesn't As soon a the java app window appears the app show a 'connection lost' message and the admin connection to the concentrator get disconnected and I am returned to the admin login page. Java plugin version is 1.6.0_33 for Netscape Navigator (DLL Helper). The java console doesn't show any activity. Just the header info a below.
