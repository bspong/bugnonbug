Greeting from China mainland first because the software "Thunder" is mainly used in China.
Here is the background: "Thunder" A.K.A. "xunlei" is a popular download tool in China, you can find detail info from here: http://dl.xunlei.com/xl7.html
Thunder ha a add-on for Firefox to enable right-click context menu download, named "Thunder extension", this add-on provides "down by thunder" and "down them all by thunder"
these two function work perfect in other websites, but in http://bbs.sfileydy.com/ it(I mean Firefox) just crash when I use "down them all by thunder"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install Thunder(a.k.a xunlei) from here: http://dl.xunlei.com/xl7.html and install the add-on "Thunder extension"
2.go to page http://bbs.sfileydy.com/viewthread.php?tid=135832&extra=page%3D1%26amp%3Bfilter%3Dtype%26amp%3Btypeid%3D641
3.find emule download link in floor 2, there are 6 link there, named "Spooks.Season2.EP01_S-Files.rmvb" and so on
4.right click at white space and choose "down them all by thunder"(you may have to translate to Chinese when you reproduce thie scene)
5.and our lovely Firefox just crash, tip are:VC++ runtime error
Actual Results:
our lovely Firefox just crash, tip are:VC++ runtime error

Expected Results:
Firefox should pas all the download link to "Thunder"
this function work perfect in other website but cause crash in http://bbs.sfileydy.com/
