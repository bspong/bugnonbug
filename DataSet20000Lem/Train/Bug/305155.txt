Can't print any web page

When I try to print any web page, everything look like it go ok but nothing
go into the print queue and nothing prints. The print dialog find my
printer and the splash screen progress bar show that it prints. I can print to
a p file just fine and print preview work a well.

I can print from all other apps (open office, gedit, evolution, etc).

I am using fedora core 4 and gnome 2.10.

I have:
cup 1:1.1.23-15.1
gimp-print ijs driver
epson stylus color 600 printer

I really don't know that this is a Firefox issue but it seems to have started
after I upgraded to mozilla 37:1.7.10-15.1.

I don't know what else to provide. Any help will be appreciated.
