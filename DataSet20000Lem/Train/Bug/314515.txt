after a few week since version 1.5 (now at v. 1.7) firefox begin to lose functionality. For example, my tab button on my keyboard won't work in form using firefox, but it work in IE or text.
Pages won't load anymore, site are blocked.
Also, the speed of firefox diminishes over time, even if I clear all my cache and history etc.
Clearing history, also remove all my form information that wa remembered, when i should just clear the url.
the only workaround, uninstall firefox, delete all firefox directories, and profile information, reinstall firefox, .


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use firefox normally
2.wait for a few week
3.

Actual Results:
pc keyboard tab stop working,
site are blocked, for example uscellular.com,
mozilla start crashing, or freezing up (one site might begin to use all my available pc RAM + more over time,
java script won't work anymore,
java script pop ups wont appear anymore,


Expected Results:
tab key should work in forms,
site should load, because I have nothing to block them,
mozilla should not crash,
it should steall all my available RAM + more ( ihave 512 and sometimes firefox will steal 800 or more)
java script should work all the time
