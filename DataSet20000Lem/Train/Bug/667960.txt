By using drag'n'drop file upload the memory usage increased up to 2.7 GB - page refreshing and tab closing didn't help.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0
Build ID: 20110615151330

Steps to reproduce:

I wrote a j library to provide easy-to-use drag'n'drop file uploads (cross browser).

This library will show thumbnail of the image to upload. It creates an objectURL (if available) or it read the image a a DataURL. It show this thumbnail and put the file to an array to upload.
Next it will upload the image (using FormData) but maximum two at the same time.


Actual results:

The memory usage increased imediately and it wa not going to decrease again.
If I close the tab where I put the files, the memory usage decrease only ~1kb (I think firefox free the document and the variable in JS/DOM). The file stay in ram. Even if I don't preview the file (only upload via FormData), the ram increase and stay up.


Expected results:

The file should be uploaded and then the file should be free (the preview image in my example are only displayed until the file upload ha finished). The latest point to remove the file from the memory - I think - is by closing the tab or leaving the page.

Better alternative: the file shouldn't be read into ram until the code says: "read it" - or only up to a maximum size (what if i want to drop a 1 Gb file?). At least if the code doe only upload the file (for example like this:)
- for each (dropped) file:
- check the mime type
- push it to a FormData-object
- send the FormData via xhr

I'm sorry for my english - I hope you'll understand.
