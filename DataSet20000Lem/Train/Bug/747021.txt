User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20120419 Firefox/13.0a2
Build ID: 20120419042011

Steps to reproduce:

Converts character typed in an outlook email to incorrect character when email is sent out.
Example phrase: Wasn't sent OK is sent a Wasnâ€™t sentÂ OKÂ Â Â (where Â wa a space bar key). This happens on newly created email and forwarded from others. In previous updates, it wa intermittent. NOW IT IS SOLID FAILURE


Actual results:

Types ok on screen. In the sent file ha wrong characters, the receiver get wrong characters, view the same sent email in an online mailbox - character are wring BUT different than what outlook show they a (the single quote is now a question mark, where in outlook is is French a, euro symbol and a trademark symbol. Had this problem month ago, many update to Aurora, ha come back in last 2 updates. Now running 13.0a2 (2012-04-19), Windows 7, Outlook 2010. Seems ok using 13.0a2 (2012-03-19)


Expected results:

Correct encoding of characters. - seems to be isolated to the punctuation. SOLID BUG
