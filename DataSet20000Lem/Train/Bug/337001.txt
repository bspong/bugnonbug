The summary say it all, really. I can declare a class for a select or option, but a far a I can tell, it's totally ignored. If I embed the same stylistic value in a style= tag, though, that appears to work (I've not done any real investigation).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Define a class in a cs sheet, apply the class to a select, observe output
2. Define an embedded style with the same value a are in the class, observe output
3.



Expected Results:
I expected the <select> and it <option>s to reflect the stylistic value defined by the class, but they didn't.

I've listed this bug at the 'normal' level rather than 'trivial' because select/option seem to be the only html operator that are unresponsive to cs class definition (I might be wrong about that; I've not tried to investigate every operator). Also, having to insert an explicit style description in every instance of those operator is a bad idea on a number of levels.
