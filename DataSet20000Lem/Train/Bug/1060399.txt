[markup view] Isolate a node
Feature request:

- Right click on a node in the markup-view
- Select "Isolate node"
==> The markup-view refreshes and now show the selected node a root.

This feature should help when wanting to focus on a given part of the DOM and not be distracted by the rest.

To go back to the normal root node, there could be multiple ways:
- right-click the node again and choose "Un-isolate node"
- choose another node from the page
- navigate in the breadcrumb widget
- maybe there should be a button in the markup-view (kind of like the "show more nodes" button) too

I had a quick look at the code and didn't find an immediate solution for this, but I'm pretty sure this is possible.

We can either do this on the client-side by reusing the "new-root" event that is sent by the WalkerFront. Adding a new function along these line could work:

setNodeAsRoot: function(node) {
this._createRootNodePromise();
this.rootNode = node;
this._rootNodeDeferred.resolve(this.rootNode);
},

Or we can do this on the server-side, by mimicking the way the iframe selection mechanism works, which basically is faking will-navigate/navigate event except that in our case, we wouldn't be navigating to a window but to a node.
Reusing this might be easier in term of amount of code, but it feel more hacky to pretend to be navigating to a new window.

There's a few roadblock in the way a I think both our actor and markup-view code assume that top level node are document node (also the default selection code assumes that a <body> node exists).

See also bug 979344 for which we would need the markup-view to be able to display part of a DOM tree too, not the whole document.
