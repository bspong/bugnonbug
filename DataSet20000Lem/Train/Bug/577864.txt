When I search for something in the google search engine, I press the search button on Google but I don't get my results. I then have to press refresh, and then it go to my results.

This seems to happen every time, and I need to press refresh to get search results. I'm not sure what the problem is.

I wasn't sure if this would be firefox's problem or not. But I know that my dad recently installed bluecoat k9 web filter, and so I'm not sure if that is their problem that they need to fix, but I wa just letting you (firefox) know. I will email this to them a well, and also to google just in case.
