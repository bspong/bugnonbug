When activated the option smooth scrolling the temperature of the memory
controller suddenly produce peaks, forcing the fan to power up to 100% for a
few seconds, scrolling with this option checked force the fan to work at 100%
for the whole time of scrolling.
Disabling this option make the fan and the memory controller bahave a
expected, with scrolling and without.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. activate option
2. scroll through a website
3. listen to the fan or check temp/fan with hardwaremonitor

Actual Results:
It seems, that for whatever reason the memory controller is overloaded during
the scrolling.

Expected Results:
The SW should use only a much load on the chip a is required so that the fan
ha not to power up to 100%.

I could mention, that due to the high main processor capacity of 2*2.5GHz some
timing inside the smooth scrolling code overload the memory controller
resulting in the described behaviour.
