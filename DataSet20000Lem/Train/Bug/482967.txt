After browsing, closing the browser and starting it again later, selecting Tools->Clear Private Data sometimes doe not clear browsing history, cache and cookies. Previously-visited site appear in the browsing history (to be clear: I am referring to non-bookmarked sites!), the cache directory is unchanged, and site preference that are stored in cooky persist.

I noticed the bug occurs especially right after the browser ha started. If I wait for, say, 20 seconds, private data is usually cleared a expected.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf the web, visit site that you do not have bookmarked.
2. Close the browser.
3. Start the browser and immediately after it start up, select Tools->Clear Private Data
Actual Results:
Visited site still appear in the browsing history pull-down, even though they are not bookmarked. Cached data and cooky from previous surfing are preserved.

Expected Results:
Only bookmarked site should appear. No cached data or cooky should be preserved.

Similar bug have been reported in the past and have all been eventually merged into Bug 423507, which wa subsequently claimed to have been fixed. I have been asked to open a new bug report. Whether it is or it is not the same bug, I have witnessed this bug continuously since I first installed a Firefox 3.* version and it is still not fixed a of Firefox 3.0.7 and may compromise the privacy of the browser's users.
