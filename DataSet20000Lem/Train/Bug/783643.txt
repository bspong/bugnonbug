firefox can't open any URL after suspend to RAM
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:14.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/14.0.1 Iceweasel/14.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

I'm experiencing someting similar to bug 470274 but I'm using 14.0.1 packaged for debian stable (Actually I see this issue since at least FF13). I have gmail and zimbra opened all the time a well other web site (I usually have around 10 active tabs). When I resume after suspend to ram, almost always firefox can't open anything. UI is responsive but no page open a if there is no Internet connection. But there is because other browser can open page at the same time. Also if I restart firefox, it start working.

Restarting firefox mean killing the firefox process, because File->quit close the FF window but do not terminate firefox completely.

Looking at bug 470274 I tried to play with offline mode. When I got FF in this bad state I enabled offline mode, one page immediately opened but any further attempt to open any page yielded an error that page can't be opened in offline mode. Trying to disable offline mode didn't help and nothing I tried made FF leave offline mode.

So to me it seems offline mode ha something to do with the issue.
