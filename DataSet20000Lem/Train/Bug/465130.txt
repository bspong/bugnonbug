When trying to save a file the window save dialog is broken or crippled in certain situations. Specific example include when downloading a file, or when right-clicking on an image and choosing save image as. When the save dialog come up, you are able to navigate existing folders. However right-clicking within folder and choosing "New" on the pop-up menu show a sub-menu that only ha "new" on it. The dialog work correctly in every other application and situation, including identical situation in both Opera and IE. the only place that I can get the save dialog to work correctly in firefox is if choose File .. Save As from the main menu to save a web page.
