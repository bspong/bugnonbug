Annoying Dial Up Networking Box Constantly Appearing in Firefox

When using Firefox in Vista, apparently if the browser loses Internet connectivity for a millisecond (even if permanently connected to Internet through a LAN) an annoying Dial Up Networking box pop up asking you to connect to the last-used DUN provider.

Same thing happens when working with Firefox offline.

Is there any way to suppress the DUN box from appearing? I don't see any Configuration setting within Firefox to handle this and I'm wondering if I'm missing seeing a setting, or if there is some setting I can make in Vista to suppress the DUN box.

Any suggestion are appreciated. Thanks.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.be connected to a constantly updating web page such a Yahoo Finance stock quotes, or work on Firefox offline
2.lose Internet connectivity (or work offline)
3.DUN box pop up apparently because FF is looking for connectivity and doesn't instantly find it
4.click Cancel on DUN box
5.assuming Internet connectivity is now restored, a is typical, FF function normally until the next millisecond outage occurs.
Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
do not want to see DUN box or any other Internet connectivity box

wait for temporary outage to subside so no need for DUN box.

better to allow a user-programmable buffer wherein no DUN box will appear so long a Internet connectivity is restored within X time. also, when working offline, obviously there is no need for DUN box to pop up ever.
