The above is how (bold) Courier, and Courier New display under all websites, on Firefox 3 and other programs. It is how I've always seen it before.

This is how it appears under Firefox 4.0b11pre 64bit. It only seems of affect some websites. This textarea appears normal. But the bold text above on the edit page- pop3 mail, Zarro Boogs found, are a this image.

I don't understand why it's rendering differently, be it my end or an intentional choice of the developers. I've noticed that FF4 is also making line height taller unless the CSS is specified.
