I get these weird rendering problem where part of a webpage get rendered incorrectly: actual window toolbars get displayed on the page multiple times, or part of page from other tab get mixed up with the page I look at. This rendering problem is illustrated by those two screenshots:

I experience such rendering problem on about 25% of the site I visit. Usually the problem is not a severe though. I viewed the same page in other browser and they had no problem displaying them correctly. I created a new FF profile and even run FF under a brand new Linux user account with no add-ons, plugins, etc. Still the problem remains. Refreshing/reloading the page and changing font size doe not help.
