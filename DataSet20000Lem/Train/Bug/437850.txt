firefox 2 wa very slow on my computer so i upgraded to firefox 3, which is 10 time faster. However the only problem i am having with it is when i try to sell something on ebay, i can write the listing out ok but firefox3 is stopping the "add pictures" pop up window from opening so you can select what picture to have and load them to ebay. I click the "add pictures" button on ebay but nothing happens. Also the same thing is happening when i go on the coral bookmaker website. I can log into my account ok and have a flutter on the football, but some game i click onto firefox 3 is again stopping the window from popping up. This is with pop up blocker turned off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.try to sell something on ebay, get to add picture button, then click it.
2.nothing will happen.
3.
Actual Results:
the same a what always happens...nothing!


The software should have allowed the relevant window to pop up on screen, it work fine on firefox2, just not firefox3. But i can`t go back to firefox2 a it wa slower than internet explorer.
