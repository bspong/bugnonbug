Printing page always print the screen layout, no matter what option button is selected.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0) Opera 7.21 [en]
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; rv:1.7.3)

When printing a page with 3 frames, Firefox print the screen layout even when
"The selected frame" option is selected from the print dialog. The web site is
unfortunately an intranet page, so I cannot share it, but the layout is like
this:

|---------------------|-----------------------|
| | |
| Frame 1 | Frame 2 |
| | |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| |
| Frame 3 |
| |
| |
|---------------------|-----------------------|

The problem occurs when trying to print "Frame 3" no matter how the page is
submitted to the printer.

Frame 3 is the result from a report query, and is usually anywhere from 3-20
page long. Firefox always only print 1 page, and includes Frames 1 and 2.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select File | Print
2. Choose "The selected frame" option
3. Click "Ok"

also

1. Choose File | Print Preview
Actual Results:
Printer print only 1 page.

for the second method

Print Preview only display one page.

Expected Results:
Multiple page should be shown.

None, a bare install of Firefox PR1 wa used. Exact same situation occured with
Firefox 0.9.3.
