I wa playing this game (http://armorgames.com/play/5228/space-attack), and every time I got to the next level Firefox would not respond to mouse clicks, although the Flash application kept running. My computer continued to run normally. If I minimize and un-minimize the window, it return to normal. This isn't the first time this ha happened on a Flash application - I just chose this example. I'm not sure, but I think this ha something to do with the plugin container - this didn't happen before it wa implemented.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Play the game until you reach a few new levels. That should do it. Sometimes other flash application cause the same problem.
Actual Results:
Firefox quit responding to mouse clicks, even right-clicking on the taskbar. The flash application continued to run. If the window is closed using Task Manager, the window disappears but appears to keep running due to sound effects. It had to be closed by terminating the process. This may point to a problem with my computer itself, however.

Expected Results:
Not frozen and continued running normally.
