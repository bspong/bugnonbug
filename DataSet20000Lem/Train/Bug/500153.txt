If I right-click on an image it brings up the sub-menu with the 'Save Image As...' option. If I click on this the screen 'blinks' (as if all icon momentarily disappear and reappear), the hour-glass come up for about 10 seconds, and then nothing happens. If I go to 'Options:General:Download Files to Directory' and hit the 'Browse' button nothing happens. If in the 'File' Menu I choose 'Open File..' nothing happens. All seems to suggest it can't open the 'file browser'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find image on a web page.
2. Right-Click on image, open 'Save Image As...' menu
3. Choose 'Save Image As...' (hour-glass icon for mouse)
4. nothing happens

1. Open Options : General : Directory to Download Files : Browse...
2. Hit Browse... button
3. Nothing happens

1. Open 'File' menu at top
2. Select 'Open File...'
3. nothing happens
Actual Results:
nothing happens, so I can't save images, or change the download location directory, or open a file (these are the thing I'm aware of).

Expected Results:
I expected the "Save File As' to open the 'Save File' dialog box
I expected the 'Browse' to open the file navigator dialog box
I expected the 'Open File' to open the file navigator dialog box


I just laded Mozilla for the first time last night. Everything else seems to work. It did at one point have a problem installing the Flash plug-in. The installation went fine. But it at first wouldn't let me just run from web site, it provided an 'manual install' button but it did nothing. Then when it put it in download manager attempting to open it warned me it wa an 'exe' type, but then said I had to provide an application to open the 'exe' (???). I wa able to install plug-in by just executing the exe on my system manually with Mozilla closed. It WILL allow me to 'Copy Image', a I'm able to then save using Photoshop (a hassle). Finally, I'm wondering it is because I use a TWO SCREEN system on a portable with an external monitor. The screen size might 'fool' it somehow (just speculating).
