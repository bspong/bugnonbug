Bug 202615 ha similar background. All important for ease of browsing in modern mouse/Keyboard/touchpad is quick BACK and FWD button or strokes. Many of these piece of equipment have dedicated button or stroke for BACK or FWD. These facility do not work in Firefox with Sony Vaio laptop or Logitech mouse or keyboard. Have tried latest version of all driver and software etc. These function work with every other piece of software that I have. For me it ha never worked with any version of Firefox. This problem is evident with Firefox and Firefox only. I would echo the sentiment of many others on the Forums etc. This function failing to work make Firefox unuseable for those of u who have become accustomed to the convenience of these quick navigation buttons. I so want to use Firefox but am frustrated by this shortcoming, I know I am not alone I hope there is a fix! From what I have read it appears to be the same with most make or brand of Laptop or Mouse/Keyboard.

Reproducible: Always
