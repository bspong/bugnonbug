ALT+Left clicking a thumbnail doe not download the full image (save link)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/535.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/16.0.912.77 Safari/535.7

Steps to reproduce:

About a week or so ago, I wa able to hold ALT on the keyboard, and left click a thumbnail, which link to a full size image, and it would automatically download and save the full size image to my downloads folder. Pretty sure this wa a shortcut for the Save Link As context menu (never tested it with other type of documents).

Using the latest Nightly 13, Windows 7 64bit.


Actual results:

Something ha happened , and now ALT+left clicking a thumbnail doe not save the full size image. I had grown accustomed to this. I also noticed that this is the default behaviour in Chrome, it also work in the stable release of Firefox (10 at the time of writing).


Expected results:

Steps to reproduce:

1. http://jsfiddle.net/fMDT6/
2. hold down the alt key and left click the thumbnail
EXPECTED:
the full size image then save to the downloads folder, without requiring the image to be opened and then saved, or right clicked and then going to save link a
ACTUAL RESULT
nothing happens, if anything only the alt key is recognised and the menu bar appears
