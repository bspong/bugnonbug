When using the web version of MSN Messenger, incoming message can freeze typing
into text fields. This isn't just an issue with webmessenger, because it freeze
text input across tabs.

For example, it's happening now. Someone is talking to me in a tab that is for
the webmessenger conversation, and I'm typing in here -- every time they send a
message, I can't type any more. My caret is still positioned in this text field,
but focus seems to have gone elsewhere (pressing backspace in the situation
cause the browser to go back in the page history).

Clicking out of the text field, then back in, will allow typing again.

Sometimes even just within a single tab, the msn messenger text input field will
lock. This is much rarer though.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have an MSN account
2. Go to webmessenger.msn.com and sign in
3. Have someone chat to you, whilst you type in the text field on another tab

Actual Results:
I couldn't type, although the caret wa still there a if I should be able to
be. Nothing changed to make the field look 'locked'.

Expected Results:
Not interfered with my typing ;).
