File system error after "Save Page As - Web Page, complete"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Some of the web page I am saving locally (both the index .HTM file and the associated directory) cannot be deleted afterward from the HDD.

I have Win XP w/ NTFS FS and the file and the associated directory are visible in Windows Explored but cannot be removed.

For example, I saved once http://www.forkparty.com/25-more-unlikely-animal-friendships/ locally as:

25 More Unlikely Animal Friendships _ Fork Party.htm
25 More Unlikely Animal Friendships _ Fork Party_files (the associated folder)

With one occasion when I tried to save the same web page, instead of the above file and directory name I got on my HDD the following file and directory names:

25 More Unlikely Animal Friendships | Fork Party.html
25 More Unlikely Animal Friendships | Fork Party_files

(with pipe"|" character added instead of the expected "_" in the file name)

When I am trying to delete them I am getting this Windows Error Message instead:
"Cannot delete file: "Connot read from the source file or disk."

These invalid entry cannot be deleted with the regular del command.

Please advise,

Cristian
