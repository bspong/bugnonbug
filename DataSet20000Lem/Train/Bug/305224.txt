In two different pages(www.thehallcenter.com,
www.hestonliebowitz.com/clients/btlj)there are very thin horizontal line that
protude from block-displayed relatively-positioned <a> elements. The line
protrude from the right-most edge of the <a> element and terminate at the
let-most edge of the browser window (portal). They appear to be the color of the
page's background-color CSS property. If I roll over the <a> element the line
temporarilly disappear, even if there is no hover effect on the element.
