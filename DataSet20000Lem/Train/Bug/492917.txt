Right click on pdf file, open with dialogue pop up, open with Evince (for now).

OK, that works.

Come back next day, right click, open in new tab, open with Evince, appears to lock up. Top show 99 % cpu usage until killall firefox-bin from xterm.

Saw previous bug report that file should not be saved world-readable. OK, that's valid. However, should be saved user-writable so FF can overwrite file second time downloaded (unless security violation) in which case FF should recognized existing file and give new name.

e.g. filename.pdf and filename{date}.pdf.

Have also gotten "can't save file -- check permission type messages".
Thx,

Kirk B.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download pdf file.
2. Open in external app (not plug-in like acrobat in ie on Windows).
3. Close app w/ pdf file (doesn't seem to get deleted).
4. Go to step one, can't complete.
Actual Results:
Top show 95 - 99% cpu usage, ff becomes totally unresponsive to mouse/keyboard.

Expected Results:
Open pdf file again, just like it did the first time.

If delete file from /tmp subirectory, can download file again.
Not sure if save file instead of open -- that seems to work ok.
