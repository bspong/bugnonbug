Some page (blogs) allow to submit a comment and keep the same URL, such a the above URL. When I want to reload the page, Firefox says: "The page you are trying to view contains POSTDATA. If you resend the data, any action the form carried out (such a a search or online purchase) will be repeated. To resend the data, click OK. Otherwise, click Cancel." But I just want to reload the page without resubmitting anything, and neither OK nor Cancel allows to do that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a webpage having the described system.
2. Do a form submission.
3. Click on Reload.

Actual Results:
Firefox open a box saying "The page you are trying to view contains POSTDATA. If you resend the data, any action the form carried out (such a a search or online purchase) will be repeated. To resend the data, click OK. Otherwise, click Cancel." and having two button OK and Cancel.

Expected Results:
The box should have a third button to reload the page without doing any form submission.

As a workaround, I can copy the URL, paste it in a new tab and close the old tab.
