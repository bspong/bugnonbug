Make "Find in this Page" start from the beginning of the document (as a default).

Currently, "Find in this Page" start searching wherever the user ha clicked
their mouse. I propose changing "Find in this Page" so that is start searching
at the beginning of the document, and, if necessary, make searching where the
user click an option in the dialog.

1) If a user is looking to find something on the page, which he often is, then
by not starting at the beginning, the user doe not know if the search ha
covered the entire page. Instead, he must first scroll to the top, click on the
top of the page, and then do the search to be sure everything is covered. Or,
he must search one time using down, and then click the up radio option and
search a second time to be 100% sure the entire page ha been covered. This
process make something very simple, much more tedious than it need to be.
2) The "Find in this Page" doe not indicate that the search begin where the
user click the mouse. Most people migrating from IE (which is the majority of
people) will expect it to search the entire page, and may be oblivious for some
time to the fact that their search are not doing what they want.

Solution 1:
Switch back to the method where it begin searching at the top of the page.
Find a you type could then be used to begin searching at a certain point. The
only downside to this, is that people might not like find a you type and/or
there may be instance where find a you type doesn't fit what the user needs.

Solution 2:
Switch back to the method where it begin searching at the top of the page, and
make this the default. However, include an option to "begin searching where the
user clicked." The only downside to this is the UI clutter it could cause if,
and when, Bug 234048 is implemented.

Other solutions?
If we need to collect some user feedback on this issue, I think we could take
some time to do that a well. However, I do feel that this is a significant
issue (especially for people migrating to Firefox) that need to be addressed in
some way.

Note, I will attach some screenshots....
