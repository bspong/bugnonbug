Firefox throw exception and close when opening new link in tab or same window. Pages not broken.

I have not yet recorded the exception number(s?), but if I manage to, I will update this (I assume update are possible) with that info.

The problem is seemingly random. Clicking a link may cause firefox to fail ("firefox ha encountered an error and need to close" or something like that). This occurs both when opening the link in the same window and when opening in a new tab.

Sometimes, attempting a link multiple time will consistently fail, sometimes it will fail the first time and succeed later on. Some link are from news.google.com, so the source is not bad, and the target have included major news organizations, website that have worked in the past (and after), and others, so the page themselves do not appear to be related to the problem.

This is also not caused by the number of open tabs. It occurs regardless of that. There are time when I can have 100 tab open over 5 or 6 window and it will work fine, while having 3 tab open in one window can be linked with a failure.

Additionally, clicking two link to different page on the same site can result in one working and one failing.

The only thing of note is that the failure always occur before the page being attempted finish loading.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click link
2.open in same window or in tab
3.may or may not fail (if fail, will fail before link finish loading)
Actual Results:
firefox will close ("has encountered an error and need to close")

Expected Results:
...not throw exception and close? Loading the page(s) would be nice.

After crash, restarting with the "start new session/reload old session" (i dont remember the text exactly)...

Sometimes after the crash, if multiple window were open, choosing to restore an old session will not open all window that were open before the crash. These window were not new enough to have not been "registered" before the crash, since sometimes they will be recovered the first time, and then if reattempted immediately, they may not come back the second time.
