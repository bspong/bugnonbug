HTTP basic auth go directly to 401 error page when foxyproxy is enabled
This is a regression introduced on 2016-09-01 between af5df7bd and d3bf9bbe, with the fix for this bug:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1266836

Steps to reproduce:

1. Install foxyproxy standard https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/
2. Ensure it's enabled (toolbar icon not crossed out, set to "Use proxy based on their pre-defined pattern and priorities")
3. Go to a page requiring http basic auth, such a http://test.webdav.org/auth-basic/

Expected results:

- Get asked for user/pass

Actual results:

- Get 401 error page from the server

Other notes:

- Doesn't happen in non-e10s windows.
- One workaround I've used (before finding out that it wa foxyproxy) is to pas the credential in the url bar, in the format http://user:pass@example.com
