If the browser window on focus lack toolbars and menu (i.e. Javascript pop-ups), starting a new browser instance make that window go blank

As an example, If you open this website:

http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2278

And click on the Comments link at the bottom of the text. It should open a new
window without any toolbars or menu (Javascript window.open() without most
options). Now, put that window on focus, and try to start a new instance of
Firefox. The pop-up window becomes blank and no new instance of the browser
appears, instead of creating a new tab like it usually does.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a pop-up window without any menus/toolbars
2.Put it on focus (as the main window)
3.Start a new instance of the browser

Actual Results:
The window went blank

Expected Results:
Either open a new instance of the browser with a new tab if there isn't any
other window than the pop-up one, or open a new tab in a normal window (with all
menus/toolbars) if there is already such a window opened, even if it is not on
focus.
