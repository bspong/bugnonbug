A script attache and infect website index files, and a few other using FF a the medium

Win XP SP2 FF 3.05


Some kind of script piggybacked on FF and either directly or with the aid of my FTP software infected my sites, ALL OF TEM. I have attached the 2 file for your reffrences, the HTML file is easy to see and the PHP file ha the same or similar code at the end. Other file were altered a well, but similar code

The only reason I wa able to catch it is because it SCREWED up the CSS on one of my site and the alignment wa off. I restored the PC, , and everything is fine now.

I am amazed that this happened, maybe you can look into it on what and how it could be done.

Also, I checked the registry and noticed many instance with word such as;
shell access
cmd

I am not a programmer but it might mean something, the main problem wa CSS. The site had no problem if I did not use the “www” in front only when the :www” wa used that I noticed the problem.
I only use FF so it had to come in a a download when I viewed a site, I did not install anything new.


Thanks,
Mitch
