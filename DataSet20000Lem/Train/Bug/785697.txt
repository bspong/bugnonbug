The comment here always talk about 'step over', but should be altered to match the string.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (dbgStepOverDesc) A very short string used to describe the
# function of the dbg step over command.
dbgStepOverDesc=Executes the current statement and then stop at the next statement. If the current statement is a function call then the debugger executes the whole function, and it stop at the next statement after the function call

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (dbgStepInDesc) A very short string used to describe the
# function of the dbg step over command.
dbgStepInDesc=Executes the current statement and then stop at the next statement. If the current statement is a function call, then the debugger step into that function, otherwise it stop at the next statement

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (dbgStepOutDesc) A very short string used to describe the
# function of the dbg step over command.
dbgStepOutDesc=Steps out of the current function and up one level if the function is nested. If in the main body, the script is executed to the end, or to the next breakpoint. The skipped statement are executed, but not stepped through
