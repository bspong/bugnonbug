After the update, I went to my bookmark and saw that they were no longer there. I'm not one to use the sidebar, it's a bit IE-ish and I never liked using that browser at all. When I click the bookmark button and the drop down menu open there are no bookmark folder to slide out when I hover over them with my mouse. It is a great feature, and one I enjoy using.

A second problem with bookmark button - there are two, a you know. One you use for the sidebar - which I usually Customize/remove and replace with the second - and the second with the slide out bookmark I describe above. That button shouldn't have word beside it when I have "Icons Only" selected. Thought you should know.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on the bar and go to Customize
2. Find the second bookmark icon and drag it to a spot by the bookmark bar.
3. If you have many bookmarks, you will not see them. But when you click the sidebar bookmark button, you will
Actual Results:
There were no bookmark in the slide-out menu, but were in the sidebar.

Expected Results:
My bookmark should have been there.
