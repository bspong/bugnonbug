I'm running Debian Sarge with the most recent updates, but with a mozilla.org
downloaded Firefox.

The window manager is FVWM 2.

Firefox had been running for approximately 6 day when the problem occurred.

I went to full screen by accidentally hitting F11, and thought I'd restore to
normal size by hitting F11 again.

Hitting F11 again removed the Firefox window, but left the process running.

That is, Firefox doe not appear in the window list of the window manager, and
is a such impossible to restore.
