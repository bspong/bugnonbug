we use custom extension for our template (we wrote the actual web server that
doe the template evaluation), this extension is .HTT . In IE and Opera, the
browser request the page from the server and it sends back a normall HTML page.
But in FireFox 1.0Preview when that page is requested, it pop up a dialog
asking me what external program to use to handle that file type, then sends the
un-expanded version of the file. I saw no way to instruct FireFox to ingnore
this file and simply request it from the server.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Unfortunately you can not reproduce the problem exactly a I am because you
don't have the same web server. But If you simply rename a normal HTM file to
HTT you should see the same behavior when you try and load that file.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
got a dialog box wanting me to choose an external application to handle the HTT
file type.

Expected Results:
make a request of the server to send the file over and then render it on the
browser not send it to a remote program.

I did try and associate the HTT file extension with FireFox but when I tried to
load the web page FireFox went into a loop opening new window over and over
again. I had to kill the process in the Task Manager.
