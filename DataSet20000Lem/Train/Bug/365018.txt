3.

Actual Results:

I've narrowed it down using official nightlies to 2006-11-12-06-mozilla1.8 working ok, but 2006-11-13-03-mozilla1.8 flickers. Regression likely introduced by https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=348304 checked in that period.

This also mean that the official Firefox 2.0.0.0 doe *NOT* exhibit this behavior, but 2.0.0.1 does.

Further, Thunderbird 2.0b1 also exhibit this problem.
