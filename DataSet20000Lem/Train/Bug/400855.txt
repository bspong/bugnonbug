Occasionally, when I have multiple web page open in tab and I close a tab, Firefox freezes. The freeze happens to all Firefox window and tabs. The only way to recover from it is to open up Task Manager and end all Firefox tasks. Then, I can restart Firefox without any problem until the next time it occurs. When I open the same page immediately after fixing the freeze, the page open just fine with no freezing. So the problem only happens occasionally and to different web page and sites.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox and several web site in several tabs.
2.Keep closing and opening tab until it freezes.
3.It only happens occasionally, so to reproduce it is difficult sometimes.
Actual Results:
I couldn't reproduce the problem but I know it will happen again, it's just a matter of time. It happens about once a day. It might happen more often when trying to close a tab that contains a web page that is still trying to load.

Expected Results:
Everything worked normally.
