When adding a new approved site from the 'protect your computer' bar->edit option button->allowed site dialog, user cannot cancel accidental delete of originally approved update sites. There is no cancel button, and escape key doe not exit the dialog. User can accidentally delete all the mozilla sites, without an in-dialog way to restore those settings.

When the allowed site dialog is spawned this way, it need a cancel option, and the tan 'change preferences' bar need to stay in the window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to unapproved site.
2. click install link.
3. click in tan 'change preferences' toolbar at the top (change allowed site dialog opens)
4. delete any originally approved update site
5. user must now save prefs, with no cancel option. originally approved site is lost.

Actual Results:
Originally approved site is lost.

Expected Results:
Cancel button and escape key allow user to return to original prefs.
Tan 'change preferences' bar remains at top of window.
