This is similar to other frame related bug like 235824, but they seem to have
too many "worksforme" a the last action on them. I cannot accept that. This
is a MAJOR problem that affect my ability to generate a website that is FF
compatible.

This definitely fails in FF, but work in IE 5.5, 6.1 and Netscape 7.1, 7.2 and
AOL. Two of my site using frame on (RedHat, QuadCPU, MySQL, PHP, Apache). One
site (http://www.badronaldstattooing.com) where the main page navbar using
.shtml page sent from a button push in "bar" to open in "main" work fine. When
pressing "galleries" button, the second set of frame for picture gallery ha
16 button sending .php file to the "main" frame. All work except for two.
They are all coded nearly identically. The one odd thing is that the two that
fail have the word "face" in the GET string, and nothing else is different from
the other button statements.

My current addon to the kickstart-1 webpage is the extraction of a .5 gb Adobe
document into individual webpage of each catalog page. I made button in the
nav-bar frame to open a set of page thumbnail button for the appropriate
document section in the target window. When you click a button in the target
window, it brings up an image of that page of the document where a person can
then enter page #, catalog#, of an item in the shopping cart.
I've barely got a skeleton of the 1100 page started, a main entry with three
button on left frame to open coverpage,eventspage and TOC in main window. TOC
brings up an "index" page where area map of some numbered item at top of index
page section are in the main window and a couple dozen section button on left.
Sections button match areamapped text at top of TOC page for target code.
All left frame section button from initial page of three button and second
level section button fail 100%.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.1. go to http://www.kickstart-1.com/dragpages/index.php
1.2. see left frame with DragSpecialties logo and three page thumbnails. Right
frame contains catalog cover image.
1.3. push any of the left frame buttons.
or
2.1. go to http://www.kickstart-1.com/dragpages/indexPages.php
2.2. See orange button in left frame, TableOfContents mapped image in right frame.
2.3. In right frame, press in area of "1. Windshields, Dresser and Touring 22-59"
You should see a new page of page thumbnail appear in right frame. That is the
correct output.
2.4. Press the orange "Windshields, Dresser & Touring" button in the left frame.
Do not try any other button because they are not programmed yet. I'm just
setting up the skeleton right now.

or
3.1. go to http://www.badronaldstattooing.com/
3.2. see all left panel button open page in right frame correctly.
3.3. press the Galleries button in left frame.
3.4. new set of left frame button and new right frame appears with right frame
item matching those button in left frame. All left frame button work
correctly excepting the "Faces/Figures" and "Skulls" buttons.

Actual Results:
section 1. All of the three page thumbnail open their target page inside left
frame instead of right frame.

section 2. Orange Windows button open target page in left frame instead of
right frame.

section 3. All left from button bring up target in right frame correctly
except the "Faces/Figures" and "Skulls" buttons, which open their target page
inside the left frame.

Expected Results:
section 1. First button should duplicate initial entry with 3 left button and
catalog cover in right, second button should bring up Events page in right,
third button should bring up page of multiple index page button in right frame
and orange button in left. Don't know where orange button went.

section 2. Left frame orange "Windshields" button should have opened up page
full of three initial left frame thumbnail and several thumbsize indexpages
button in right side frame. and reloaded all orange button in left frame.
Instead, the right frame content come up in left nav frame and orange button
go away.

section 3. The "Faces/Figures" and "Skulls" button should have brought up
their target in right frame just like other button do. Instead they open in
the left frame.

The "Faces/Figures" and "Skulls" button both have the word "face" in the
SearchCategory string sent to the target PHP code for the target frame.
<TD NOWRAP ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP><A onClick="setImage('FACES');"
HREF="/imagedb/redirect.php?searchcategory=Faces/Figures"
TARGET="main"><IMG SRC="/images/facesfigures.jpg" NAME="FACES" ALIGN=TOP
WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=30 BORDER=0></A></TD>
<TD NOWRAP ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=TOP><A onClick="setImage('SKULLS');"
HREF="/imagedb/redirect.php?searchcategory=Skulls/EvilFaces"
TARGET="main"><IMG SRC="/images/skulls.jpg" NAME="SKULLS" ALIGN=TOP
WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=30 BORDER=0></A></TD>

These are coded identically to other button and having slash is not unique.
The onClick function simply sets/clears red or green button image in left frame.

Windshields, Dresser and Touring button are coded identically to others that do
work.

In the kickstart-1 pages, all frame declaration page use this header:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">

All target code sent to target frame us this header:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd">

I read other bug description where people have suggested thing are not
enclosed in double quote like they should be. I've tried version where there
are no thing quoted or all thing quoted and behavior is same.

I worried that calling the "navbar" a "navbar" and the main window frame a
"main" and the footer frame a "foot" may have been interfering like the word
"face" doe in the tattoo site, but I renamed them to navWin, dspWin and tailWin
and the exact same error result.

IE, Netscape and any other browser I have access to, works. Maxthon performs
them correctly, then complains it can't find "self", but I do not use "_self" or
"self" anywhere in my code.
