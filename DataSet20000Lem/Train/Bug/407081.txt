When I go to www.thestar.com and click on the headline of an article to open it, frequently (almost every time) Firefox hangs.

It seems like the article I wanted to read start to load but never finishes. I can still do a few thing like close tab and close the Firefox window, but I don't think I can follow any new links. It is in a bad state, anyway.

After closing the Firefox window, firefox.exe still run in the background and must be killed using the Task Manager.

Subsequently, when I reopen Firefox, return to www.thestar.com, and try to open the same article a second time, everything work fine.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open www.thestar.com.
2. Click on an article headline to open the article.
3. If Firefox doe not hang, go Back and click on a different article headline. Repeat until Firefox hangs. It only take one or two try for me.

Once the hang ha occurred while trying to open a particular article, that article becomes "safe" to open in a subsequent session. To reproduce the crash again, you need to open a different article you haven't already opened.
Actual Results:
Firefox becomes useless, must be closed and killed via the Task Manager.

Expected Results:
The article should open.

I have only two extension installed: Adblock Plus 0.7.5.3, and DOM Inspector 1.8.1.11. I have tried disabling Adblock Plus to see if that wa causing the problem, but the bug still happened.
