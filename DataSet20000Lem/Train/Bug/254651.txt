When a Windows program try to open a link with Firefox 0.9.3, Firefox give me
the following error message in the new window and open the page in another new
window: [Exception..."Component returned failure code: 0x80004005
(NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIControllers.removeController]"nresult: "0x80004005
(NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame ::
chrome://bookmarksftp/content/bookmarksftpOverlay.js :: anonymous :: line 56"
data: no] Please note that since Windows program don't know how to use tabbed
browsing this only occurs when a Windows program need to open a new occurence
of Firefox. Please also note that I'm using an Extension from Mozilla.org that
uploads and downloads my bookmark from FTP and the error message seems to refer
to this extension.
