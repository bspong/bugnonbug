Firefox 3 always prompt to accept/reject cookie from local html file, even though "Use my choice for all cooky from this site" is checked.

My Firefox home-page is set to a local copy of my personal website, using the file:// protocol in the URL.

The site ha three "themes" using different style-sheets, and us a cookie to remember which of them the visitor ha selected.

I have Firefox set to ask me whether to accept/reject cookies, and the "Use my choice for all cooky from this site" checkbox is checked so I only see the prompt once per site.

Since upgrading to Firefox 3, my local page prompt every time, apparently ignoring the checkbox.

The online version of the site is at http://www.dansoper.clara.co.uk - the problem doe NOT occur there; Firefox correctly remembers the cookie accept/reject choice.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Obtain a copy of my website, including at least one html page, all the CSS file and the Javascript.
2. Open the HMTL page in Firefox 3
3. Visit any other website.
4. When asked whether to allow the site "file://" to set a cookie, ensure the "Use my choice ..." box is checked, and click "Allow"
5. Repeat step 2 and 3
Actual Results:
On step 5 above, the prompt to accept/reject cookie reappears

Expected Results:
Having checked the "Use my choice ..." box, the prompt should not reappear.

Firefox 2 (and earlier) did not have this problem, but it did fail to remember the cookie setting between sessions. (This may have been a bug in the JS that set the cookie, however.) Firefox 3 doe correctly remember the cookie setting between settings.
