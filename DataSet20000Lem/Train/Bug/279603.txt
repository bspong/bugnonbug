Build Identifier:

Many configuration/installation utility could do with nicer interfaces.
If they could call Firefox with a command line option to use a named pipe or
similar a it "server". e.g. Firefox -activesource pipename
Firefox could receive it first page from the script via standard in and then
send all post to the script via the named pipe.
That way a script could build a page a it run roviding a visual log of
progress in a pretty way, then offer the user a graphical set of check box
etc. which they could then submit to the script. which could again provide
output to the user via standard out through Firefox.


Reproducible: Always




I have looked for similar bug and this, 182811, is the closest I could find.
This is just an idea for a usefull feature, I dont much care how it is
implemented so long a I can write script in any of a few language and still
use HTML and CSS to provide pretty output I am happy.
I suppose it should only be an active system when Firefox is activated from the
command line, being able to submit to a pipe URL could be a security problem if
it get the link form a page on the net.
