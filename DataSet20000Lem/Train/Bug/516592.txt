I seem to have a webpage hang then have Firefox become unresponsive with a stop script message. It's occurred on multiple machine all running XP SP3 with either 3.5.2 or 3.5.3.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log into Yahoo Mail
2.Click on "Inbox" button below Welcome [User] above the News box. Web link list this a http://us.mc522.mail.yahoo.com/mc/showFolder?fid=Inbox instead of the link on the left which is listed a being http://us.mc522.mail.yahoo.com/mc/showFolder?fid=Inbox&order=down&tt=236&pSize=50&.rand=1546965033

3. Sometimes bug pop up with a Firefox hang and a "Would you like to continue running scrip on this page" dialogue box.


Expected Results:
Firefox should have gone directly to my Yahoo mail inbox.

The stop script message I receive is:

Unsure if this information is tied to my email account (I'm just an end-user and don't know html/java/jack about comp lang...) so I enabled the Security checkbox below. Sorry if there's no personal information attached to this...
