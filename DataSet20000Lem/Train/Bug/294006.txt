digest auth spread across multiple instance of the browser

Not sure if this is a "bug" or a "feature" - it just different to Internet
Explorer and I don't know which is the "correct" behaviour.

In IE, on site with digest authentication (DA), I can log on to the site a two
different user at the same time a long a I use two instance of the browser -
one for each log on. In FF the second instance presumes I must want to use the
credential I used in the first instance so you don't get asked for them again
it just let you right in! I do this a lot while developing site which use DA
and it bug me that I have to use IE all the time!

It would be OK if FF did this for tab in the same instance but not across
instances. (For clarity: by "instance" I mean a new window entirely not just a
tab in an existing window.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a site with DA
2. Hit the site and log in to it in IE
3. Open a new IE window (new instance)
4. Hit the same site (you get prompted for credential again) and log into it
with different credential
5. Try the same thing with FF - the second window (instance) just let you right in!

Actual Results:
See "Steps to Reproduce"

Expected Results:
IE let you log in a two different users. It separate the instance for the
purpose of DA. FF doe not. You can only log in a one user over multiple instances.

I have marked this a minor - however depending on what the "correct" behaviour
of DA should be it could be major. It is certainly more usefull the IE way.
