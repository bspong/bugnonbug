support nsIFileURL for "moz-page-thumb://" URLs
This will allow the imgLoader to re-use the cached imgRequest when loading the thumbnail for the same page in separate about:newtab pages.

The image loader doe check the mtime of the file, but first it ha to know the the url is backed by a file (i.e. "url instanceof Ci.nsIFileURL" must be true)

This can be done by inheriting from nsStandardURL.h, a e.g. resource:// URLs do. But the mapping from moz-page-thumb:// url to the underlying file:// url should probably continue to live with all the other page thumbnailing logic, i.e. in javascript. Fortunately it seems to be possible to inherit from an xpcom "standard-url" instance.
