unfocused window don't get focus when attempting exiting firefox and window have tab using onbeforeunload event to prevent closing them
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:43.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/43.0
Build ID: 20151221130713

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open a firefox window (window 'A') and load any page.
2. Open ANOTHER firefox window (window 'B') with at least two tabs, one including a page with "close preventing" validation (e.g. page using onbeforeunload event to prevent closing the page). An example is https://regex101.com/ Make change on such page so it would prevent it from closing. Focus on another tab of this window.
3. Focus the first window 'A'.
4. Attempt to close firefox, e.g. via Firefox menu -> Exit.



Actual results:

Firefox doesn't close, and no actual reason is apparent because Firefox doesn't change focus to the other window (B) with the preventing closing tab.


Expected results:

Firefox should have focused on the window B, with the tab preventing closing getting focus, so the user is aware that they can't close the browser until confirming the action in such tab and window.

Note that the tab itself DOES get focused within it window. But the window itself doesn't get focus if another window ha focus.
