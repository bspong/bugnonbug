I am monitoring the window clipboard to automatically archive any data I copy
to it. My program join the clipboard viewer chain to recieve WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD
message indicating the content of the clipboard have changed.

Whenever a copy operation is performed from firefox, the WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD
message is recieved three (3) times. No other application I have copied data to
the clipboard behaves in this way.

All copy to clipboard operation in firefox cause this problem. Copying from the
address bar, from page in browser and from form entry fields.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Monitor the clipboard (SetClipboardViewer API)
2. Watch for WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD message
3. Copy some text from firefox and observe how many WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD message occur.

Actual Results:
WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD immediately fire three time in a row

Expected Results:
WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD should only occur once for each data change in the clipboard.
Firefox seems to be copying everything three times.
