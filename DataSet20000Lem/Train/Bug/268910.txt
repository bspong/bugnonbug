Sorry this site is secure, but it is the only page where I can
make this problem happen.

When I right click on the page and select "Save Page As..." a modal dialog
box come up with a title of "Save Link" and the following message:

The link could not be saved. The web page might have been
removed or had it name changed.

In the context of saving a page this message doe not seem to make
much sense. I'm really not sure why I can't save this page if it ha been
loaded.
