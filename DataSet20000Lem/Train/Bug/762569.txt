Implement "FrameWorker" component to handle persistent connection to social provider
See these link for detail of the component already implemented a part of the Social API addon (https://github.com/mozilla/socialapi-dev/blob/develop/modules/frameworker.js):

The requirement are to be able to maintain a persistent connection to the social provider, and allow message passing to implement functionality such a notifications, chat, "share" buttons, etc.

The current approach is to create an empty JS sandbox/worker, and "import" desired APIs into it. A possibly simpler alternative we were considering wa to just use an iframe, since some social provider utility library depend on the presence of a DOM. That might be simpler implementation-wise, but expose a much larger API, making it almost certainly impossible to ever revert to a more restricted one.

BrowserID ha a similar setup which they call a "Sandbox":

That take the "use an iframe" approach, so we might be able to factor that code out and use it for this, if we decide to go that way.
