Slow loading of the web page/problem with IE javascript

I experience a strange behavior of the web page http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/. When I want to switch to the tab with that web page from a different tab, it take like 1-2 second until the web page appears. Even when the web page is loaded and I am just switching tabs, everything reacts immediately, except the tab with the page. Strange is, that it finally work well after few switching back and forth, but then again, if you spend a longer while (10 second is enough) on a different web page, I want to go back again, the web page show up very slowly,again.
I believe that the problem could be with the "feature"/javascript, that when you move your mouse, a "tail" of small graph is following the arrow (you will see what I mean if you open it in IE). In FF this doesn't work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any web page
2. In different tab, open web page: http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/; or http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~fan/bio.html
3. If you switch from one tab to another, the web page show up really slowly after some while (cca. 2 seconds) - even when fully loaded. Also "small graphs" are not moving with mouse.


Expected Results:
The web page should appear immediately after clicking on the tab. Possibly, also the "tail" of "small graphs" should be moving behind the arrow.
