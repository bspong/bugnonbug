Source map optimization in console due to Unique Locations
Right now, we cache multiple location call over RDP, but if we have multiple unique location for a non-source mapped file, we make redundant call to the server.

We can implement a map of URL to SOURCE_MAP_STATUS, either true, false or undefined, defaulting all logged location to undefined. Upon location resolve, if undefined or true for that URL, we continue attempt to resolve. If we get back the same location (is this possible with a valid source map? Or maybe we can also return the source meta with the `isSourceMapped` property?), then we can tag the URL's SOURCE_MAP_STATUS a `false`, and all other attempt to resolve location with this URL are just a resolve-noop.

On 'source-updated', if a valid event (passing the conditionals), we can then tag or retag the SOURCE_MAP_STATUS for that URL are `true` if the source isSourceMapped, and within `onSourceUpdated`, we resolve all current location anyway to reattempt, which would resolve to the new source mapped version.

This is a potential plan Jaideep and I discussed, but wondering if it's worth the effort with client side source mapping on the horizon.

I can explain more clearly if needed, I'm sure.
