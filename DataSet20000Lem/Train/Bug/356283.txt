The bug affect ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS (and probably Linux too - but untested). (Any operating system which us keyboard navigation indicators). It doe not affect Mac OS X.

I am using en-gb -- is this reflected in non-English or American English (en-us) builds?

It is a NORMAL bug but should be quite critical for Firefox 2.0 final -- this is a usability issue which affect user with disability and Firefox should be an accessible browser.
