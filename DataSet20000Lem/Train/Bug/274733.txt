I am using Movable Type 2.661 to run a blog. If I copy formatted text from
another webpage into a New Entry form (e.g. into the Entry Body part of the
form), it paste a expected, but if I then copy or cut a portion of the text
(e.g. a few paragraphs) and then paste the text into a different part of the New
Entry form (e.g. Extended Entry) or even into a text editor then the line feed
and return are lost -- essentially I can't use Firefox to make entry in my
blog because I lose paragraph formatting.
