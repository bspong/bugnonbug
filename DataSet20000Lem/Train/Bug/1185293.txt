"Save All As HAR" fails with TypeError: file.responseHeaders is undefined @ har-builder.js (also file.responseContent)
In a new profile with the current Nightly:
1. Open Tools -> Web Developer -> Network (Cmd+Alt+Q)
2. Go to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/firebug/u3nbmQfiMHk
3. Wait until the page finish loading (at ~37 requests)
4. Right click the network pane, select "Save All As HAR"
5. Reload the page (Cmd+R)
6. Wait until the page finish loading (at ~37 requests)
7. Right click the network pane, select "Save All As HAR"

At step 4 the HAR file is generated correctly.
At step 7 the HAR file is not created, the browser console say
> TypeError: file.responseHeaders is undefined
> resource:///modules/devtools/netmonitor/har/har-builder.js:295:5
>
> buildResponse: function(file) {
> [...]
>
> response.content = this.buildContent(file);
> >> response.redirectURL = findValue(file.responseHeaders.headers, "Location");

Also I see a similar problem, which I did not try to reproduce with a clean profile on gmail.com:

> TypeError: file.responseContent is undefined
> resource:///modules/devtools/netmonitor/har/har-builder.js:313:1
>
> buildContent: function(file) {
> [...]
> if (!this._options.includeResponseBodies ||
> >> file.responseContent.contentDiscarded) {
