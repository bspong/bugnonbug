A JAVA applet to support scanning of a document load within the calling browser window correctly but button needed for operation are not visible and are not selectable. (This also did not work under Firefox 2 but I wa hoping it would under 3.) This JAVA applet work correctly under all version of IE on the same machine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.LOGON to banking site
2.Request service which start a JAVA servlet/applet to accept scanning document
3.The scanning window within the original browser window/page open
4.There are no button visible or selectable to carry out the scanning operation
Actual Results:
scanning window appears initiated by JAVA but no button are visible and no button are selectable

Expected Results:
The scanning window should appear with control button below the window. The control button should be active and selectable to proceed with the scanning operations.

All other passive JAVA application (no buttons) seem to work correctly. This also fails on a Win x64 AMD system with Firefox 2. This JAVA application (with fully functioning buttons) work correctly under all version of IE.

The about:plugins show JAVA 1.6.0_07 with a variety of version for JAVA Applets and Beans. In the first group reported Applet (1.4.2) and Beans (1.5) from npjava14.dll. In the next group displayed, Applet (1.1.1) and Beans (1.1) from npjava11.dll and another for npjava12.dll, npjava13.dll and npjava32.dll. All show up a being ENABLED. Is that normal?

I'm using the default theme (3.0.1).

Under IE, when the JAVA application is active, the IE display of active plugins show 3 JAVA-related lines: (1) Sun JAVA Console (file = ssv.dll)
(2) SSVHelper Class (file = ssv.dll)
(3) JAVA Plugin 1.6.0_07 ActiveX Control

By the way, otherwise Firefox 3 is working great and look good.

Thanks
