When sliding the mouse over the big dark red menu on the left of the page (first option in this menu is "Primeira Pagina") the browser us a lot of CPU.

This problem happens in linux and Windows XP with firefox 2.0 and 1.5.X
This problem also happens with the Mozilla browser, but instead of using a lot of CPU, strange image appears on the screen while sliding the mouse over the menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open http://g1.globo.com
2.Slide the mouse over the big dark red menu on the left of the page


Actual Results:
With firefox 2.0 and 1.5 for linux and window XP a lot of CPU is consumed and response time is very slow. Sound and image break-up when using mplayer and mouse is slided over the menu.
With Mozilla 1.7.12 a lot of CPU is consumed and response time is very slow. Weird image appears for a short period on the left of the screen when mouse is slided over the menu.

Expected Results:
Normal menu response time and almost no CPU consumption. No interference with mplayer.

This page is working fine with Opera and Internet Explorer.
