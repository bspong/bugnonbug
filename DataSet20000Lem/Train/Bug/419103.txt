When moving the Navigation button to the file edit menu previously, all button kept the same consistent look and feel. On the latest nightly they all go to small icon even though this is not selected.

When I turned small icon on, then off again, normal size icon did resume which should have been present already, upon moving navigation button to file edit menu. Many user would of course not attempt this swap of icon size and be left with the wrong icon size, and incidentally, icon look and feel.

Small icon even when they are turned on, are not consistent with normal icon look and feel. They all return to Firefox 2 designs, this includes back/forwards where keyhole design should and could remain. Stop is no longer the cross but the Firefox 2 design, Reload, new tab, and others, the same applies. The icon should be a consistent to the normal size icon a possible not the Firefox 2 icons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click file edit menu
2. Customize
3. Drag navigation button to file edit toolbar
Actual Results:
Small icon are present, yet this is not selected. Small icon design even when present is not consistent with Firefox 3 icons, but Firefox 2 icons.

Expected Results:
The same icon size, look and feel should be consistent throughout.
