Will not keep saved password when closed and reopened quickly.

I've noticed a trend since the 3.5.x release, if I accidently close Firefox and reopen it ASAP(which doesn't always happen because Firefox.exe like to lurk in my process list for a while sometimes, even sometimes requiring a reboot because FF will not reopen with a crashed instance already running), my stored password to forums/webmails/etc... anything.. will not work. Subsequently, if you allow a minute or two after closing Firefox, and then reopen, they will work and be cookied like normal.

Also, if I run ANY full screen game that change my pixel depth, and receive a facebook chat while the game is running a the active process, Firefox crash and will not reopen for some time, again, usually requiring a reboot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close Firefox via X
2. Immediately reopen
3. Proceed to any page which you've previously stored login information
Actual Results:
Same thing. Must re-login, Firefox asks me if I wish to change the password, acting a if it know I have one already but didn't supply it for me.

Expected Results:
Use the cookie.
