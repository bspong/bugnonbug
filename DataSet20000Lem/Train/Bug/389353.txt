Larger number of RSS feed cause Firefox to send out LOTS of packet at once

I have 50+ Live Bookmarks (RSS Feeds) in my Bookmarks list. When Firefox first runs, Wireshark (packet sniffer) reveals it sends out 50+ HTTP request simultaneously, and somehow saturates the local network bandwidth (I didn't do the packet capture myself).

If I also believe the same source that told me about the packet capture, it also manages to do this at 6am in the morning when I'm sleeping and Firefox isn't running... O_o

Although I can't verify THAT, I did SEE a packet dump, and I am very close to being banned from my network for using an application that sends out "thousands of packet a second" (his words).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add lot of feed to Firefox.
2. Hook up Wireshark or some packet sniffer
3. Restart Firefox.
4. Profit?
Actual Results:
Firefox will (hopefully?) send out a large number of packet in a very short time.

Expected Results:
Firefox should limit the number of feed queried at once or cache query from past session and refresh different feed in a staggered order (IE: If we have 30 feeds, and we want to refresh feed every half-hour, we refresh one different feed a minute).

It would be nice if there were at least option to reduce the number of RSS Feeds queried at once or something... I'm sorry I don't have more concrete fact or a Wireshark dump but I can't test this myself on my network.
