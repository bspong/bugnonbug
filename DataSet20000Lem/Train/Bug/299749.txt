The Mozilla crash AND stop working (even when you reboot the machine, or try
to disable the auto-complete in setting menu)
When doe this happen?
When you got the Auto-Complete feature enabled and you type a lot (I mean a
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT) of character in a textfield, the next time the
browser try to recover that word it will crash.
And you can't disable the auto-complete feature because it crash if you do so.

The only way to fix the problem is browsing (not with mozilla =P) to the folder
where the auto-complete word are stored (I forgot the path to it) and delete
THE file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enable the Auto-Complete feature.
2.Type a lot, I mean a lot, more than k k k k character in a textfield
3.Click on the submit button (so the browser will save the word you typed to
recover it when you visit the website next time
4.Get back to the same website and let the browser show the list of
auto-complete word and see it crashing...

Actual Results:
The browser crashed, and the PC ha become 100% used by the Mozilla Software

Expected Results:
Have a limit of N character to "remember" on auto-complete fields, like this...
* if the guy type 150 char the browser save only 30 (the dev. will have to
test the limit of the PC/software and set that number)
