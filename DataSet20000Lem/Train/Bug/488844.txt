I have a large number of RSS Feeds [Mainly NewsFeeds] stored a link in my Bookmarks. These are known a Live Bookmarks.

Traditionally these would refresh whenever Firefox is loaded up, and then periodically during the time the program is open.

This doe not seem to be happening with Shiretoko, and the link from RSS Feeds from the previous session are carried forward to the new one, and not updated at start-up.

Additionally, under the old Firefox Program, when the context option 'Reload Live Bookmarks' is selected, a display box show which confirms that they are reloading.

This doe not happen with Shiretoko and so one is left wondering if they have in fact been reloaded, especially when they have not in fact changed and it is confirmation of this fact hat is required.

Hope I haven't confused matter by raining two points, if so then feel free to split the bug for clarification
