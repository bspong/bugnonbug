Firefox freeze if I multi-task when a plugin (Silverlight or Flash) is running.
When I attempt to run it again after forcing it to quit (refer to Actual Results), sometimes it may run again but Firefox freeze once again after I multi-task.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I click into either the Silverlight of Flash application.
2. I click 'outside' of the application to multi-task (e.g. view other tabs, type a document, etc.)
3. I attempt to go back to the page with the plugin and Firefox freezes.
Actual Results:
After Firefox freezes, I had to go into the Windows Task Manager to manually click on 'End Process' for 'plugin-container.exe' on the 'Processes' Tab for Firefox to run normally again.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have been able to run a per normal, and not freeze, when multi-tasking with plugins enabled.

Theme: Default theme

Plugins: Shockwave Flash 10.1.53.64, Silverlight Plug-In 4.0.50524.0
