In the "Edit this Bookmarks" dialog, if I bring up a context menu with Shift-F10, one of two wrong thing happen.

One happens while "Name:" and "Tags:" have focus. As you arrow through the context menu, all of the MSAA event fired are identical while they should describe the current item in the menu.

The other happens when you use Shift-F10 over the "Show all bookmarks" button (and others). Instead of bringing up a context menu, the dialog go away. Then the next time I try to bring up the dialog with Ctrl+D, Firefox beep and doe not bring up the dialog until a second Ctrl+D.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
a1. Start Accevent with value added to the list of attribute return
a2. With Firefox 3 running, bring up the edit bookmark dialog with ^D
a2. While focus is on the "Name:" field (Tags work too) use Shift+F10 to bring up a context menu.
a3. Look at the focus event fired a you up and down arrow in the menu. The name, value and role are appropriate for the edit box, not the menu items.

b1; b2. same a a1 and a2
b3. tab to one of the buttons. press Shift F10. The dialog go away
b4. Press ^D, Firefox beep
b5. press ^D again and the edit bookmark dialog come up.
Actual Results:
For the a sequence the focus event are appropriate for the edit box, not the menu items.

For the b sequence, the ^D in b4 beeps.

Expected Results:
When the context menu is open there are menu item role focus with the text of the menu item in the value attribute.

When the dialog close the next ^D brings it up again.



I'm not sure how this dialog is implemented inside Firefox, so I am also not sure whether I should have filed two bugs.
