Using the SHIFT key + dragging the folder to a desired position on Bookmarks Toolbar doesn't work properly.
When trying to move a folder at the visible end of the Bookmarks Toolbar it doesn't stay there. The folder snatch back to the old position immediately or after a FF restart.
Searchbar is also located on the bookmark toolbar and the Searchbar Autosizer Add-On is installed. At one occasion the searbar appeared with no space within it (width = 0).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have many item on the bookmark toolbar, so that not all fit into the visible area.
2. Try to drag one (using SHIFT + drag) from the not visible end to the visible end of the bookmark toolbar or to the second last position. that doesn't work at all. item snatch back to the old position or to the end of all items.
3. Try to drag it to an other position on a visible bookmark toolbar. if it work re-start Firefox and see if the item is still at the new position? most of the time it snatch back to the old position or to the end of all item after restart.
Actual Results:
wa unable to re-arrange the bookmark on the bookmark toolbar the way I want.
I had to put all item from the non-visible area into one folder, so that only 3 folder were in the non-visible area (in order to have a folder that I need on the visible bookmark toolbar actually appear there)

Expected Results:
it should be possible to re-arrange item on the bookmark toolbar the way I want. right now it's very hard to do that (impossible most of the time if there are many item on the bookmark toolbar)
