I have uploaded an item to google base. I had no problem with firefox 2. I upgraded to firefox 3 last night.

Now, when I click on my google base account, login, click "my items", click the edit item link the page renders, and there is a description field that ha an HTML editor in a window.

With firefox 2 this all worked fine, but since upgrading browser to version 3 I get html code in that window briefly, then the correct website render in the window, then the editor tool appear at the top and the editor window is then blank white. While blank white the page cannot be edited, so firefox 3 ha broken google base. There is an edit HTML link, that changed the display to raw HTML code which can be edited. But this worked in ff2.

There is no text in the window, select all doe not reveal anything, there are no frame or other html issues.

The google base HTML web editor is now broken.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open google base HTML item for editing
2.The page render with a blank editor window. It cannot be used.
3.This happens each time.
Actual Results:
HTML editor window in google base render briefly then blanks. Preview show correct page, but it cannot be edited. This all worked in firefox 2.

Expected Results:
HTML preview should be editable with the javascript tool above the window like in IE and firefox 2.

I suspect this bug will affect other site that have an HTML preview/editor. Like maybe eBay? It's pretty similar. The widget above are similar in function. I use adblock plus, I disabled it to test. No difference. I use the default theme. Javascript, java, all are enabled. No restrictions.
