If an element ha it's cs property set to "display:inline", and it's border is the same size a the border of it's container, it appears to have a 1px top-margin. A using "float" (only on the <li> element specifically, it will not work if applied to the root <ul>) or "display:inline-block" both force the element to fit within their borders, however the float remove the space between each <li>. The only way I can find to cause the inline element to completely overlap the div border is to set "margin-top:-1px;" on the root <ul>, which would cause problem in other browsers. This is not a problem in Firefox 3.6.x that I have seen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a div with a border at least 1px in size.
2.Create a nested <ul>(or <div>) with any number of <li>'s and a border the same size a the container div.
3.Set <li>'s to "display:inline"
Actual Results:
Strange appearance of 1px top margin on anything set to "display:inline"

Expected Results:
No margin.
