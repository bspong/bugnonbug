No Google Search option

1. Recently upgraded from 2003 to 2004 a part of an office-wide upgrade (about 100 PCs). After the upgrade, no Google Search appears in the search toolbar. Only Mozilla Add-Ons appears. Found one similar bug, but no user-friendly fix is suggested in Bugzilla or Help or anywhere.

2. When I go to Manage Search Engines > Get More Search Engines, I see no option to add Google (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browse/type:4). The standard Google internet search is a default search engine in Mozilla, so why wouldn't it appear here, allowing user to easily add/re-add it? If I go to mycroft.mozdev.org to add it, it take an unintuitive series of click to find a basic internet search using Google. Please list the default internet search at the top, if not on the initial page of search engines!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 2.0.0.4
2. Go to search field
3. Scratch head at missing Google
4. Click Manage Search Engines
5. Click Get More Search Engines
6. Scratch head at missing Google
7. Click on mycroft.mozdev.org
8. Click Google
9. Scratch head at massive listing of options. It is unintuitive to have to surf such a large list.




Expected Results:
I expected Google search to appear in the internet search/search engine by default after upgrading to 2.0.0.4. I expected to re-add the Google search engine easily.
