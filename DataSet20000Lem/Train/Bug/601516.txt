I open Firefox. I go in and make a few customizations to the toolbars (I add the activity indicator, I remove the Bookmarks button, and I select to display the Roboform toolbar).

I then close Firefox and reopen it and all my customization is still there.

I then right click on a link and say to open in a new window and the new window ha none of the customization of the original window. This also happens if I click on the icon on my desktop to open a second instance of Firefox.

Now I close both window and click on the icon on my desktop to open Firefox and it no longer ha the customization.

This happens only in the Firefox 4 beta. If I do the same thing in Firefox 3.6.10 it work fine.

3. Open another Firefox window (open link in new window or open another Firefox instance)

Actual Results:
