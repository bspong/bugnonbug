I received an eMail [in Thunderbird] that contained an embedded image, associated with an image on ...LiveFileStore.Com. Clicking on this image initiated a download which wa picked up by Fox.

Fox opened an untitled tab [as the file type has/had not been defined to Fox and/or TabPlus Addon, to avoid that untitled tab.

A download dialog box opened, which I assent to. The Fox Downloads Dialog box opened and disclosed to me that the file wa 5-6MByte, too large for the timid wireless network at the time of day I executed the download. So ....

I canceled the download, and I closed the tab.

About 5 minute later, despite that I had canceled the d/l, a MSWin7 Windows Photo Viewer popped up with the image -- leading me to believe that somewhere between TBird and Fox, and MSWin7, there is confusion when I cancel an image that is part of a email.

In case it matters, the image wa a JPEG; I did not hit the "play slide" that wa part of the email.
