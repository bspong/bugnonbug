I wa using firefox 1.0.6 with Adobe Reader 6.0.2b. I migrated to Firefox 1.5
Beta 1 (Firefox 1.4)with a clean install, and found that PDF file are not
opened in browser window. Then I uninstall Adobe Reader and reinstalled it. This
time up to version 6.0.4. (Adobe Reader 7.0 is not available for Win 98 SE,
which is my OS)Then I decided to try a newer nightly and did so with this
version. Same result. To be sure, I uninstalled firefox's newest version and
installed 1.0.6. Clean install. This time, 1.0.6 didn't open PDF from within
browser but from Adobe Reader. (By the way, while doing all these, I knew that I
had Adobe Acrobat plug-in in Firefox, from about:plugins, result wa always and
still is a follows:
Adobe Acrobat

File name: nppdf32.dll
Adobe Acrobat Plug-In Version 6.00 for Netscape

MIME Type Description Suffixes Enabled
application/pdf Acrobat Portable Document Format pdf Yes
application/vnd.fdf Acrobat Forms Data Format fdf Yes
application/vnd.adobe.xfdf XML Version of Acrobat Forms Data Format xfdf Yes
application/vnd.adobe.xdp+xml Acrobat XML Data Package xdp Yes
application/vnd.adobe.xfd+xml Adobe FormFlow99 Data File xfd Yes

Yes, 1.0.6, this time didn't open from within browser window. I looked at Adobe
Reader 6.0.4's edit>preferences>internet area. There are 4 choice and all of
them were checked. They are: "Display PDF in browser", "Check browser setting
when starting reader", "Allow fast web view" and "Allow speculative downloading
in the background". I unchecked the second one "Check browser setting when
starting reader", and Firefox began to view the PDFs within browser window using
Adobe Reader. Deciding that I solved the problem, I uninstalled 1.0.6 and made a
clean install of 1.6a1 again. But I couldn't get the result what I expected.
With that setting too, I am not able to view PDFs from within browser window.
Whenever I click on PDF link in a browser window, 1.6a1 asks if to view it with
Adobe Reader or to download it. If you say "view it", it directs you to Adobe
Reader and it's viewed there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 1.4 or 1.6a1 under Win 98 SE.
2.Install Adobe Acrobat plug-in, if necessary.
3.Check the box "risplay PDF in browser" from Adobe Reader's preferences, if it
is not so.
4. From a web page click a PDF link.

Actual Results:
Firefox asks if to view it with Adobe Reader or to download.

Expected Results:
To view it in it own window by using Adobe Reader.

Tnere's a discussion on MozillaZine forum about the subject:

People using XP etc. say that they don't have such a problem. Can it be
something related with Win 98 SE? because you can not update to Adobe Reader 7.0
in Win 98 SE. But why can we view PDFs in 1.0.6 with the same Adobe Reader
version (even if unchecking the "check browser settings...") but not in Deer
Park versions? What can the "browser setting" which Adobe Reader doesn't like in
1.0.6 be? And why situation for Deer Park version is even worse?
