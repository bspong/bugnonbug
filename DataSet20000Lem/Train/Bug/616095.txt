The game at http://contrasaur.us generally work well, but by the time you get to the third or fourth level, pause occur somewhat frequently. The game will stop, sound, input, and graphics, and stutter for several second before resuming and playing correctly for a short time. After this time, the stutter repeats, and the game resumes, and so on until the end of the game.

My "shot-in-the-dark", useless, and likely embarrassing guess is that these are GC sweep that pause the whole game. I guess this because the stuttering becomes more frequent a the number of object increases, with no stuttering or almost no stuttering for the first couple of levels, and a lot of stuttering by the final levels, where there are a lot of bad guy and weapon on-screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Play the game for a while.
2. Observe the behavior described above.
Actual Results:
Gameplay interrupted by intermittent stuttering

Expected Results:
Smooth, uninterrupted gameplay

I am using a nightly from Dec. 1 on Linux 2.6.36 x86_64. I have a GeForce GTX 285, nvidia 260.19.21 blob drivers. Toggling layers.accelerate-all seems to have no effect.
