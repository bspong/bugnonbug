Hello FireFox,

First let me say. I love your software! Way better than ie 7.
I love all your new features, tab browsing and searching engines/

However, it seems that even with version 3. It is still not compatible with 3rd party - print screening software.

Here is the issue.

I run a computer lab facility for a major college within the Brooklyn area.
Firebox is the preferred internet browser within my lab. However, due to print wastage we had to install a print screening software called print manager. From softwareshelf.com.

Print manager is designed to screen unnecessary print job using print screening filters. Before a print job is sent to a printer. Its first sent to a server where the content of that print job can be screened before printing. Within IE 7. Print job generate label or header(at the top doc or in header ) explaining what is needed to printed. Print manager scan the these label and is able filter out unnecessary print job before sending it to the printer. Unfortunately, within Firefox 2.3 and 3 this ha no effect on print jobs. in other words, print manager in compatible using this 3 rd party software.

My question is this.
Can Firefox please correct this Bug asap??!!! We have been waiting for a response for almost 2 year with no success. In addition, we just learned that
firebox ha now released version 3. I have been able to send word to sofwareshelf and they have confirmed no change since your last update. Meaning
Print manager is still incompatible with Firebox 3.

Can someone help me fix this issue?
