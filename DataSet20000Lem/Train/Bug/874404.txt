W3C implementation of getscreenshot (used by Selenium WebDriver) render incorrectly for element with position fixed.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130116073211

Steps to reproduce:

Assuming reader is familiar with Selenium WebDriver (Test Automation Framework).
1. Start a FirefoxDriver.
2. Load Soasta's demo page: http://www.soasta.com/cloudtest/demos/
3. Save the screenshot.


Actual results:

The footer is rendered at the middle of the screen.

Expected results:

The footer should be rendered at the bottom of the screen.

The implementation of the API that Firefox expose (to add-on developers) for taking screenshots, and to Selenium, which is also a W3C standard proposal (http://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#screenshots) ha a rendering bug for element with fixed positioning:

Elements with position Fixed (footer in our case) are not positioned a the standard states, Firefox render them according to a viewport with dimension similar to the screen's, and not an infinite one like Chrome/IE do (Quoting from the spec: "One way to think of capturing the entire DOM is that the user ha an infinitely large monitor and ha resized the window to allow all content to be visible").

I've opened a bug in the Selenium bug tracker first, which claim (rightfully) that this is not a Selenium bug.

Thanks in advance,

p.s. I've opened a Firefox feedback ticket first. Apologies for the cross posting.
