This bug appeared only after upgrading my MacOSX operating system to 10.4.4 version. All the bookmark written in Russian transformed from cyrillic text to interrogation sign (?????). The same wa observed with toolbar text in Russian. Moreover, when I fulfil textboxes in Russian (for example, Google search textbox), only interrogation sign appear instead of cyrillic letters. However, web page in Russian are displayed correctly.&#13;&#10;With Mac OSX 10.4.3 operating system version everything worked perfectly.
