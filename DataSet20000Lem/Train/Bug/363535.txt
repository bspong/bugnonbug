Navigation & bookmark toolbars disappear, can't be reinstated with View menu

Sometimes I find that the navigation and/or bookmark toolbars
disappear completely (only tab remain) and I can't find any way to
reinstate either of the toolbars. Checking/unchechecking entry in
the View/Toolbars menu ha no effect when FF is in this state (See
attachment for a picture that show both of these selection checked
and no Nav/BM toolbars present.)

Note: A new window can be opened and it doe have both toolbars and
they are controllable with the View/Toolbars menu checks, while the
original window remains blocked.

This bug is intermittent for me - I can't find a way to reproduce it
reliably. Possibly some website turn off these toolbars with
Javascript. But even if I open other known toolbar-friendly site in
other tab and switch to them, I cannot make either of these two
toolbars re-appear: the whole window (and all tab it contains) stay
toolbar-unfriendly for these two toolbars. Sidebars and status bar
work OK and have no effect on the missing toolbars. There are no
customizations other than adding my own personal toolbar item and
folders, all of which normally work a expected.

This bug appears for me about once a week.
