When you right-click on an image, the Save Image box that pop up should allow you, in the "Save a type:" numerous choice for saving the image in whatever format you want (ie. saving a JPG file a a BMP or PNG file). For some reason, though, when it come to JPG or BMP files, the field is left blank. I've also noticed that the button at the end of that filed produce no response at all whatsoever. The same can be said for the "File Name:" filed a well.

But when it come to GIF files, though, the total opposite is the case. There's a file choice in the field, the button at the right end of it works. This bug ha been documented more than 20 time by one user. Here's the link to the thread that talk about it:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to this link: http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/11/21/parents.slain/index.html

2. Right-click on the image of the teenage girl.

3. Chose "Save Image As" from the menu that pop up.

4. Try to, in the Save As box, use the button to the right of the "Save a type:" and "File Name:" fields.

5.Go to http://mail.google.com/ right-click on the Gmail logo (in the upper left-hand corner of the screen) and repeat step 1-4.
Actual Results:
At the CNN.com link, both the button for the "Save a type:" and "File name:" field will not work, and the former won't have anything listed in there. At the Gmail.com link, though, the total opposite will be the case.

Expected Results:
The Save As box should work the way it did with the Gmail.com example every single time.
