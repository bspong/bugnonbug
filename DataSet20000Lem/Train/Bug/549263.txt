Firefox go nut after returning from Standby

If Firefox is open and my computer go into standby mode, when I bring it back, the current open tab will bring up the page I wa on and then immediately go blank, bring it back, go blank, over and over like it ha the hiccups. The rest of Firefox is frozen at that point and the only way to stop the behavior is to close out Firefox and go through the whole reload process. This happens over and over again during a day and started when I upgraded to 3.6.

Also, I've had it crash my system to a blue screen twice, which is the first time I've seen a blue screen in Windows in years. Obviously there is something very wrong.

Reproducible: Always




I am not entirely sure if it happens every time, but today it ha happened 5 time already and yesterday several time also. Since I'm on my computer nearly all day, it doesn't have a chance to go into standby very often and it wa only today that I connected the problem to standby mode.
