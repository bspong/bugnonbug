My bookmark toolbar ha several bookmark (not folders) with long names, and
using the customize toolbar sheet I have moved the bookmaks toolbar to be shown
in the space between the Help menu and the Throbber on the right. Possibly due
to the number of links, and each with lengthy title (that are being truncated),
the throbber is being pushed off of the screen, sometimes just by a little bit
and sometimes (when I open the app fresh) - completely off of the screen! (I
shall attach a screenshot of this)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill your bookmark toolbar with five or six bookmark (not folders) each
with lengthy title that will get truncated.
2. Go to Customize toolbars and drag your bookmark toolbae from it's current
position to the blank space in the menu bar so that the bookmark bar is
situated inbetween the Help menu and the Throbber.
3. Remove any flexispaces or space from the menu bar area entirely.
4. Close and restart app, your throbber should be nudged right a couple of
pixel or knocked entirely off screen - consult screenshot for additional setup.

Actual Results:
Throbber is nudged across so it is partially off screen, or on some occassions
(usually upon starting firefox for first time on reboot) entirely off the screen.

Expected Results:
Throbber should stay in place and the bookmark toolbar should be shrunk instead.

Please see screenshot.
