(apologies if this ha been filed elsewhere. There are 200 table bug and none seemed to be a match...)

When a table, which contains form elements, exceeds the width of the current browser window, the apparent width of the horizontal scrollbar is incorrect. The scrollbar is positioned to indicate the content is only slightly wider than the window, even when the actual content (table) is considerably wider than the window.

This occurs with FireFox on Windows XP and Mac OS X and with Camino on Mac OS X. With FireFox on Mac OS X the horiz scrollbar is not displayed ("nothing to scroll")

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a table with form element in the cell
2. narrow the window so the actual table is wider than the window
3. observe the horizontal scrollbar

Actual Results:
the scrollbar should indicate that the table is wider than the window. Instead, it indicates that there is nothing "to the right" beyond the window border. As the window is widened, more of the table is exposed. However, the scrollbar continues to indicate there is nothing more to the right.

Expected Results:
there is more content to the right. The scrollbar should indicate this and allow scrolling.
