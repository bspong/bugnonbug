This happens every time. I had no problem until I installed Norton Internet Security 2008. It had worked with my previous version of NIS(2007, I believe...). The site is functional with Internet Explorer 7. Ancestry.ca help tell me that other client are having this difficulty, and it ha something to do with Norton Confidential. The site would crash with IE 7 under certain condition until I wa able to deactivate Norton Confidential within IE 7. I can't find a way to deactivate it within Firefox, nor within NIS 2008.
