Hidden window opened in firefox by website infomoneyservice.com

After running firefox a long time, i close it.
But it appeared that it wa still opened using a large part of memory.

I kill firefox, then reopen it, and 4 window open with blank page on the website infomoneyservice.com.

It appears these page were opened before, but in an hidden way, and they don't show in history.

It happened to me 5 or 6 time since 1 week before i wa able to reproduce some symptom in a systematic way.

I think this problem is also related to some interception of google results.

Now, i can detect the problem before closing firefox : when some window are hidden, the pop-up window of firefox is not normal :
- in normal closure, the closing pop-up window ha 3 button with on left side : "record or quit".
- when hidden window are running, the closing pop-up window ha only 2 buttons, quit and cancel.

When only hidden window are running in the background after i quit firefox, i can see some tcp session from firefox, for instance :

System Process:0 TCP mypc:3117 212.243.210.160:http TIME_WAIT
System Process:0 TCP mypc:3118 212.243.210.178:http TIME_WAIT
System Process:0 TCP mypc:3135 cookex1.ads.adx.vip.ch1.yahoo.com:http TIME_WAIT
System Process:0 TCP mypc:3136 mpr2.ngd.vip.ch1.yahoo.com:http TIME_WAIT
firefox.exe:1108 TCP mypc:3139 173.192.136.86-static.reverse.softlayer.com:http ESTABLISHED
firefox.exe:1108 TCP mypc:3151 fg-in-f101.1e100.net:http ESTABLISHED
firefox.exe:1108 TCP mypc:3152 193.247.193.29:http ESTABLISHED

So the hidden window are doing something with unknown websites.
