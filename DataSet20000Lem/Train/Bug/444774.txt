Important: This happens since 2.0.0.15 under MACOS/Leopard (latest version) and on Windows XP SP2, but i decided to open only one bug report. the physical system is not shared, so this happens either on my macbook and my custom build i686 pc.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some site in some tab
2. try scrolling all time
OR
3. enter some data in a textarea or input type=text field
Actual Results:
experience lag sometimes, lasting 2-5 sec with 100% cpu usage or experience the lag while typing

Expected Results:
smooth scrolling, a usual or a it wa under 2.0.0.14
same with form input

strange enough, that these lag havent happened since filling out the form field of this bug report. i wish i could switch to firefox3 but ongoing comparison of display result between safari and firefox3 on macos still show rendering/css problem with firefox3, both browser are acid proof, however. this one might be hard to reproduce, maybe some flash or javascript must be running in one of the other tab but since i did not open the same site under macos and windows, this one seems not to be website related. anyway, a method for downgrading to 2.0.0.14 would be nice too...
