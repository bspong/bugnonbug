Built in error page for thing like inability to connect to a server appear to be missing.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110411 Firefox/4.2a1pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.2a1pre) Gecko/20110411 Firefox/4.2a1pre

Whenever I try to visit a website and I end up losing my 'net connection, or I just can't seem to connect to the site's server, rather than getting the appropriate error page I end up getting this:

XML Parsing Error: undefined entity
Location: jar:file:///usr/lib/firefox-trunk-4.2a1pre/omni.jar!/chrome/toolkit/content/global/netError.xhtml
Line Number 331, Column 31: <h1 id="et_remoteXUL">&remoteXUL.title;</h1>
------------------------------^

Now, I don't know exactly what that mean but my best interpretation lead me to believe the built-in page is missing. Please look into this and correct it if necessary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to visit a website.
2. Either lose your network connection or discover the site's server is unreachable.
Actual Results:
As mentioned in the details, rather than being served the appropriate error page, I'm served an error message referring to an unidentified entity.

Expected Results:
Should get the regular error page referring to the inability to connect to the server.
