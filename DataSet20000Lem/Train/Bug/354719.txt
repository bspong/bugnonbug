function SystemSpec ()
==============================================


the new page with list of needed product should display. Instead both Firefox and Mozilla redisplay same form with all value reset to default.
When using same form in IE 6.0.2900.2180 return correct results.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill form a following:

Step 1 - select "point to point communication"
Step 2 - door/gate station = 3
mounting = flush
vandal = no
Step 3 - skip this part
Step 4 - Master station = 8
Do station communicate with each other = "Yes"
mounting = "semi-flash"
Step 5 - Check following options:
"Door Release"
"All Call/Door Chime"
"External Signaling"

2. Click "QuikSpec It!" button
Actual Results:
Displays same page reset to initial values.

Expected Results:
The page should reload with same URL address and display detail spec for the system.

As long a all information is correct (total number of unit in Steps 1-3 doesn't exceed 11), entering different option give same result.

Entering incorrect data will display a proper error message.

Correct data produce no message of any kind, just reloads the page.

I am using FireFox default theme 2.0.
