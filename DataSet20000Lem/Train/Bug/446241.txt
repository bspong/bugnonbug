While using "lucky search" in address bar I'm redirected to MS LIVE SEARCH. In my Firefox there are no setting that point in any way to "live", "msn". My default search browser is google.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type "test" in URL bar
2.Accept
3.Status 302 and live search open
Actual Results:
While using "lucky search" in address bar I'm redirected to MS LIVE SEARCH.
Firefox hac actually nothing to say, because this redirection come directly from OS (Vista). Same search address show up while doing the same thing in IE 7 (search.live.com?(...); same url-pattern;parameters etc.)

Expected Results:
Firefox should decide for himself and select user defined search engine for this task.

It happens very often on VISTA runing computer (it suck).
