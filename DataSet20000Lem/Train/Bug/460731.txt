Entering in the Range on the Print Dialog a : 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17 ...and then turning over the page and printing 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 ... result in double side page printing like this (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6) ...etc. Thereby instead of halving the number of page used to print, it keep the same number roughly, a I end up having to toss every second page. I do not have this problem with OOo (Open Office) or Konqueror. The only problem with Konqueror is that it doe not use page break and will actually cut image in half across pages. The program that I use to create this "html" page is GCstar. I am using Kubuntu 8.04 on AMD64. Since no other program ha given this problem with this particular printer (Brother HL-4040CN) I doubt it is the printer or printer driver. I will gladly supply a copy of the html page to whomever request it for testing purposes.
Thank you!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In the print dialog select "Range" and enter all odd page individually
2.After they print, turn over the paper and place it in the tray
3.In the print dialog select "Range" and enter all even page individually
Actual Results:
Pages printed a 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6... 25.

Expected Results:
Pages should have printed 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8, 9/10...25.

A print all odd/even page selection would be most handy. However, for the purpose of this application, very few people would print the way I do (save paper by printing double-sided). I think in the future I will attempt to load the file I need into OOo Writer and print from there. This is the ONLY application I have seen do this in 20 year or more.
Thank you!
