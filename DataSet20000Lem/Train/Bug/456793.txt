I have found a situation where quirk mode is triggered in FF when browsing a python WSGI application. The header and output are all correct and IE and Opera both show standard mode, but FF doe not. If the same application is browsed from a different computer, FF show standard mode.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get Firefox 3.0.1 or Firefox 3.0.2 and install on Windows XP
2. Make sure Python 2.5.* is installed
3. Run this script: http://rcs-comp.com/code_examples/ff_quirks_bug/quirks_test.py
4. Browse to http://localhost:5001/
5. See if FF is in standard or quirk mode, if in standard mode, refresh the page several time until it show quirk mode
Actual Results:
Firefox will display "test" and most of the time show that the page is being rendered in quirk mode.

Expected Results:
Firefox should display "test" and always render in standard mode.

In the test script, when a string rather than a list is returned, the WSGI server iterates over each character of the string, outputting the character and then issuing a flush(). This slows down the response considerably.

I am assuming there is some kind of metric in FF based on the connection that determines how long it should wait before testing the document for standard compliance mode. When running on localhost with a slow response, quirksmode is being triggered. When running over a network, FF wait longer, and test for quirksmode after the correct content is loaded.
