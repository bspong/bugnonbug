I have been using firefox latest version of firefox (3.5.5) for quiet some time now. I have observed with the latest version that the memory footprint of Firefox continuously increase starting from approx. 50Mb upto 250~300Mb when kept open for more than 30 minutes. Sometimes it go beyond that and sometimes Windows hang due to this.
I have checked all p2p connection setting and they are disabled in my browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Firefox window
2. Start surfing (use stumbleupon!)
3. Open window task manager by pressing (Alt-Ctrl-Del) together.
4. Observe memory foot print of Firefox
Actual Results:
Memory consumption increase from 50Mb upto 1GB if kept open overnight

Expected Results:
Memory should be stable and should not go beyond say 100 Mb

Also a suggestion, would it not be possible to have a Slim version of Firefox that will take a beating at Google's Chrome browser.
