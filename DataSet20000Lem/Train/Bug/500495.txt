Upgrade Firefox 3.0.x to NSS version used by Firefox 3.5.1 (NSS 3.12.3.1)
Firefox 3.0.x need to upgrade to the version of NSS used and tested by Firefox 3.5 (nss 3.12.3) in order to pick up some security fix for issue that will be discussed at this year's BlackHat.

In addition to the simple NSS tag change there may be PSM patch required to adopt the new version or to fix related bug -- will have to investigate what went into Firefox 3.5

It would be nice to fix this in 3.0.x before the BlackHat talk (meaning 1.9.0.12), but maybe having a fixed 3.5 to point at is good enough and we can get this change in 1.9.0.13 around the end of August and still beat any active exploit of those problems. Maybe?

Drawbacks to fixing this in 3.0 include some regressions, and being able to point at the BlackHat talk will make it easier to explain them.

1) We fixed our non-standard wildcard behavior (bug 159483). This led to several duplicate bug although everyone acknowledges we were the only browser to support that. Mostly an issue for linux-only shop where a mozilla-based browser is standard. bug 495339, bug 495602, bug 499122, bug 499647 and possibly more once we ship.

2) Bug 474606 -- EV site with CRL rather than OSCP no longer green. The fix for that isn't until NSS 3.12.4.1 which 3.0 should eventually upgrade to in order to get FIPS certification, but isn't even in FF3.5 yet. This is probably too visible a thing to break in order to fix what look like a non-problem before the blackhat talk. We'd at least need to take bug 485052

Since this is affecting user experience around EV I think Johnathan make the call when we take these fixes.
