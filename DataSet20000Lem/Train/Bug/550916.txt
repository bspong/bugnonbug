Less stable after upgrading to v3.5

I have noticed since updating my version of Firefox (3.5 and above) on 2 separate computer (work laptop and personal laptop) that the browser is crashing regularly (1 or 2 time a week). Prior to the update Firefox crash were uncommon on either laptop. There is no warning Firefox just disappears. I normally have several (3-7) tab open but will typically differ between work and home computer. When I restart Firefox I do not get the session restore option, all the session are restored automatically. The 2 laptop are Dells (Latitude 620 and 630) and have XP SP3 but very little common software.

I do not have any indication that the issue is with the Firefox software update itself other than the timing due to the issue occurring more frequently after the update and it is occurring on 2 separate computers.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tab and use 'normally'
2.
3.
