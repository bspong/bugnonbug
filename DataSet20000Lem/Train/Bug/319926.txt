V1.5 installs but previous version still active, and overwriting part of the splashscreen.

Installed v1.5,installer ran ok. Open firefox and have spurious drop menu bar in http window. Open option in tool (this is still there, though on a mac it is not there in 1.5) and get the button and a little text but no full window. It look like the previous version 1.0.7 is still being called in some way despite the apparent suscessful install.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.download v 1.5 and run firefox105.exe.
2.Open firefox ok.
3.check tool > option and get bottom button only.

Actual Results:
The address line ha a dropdown arrow and box in the right hand end. Can open tool > option and get the bottom three button and some text up top but nothing else.

Expected Results:
Address line should be clean, and the option is no longer under tool (or if it is in xp than the full option screen should be displayed)

I am running this software after downloading it through the uni system from the firefox website. It could be a problem with firewall etc , though the installer seems to work fine. Alternatively there may be something in the setup of my computer that is not allowing the full overwriting of the previous version of firefox.
