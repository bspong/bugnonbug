For the the past two or three month every time I am browsing using Mozilla, "always", after 5 or ten minute I receive an error message stating window ha encoutered a problem and must close, after a pause it close and I am back to desk top. It is so consistant that I NOW,only use Mozilla from time to time; Am I being "forced to use Explorer"? Is this a "play on one frustration" to change he use of products? I feel that is the case a Explorer doe NOT SUFFER the above mentioned ERROR report or SHUT DOWN EVER. I am 70 and surf many hour a week...
My Computer is all up to date on all front


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.SURF USEING MOZILLA BROWSER 5-10 MINUTES OR LESS AT TIMES= WINDOWS ENCOUNTER ERROR.
2.EXPLORER DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AFTER SURFING AN HOUR OR LONGER.
3.BEFORE 2006 THERE WAS NEVER A PROBLEM USEING THE MOZILLA BROWSER.

Actual Results:
RUN WINDOWS XP TOTALLY UPDATED, USE MOZILLA BROWSER, SURF NET, NEXT TRY THE SAME THING USING EXPLORER.

Expected Results:
NEVER ONCE A MESSAGE STATEING "WINDOWS HAS ENCONTERED A PROBLEM AND MUST CLOSE" WHILE USING EXPLORER.HOWEVER, EVERY TIME I USE THE MOZILLA BROWSER, WINDOWS "WILL" BRING UP ERROR REPORT MESSAGE, "WINDOWS HAS ENCONTERED A PROBLEM AND MUST CLOSE.

LET ME SURF USING MOZILLA AS IT WAS MY CHOICE; NOT FRUSTRATE THE INDIVIDUAL WITH ERROR REPORTS THEREBY FORCING THE PERSON TO USE EXPLORER DUE TO RUNNING WINDOWS XP.
