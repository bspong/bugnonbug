I do not seem to be able to pin down the proplem better than this:
On a beta-website I have a login form that asks for user name, password and a validation key. After clicking login, the user either get an error message or a session is started and the user redirected to a different page by using a PHP header redirect like this: header("Location: ...").

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Needs a login form that sends it data to a PHP script that in return will create a session and redirect the user a described above. Since the problem only appears occassionally I do not know whether this is enough information.
Actual Results:
Usually it work just fine, just sometimes firefox say "waiting for <domain>" in the status bar without actually doing anything. Closing all open firefox instance usually fix the problem.

Expected Results:
Should redirect to the page specified in the header output generated by PHP.

I have tried for hour to pin down this issue because I thought it could be due to some PHP programming mistake on my part that would produce an endless header-redirect. But since the Internet Explorer never had any problem with the same site (just tried it again for 15 minutes), I assume it is a Firefox problem.
