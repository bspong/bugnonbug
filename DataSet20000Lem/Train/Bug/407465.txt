This bug is pretty strange...
It happens always when the firefox process ran a long time.
Then it start to create new window (like popups) that display part of the content (I think mostly frame or image but sometimes also the whole site) from site that are currently opened.
On these site the region where the content wa is no longer redrawn (which lead to the nice effect when you draw other window over it ;) ).
It also happens that more than one such window opens.
Typically this happens with advertising part of websites.

When I close those window firefox crashes.
When I close the tab/windows from where the content come,... the tab/window is closed and the damaged windows, too.

I can actually "use" (click on links, etc.) the non-stolen part of the original window/tab (but not those part the went into the new windows) and I can also "use" the stolen part in the damaged window.

This happens with and without the use of tabs,...

I experience the bug for a long time now,.. probably since 2.0 (was to lazy until now to report it ;) )

I use the binary nvidia kernel drivers,... Xorg 7.3 and i use a dual screen setup but with two X-screens (0.0 and 0.1) and not with Xinerama or sth like that.

Ah,.. and btw: I think that new (damaged) window are only opened when I reload/open a new page.
But this happens very ofte because I use the TabMixPlus extension and have auto-reload set to 10 sec at some sites,... and this all the day ;)

Any ideas?
If you need further information please ask.

Reproducible: Always
