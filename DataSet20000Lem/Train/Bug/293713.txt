User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

When text is entered in a text box in a form (like the one Im using now) it can
be selected, then copied to be pasted on a different window. When the second
window is clicked, and the text is pasted, you return to Firefox and the
origional text that wa seleceted remains selected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any website with a textbox in a form feild
2. Type any text in the text box
3. Select it and copy it (I always used ctrl+c)
4. Leaving Firefox open, open a second window that text can be pasted to (MS
Notepad)
5. Paste the text (probably optional)
6. Return to Firefox. The origional text in the text box that wa selected will
remain selected and only unselects after seamingly random click-and-drags occur.
Actual Results:
The origional text in the text box that wa selected will remain selected and
only unselects after seamingly random click-and-drags occur.

Expected Results:
One clcik anywhere on the Firefox window should return the focus and window
z-order to Firefox. A second click (within a textbox) should unselect any
unselected text and place the cursor at the mouse pointer.

Problem occured with origional theme, a well a in "Silver Skin" (The only
other theme Ihave tried)
