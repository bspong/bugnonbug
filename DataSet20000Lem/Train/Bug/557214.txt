Somehow I created a state where some of the possible-to-switch-into tab are not showing, and some tab are uncloseable.

The 'invisible' tab state can be described like this:
We have tab A,B and C in THAT order.
When focused on A I press CTRL+TAB to rotate forward to the next tab.
I am seeing only C a the next tab, but instead pressing the above result in switch into B.
I am not seeing B focused like A wa when I wa focused on it.
pressing at that state CTRL+TAB again brings me to tab C.

it is like B is between A and C but I can not switch into it using the mouse.

I can not close B or any other tab for that matter.
I tried closing by pressing CTRL+W, CTRL+F4 and clicking with the mouse on the little 'X' icon on the tab frame itself.

Also when I tried moving tab using the mouse from one window to another:
The first time I dragged the tab A from window W1 to window W2 it created an 'about:blank' tab in W2 instead of A reappearing under W2.
The second time I tried dragging A from W1 to W2 it worked

This behavior happened for every tab when I tried the above.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
I noticed this happened when I first tried detaching and dragging tab from one window to another, so I believe that detaching the tab might have caused that.

I got nothing else, no idea how this state started otherwise.

After restarting Firefox and playing the the tab a little bit to try and reproduce - nothing happened, it stayed the same.

Firefox did not update when I restarted it, same version wa before and after the restart - 3.6.3
Actual Results:
Firefox worked a expected without any problem regarding any of the mentioned above.
