Firefox doe not properly handle self-extracting archives. Understandably, you
don't want to carelessly execute an .EXE file. However, self extracting
archive can normally be opened with archive program such a FileRoller,
WinZip, power archiver, etc. So, for all .EXE files, a valid option should be
to open with an archive tool. This is also much safer than current behavior
where the user save the file, click on it and it actually executes rather than
opening an archive tool.

As to the decision not to invoke .EXE file at all from within Firefox, that is
a rather dubious choice. It is actually safer if you do open the file from
within firefox but only after reading the user the riot act than to download to
disk and let the user click on it without any warnings. Actually, firefox will
invoke executable file if you click "open" in the download box but
unfortunately there is a box you can check which will suppress that warning in
the future and the warning is not harsh enough.

Reproducible: Always
