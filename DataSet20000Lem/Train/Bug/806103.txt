Steps to reproduce:

This is a random problem, but if you need to recreate it you can install some malware that attempt to change your browser setting every once in a while. This would in turn cause the alert box that is causing the problem appear. Once Firefox detects the browser setting change it pop up a message that say "An unknown change wa detected on your browser's search settings".


Actual results:

I get a screen message that randomly appears and say "An unknown change wa detected on your browser's search settings". The only way to get rid of this alert box is to close it by right clicking on it. The event handler and/or subsequent function that should be called for this message is not called because nothing happens when the user selects either of the two option that are made available by this alert message and click yes. This is why this alert box keep popping up over and over again and the user ha to keep closing it because it doe not take any input from the user a it should.


Expected results:

After the alert message appears, the browser should allow the user to select from either of the two option that are shown and then click yes because this is the intended function of this alert box. Once this is done this alert message should not reappear. If the user click on "I am aware of this change and approve it", then this alert box should go away because now it know that the user is OK with the current settings.
