This dialog pop up and suggest various source of the problem, none of which, when remedied, solve the problem. I also cannot find help on the Support forum, e.g., McAfee Security.

I am using McAfee, version 1.0.0 patch 1 (915), with McAfee Anti-malware version 9.0.0 patch 1 (4156), DAT version 6251.0000. This application doesn't offer the same preference or configuration on the Mac (OS 10.6.6) a is shown on the Support site for Win OS.

Since the security component is unavailable, I cannot access my bank or investment sites, such a E*Trade, and so on.

I am speculating a to whether deleting the browsing history (cache, cookies, etc) may actually be deleting some critical components, but again, this is an uneducated shot in the dark. I can't think of anything else I have done with the app that would have caused the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. double-click app icon
2. get alert/error msg
3. app starts, run normally, but unable to access any https:// site
4. remove app, download, re-install
Actual Results:
get the alert dialog: "Alert <space> Could not initialize the application security component. The most likely cause is problem with file in your application='s profile directory <<where is this EXACTLY? A path and identifier would be extremely helpful here>> Please check that this <??>> directory ha no read/write restriction and your hard disk is not full or close to it <<it isn't, not by a long shot>>> It is recommended that you exit the application and fix the problem <<how?? some Steps here would be helpful. The forum offer no help in my case>> If you continue to use the session, you might see incorrect application behavior when accessing security features."

Reinstalling the application doe nothing to change this.

Using the Beta build 4.0 doesn't work either by the way, bookmark are all inactive.

Expected Results:
I expect that:
1. the dialog offer more support and step to take
2. that the problem on the support site is analyzed and remedied in a more thorough approach.
