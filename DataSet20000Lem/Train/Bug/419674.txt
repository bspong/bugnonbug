Opened the Bookmarks sidebar (Ctrl-B).
Dragged three loose bookmark from the Bookmarks Toolbar into the Unfiled Bookmarks folder.
Got annoyed at having to open my bookmark to view the Unfiled Bookmarks and attempted to drag-move the Unfiled Bookmarks folder onto the visible Toolbar (at the top of the browser window). This did not create a folder for Unfiled Bookmarks on the visible Toolbar.
So I tried dragging the Unfiled Bookmarks folder into the Bookmarks Toolbar folder.
This created a folder called Unfiled Bookmarks in the Bookmarks Toolbar folder, but I can't recall if it showed up on the visible Toolbar.
The new folder in the Bookmarks Toolbar did not contain any of the bookmark from the Unfiled Bookmarks folder.

Unfortunately, I can't recall exactly what I did after that. I think I tried to drag the new (empty) folder down to the same level a the Unfiled Bookmarks folder or I created a new folder called Unfiled Bookmarks on the same level a the already-existing Unfiled Bookmarks folder. In any case, I know it wouldn't let me delete either the new empty Unfiled Bookmarks folder or the old existing Unfiled Bookmarks folder from the right-click menu and I ended up with two "Unfiled Bookmarks" folder on the same level a the Bookmarks Menu and Bookmarks Toolbar.

I closed the Bookmarks sidepanel and tried going through Bookmarks > Show All Bookmarks. Now, *both* of my Unfiled Bookmarks (new empty and old existing) are gone. No amount of Ctrl-Z undos have brought them back.

I have not tried restarting the browser yet or anything else a I simply wanted to submit the bug while my memory wa still fresh.
