Percent encoded URLs are normalized to human readable format too eagerly

Steps to reproduce:

Use a percent encoded link such a https://gitorious.org/%7Esstewartgallus on a site.
Try to examine the link by hovering over the link with the mouse cursor to see a little popup of what the link point to.
Alternatively, try to goto the linked site directly.


Actual results:

In many element of the UI the percent encoded link is normalized into a nonpercent encoded link. In this specific case this mean that the link show up a https://gitorious.org/~sstewartgallus in many element of the UI such a the URL bar. This is extremely confusing and make it really difficult to debug complicated multisite interaction such a the bug at https://github.com/reddit/reddit/issues/1244#issuecomment-72949686.


Expected results:

The URL should show up a a percent encoded URL in the URL bar and in all other element of the UI. Alternatively, the URL sent to the site when requested should be the same a the normalized URL (and not percent encoded). Either way, the URL shown to the user should be exactly the same a the one sent to the site when the webpage is requested.
