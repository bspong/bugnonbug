When the Applet loss focus(by clicking somewhere in the page or changing the tab) it's unable to regain keyboard focus when you click on it, it regains mouse focus but whatever you try on the Java side of things, there's no way to get the keyboard focus back.

Calling requestFocusInWindow() on the Applet just return false all the time.
You can even lose the initial focus of the Applet if you call requestFocusInWindow() in the Applets init() Method.

I've switched to Linux a few day ago and this is actually pretty annoying, under Windows everthing worked fine.

I've also searched the web for a solution but couldn't find one.

Also I tried both the official Java from Sun(6-15-1) and the OpenJDK(6b16.1.6.1-3ubuntu1) both fail to regain the focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the page containing the applet
2. Click somewhere in the page outside of the applet
3. Click on the applet
Actual Results:
Applet doesn't regain keyboard focus.

Expected Results:
Applet should regain the keyboard focus.
