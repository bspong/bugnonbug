No Secure Connection with Firefox but Safari ok @ site ;Firefox warning

These are the facts:

I attempted to open an account/make a purchase @ https://www.dvwarehouse.com/; however, the lock icon had a red slash through it. There wa no request through Little Snitch that a 443 port open. Despite this, I dumbly provided credit card info which I now believe went out unsecure through Port 80.

I now realize that Firefox did not make a secure connection and I take the red slash to mean that Firefox WARNED me that this wa an unsecure connection. I was/am able to log into https://www.dvwarehouse.com/ using a valid encrypted connection (according to Safari's lock icon). Firefox continues to connect me when I log into my account @ https://www.dvwarehouse.com/ with an unsecure warning.

My question(s) are:

1) Did Firefox do exactly what it wa supposed to do when it warned me of an unsecure connection?

2) On the other hand why doe Firefox deny me a secure connection @ the site wheras Safari is able to give me a secured connection, confirmed by it icon and Little Snitch permission for port 443?

3) Is it possible that this abberation is restricted to or somehow a consequence of the site? If so, why is Safari ABLE to make a secure connection? Is this at all relevant?

As you can see, I'm not a developer and maybe not concise; I don't profess to know or suspect that this is a bug. Firefox warned me through it lock icon that this wa an unsecure port 80 connection; however why can't Firefox make a secure connection at this site?
