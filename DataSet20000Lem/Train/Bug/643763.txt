I just right clicked > (from context menu) click "Bookmark This Page > ..
As Soon a I clicked on 'bookmark this page' the Menu, Navigation and Bookmark Toolbars Vanished...
I had no problem Alt+V > T > M, N, B to get them back (actually, I used the mouse for N and B after I got the Menu back)

Just FYI...
Landis.
I will make a BugZilla report..

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.right click on 'blank area' of page
2.select 'Bookmark This Page'
3.Toolbars including Menu, disappear
Actual Results:
All Toolbars (Menu, Navigation and Bookmarks) disappear.
..But, the 'bookmark' dialog box doe appear.

Expected Results:
Just the bookmark dialog box should appear and be done with it.

I have 6 window open.
One of those window contains a single page from http://mapper.acme.com/.
On this 'map' window, I have removed by choice, the 3 Toolbars just playing around, instead of F11 (full screen) so that I still have access to my KDE Taskbar which doe not appear (I have it autohide, top) when the 'full screen' window is Not the active window...
This 'map' window with toolbars removed wa Not the active window when the 'right click' incident accrued, obviously.
