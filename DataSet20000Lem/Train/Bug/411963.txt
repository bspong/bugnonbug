should we emphasize title / url in a result when we matched due to tag?
should we emphasize title / url in a result when we matched due to tag?

for bug #406255, we now emphasized the matching text in both title and url.

but if the match is due to a tag, we are currently not emphasizing either (and instead showing the "tag" icon).

Is this still desired? Should we also emphasize any matching text even when we have a tag match?

Maybe it is because the tag icon is on the far right, but sometimes I'm confused about why a certain site ha matched.

maybe we could make the tag icon "stronger"?

note, the code that make it so we *don't* emphasize on tag match is here:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/content/widgets/autocomplete.xml#1226

1226 // if we aren't matching any text
1227 // (the user ha clicked on the history drop down
1228 // or this result is a "tag" match, don't bold any matching text
1229 if (text == "" || type == "tag") {
1230 this._setUpDescription(this._url, url, this._urlBox.boxObject, this._urlOverflowEllipsis, -1, -1);
1231 this._setUpDescription(this._title, title, this._titleBox.boxObject, this._titleOverflowEllipsis, -1, -1);
1232 return;
1233 }
