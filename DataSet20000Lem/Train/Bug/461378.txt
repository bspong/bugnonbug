missing maxversion string cause FF to mess up add-on management
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-DK; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092700 SUSE/3.0.3-1.2 Firefox/3.0.3

I created an extension that did not contain a maxversion in install.rdf for Thunderbird (!) ... and this cause Firefox to keep saying that the add-on will be installed after FF ist being restarted. Uninstalling is also not possible. The whole add-on management wa broken until I manually deleted the folder containing the add-on. add-on debugging enabled showed this at startup:

*** ExtensionManager:_finishOperations - failure, catching exception - lineno: 7602 - file: undefined - [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIRDFDataSource.Assert]" nsresult: "0x80004003 (NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)" location: "JS frame :: file:///usr/lib/xulrunner-1.9.0.3/components/nsExtensionManager.js :: anonymous :: line 7602" data: no]

the mentioned line 7602 contains:
this._inner.Assert(anon, maxVersionRes, installManifest.GetTarget(newVersionInfo, maxVersionRes, true), true);

which gave the ultimate hint to the missing maxversion.

Firefox shouldn't be screwable like this just because a plugin miss a thing like this.
