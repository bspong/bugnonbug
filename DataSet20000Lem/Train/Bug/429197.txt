After starting the beta 5 all bar went wild, toolbar, bookmark and tabs. Also, some form input were displayed weirdly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install firefox 3 b5 overwriting ff 2.0.0.13
2. launch it
3.
Actual Results:
The bar and some form element look weird. See screenshots.

Expected Results:
The default OS X theme should look "as advertised".

I've run it several time with different settings.

- The first run wa over a firefox 2.0.0.13 profile. It seemed like it updated the profile, it warned about non-working extension disabling them and everything seemed fine but the look wa weird and the scroll wa quite slow. Then I browsed to firefox's bugzilla and found that some form element were displayed with black text over black background.

- Then I created another profile with the profile manager and run the beta with the new profile. The bar still looked weird. I deleted the new profile with the profile manager.

- Then I launched firefox in safe mode. The bar still looked weird.

- Then I deleted all the content of the default profile directory ("~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/${hash}.default/*"), and relaunched the browser. The directory wa repopulated, but bar still looked weird.

- Then I deleted the whole "~/Library/Application Support/Firefox" directory and relaunched. Firefox asked me to import from safari, I rejected, it kept initializing recreating and populating the deleted directory, and when it stopped loading, the bar still looked weird.

As a side note, while the browser is loading and no text is yet displayed, the bar look fine. Then the browser finish loading, the text appears and the white part are shown like in the screenshot.
