The %s placeholder parameter is now URL encoded, this break many bookmarklets.

Example, this bookmark is for doing a Google site related search:

http://www.google.com/search?q=related:%s
my keyword = gr

Fx used to substitute %s without any transformation, so if I issued "g2 http://forums.mozillazine.org" in the address bar, it would translate correctly to "http://www.google.com/search?q=related:http://forums.mozillazine.org".

Now it translates to "http://www.google.com/search?q=related:http%253A//forums.mozillazine.org" and google fails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create bookmarklet for keyword search that is based on an URL, e.g. http://www.google.com/search?q=related:%s
2. assign keyword to the bookmarklet, e.g. gr
3. issue keyword search in the address bar and inspect the resulting URL
4. resulting URL get incorrect parameter because the keyword search placeholder substitution is encoded, Firefox didn't used to do this.

Actual Results:
for http://www.google.com/search?q=related:%s, and using gr a the keyword and http://forums.mozillazine.org a the search argument,
http://www.google.com/search?q=related:http%253A//forums.mozillazine.org is the resulting URL and Google report that there is no match.

Expected Results:
Google will report two match if http://www.google.com/search?q=related:http://forums.mozillazine.org is hand-entered into the address bar

Fx didn't use to do this, it left the keyword substitution alone.
