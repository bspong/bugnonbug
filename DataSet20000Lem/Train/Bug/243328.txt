On some page containing Polish character (such a the one whose address is
given), the page look correctly on screen, but printing produce extra space
after some of the Polish characters, which make the printout look ugly and
unreadable. The archive attached contains the whole of the above page (since
it's a page dedicated to an event which ha already taken place, the page may be
put offline, so I archived it) and a postscript document produced by prinitng it
to file. Notice the extra space after some (but not all !) Polish character
(the accented letters) and that the font look monospaced instead of a
proportional sans serif. I also encountered the same behavior several time with
some other page with Polish character (using the browser from mozilla the
suite, not firefox), but it wa a long time ago and I can't locate them any more.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open one of the affected page (e.g. the one given in "URL")
2. Print it to file or to printer
3.

Actual Results:
Extra space wa added after some Polish character

Expected Results:
There should be no additional space after these character

Some page with Polish char display and print correctly. The error may be due
to some special html found on the page, but I wa unable to identify the exact
cause.
