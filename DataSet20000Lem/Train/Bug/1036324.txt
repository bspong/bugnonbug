Steps to reproduce:

1. Open a page, any page but for testing preferably something with slow-loading scripts.
2. Select an element, any element, to the DOM Inspector. DOM code view should show normally.
3. Reload page.
4. Select again an element (the same element or any other) before the page ha finished reloading, but when the DOM structure should be already loaded (e.g. some script are still loading).


Actual results:

When you select the element again, the code view of the DOM Inspector disappears, and doe not reappear even if you wait for the page to finish loading. If you close the Developer Tools and reopen it, the code view show normally, even if the page is still loading. If you wait for the page to finish loading and _do_not_select_ any element while loading, the code reappears.

The element path view behaves a expected: the element is selected, and you can use it to navigate to other elements. Also the CSS view (Rules, Computed, Fonts, Box Model) show the correct value for the element. You can also select new element by using the mouse right-click on the page, and the element path view update a expected, a well a the CSS view. Only the code view stay hidden all this time.

If you change to other Developer tabs, e.g. JavaScript Debugger, it doesn't help. Only closing and reopening the Developer Tools completely make the code in DOM Inspector reappear.


Expected results:

The code should be shown in the DOM Inspector immediately after the DOM is ready, even if the page is still loading some content or scripts.
