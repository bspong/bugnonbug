Suse 9.1 Linux box.
I have installed Firefox 1 preview manually (9.1 currently just offer and older
version).
I have ton of font installed on my Suse 9.1 Linux box. They are available to
other applications. But in Firefox when I do the following I do not get access
to these fonts:

Edit
Preferences
Fonts & Colors -->

Under "Monospace:" I have all font available (including many proportional font
a far a I can tell).

BUT the combobox for "Proportional:" remains limited to just 2 font choices:
"Serif" and "Sans Serif".

This is bad, because a lot of website (e.g. under URL) look pretty ugly with
the "Serif" font, "Sans Serif" is even worse.

I have adapted the advice from http://www.gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_Xorg_and_Fonts
and have listed all my font directory in the following form in "user.js":
user_pref ("font.directory.truetype.1", "/usr/share/fonts/ttf-bitstream-vera");

This changed nothing.

It may well be that I misunderstand the Firefox interface for "Proportional:",
but it should not be THAT hard to get good looking font for Firefox when they
ARE available on the Linux box.
Maybe the interface could be more self-explanatory or there could be a help
section added?

(I just realized that with the Windows version you also are limited to "Serif"
and "Sans Serif", but there they look good :-)

BTW: I have imported Windows font on the Suse 9.1 box.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Edit
2. Preferences
3. Fonts & Colors -->
4. Try to select a different font under "Proportional:"
Actual Results:
Limited to two fairly ugly looking choice of fonts.

Expected Results:
"Proportional:" should let me choose all available proportional font installed
on the Linux box. Maybe. Or maybe the idea wa something entirely different -
but one should somehow be able to make use of all available font in an easy way
under Linux.
