When viewing the HTML version of any FeedBurner feed, all character seem to be in wrong encoding.

When I go to any RSS feed that us FeedBurner's BrowserFriendly feature (renders RSS feed a an HTML page), the character on the page seem to be in the wrong encoding. The document's source identifies itself a UTF-8 and View->Character Encoding show Unicode (UTF-8).

Firefox doe not render the page differently even when I select an alternate encoding from View->Character Encoding like ISO-8859-1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up Firefox 3.0 Beta 4.
2. Go to a FeedBurner feed, such a http://feeds.feedburner.com/geekie?format=html .
Actual Results:
The page's character are not shown properly.

Expected Results:
The text on the page should have rendered properly a UTF-8.

The source code of the page is normal HTML and ha no character encoding issues. Also, link (in <a> tag) show up fine.
