Can pan and tilt the camera with a period, just won't tilt with a comma (or - if you're lucky - display upside down)

Press the button in the lower right corner. Name tag fade in, which are misplaced when a comma is used

The left box ha the value Shockwave creates dynamically, which apparently depend on your system Locale setting if you are using Firefox 1.5. The middle column show what the value should be, and what they are in any browser but Firefix 1.5 with the 'wrong' Locale settings. The last column is a reference that show what the value look like if the decimal symbol is set to a comma.
