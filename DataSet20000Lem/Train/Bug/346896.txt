Hi there.
Sorry to bother you, but I have a really annoying problem.
After I installed the new Microsoft Internet Explorer Beta (I use both internet browsers) my Mozilla Firefox browser is acting really weird:
When I have internet Explorer open, Mozilla keep on opening windows. It doe this both when I have Mozilla Firefox open and when it's closed, but only if Internet Explorer is open (have that one or both browser open at the same time).
I have the newest Firefox version, Service Pack 2 and installed the Explorer Beta yesterday.

The window that it open is blank every time it doe it.

I have read all the faq's I could find but can't find the problem commented anywhere. I have updated to the newest version and restarted my computer, but sadly without luck.
While I have written this message to you, it ha opened 14 new windows.

I truly hope that you can help me and possibly alot of others, to solve this issue.

I like to use Mozilla, but if it keep on doing this, I am forced to uninstall the browser.

Hope that you can help me out and thanks alot for your time - I appreciate it.

Yours sincerely

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Install the new Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 Beta3
Open the Explorer browser.
Open the Firefox browser.
Problem occurs.

Expected Results:
See what I have written above under "details".

What should the software have done instead?
It should not open new windows, unless I choose to do that.

The only Mozilla product I have installed is your Firefox - no other of your products.
