I use a wireless connection to connect to the internet. Unfortuneatly I am further away than I would like and the connection will drop out some time (far to often for my liking). If I have page loading when this happen (like about 30 time today) and it drop out and the page ha not finisheding loaded yet. There is normaly enough text to start reading the page but then the connection drop out and the "problem Loading Page" come up and I can't get back to what I wa reading! Often it is only the image that have no loaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Be stupid and install a wireless card
2.Be even stupider and move you computer too far from the router
3.Load page till the connection drop out
4.Be annoyed about the "problem loading page" comeing up on a page that had enough to read.

Actual Results:
I wa very annoyed

Expected Results:
The partly loaded page should stay loaded so I can read it.
