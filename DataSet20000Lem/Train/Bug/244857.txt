When typing in the location bar and then using the menus, the focus is lost
until the window is unfocused and refocused again (also, the Autocomplete list
behaviour breaks)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type a URL into the location bar so that the autocomplete list come up (eg.
www.google.com/)
2. Tap ALT (and make sure you let go before pressing another key) and press F
(or another shortcut letter)
3. Click on something in the autocomplete list
4. Click on the location bar again and try typing something

Actual Results:
The user cannot enter a URL until the window loses focus and regains it.
(Clicking on content of the window (field boxes, plain text, buttons, etc.)
work fine.)

The autocomplete list seems to close, but the item that is clicked doe not
appear in the address bar.

Expected Results:
The address bar should contain the URL of the item clicked on in the
Autocomplete List and FireFox should navigate to that address (as normally
happens when an item is selected from the Autocomplete list)
