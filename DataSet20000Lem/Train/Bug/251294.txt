Firefox crash when accessing this page: http://www.finheaven.com/boardvb2/

Happens about 1 out of every 10-15 visit to this page (and only this page). It
look like the error is caused by the loading of the News Viewer frame(?)
(sorry, I'm not overly knowledgeable about programming) at the top of the page.
When said crash occurs, FireFox present a message saying that it ha
encountered an unexpected error and must close. So it's not just "shutting
down" per say. It actually wait for you to ok the closedown. But every open
browser window also close out.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. From "forums home" (the linked page), enter one of the sub-forums, then
return to "forums home" by clicking the appropriate link. Might take you a few
tries, but it'll happen if you stick with it. :p
2. Also try scrolling down immediately upon reaching the forum home (scrolling
navigates the news frame).
3. Basically, if you keep accessing the Forums Home page, you'll get the error.

Actual Results:
Firefox crashed. :p

Expected Results:
Not crash. :p

Error occurs regardless of theme (including default). And I am not the only one
experiencing this exact issue (other member of this forum a well). =[ I just
got a lot of them to try Firefox. And I don't want them jumping ship before
v.1.0 come out!! =]

Regardless, thank you for creating and slaving over such a great piece of software!!
