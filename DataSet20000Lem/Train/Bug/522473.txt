I am getting an ever more frequent crash of FF ver 3.5 (most recent) of the BEX variety. It is driving me crazy. Please fix the bug, or tell me how to fix whatever is wrong in my machine. I am virus free (by Kaspersky) and Malwarebytes and have uninstalled and reinstalled FF. A crash report is copied below. Thanks
