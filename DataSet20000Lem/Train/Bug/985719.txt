Tab drag new window crash
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

This is hard reproduce. I only succeeded in private mode.

Create a new tab in private mode.
(Close other windows.)
Create a second tab.
The next step requires some luck: quickly drag out one of the tab to create a new window, but multiple times.

You need to drag out a second / third time while Firefox is still busy creating a new window.



Actual results:

I created a new tab in a private window with a click on '+'. Only one private window and no non-private window were open at that time. (zattoo.com with flash stuff running in it) My intent wa to open a second window by dragging the newly opened tab out but nothing happened. I think it wa just my hard drive taking some time?

Since I still saw the new tab in the original window (flash player didn't freeze) I tried to drag it out two more time and after a few second I got _2 new private windows_ with a new tab each. So I actually 'cloned' two new empty window from one tab while the tab in the original window remained.

Firefox crashed when I tried to access the new tab in the original window.

It took a while to start Firefox again and when it did I saw "data:text/plain,browser.startup.homepage=about:newtab" inside a non-private window.


Expected results:

Only one private window should've appeared.
