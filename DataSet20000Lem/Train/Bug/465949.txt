With Tools/Options/Security/Settings/"I submit information not encrypted" set each page is loaded, a dialog box indicating that unencrypted information is being sent, and continuing caused the page to be reloaded a a separate unique page. Navigating through link result in page stack like:
o http://www.washingtonpost.com/
o http://www.washingtonpost.com/?reload=true
o http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/19/AR2008111904440.html?hpid=topnews
o http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/19/AR2008111904440.html?hpid=topnews
o http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/19/AR2008111904440_2.html?hpid=topnews

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set Tools/Options/Security/Settings/"I submit information not encrypted".
2.Visit http://www.washingtonpost.com (An account is required for behavior).
3.
Actual Results:
See detail above.

Expected Results:
After continuing from dialog, the page should only be loaded once. Either the dialog should appear prior to page load or continuing should return to the previously loaded page. Should check that unencrypted information is not being sent prior to dialog confirmation.

See expected results.

This would only be a security issue if unencrypted information is being sent prior to the continue confirmation. Even then I would consider it a low level security issue since it likely involves cookies.

The work around is to unset Tools/Options/Security/Settings/"I submit information not encrypted".
