keyword search fails, give error page trying to load nonsense jar content
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Unlike previous FF versions, this will not search in the location box on partial domains. For example, previously I could go to www.bluemassgroup.com by typing only bluemassgroup. FF would head to the right domain.

Now if I try, I get:
Firefox can't find the file at jar:file:///C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/chrome/en-US.jar!/locale/browser-region/region.propertiesbluemassgroup

Apparently one or more archive did not get installed.

Other functionality, such a recalling previous site work. When I start typing bluemassgroup, the choice appear under the location bar and I can tab to or click on one to go to the right location.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the location bar, type a partial URL, using just the primary domain name
2. Press Enter
3. Receive jar error
Actual Results:
FF halt and display the jar error.

Expected Results:
FF to check it files, fill in the http:// plus the right extension and go to the site. It's been doing that for many versions.

I checked for update and found none. I don't have enough info to locate and manually all the missing file(s).
