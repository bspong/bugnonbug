This happens mostly when reading email at gmail.com or live.com I have to reload the page every time to get a link to work. If i don't reload the page the link do not work. I also have to reload the page to scroll the page. I Checked to see if it wa the web page using IE8 and every thing worked like it is supposed to

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.logged in to my email account on Gmail
2.clicked on a new mail link and nothing happened so i clicked it again and still nothing.
3.so i clicked on the reload on the browser after the page reloaded i clicked on the new mail link and it opened the new mail. I had to reload the page every time to read my mail old and new or on any link. I also had to reload to get the page to scroll.
Actual Results:
it kept repeating the problem after i reloaded and clicked on a link

Expected Results:
opened the link when i clicked on the link every time with out having to reload the page same with the scrolling.

at the time i did not have any add-on or anything i wa using a I got it when i downloaded it. I now have adblock and adblock helper. And somehow McAfee SiteAdvisor got on the browser. I did not install it and it is not listed a a add-on or an extension or plugin.
