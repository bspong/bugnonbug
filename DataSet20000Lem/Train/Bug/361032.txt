A portion in the middle of the ebay page is not visible, appears to have been truncated and information that should be below it is now where it should have been. But when you copy and paste the page to other application and it show up. It display fine when opened in IE and Outlook. I'm assuming that this could happen with other ebay pages, though I don't have firsthand knowledge of any others.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open url mentioned above in Firefox
2.compare to same page opened in IE
3.note difference
Actual Results:
Part of the information is not visible in FF. Correct page display in IE. Had my neighbor duplicate this problem, also. They, too, are Firefox users. I installed FF1.5.0.3 and opened the page and got the same problem. I installed the nightly version, firefox-3.0a1.en-US.win32.installer.exe, and still problem.

Expected Results:
Correctly display the full information on the page.

I found another bug that might be related but it wa two year old, #265861.

Items listed by the same user with basically the same information appear a they should. Just this page seems to be fishy.

Fortunately this wa a small $ item. Still, it caused miscommunication and misunderstanding between me and the seller, ultimately costing me more money than I anticipated. Imagine my surprise if a huge shipping price had been stated in this invisible section that I wa then obligated to pay.
