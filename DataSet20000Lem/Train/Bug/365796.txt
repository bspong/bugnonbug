Intermittent problem with text entry and selection in textboxes

Problem: Firefox occasionally stop accepting textbox input, or stop listening to keyboard entry command in textboxes.

At times, Firefox will present a textbox that contains a caret and look like it ha focus, but which stop accepting any text after a while. (Not related to max length, the current content of the textbox, etc. - it just stop responding to all keyboard input.)

At other times, Firefox will present a textbox and will accept text, but will respond inconsistently to common text input commands. For instance, it will stop responding to Shift+Cursor Key or Control+Shift+Cursor Key event for text selection, Control+X/Control+C/Control+V cut/copy/paste event for clipboard operations, or even Backspace to delete text.

When such textboxes stop responding, the only way to restore this functionality is to reload the page.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Sadly, this problem is erratic - there is no pattern for reproducing it. However, during regular browser use over the past month, I've encountered this problem approximately a dozen time on different websites. (I've also encountered this problem on multiple machines. The only consistent factor seems to be the latest build of Firefox.)
Actual Results:
n/a

Expected Results:
Obviously, textboxes should work consistently.


I've used many version of Firefox - none of the prior version seemed to exhibit this behavior.
