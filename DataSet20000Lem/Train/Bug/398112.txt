On any page which ha the vertical scrolling bar, I should be able to scroll up or down. It work with my wireless mouse, but not with my touchpad, whether it doe in IE and all Window's applications. The way I scroll with the touchpad is by touching the right side of the pad and going up or down with my finger. The special scrolling cursor doe appear a usually, but there is no effect.
This bug also appears in some others non Windows distributed application in which this event isn't recognized.
As the material with this computer is quite specific, I think this may be related, but I haven't tried with any other laptop's touchpad.
My computer is a laptop ACER Aspire3020. The touchpad driver are those provided by ACER.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use an ACER Aspire 3020 (or maybe another laptop) and launch Gran Paradiso
2. Go to any page with a vertical scrollbar
3. Use the touchpad's scrolling function by touching the right border of the touchpad.
Actual Results:
The cursor changes, but there is no scrolling effect and the cursor stay in position. In some other application were it works, the cursor go temporarily on the right scrolling bar (like in µTorrent) or stay in position (like in IE7).

Expected Results:
The page should scroll up and down. About the position of the cursor, well I don't know exactly what should be expected a all software do not handle it the same way...

Using a laptop : ACER Aspire 3020. (with Windows XP)
