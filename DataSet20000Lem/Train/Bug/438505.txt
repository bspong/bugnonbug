Hello crew,

Please feel free to contact me to troubleshoot through this issue. I am experiencing a massive memory leak in Firefox 3 RC2. Here is my version detail from Help:

"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0"

Problem - randomly opening a new site (ie. this ha happened while uploading a file to photobucket, accessing my gmail, and logging in to facebook; three sites, three different activities, no relation a far a I am aware) appears to 'crash' firefox - no activity, doe not respond to mouse or input. Bring up task manager and can see firefox.exe using 90%+ CPU with memory usage running from whatever initial state (eg. 140,000K) increasing at a skyrocketing rate - say 7 to 15 Meg per second. I have not yet let it reach the maximum of my memory capacity, but it ha reached upwards of 900,000K before I killed it.

Have tried to reproduce to no avail. It just work sometimes, doe not work others.

Might be possible to have corrupted file - I previously had RC1 installed, downloaded RC2 and ran the installer in which firefox did a version check. My assumption wa that this wa an upgrade, but I did *not* uninstall RC1 before installing RC2. I can start there, but thought best to report this ASAP a it ha been happening frequently for the last 3 day (and not before then - RC2 ha been installed since release).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit Website.
2. Flip coin.
3a. Reproduced? Go to 4. Else 3b.
3b. Works great. Go to 5.
4. Pull hair out.
5. Go to 1.
Actual Results:
Random result - either crash or no. Always when FF RC2 hang CPU use max out and memory climbs.

Expected Results:
Nothing abnormal such a this.

Critical problem to be investigated before FF3 release. Contact me for further troubleshooting if needed.
