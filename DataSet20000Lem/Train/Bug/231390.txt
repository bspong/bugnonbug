When setting option for cooky such a adding a or removing an expection (in
the tools->options dialog box under privacy) the setting doe not take effect
until firebird is closed and opened again. This is not a good thing because if
i a a user accidentally deny cooky from a site that will only load with
cooky enabled (and i have other tabs/firebird window open), then i have to
bookmark everything and restart the browser just to get to the site i wanted to
go to.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.bestbuy.com with "enable cookies" and "but ask before accepting"
selected in the privacy option dialog box
2. select "deny" cooky for the site www.bestbuy.com
3. bestbuy.com will not let you enter without cooky enabled
4. go to tools->options-privacy->cookies->exceptions and remove www.bestbuy.com
form the list of blocked site
5. refresh www.bestbuy.com (cookies are still blocked)
6. close and open firebird
7. go to www.bestbuy.com and select "allow" cooky this time. the page loads.

Actual Results:
firebird blocked cooky from bestbuy.com even though i had removed it from the
exception list until a firebird restart

Expected Results:
firebird should have asked whether i wanted to "allow" or "deny" cooky from
www.bestbuy.com after removing www.bestbuy.com from the exception list
