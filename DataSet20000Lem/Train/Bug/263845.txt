Firefox (branch) unregisters Internet Explorer a default browser but shouldn't
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/2004108 Firefox/0.10

Firefox (branch build since 20041008
) seems to unregister Internet Explorer a default browser (and doe not
register himself a the new one) although Firefox should not bee the default
browser.
So after closeing Firefox and starting IE again, IE say it is not the default
browser anymore (but only if the option to perform this check is active, if not
it won't tell you that).

This is really annoying because link from chat window of my IM (trillian)
won't open correctly anymore - IE open but show a blank side with no url in
the adress bar (just like the blank startpage but without the 'about:blank' a
url in the adress bar).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.) Start IE and make shure it is set a default browser (check out the option
in internetsettings -> program that IE will check on startup if it's the
default browser or not). If not, than make it the default browser again.

2.) Close IE and start Firefox (branch build 20041008) and make shure, that the
option for making FF the default browser is not set.

3.) Close Firefox and open IE again. You will notice that IE is not the default
browser anymore although Firefox wa not allowed to do so.

Actual Results:
- link (from instant messenger or URL files) only open an empty IE window
- when opening IE and don't making it the default browser again (because the
option to check if IE is the default browser is not set) you can not open
internet setting from extra menu in IE
