If I had opened a couple of Firefox Windows, older Firefox version have freed memory if I closed one of the Windows. The new Firefox doe not free any memory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open many Firefox Windows with many Tabs with many image in it...
2. open Windows Task-Manager
3. Look at the Menory Usage of Firefox if you close one Firefox window after the other...

Actual Results:
Memory Usage doe not decrease

Expected Results:
Memory usage should decrease, since you are not able to "go back" to the cached site anyway!

Something else I run into, is that Firefox becomes really, really slow if you have opend a lot of site with many and big images. Sometimes firefox need 1 minute or more of 100% CPU usage to open/close a simple window with only one image...

But it's not really easy to reproduce, because this happens only if you have visited a lot of page with image (takes some time...). When I look at the memory usage at that time, firefox us 300-500 MB (I have 1GB RAM installed), so it doe not swap!

Here is where I noticed it last time: http://dtm.de/desktop.php

Perhaps I can find a better way to reproduce it soon!
