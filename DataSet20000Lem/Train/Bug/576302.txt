Basically any flash video i load start to play and freezes, firefox is completely frozen.. but if I CTRL + SHIFT + ESC , then force quit firefox, when it asks if i definately want to close firefox i say CANCEL and at the same time the firefox ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO QUIT pop up... if i leave it up then the video play till the end.. if i hit cancel the video might freeze right away.. or it might freeze later on...

so basically i watch the flash video by force quiting firefox and canceling the force quit from windows, but leave the firefox are you sure you want to quit and move it to where it doesnt sit in front of the video i am watching..


great mozilla i really love how your NO-CRASH firefox version is worse than ANY VERSION I EVER USED FROM YOUR COMPANY... i am already switched to chrome because this is just ridiculous.. like a mercedes or a bmw breaking down ... it not what the product is chosen for over the next.
