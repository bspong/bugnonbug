Firefox still hang up and becomes nonresponsive on "save as..." file download selection -- why?
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140716183446

Steps to reproduce:

1. File Download - Either a) right-click on file link and select "save as..." OR b) have FF download option set to "ask me" rather than specifying a fixed location.

2. Attach file to e-mail - I use the Compuserve/AOL Webmail interface (http://webmail.cs.com/) for e-mail service. Once logged in, if I initiate composition of an outgoing e-mail and click on the paper-clip icon to attach a specific file to the e-mail for sending, the same "hang" in FF occurs.


Actual results:

In both cases, FF seizes up ("busy" cursor displayed interminably without change) and requires 3-finger salute (<CTL> <ALT> <DEL>) to bring up Task Manager and manually kill the Firefox process (or process tree), then I have to re-launch FF.


Expected results:

In both cases, FF should bring up a file directory window to allow specification of the location where a) the linked download file is to be saved or b) the file to be attached to an outgoing e-mail is located.

jscher2000 suggested most recently in the latter thread that I submit a bug report for this issue. It ONLY occurs on one of my desktop machine running Win7 Ultimate x64, not on others running WinVista Ultimate x86 or WinXP Pro, and the problem doe NOT occur with IE in attempting either action on the affected machine. The affected machine ha been regularly scoured for malware by weekly scan of MSE, MalwareBytes, Kaspersky TDSS Killer, SuperAntiSpyware, and Panda Cloud AV, plus SFC and CHKDSK have been run repeatedly both independently a well a integrated within the Tweaking.com repair tool that ha been run multiple time since the symptom first appeared month and month ago on a much earlier version of FF. I've created new profiles, reset FF to it defaults, and tolerated the impediment the problem imposes but am really reaching the end of that tolerance.
