Hi

I have recently downloaded firefox v1.5.07 to upgrade the v1.1.0(?).

There were a number of thing that concerned me about the previous version and they dont appear to have been rectified in the version just downloaded.

In general, execution of the html is reasonably competant with the following exceptions:
1) the onmouseover, onmouseout and onclick event response do not work from within a table cell.
2) the style attribute "curser" is ignored.
3) the scrollbar off/on attribute is ignored.

The javascipt ha the following deficiencies. Here are the more serious ones.
1) page contained in an iframe do not seem to maintain a pointer back to the parent page, so javascript within the iframe that refers to the parent fails.
2) If access to code to be executed on the server is required to be made it appears the only way to do this is to submit from an html form.
I frequently use javascipt to make server access thus "location.href = 'somefile.php?param1=somevar&parem2=somevar'".
This is obviously a "get" command but it seems to get this all wrong and doe not produce any usefull result.

There are a number of other shortfall in the javascript which I wont bother you with a they might be fixed in the upcoming Firefox2 release. I cant believe you havent been advised of the above mentioned error much earlier. You may have been; I just couldnt be bothered wading through the mass of verbosity on your- site.
As your browser stand at present it ha been necessary to place a warning in most of my site that site navigation may fail.
