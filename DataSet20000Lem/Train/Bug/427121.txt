After installing Mozilla Firefox 3 Beta 5, bold font in certain part of the Firefox interface show up improperly spaced (see attached URL). Characters seem very wide, and number pretty much overlap each other, making some text very hard to read.

The problem is in the interface somewhere, I think, because bold font on website render fine--it's only on three place that I've seen this bug so far: the bolded part of the auto-complete list when typing URL's in the addressbar (not shown in attached image), in the header of the selected tab, and in the error message shown on the ``this site doe not exist'' page.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) I just ran the setup normally, 2) started the browser, 3) and the bug wa already there. I know that it's probably hard to reproduce because none of my friend seem to have this problem. It should be noted that font showed improperly spaced, right when I ran Firefox 3 for the first time after installing it, i.e. there wa no point at which I did not see this bug occur.




It's weird because I've never had a similar problem with Firefox 2 nor with any other program. I'm using the default Firefox theme, and I never messed around with Firefox' theme or setting or font or anytyhing.

In offchance that it matters, my Windows XP theme us MS Sans Serif for menu's and Verdana for titlebars (although I'm not sure if those are the font Firefox actually uses). Up to this point I used Firefox 2, which is installed in a different directory, and still work fine (i.e. no bold font bug). I haven't installed any previous Mozilla Firefox 3 beta's on this system.
