We have three different signature with similar DLL name and stack that are spiking in 39.0b1, all on browser startup. The reason seems to always be 0xc06d007e / 0x00000000 with a 0x7XXXXXXX address, which might just be common for an uncaught exception (which I guess "RaiseException" at the top of the stack point to).
Even though the library name start with "np" which usually is plugins, this is loaded in an add-on (I think) via JS-CTypes.

I don't have much more clue a to what's happening there but it sound like people with this installed are unable to use Firefox at all.

David, do you have any more insight there?
