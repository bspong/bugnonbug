Ebay "forgets" I'm logged in between summary screen and item screen. Cookies?

I am an eBay seller. Recently I put a batch of item up for sale. I am logging on to the eBay system. I can look at my list of item for sale and at the top of the screen, I am shown a being signed in.

If I then select one of my item to view, the message at the top of the screen implies that I am no longer treated a being signed in and asks me to sign in again. The result is that I can never look at my actual item detail from a seller's perspective, only that of a general third party user.

Returning back to the summary screen, I am magically signed back in again.

I have downloaded the 'Op...' browser and this doe not have the same problem. Is there some kind of issue with cooky going on here? I used eBay quite a bit with FF v2 and this worked OK so at some point an anomaly ha crept in.

TIA
Ian

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in to ebay
2. View summary of item for sale
3. Select an item to view
4. I am no longer signed in
5. Return to summary screen
6. I am signed in again
Actual Results:
As implied

Expected Results:
As implied.

I should remain signed in between summary and item screen a I am with the "Op..." browser. A Win machine I use at work using IE(v?) also delivers the expected behaviour.

I cannot use FF3 for my eBay selling activities.
