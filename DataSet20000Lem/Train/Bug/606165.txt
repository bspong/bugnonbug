We've had 2 firefox in 2 day on Ubuntu Lucid. After the first, everything started going wrong: gmail won't work except in flat html mode, other page show degraded (non javascript) version - of course not all page provide these. It wa only after the second today, I realized it wa javascript, but this is enabled in the preferences, a it ha been a long a i can remember (i checked). I had to disable xmarks yesterday because it wa causing instability, and I reckon this may also have been caused by this bug, a it only started after yesterday's update.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. look at a page with javascript
3.
Actual Results:
gmail won't work except in flat html mode; other page show degraded (non javascript) versions, where provided; xmarks becomes a cause of instability

Expected Results:
gmail would work in https/Priority Inbox mode
page with javascript would work correctly
xmarks might work without causing instability/sluggishness

see expected result
