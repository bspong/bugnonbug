Environment:

Server:
-------
- Novell open enterprise server 2 (SLES 10)
- eDirectory 8.7-8.8
- Novell NSS filesystem

Client:
-------
- Windows XP Professional
- Novell client 4.91 SP4
- Firefox 1.5-2-3

We change the Netware operating system to Linux, and from that time we have different problems.

The Firefox user profile are in the user's home directory (on Linux server). Firefox cannot create profile when it run for the first time. After the manual

profile creation the user cannot save any change in preferences, and we have problem with the download manager too. These two thing used to work on

Netware server.

Every other program is working fine (IE 6-7,Total commander, Office, etc..)




File saving problem:
--------------------

Directory tree:

root volume
|
|-dir1
|
|-dir2
| |
| |-dir4
|
|-dir3

- If we give write right to the top level directory (dir1) , Firefox can save files, save preferences, create profile into any directory.
- If we give write right to any dir below the top level folder, Firefox cannot save or create anything to the directory where we gave rights. (dir2,3,4)


Firefox 1.5:
------------

- File saving with the "Save file to" option (Tools/Options/Main) is not working, and with the "Always ask me where to save files" option it is working.


Firefox 2:
----------

File saving doesn't working in either way

Firefox 3:
----------

File saving doesn't working in either way


Profiles,Preferences:
---------------------
- Saving Preferences, and profile doesn't work in any version of Firefox.

- The only way to save file to these network drive is when we choose "save as" option where it is available. Firefox 1.5-2-3 can save file with this

method.

- If we install Firefox with local profile, file saving doesn't work too.




When file saving is unsuccessful, the Java debug console show this error with Firefox 1.5-2:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80520012 (NS_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND) [nsIFile.isDirectory]" nsresult: "0x80520012

Source file: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/components/nsHelperAppDlg.js
Sor: 285


Firefox 3:
----------
Error: uncaught exception: unknown (can't convert to string)


We have problem only with Firefox, everything else work good.
