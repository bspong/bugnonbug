This issue is getting more common since more site have flash-based advertising on their pages. If you have multiple windows/tabs open, these flash animation will degrade the performance of the system until it's almost unusable. This ha been very evident with my wife's computer, since she love tabbed browsing, but often is on news and shopping page with 1+ animation on each page, her performance can fall off quickly even if only one page is visible.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tab of site with flash ad (e.g. http://money.cnn.com)
2. Ctrl/Alt/Del for Task Manager, firefox is using 90%+ CPU

Actual Results:
System performance becomes very sluggish with high CPU usage

Expected Results:
System should run normally with moderate CPU usage.

I've found that if I hunt down the flash animations, right-click, and select "Low" quality, this reduces the CPU usage significantly. If firefox could reduce the quality or CPU (reduce thread priority?) usage of flash image in page that are not visible (minimized or tab is not selected), this would result in a major performance improvement of Firefox.
