If firefox render something that hang it and you have to hard kill it
(on ANY platform), if it is able to save session info, then when you restrat
firefox, it try to restore the session and end up rendering the
"bad actor" stuff again. There should be something in the preference that
allows forcing "new session?" dialog after a firefox crash that ha saved session
info. (In general prefs I have "show my hompage on startup" but after
killing with window task manager, I get the behavior described above)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.find a page that reliably hang firefox when rendered
2.hard kill firefox (with task manager on Windows)
3.restart firefox (if session info is available, firefox will
rerender the offending page)
Actual Results:
firefox start and proceeds to the same hang-state

Expected Results:
if there is a clear prefs/general/ option added to the
"when firefox starts" list that is "when firefox crash or is killed,
do not rerender the previous session on restart) That will fix it
