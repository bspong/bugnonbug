Behavior of the address bar for Cmd-N followed by Cmd-L depends on how long you wait in between the two commands, and how quickly you start typing afterwards. Sometimes the address is not entered, sometimes it is appended to the home page address, and sometimes it correctly replaces the home page.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Cmd-N
2. Press Cmd-L
3. Type an address, like "www.mozilla.org"
4. Repeat step 1-3 with various timing between the different step

Actual Results:
Scenario 1: Cmd-N (0.01 seconds) Cmd-L (any amount of time) "www.mozilla.org" doe not put anything into the address bar. The cursor is not even up there. This is a bit annoying.
Scenario 2: Cmd-N (0.5 seconds) Cmd-L (2 seconds) "www.mozilla.org" result in "http://my.yahoo.com/www.mozilla.org", which is very annoying
Scenario 3: Cmd-N (0.5 seconds) Cmd-L (0.01 second) "w" (any amount of time) "ww.mozilla.org" put "www.mozilla.org" into the address bar. This is how it should be.
Scenario 4: Cmd-N (2 seconds) Cmd-L (any time) "www.mozilla.org" put "www.mozilla.org" into the address bar. This is how it should be.

Expected Results:
In all 4 scenarios, the address bar should only contain the typed address

The timing is related to the time it take for the window to open, and for the home page address to appear in the address bar. If Cmd-L is pressed before the window is open, the command is lost. If Cmd-L is entered after the window opened but before the home page address appears, and you start typing after the home page address appears, the text is appended to it. If you type the first letter before the home page address appears, the home page address never appears so you can continue typing. If you have a lot of time on your hand and only type Cmd-L after the home page address ha appeared, it is selected and repaced by whatever you type.
