When one right click the back or foward buttons, a menu pop up. But, when one
right click one of *those* site listed in this menu, instead of getting a
context menu, the same behavior a a left click (it go to that page) is executed.

What I propose is a context menu to pop up on top of this primary menu when
right clicking on these back and foward button history entries, a well a when
right clicking the history entry in the Go menu. I think most effectively, the
context menu option would be: Open (default), Open in New Window, and Open in
New Tab (which happen to be the applicable option taken directly from the
Bookmarks right click context menu). These option would coincide with and
compliment the functionality given by the middle click enhancement of Bug 202819
"Middle mouse click on the back button open previous page in new tab
(enhancement)" and Bug 214816 "Middle click on link in go menu doe not open a
new tab", but would also dually serve a an alternative or replacement option
for user who happen to have their middle click functionality disabled,
unavailable, or assigned to alternative uses.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on entry in the back, foward, and Go menu



Actual Results:
In the Back and Foward menus, the right click doe the same a a left click and
open the page in the current window.
In the Go menu, a right click doe nothing.

Expected Results:
Expected results:
A context menu open up with option when entry are right clicked.
