Might be a Google problem but I don't think so.

After hitting home perhaps twice, my usual Google front page seemed damaged such that thing were missing like current temperature in my home town. And searching from the Google box on the upper right of my window failed entirely before that. Searching on the front page worked fine, but clicking on any result only got me a blank page on a new tab, no contents. And trying to report the problem on a Google feedback page got a 404.

I wish I had a way to capture enough of the relevant bit so you could tell what the problem wa but I don't think I do. I'd be happy to run a bigger, slower binary which had logging and dumping built in so I could be of some real help when I notice this kind of weird crap.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Can't tell.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Weird behavior

Expected Results:
Normal behavior

All I know is in the description above. I'll wager it'll never happen again like this to me.
