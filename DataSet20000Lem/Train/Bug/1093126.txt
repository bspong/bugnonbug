Can't choose what too SYNC prior to connecting for the first time.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0

Steps to reproduce:

Just created my NEW style FF sync account. And could not choose __before__ first connection what this device will send. Before, we could deal with thoose option before starting the first sync process.


Actual results:

Sync started sending data before I wa allowed to disable item.


Expected results:

We would be able to do that before starting. As we can no more manage the per item quota like we could in the previous way, what will happen on the second/later device? Where maybe too much data from the first one will overflow (huge number of tabs/passwords/history/bookmarks) say a small entry level smarthphone product, and worse, preference and special addons setting would break the current default profile of the second/later device (I think to a bug with the new SSL for which I tried to workaround with the beta "SSL Version Control 0.2" addon whose setting will propagate furtively).
How can I wipe __out of the server__ say only one out of the 6 item I never want in the cloud, without deleting the whole account which will prevent syncing anything?
Thank you
