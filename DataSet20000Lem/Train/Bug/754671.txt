[Page Thumbnails] size of thumbnail directory (in profile directory) keep growing infinitely
Since the thumbnail were moved from the cache to the file system, they have become much more visible. At this moment, I have 130MB of image in 1983 files. That's after *only* 10 days.

It's not a new issue, but previously they were hiding among ten of thousand of entry in the 1GB cache, and cleared when that cache got cleared (automatically or manually). They could also have been pushed out of that cache by other content, but that's not happening anymore. They could also have been deleted by the regular expiration algorithm, but since the current history can keep entry for more than many months, that's not an option either. Also note that they are question about privacy (there's no reason to store image if they're never going to be displayed again).

I do understand that the thumbnail do not only contain the 9 image that have to present on the new-tab page, but that it also contains the image that are needed in panorama. You can also not write an algorithm that would only remember the top 9 sites, and discard the rest.

So what can be our option ?
- at startup, discard all except the top-N site ? In case people are removing tab from the new-tab page, we need N to be larger than 9.
- discard image that are older than X day ? Maybe skip their deletion if they're still in the top-N list.
- if a tab is deleted, we should also delete the thumbnail, except if they're in the top-N list
- there could be also reason why some site are not stored in the cache, like mentioned in bug 754608.
