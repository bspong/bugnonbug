usercontent.css

STR:
- Copy userContent.css into the "chrome"-folder in the profile, or create a Stylish-script with it content
- Change browser.newtabpage.columns to 7 or bigger
(the attached picture ha been made with the value of 8)

ER:
Only a many column a defined in browser.newtabpage.columns are shown.

AR:
The number of column is bigger than the value of browser.newtabpage.columns by 1.
In the attached picture that's 9 column instead of 8.

As a sideeffect, there are a many tile a the product of the value of browser.newtabpage.columns/.rows (8*5 in the attached image), but because of the additional column, the last row ha not enough tile to fill the row.
