fx bug - session not restored.jpg

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:40.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/40.0
Build ID: 20150807085045

Steps to reproduce:

Open Firefox 40, it load my tab > close it with [X] close button in the upper right corner of the screen > Open firefox again > blank empty tab is loaded, you can'
t open option from menu, addons, you cannot close firefox by pressing the [X] button in the upper right corner of the screen, I did not tested if I can create new tab or go to some website but basically nothing is working (like go to menu > Options/addons = nothing will happen/open) > to close firefox I have to either right click on it in taskbar and select close, and then it will close, but when I open it again the result will be the same, or open task manager, end firefox process from the task list - this produce various results, either on next firefox start/boot i will be greated with "sorry" session restore page where I can recover my session, or it will not show anything and firefox will open with black page, with [X] close button not working thing like option or addonds from menu not doing anything etc. When this happens > force close down firefox > go to the firefox profile (Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\XXXXXXXXXX.default) and delete file sessionstore which might help sometimes > start firefox > it will open up my tab again.


Actual results:

After I do the thing I wrote above, I can use the browser normally, until I close it again and then it's a lottery... one time it will start again normally loading all my session tabs... other time it will repeat what I wrote above and I have to fiddle with it until it will restore my tab :/


Expected results:

Open/Start firefox > load all my tab > work how it should with all my tab restored from my previous session.
