There is an issue with Firefox (3.6+) which seems to cause some website to be unable to log in. The bug doe not present consistently across platform and website but seems to present more regularly in phpmyadmin.

The best way to repeat the bug is to go to the login page and enter a username and password. Make sure and have Mozilla remember the username and password. Close Mozilla and reopen it. Try to login to the webpage. You will often find that you can 't login even though the username and passord are correct. Once this failure occurs, you can hit the login button a often a you like without success After the failed login with correct credentials, if you hit the refresh button you often will be logged in.

I am sorry that I can't provide an example URL. This error occurs on secure site and I cannot provide credentials.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup phpmyadmin
2. Go to the login page using a Windows Computer (might fail on others)
3. Login and have Mozilla remember the login
4. Exit Mozilla
5. Restart Mozilla and go to phpmyadmin login
6. Try to login (This is where it fails)
7. If it failed to login, hit the refresh button to login
Actual Results:
On trying to login, the website sometimes report a login error citing missing passsword.

Expected Results:
Website should login without error.
