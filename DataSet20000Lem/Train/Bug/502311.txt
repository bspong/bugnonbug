Opening Firefox launch dialup connection, but addons not connecting.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1) Gecko/20090624 Firefox/3.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I open Firefox, it launch my dialup connection, but then seems dormant after the connection ha been established. 1-Click Weather and Webmail Notifier do nothing. I can however, use my bookmark or type in a link and Firefox take me to the sites.

If I close Firefox and open again (leaving my dialup connection open), the addons load almost instantly.

Did not experience this problem before with any of the other Firefox versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox while dialup connection is offline. Firefox start the connection, but addons seem idle, not working.
2. After Internet connection is established, close Firefox.
3. While still connected to the internet, restart Firefox.
Actual Results:
1-Click Weather and Webmail Notifier Addons will work only after restarting Firefox when already connected to internet.

Expected Results:
Firefox ha always launched my internet connection and a soon a it connected, the 1-Click Weather would display and my Webmail Notifier would check for email.

I use Noia 2 Extreme
