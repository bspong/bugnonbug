Scrolling just a little way down, on the left colum the defendingthefox link
overwrites the main centre column text body. Viewed in IE it is fine. This is
a commmon complaint & related to how FF handle table etc, but this is
happening everytime on my, and other computer using FF. Past excuse for FF
not displaying links, text, columns, or table correctly ha been the website,
and it bad coding. This happens on many well coded websites, and this on the
spreadfirefox homepage show clearly there is a problem running a little deeper
than that here, and it is AT LEAST far to easy for a page not to display a it
should in FF. If it is not happening to EVERY FF 1.0 user, then it narrow down
the problem perhaps, but doe not mean the problem doe not exist. It doe on
many win 2k & XP so far here for this site, & all version of FF. There's
clearly a problem here, not just on badly coded sites, but well coded ones, or
there reason why FF is so prone to this amatuer looking display problem. It's
happening on the spreadfirefox homepage, that is embarrasing & need sorting,
sorry, but it does.
