With Whiskey Media page (such a Anime Vice) the comment box at the bottom of forum post ha a text box with a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) formatting bar at the top of the box, allowing you to format your text. However, with Minefield, that box show up a a plain text box when originally writing the post.

Once I've written a post in plain text, and then submitted it, if I edit the post, the text box I get there show up properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any Whiskey Media (Giant Bomb, Comic Vine, Anime Vice, Tested) forum page with a comment box on the bottom.
2. Submit a comment
3. Once the comment ha been submitted, edit it.
Actual Results:
At Step 1, there is now Formatting Bar in the text box. After performing Step 3, you get the Formatting bar, but only for the post you are editing. If you go to another page, or refresh the existing page, the bar go away. This issue doe not occur in prior version of Firefox, or with Internet Explorer or Google Chrome.

Expected Results:
The text box should have a formatting bar at the top of the box, for controlling text formatting.
