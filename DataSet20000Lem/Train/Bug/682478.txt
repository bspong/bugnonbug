Wait longer to get correct filename for "save link as"
Created attachment 556190
Wait for 4 second instead of 1 second for download filename.

I run into this everyday on Bugzilla, and I bet you do too. I right-click an attachment and click "save link as", and about 1/3rd of the time I get "attachment.cgi" a the filename, instead of whatever the patch/filename actually is (from the content-disposition header).

A little poking (and help from biesi on IRC) reveals that we wait 1 second for the reply from the webserver (to get the content-dispostion filename), and if we haven't heard back, we use the URI basename a the filename:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299372#c184

1 second is not long enough. I understand there is some concern with popping up a dialog in a "reasonable" timeframe, but a perusal of our telemetry data (yay! A decision based on actual data!) reveals that only around half of HTTP request are getting their 1st byte back in le than 1 second:

https://metrics.mozilla.com/pentaho/content/pentaho-cdf-dd/Render?solution=metrics&path=telemetry/&file=TelemetryHistogram.wcdf

(page take a while to load: select the HTTP_PAGE_OPEN_TO_FIRST_RECEIVED metric.)

This mean we're losing the correct filename a lot of the time (especially for HTTPS site like Bugzilla, user on low-latency connections, etc.).

The attached patch bump our default wait time from 1 to 4 seconds. I pulled that number out of a hat, and I suggest we give our UI expert the final say. We pay them to paint the sheds...

I've created the following page where you can both verify the behavior here, and try out different timeout value (by setting the browser.download.saveLinkAsFilenameTimeout pref):

Parity issues:

Chrome doesn't set a timeout at all--they simply wait for the content-disposition header for a long a it take (I tried the 60 second link on my CGI page, nothing longer). That seems dumb.

IE: according to

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=299372#c12

IE pop the download window right away in the "Getting file information" state, and once that completes the file picker show up with the "proper" filename. (Also seems dumb if it take 60 seconds?). I haven't verified this, and the comment is from 2005.

I think our UI is actually good here, a long a we use a longer timeout.
