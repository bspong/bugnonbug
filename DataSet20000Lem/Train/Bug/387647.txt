Visit stixfonts.org, and hover your mouse over or through the menu entitled "About Stix Fonts." Notice that the menu, correctly, stay open if you leave your mouse hovering.

Visit the page "project description" or "general information". Now hover your mouse over the menu "about stix fonts", or any entry in it. The menu quickly "disappears", a if your mouse were no longer hovering. Hovering may appear to work on the other menus, but they stay open until the first menu is clicked, even after moving the mouse away (when you first visit the page, the menu will stay open for about two second after moving the mouse away).



Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:
Menus to work correctly, a when you first visit the site, with a clean cache.
