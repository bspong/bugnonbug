I am using Foxy web filtering program (http://www.2-power-n.com)to filter adverts. It make all the needed setting on IE automatically, but I have to find them manually on Mozilla. I have to put the following setting in Connection Settings tab:

Manual Settings: localhost, port 8080.

When I put those setting it works. But when I close Mozilla 1.5.0.4 and open it again, the setting are lost and the radio button is again on Direct Connection position, so I have to make the setting again everytime I open Mozilla.

I tested the same situation on Windows 98 - it doesn't happen like that there - everything work a intended. I did it on a fresh Windows XP Installation - the same problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Put some proxy setting in the Connection setting Tab.
2.Try to browse
3.Close Mozilla, open it again, see if the proxy setting are still there.

Actual Results:
The proxy setting are gone, and the radio button is again on Direct Connection to the Internet position. I have to make the setting again

Expected Results:
The proxy setting are gone, and the radio button is again on Direct Connection to the Internet position. I have to make the setting again
