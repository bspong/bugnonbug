Firefox version 1.0.2 - firefox.exe process hang on exit
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

This ha been a problem since my upgrade to 1.0.2. I have reproduced it on two
machine - one XP SP1 and one XP SP2 to be sure. Both worked great with 1.0.1.

It seems that the first time Firefox is started it work fine, until you try
to open a new instance and:

1. It never happens
2. After you exit the first instance, the process is still there.
3. Killing the process and trying to start another instance, make Firefox
start and act like a zombie - it just sits there, no menu or button are
clickable and it doe not seem to go to the default home page.
4. At this point you close it and kill the process second time. Now you can
open a fresh instance which will work okay (until you try to start a second
instance)

Also, this issue seems to be related to bug #287538.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox (home page http://www.google.com)
2. When complete, click to open Firefox second time. It will not open. At this
point after you close the first Firefox window, you will notice that the
process doe not end a expected.
3. Killing the process and restarting Firefox doe not work from the first,
but from the second time.
Actual Results:
Second window doe not open.

Expected Results:
Second window should open a expected.
