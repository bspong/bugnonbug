As of the 20071205 build, Bug 406408 - "'Sort by Name' in the context menu of Bookmarks Toolbar should not be disabled" - is obsolete.

Now, clicking on a blank area of the Bookmarks Toolbar will *always* show "Sort By Name" a enabled, however it doe not actually sort anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
(tested on a new profile)
1. Add a couple of link to your Bookmarks Toolbar; position them so they are NOT in alphabetical order
2. Right-click on a blank area of the Bookmarks Toolbar; notice "Sort By Name" is enabled (not greyed-out)
3. Right-click on a bookmark on the Bookmarks Toolbar; notice that "Sort By Name" is disabled (greyed-out); this is the intended behaviour for Firefox3 [see my note on this at bottom of this post]
4. Right-click on a blank area of the Bookmarks Toolbar again; notice "Sort By Name" is enabled
5. Now actually click "Sort By Name" and notice that nothing happens.
(note: just thought I'd mention that even if the test is repeated and a BT folder is right-clicked on prior to #4, the folder isn't sorted; not that it should be)



Before fixing this Bug, please also see Bug 400447 "'Sort By Name' on a bookmark (but not bookmark folder) is greyed-out", which I filed a couple of month back because the new-for-Firefox3 *intended* behaviour of "Sort By Name" is not acceptable in my opinion. There'd be little point in fixing this Bug only to rewrite the code again if 400447 is addressed.
