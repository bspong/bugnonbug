Dialog box are not processed when input is given to them but wait for a cleanup thread (or something)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)

When a dialog box ('Confirm', 'About', etc.) is given input (to an OK button
for example), the input is not processed until a cleanup thread (or some other
such process) is given enough priority to destroy it.

This can lead to the browser continuing unwanted behavior until the system get
around to giving the thread some resources.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a slow computer (like a P-Pro 233 for instance) bogged down with lot of
stuff running.
2. Load webpage that requires POST information across several tab (10 should
be very sufficient).
3. Click the first tab
4. Refresh the tab
5. Click OK (or press Enter) on the 'Confirm' dialog box.
6. Repeat step 3 and 5 for each tab.

Actual Results:
The processing of each 'Confirm' dialog take longer and longer a system
resource are given to the refreshing tabs. Eventualy it can take upwards of 10
to 20 second to resolve a confirmation box.

Compounding the problem is the behavior where the Confirm dialog lock input to
the entire browser until it is resolved and destroyed, making the browser
completely non-responsive to user input attempts.

Expected Results:
The confirmation box should have been resolved and destroyed at the time the
input wa given to it.
