Max CPU usage after leaving browser idle for 30minutes+
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-GB; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008051206 Firefox/3.0

I have noticed that if I leave a few window open (2-4, not huge numbers), opened using Ctrl+N, my whole system will start to behave slugishly. Checking the task manager the culprit wa Firefox. Memory usage wa normal but CPU usage wa maxing out. Closing window one at a time it is only ever one window that make a difference.

The site I have noticed it on are website internal to my company (i.e. not public) that I have written personally. They have no AJAX / refreshing of any kind, there is no javascript apart from a few onclicks that simply perform set the cs property display to none/block and nothing more complex, i.e. nothing that would use CPU cycles. No plugins used. Pages all use quirk mode but just basic HTML / CSS with limited javascript.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Open 2-3 new window using Ctrl+N and open a web page in each
3.I wa refreshing the page every couple of minute (with refresh button or F5 key) but not navigating to other places. Using other application on same computer in between.
4.Continued to work in other application but not touching Firefox at all for 30 minute or so.
Actual Results:
Computer became slugish due to Firefox maxing CPU. Seemed to be a single window causing the problem. Closing the window solves the problem without closing the rest (although no indication a to which, just have to close one at a time until CPU usage drops).

Expected Results:
No reason for Firefox to be using any CPU. It wa not being used.

I'm running Vista Ultimate SP1 on Pentium M 2.13GHz, 2GB RAM (aprox. 750MB free), GeForce Go 6800 Ultra, running Aero interface. Only plugin I have installed is Glasser.
