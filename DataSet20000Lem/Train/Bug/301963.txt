When you try to install an extension when Software Installation is disabled
(through Preferences), Firefox display the notification bar that say that
Software Installation is disabled, and to click "Edit Options..." to enable it
and try again. However, the text of the button is "undefined", not "Edit
Options..." on Mac OS X. It doe seem to be correct using Deer Park Alpha 2 on
Windows XP, but not on recent nightlies on Mac OS X.

I will attach a screenshot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable Software Installation on the Content pane of Preferences.
2. Navigate to a page with an install link for installing an extension.
3. Click the install link (attempt to install the extension).

Actual Results:
The notification bar appears, saying to click "Edit Options..." and try again,
but there is no such button. The button text say "undefined".

Expected Results:
The button text should be "Edit Options...", based on the text of the notification.

I didn't know which component this best fit under, since the notifcation bar
doesn't have it own component, and I wasn't sure if it's an Extension Manager
or not, so I apologize if this is in the wrong component.
