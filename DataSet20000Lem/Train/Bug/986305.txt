Usability regression in FF29 beta
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140318013849

Steps to reproduce:

Just upgraded from the 28 beta to 29 beta and found some usability problem that make FF significantly more difficult for me to use. These two have bitten me immediately and repeatedly.

1) I have always had an item in my bookmark toolbar (a text item, showing a "Bookmarks", so it's easy to hit) to open my full bookmark menu, but this disappeared in the upgrade. I can't find this item in the UI customization any more; the closest I can come is a tiny dual-function icon which default to beside the location bar. This is an extremely poor substitute; it's very small and on a high-res monitor it's very difficult to hit, and to make thing worse, it's divided in half, and if you click the left half it add a bookmark for the current page instead of opening bookmarks. I use my bookmark menu hundred of time a day, and this is causing me significant pain -- I can't get the right damn thing open without searching for this tiny dual icon, and then I still get the wrong function half the time when I click on it.

2) Tabs on top preference no longer honoured - I realize #941719 is closed a WONTFIX, but this is also quite painful. I switch tab constantly, and while I used to be able to just mouse a few pixel between the content of the page and the tab bar, it's now at the top of the window, separated from the content area by (in my case) the developer tool toolbar, the bookmark toolbar, the main navigation bar - it is much, much slower now to go between the two, which I do hundred of time a day.


Actual results:

FF became a lot more painful to use.


Expected results:

"Bookmarks" item should not have been converted to a tiny icon-only dual-function button.

Tab bar should not have been forced to top of window with no way to revert this.
