run the .html file I include below. Double-click the word "static" or "new" and
you will select multiple word in the text, rather than just one. When the CSS
class which these <span> tag refer to were included, the result were the
same, so I left those CSS class definition out to simplify the example (they
just colored the text). I can reproduce this on Mozilla 1.7.1, but bug doe Not
occur on IE 6.0. Text of HTML file that illustrates the problem:
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<a class="ln" name="81">081&nbsp;</a><span
class="bg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
class="kw">private&nbsp;static&nbsp;</span><span
class="code">List&nbsp;clientAuthValues&nbsp;=&nbsp;</span><span
class="kw">new&nbsp;</span><span class="code">ArrayList</span><span
class="prn">()</span><span class="code">;</span>
</body>
</html>
