content of tab not focused to keyboard scrolling when switching tab
The content of tab doesn't get the focus for keyboard scrolling reliably when
switching between tabs. It seems to get into a state where it work for one tab
but not the other. This seems like it might be a regression from bug 175893,
which landed today. I can't reproduce in last night's Firefox nightly
(2004-07-14-08-trunk), but I can reproduce reliably in my cv Firefox build from
6pm today, and I'm reasonably sure the behavior is new because I wa trying to
scroll and it wasn't working when I wa expecting it to. (All Linux.)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open a new firefox window
2. press control-L (focus URL bar)
3. type "www.mozilla.org", and press enter
4. hit the down arrow a few time to show scrolling work
5. press control-T (open new tab, which focus URL bar)
6. type "www.mozilla.org", and press enter
7. hit the down arrow a few time to show scrolling work
8. Press Ctrl-PgUp (switch tab)
9. hit the down arrow a few time

Actual result (after 9): no scrolling
Expected result (after 9): scrolling

Note: When opening more than two tabs, the most recently opened tab seems to be
OK, but previously open tab all seem to be in the bad state. Clicking in the
body of the page of one of the tab put that tab into the good (focusing)
state, and all the others into the bad (not focusing) state.

I could not reproduce in Seamonkey nightlies, 2004-07-14-07-trunk or
2004-07-14-19-trunk
