firefox became unresponsive, failing to exit, despite apparently responding to controls. All but the last window closed using apple+shift+w, last window refused to close. All tab closed (every last one!), tab bar wa however still visible for some unknown reason. window continued to display one of the previously closed tab (which seemed odd a this wa not the last tab). checking in the window menu, found an extensive menu filled with nothing but blank menu items. the final tab title wa displayed a the single (top most), and only menu item which wa not blank. Title did not match the window displayed.

summary of features:
(1) closed tab still displayed in window
(2) emply tab bar remained visible
(3) menu item in window menu display incorrect title
(4) window menu display large number of blenk/empty entries.
(5) firefox failed to close final window
(6) firefox failed to exit
