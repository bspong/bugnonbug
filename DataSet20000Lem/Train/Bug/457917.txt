Download will not start after selected to 'save' and Firefox lock up.

When I request a Download of a program/file from Firefox, I get the small screen that I think say 'save' or 'run' If I choose 'save' it lock up Firefox and the download will not start.
I then have to shut down my PC, re-start then delete the portion of the file that it ha downloaded before it locked up.
Then 'restore the Firefox session' and try the download again and strangely this second time it works.

I did remove Firefox and re-install the program and that cured it for about 2 weeks, and now I am back to the same scenario. Firefox lock up on the first attempt.
I don't really want to re-install Firefox again a I 'lost' all my password for different websites, even though I backedup my Bookmarks.

If I subsequently use Internet Explorer (Sorry for swearing a I much prefer Firefox) the download come through with no problems, so that would suggest that the 'problem' is Firefox related.

Any help would be appreciated please.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox, find website for program/file.
2.Using 'Download' icon on webpage request Download.
3.Initial screen for Download pop up with file name, click on 'save' and PC Locks up
Actual Results:
I think/hope that I have described the result in the above scenario and feel that there is no need for additional information here.

Expected Results:
Download should have switched from small screen to Downloader that monitor progress of Download and then completed when file downloaded

I did see a 'comment' about 'dwwin.*' when shutting down the PC to try the download again but not sure if it wa an error from the Operating System.
