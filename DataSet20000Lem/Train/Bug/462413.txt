Pretty hard to explain in English, but I´ll try.
I am using Mac OS 10.4.11 on a G4 PowerBook, and Firefox 3.0.3.
The library is showing in the left column or side the whole structure of the bookmarks, but the file only. The right column or side („name“) should show file AND bookmark in their complete structure resp. hierarchy. But it is not so, with FF 2 it ha been so.
The right column/side is showing ONLY one level of the hierarchy, and this is true for some Macs I have checked –so it can not be a single problem of my G4.
I wa discussing this in the German FF forum and a PC user wa posting a sceen-shot of his library structure: http://firefox.tech-support.de/pic080806001.jpg I did the same: http://www.ekkehard-brunn.de/9test/FF3%20Biblio%20OrdHierarchie%20Sp2.jpg and it is to see, that on the right side only one level of file is to see. My pictured file have up to 5 file levels, and then the bookmark are to see. No hierarchical structure with the complete sub-structures can be seen a a total –like it ha been with FF 2.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open library shift cmd B
2.no further steps: rightaway to see
3.Going down to the next level need opening a file: again only 1 level to see, no hierarchy.
Actual Results:
only 1 file level to see under "name" (right side in the window).


Should show the complete level structure down to the bookmark or a far down a You wish. Like: http://firefox.tech-support.de/pic080806001.jpg for the PC library, or like FF 2 did.
