Firefox fails to find URL when I log into or out of VPN and firefox is already running.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050513 Fedora/1.0.4-1.3.1 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050513 Fedora/1.0.4-1.3.1 Firefox/1.0.4

If firefox is running and I then log into a VPN (cisco in this case), firefox
will usually fail to find a web page associated with a url. It appears a if
firefox cannot resolve the URL. If I close all open instance of firefox and
restart then the problem is solved.

The same thing will happen if I log into the vpn, start firefox and work on the
intranet for a while, and then disconnect the vpn. firefox then cannot find any
web site. Closing all instance and restarting solves the problem

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox.
2. Connect to VPN
3. Enter URL or bookmark in firefox.

Actual Results:
No web page is found

Expected Results:
The web page corresponding to the URL should have been found.

The cisco vpn client close all network other connection except the vpn
connection (and localhost). The DNS entry in resolv.conf are replaced with
intranet DNS servers.
