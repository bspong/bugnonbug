FOLKS, YOU NEED TO FIX THIS !!

Think about it. How many firefox user or people trying it use webmail? How frustrating is it when they cant paste a URL into their message, for example, and then aren't allowed to copy the carefully thought-through message to get it out of firefox and send it with internet explorer. Then, how many are actually going to be able or willing to follow the direction to change the user.js file. It took me an hour, using about:config, after failing with user.js, and I'm a computer troubleshooter for a living. Even then it only unblocks my webmail new message composition URL!

Allow ClipboardHelper addon 0.6.0 doe *not* fix the problem, though a simple gui fix like this would be simply the bee knees.

This one thing is turning a lot of people off on firefox. It's a serious issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log onto webmail
2.compose a message, sometimes lengthy
3. try to paste something simple into the message, get error message about security and scripts, then disallowed to copy the carefully composed message and at least send it using another browser that doesn't block cut and paste
Actual Results:
Frustration for hundred of thousand of users, if not more

Expected Results:
Allow me to cut and paste into webmail.

Running Firefox 3.0.10 on PCLinuxOS2009. No one on the message board know how to fix this, and they suggest using a different browser. I have spent hour and hour on this problem starting month ago on a different machine.

I know this is not a BUG, but there is no where else to contact Mozilla to express the seriousness of this design flaw.

People lose data in webmail!
