Website Installs Adware.CDT Without Authorization
A few week ago (I've been busy) I surfed the attached list of web site using Firefox 1.5.0.4. This was, in fact, right after I had automatically downloaded the update to 1.5.0.5, but I had clicked on "later" when it asked to restart Firefox.

On each site I clicked in the text area to highlight the area of text that I wa reading (I am aware that some site can use this a a way to trigger pop-ups). Then my antivirus software popped up and reported that I had a "partial" infection of "Adware.CDT". Since it wa listed a partial, it may be some uncharted virus or even just a mistake. I use Symantec Antivirus 10.0.2.2001.

Anyway, I hadn't installed any new software and I wasn't running anything else at the time. It is possible that symantec antivirus had just auto-installed an update that allowed it to find a pre-existing issue, but I think it is more likely that one of these site wa able to use firefox to install malware on my system.

I am sorry that I am not going back to figure out which site it is by myself, but I really depend on my one computer for a lot of stuff and it took me a long time to restore my system to a trusted state after the initial infection.

Below is the list of site I visited right before the infection wa reported. The only thing I remember doing on each wa visiting it in Firefox 1.5.0.4, scrolling through the content, and clicking on area of text that I wa reading.

Here is the symantec list of what Adware.CDT does:

Since symantec only recognized it a "partial", it might not really be Adware.CDT, but some similar variant.
