ASP.NET LinkButtons Javascript running incorrectly
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.31 Safari/530.5

With the latest version of firefox, u and out client have found that some LinkButtons have stopped working and are now throwing Javascript error i.e. _dopostback is not defined.

On closer inspection we can see the Source code is correct (__doPostBack) yet Firefox try to run (__dopostback), ONLY when the ASP.Net LinkButton is contained in a content page that ha a MasterPage set. Why firefox is changing the case is not known.

LinkButtons on stand alone page and on the masterpage work correctly, only on content page Firefox run javescript incorrectly.


(We have also tested this on other site throughout the web)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a ASP.NET LinkButton on any ASP.NET website that ha a MasterPage.
Actual Results:
Throws javascript error __dopostback is undefined

Expected Results:
Page should post back and run server code.

LinkButtons (exact same code) still work on IE, Chrome and Safari.
