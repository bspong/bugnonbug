When I navigate back to some page using the Go Back button, such a the URL above, the page is reloaded twice, the second time adding ann additional duplicate item to the history. This clear the forward history, so it remove the history item from the page where I wa moving back from. I checked this also in the latest nightly build (sep 3). It doe not happen with version before the 2.0 beta.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL above
2. Click a link to some article
3. Press the Back button

Actual Results:
The URL above is reloaded twice. After that, the Forward button is grayed out and the menu of the Back button show the site for the URL above ,even though it is the current site.

Expected Results:
The URL should just be reloaded twice. The forward history should not be erased, so it should show the article I moved back from. The backward history should show no sites, or perhaps site I visited _before_ the site I moved back to.

This might be related to the meta tag (expires = 0 and pragma = no-cache)
Also I am browsing using a proxy.
