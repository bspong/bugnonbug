Unicode character displayed a code point despite appropriate font

Firefox 3.5.5 display Unicode character in the Private Use Area a codepoints rather than displaying the character present in the font that ha been forced for that page (Code2000). The only time I have seen Firefox properly display these character is when a font using them is specified on the page itself (not in user settings). They are displayed properly in the OS and in IE and Chrome without forcing. This bug wa not present in Firefox 2.x to the best of my memory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install a Unicode pIqaD font (Code2000.ttf or pIqaD.ttf)
2. Go to any page with pIqaD text (http://qurgh.blogspot.com/ is one example)
3. Try any combination of setting to view the text without success
Actual Results:
No pIqaD, merely Unicode code point surrogate

Expected Results:
Displayed pIqaD character

Other script encoded in the PUA fail to display a well under similar conditions.
