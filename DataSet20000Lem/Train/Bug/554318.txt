I used to be able to drag a URL to a folder on the bookmark bar and save into a folder. This behavior ha stopped working for some reason. If I click the folder, I see my bookmark but if I use the organize bookmark function, the new bookmark I added are not there. I tried closing and restarting the browser and the bookmark I added are gone. Maybe a file permission problem?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Drag bookmark into a folder on the bookmark bar.
2. Go into Bookmarks -> Organize bookmarks...
3. Check for the new bookmark that were just added.
Actual Results:
No new bookmark have been added so they dont show up in the organizer but they DO show up in the folder I added them to (unless I restart the browser, then they disappear).

Expected Results:
I should see my bookmarks, I should be able to see them in the organizer and they should persist across browser restarts.

Im attaching screenshots, showing how my bookmark folder looked like. And a second showing what's shown in the organizer during the same session.
