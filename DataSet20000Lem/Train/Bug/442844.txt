Java no longer working after upgrade to Firefox 3.0

After upgrading to Firefox 3.0, java doe not work. I installed the latest version of java, and java worked immediately after installation. But after closing and reopening firefox, java no longer works. Java ha not worked since then.

Other site that exhibit the problem:

http://www.poems.com.sg (Enter number for account and password, then attempt to login)
http://www.hsbc.com.sg (Choose "Login to personal internet banking" and attempt to login)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to affected site
2. Enter username and password

Actual Results:
I am requested to install java in most cases. In the case of DBS banking, I am told that the applet ha not loaded yet.

Expected Results:
I should have been able to login to each of these site normally. This worked in Firefox 2 and still work in IE 6.

I have searched thoroughly for this bug, and have not found anything. It ha been several day now, and filing this report is a last resort for me.
