After my pc resume from hibernation, while firefox wa running, browsing becomes really slow. The point at which I have noticed most of the problem is at the address bar, where writing an address take quite some time like the system is searching for something (possibly the entry to the history).
Furthermore, flash is slow on the page and entering text in the field and form seems to stall a bit. Also scrolling stall before it initiates. This is annoying a lot.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Mozilla Firefox with some tab (pages) opened.
2. Put the system to hibernation.
3. Resume hibernation and attempt to work with firefox again.
Actual Results:
The whole browsing experience is quite slow (both the GUI and the page browsing).

Expected Results:
Everything should run smooth like the first time the program wa opened.

When I further close and reopen firefox, then everything is back to normal and the speed seems to be OK.
