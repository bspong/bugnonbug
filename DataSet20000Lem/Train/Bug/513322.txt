When using Firefox 3.5.2 on Linux to goto the login page for Citigroup's citicards, the Firefox prevents the user from entering text into the login and password text fields.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On Linux, open Firefox 3.5.2 browser.
2. Navigate to https://www.citicards.com/cards/wv/home.do
3. Click in either the "User ID" or "Password" field and try to enter text.
Actual Results:
You will not be able to enter text into the "User ID" or "Password" fields.

Expected Results:
You should be able to enter text into the "User ID" or "Password" fields.

Clicking in the text field doe not show a cursor so it look like focus is not getting set. Flash appears to be blocking the ability to enter text into the fields.

The workaround is to right click on the Flash graphic and select "Play" in the resulting menu. The Flash program will run, producing a popup window. Select the "X" in the upper right corner of the popup window to close the popup. The user is now able to select the login or password field and enter text into those fields.

This is a long standing problem. If you do a Google search on firefox citicards, you will find complaint a far back a 2003.

Note that Firefox 3.5.2 on WinXP work correctly, allowing the user to enter text into the signon and password field without needing to launch the flash popup.

I have opened this bug report because Firefox should have the same working behaviour on Linux a it doe with Microsoft Windows.
