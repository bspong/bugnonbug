FF3 fails to open when called from within Thunderbird via url link.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052912 Firefox/3.0

Upgraded to FF3. When I open a message in Thunderbird (2.0.0.14) and it ha a link to an http or http link and I click on it, FF3 doe not open at all. This happens with all theme and addons disabled. In FF2.0.0.14 the link open without a problem. After each attempt to open the link a running process is left behind which need to be killed.
This is despite the fact that FF3 is set a the default browser in KDE and Gnome. Thunderbird ha a it network.protocol-handler.app "xdg-open". If I call a url from the console with /usr/bin/xdg-open while FF3 is the default browser, the url doe open in FF3. It just never work from within Thunderbird.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set FF3 a default with or without addons
2.open email in Thunderbird
3.Click on link within an email in Thunderbird
Actual Results:
Appears to be calling a program a an Icon "bounces" for a while next to the mouse cursor, then nothing. Checking process reveals a process running for firefox and firefox-bin

Expected Results:
FF# should open to the url chosen.
