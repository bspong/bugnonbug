style tag inside noscript tag act differently in xsl v html

On a page that us xsl transforms, if there is a style tag inside a noscript tag, the style will be applied even is scripting is enabled. I copy/pasted the generated source into a static html file, and the style wa applied if scripting is disabled, but it wa not applied if scripting is enabled.

I realize the following is not w3c complaint, however, I think it should work the same if the page is html or xsl.

Example of problem code:
<noscript>
<style type="text/css"> .hide { display: block; } </style>
</noscript>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two pages, one in html, one in xsl. Each page should have a style tag inside a noscript tag.
2. View each page.
Actual Results:
The xsl page ha the style even if javascript being enabled. The html page ha the style with javascript being disabled, and not applied if javascript is enabled.

Expected Results:
The xsl page should apply the style if javascript is disabled, and it should not apply the style if javascript is enabled.

I am using the noscript plugin to enable/disable javascript. I am using the web developer plugin to get the generated source code. I haven't tested this on any o other than window xp, but I suspect it will be cross platform.

I looked and I could not find a bug similar to this, so I apologize if this is a known issue. Also, the opera browser ha this same behavior, so this might be expected.
