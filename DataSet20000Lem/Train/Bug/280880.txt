Firefox fails to redraw portion of screen

An area of the screen is not redrawn after clicking the "Modify your Search"
link. It appears to be Javascript that is modifying the page
(modifyYourSearchPressed()). Unfortunately I don't know enough about HTML or
Javascript to narrow this down to a more specific test case.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://www.travelocity.ca/
2. Choose an origin and destination for a flight (YVR to LAX, for example).
3. Click the "Search Now" button with the default dates.
4. Once the search result page appears, click the "Modify your search" link.

Actual Results:
The area of the screen in which you enter the modified search criterion (origin,
destination, date etc.) is not redrawn. If you move other window over it, or
scroll it off screen and back on, whatever garbage wa displayed on those pixel
before is still displayed. The cursor change appropriately if moved over text
areas, link etc. but they are not displayed.

Expected Results:
The area should be redrawn with the input widgets.

Default theme, almost fresh install (yesterday). I have a copy of the page
source code if necessary. Send e-mail and I will post a an attachment. But
loading this HTML file by itself doesn't reproduce the problem without the rest
of the site.

I saw a couple of other bug to do with redrawing, but one (269019) wa on Linux
not Windows (that bug's test case worked for me), and in the other (275403) the
area would redraw if scrolled off and back on or covered/uncovered by another
window or the pointer. So I'm logging this a a new defect.
