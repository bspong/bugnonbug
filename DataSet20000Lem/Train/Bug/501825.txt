1. I have FireFox shortcut on Quick Launch toolbar with "maximized" flag on
2. After start FireFox show "Add-On update available" popup
3. I select "download & install"
4. FireFox update Add-Ons then show Add-Ons window with extra line like "1 add-on updated" and red button with cross on it
5. I close this window
6. FireFox now not maximized so I have to manually click maximize button on it window title.

P.S. I saw same issue on early Komodo Edit based on Mozilla engine ;)
