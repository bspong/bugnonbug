Simplify toolbarbutton stylesheet requirement to make life easier for extension
Created attachment 504420
Set "wantediconsize", "wantedicondimensions" and "wantediconmonochrome" based on the current theme

+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #616472 +++

As Dan Mosedale explained in bug 616472 comment 41, an important half of
the issue originally discussed there is to allow extension author to use
simple stylesheet rule to select which icon size and color should be used
for their toolbar buttons, instead of relying on complex host application
detection in chrome.manifest.

An additional win would be for the stylesheet to choose whichever artwork is
most suited to the current theme, regardless of the platform on which the
browser is executing. For example, there is a custom Mac OS X theme that
might want monochrome icon like the default "pinstripe" theme for Mac.
This is very easy to achieve using the detection technique suggested by
Markus Stange in bug 616472 comment 37.

Using the simple test case provided by Nils Maier (thank you very much!)
in bug 616472 comment 48, I wrote a patch that implement this detection
technique. It's quite polished except for these known issues:
- "Wanted style" attribute are not yet applied to the customization palette.
- I haven't tested it on platform other than Windows, although I've tested
it with some custom themes.
- Contains debugging code that output detected value to the Error Console.
- The new Toolkit toolbar customization event named "style" could use an
automated test case.
- I'm not sure if and what other automated test might be needed.

Here is how an extension's stylesheet would appear. Note that all the new
styling-specific attribute name begin with a common prefix, currently
"wantedicon...", but I'm open to suggestions.





/* --- MANDATORY ICONS --- */

/* Basic (24x24) icon */
#my-button {
list-style-image: url(icon24.png);
}

/* Small (16x16) icon. The iconsize check is for FF3 compatibility only. */
toolbar[wantediconsize="small"] #my-button,
toolbar[iconsize="small"] #my-button {
list-style-image: url(icon16.png);
}

/* --- OPTIONAL ICONS --- */

/* Small (16x16) monochrome icon. The default on Mac. */
toolbar[wantediconsize="small"][wantediconmonochrome] #my-button {
list-style-image: url(icon16-monochrome.png);
}

/* Extra large (32x32) icon. Only for custom themes. */
toolbar[wantediconsize="x-large"] #my-button {
list-style-image: url(icon32.png);
}

/* Custom sized (example: 18x18) icon. Only for custom themes.
Note that this icon will not be used if the theme want
icon that are 20x20. However, in this case we still have
wantediconsize="small" that allows u to use an icon
that fit in the available space. */
toolbar[wantedicondimensions="18x18"] #my-button {
list-style-image: url(icon18.png);
}






Note that extension that handled the disabled or hover button state can
now check if the "wantediconsize" attribute is set and, if this is the case,
avoid to provide specific image for that case. I also considered setting
a "wantediconwithouteffects" boolean attribute for that case, but maybe
it's just overkill.

Firefox 3 for Mac still need the add-on to draw the whole button broder and
state, like before. Extensions that want to support this case must do it like
they did previously.
