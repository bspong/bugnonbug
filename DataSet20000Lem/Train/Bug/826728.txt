Private browsing window recoverable
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_8_2) AppleWebKit/537.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/23.0.1271.97 Safari/537.11

Steps to reproduce:

Only tested on Mac OS X. Several issue here:

1. Private browsing window can be reopened in the same private browsing session
2. Regular browsing window can be reopened in a private browsing session, including their cooky
3. Private browsing window can be reopened in a regular browsing session, excluding their cooky

To recreate:

All scenario assume you've completely quit Firefox (CMD+Q) and are starting with a fresh instance

1. Private browsing window can be reopened in the same private browsing session:

* Launch Firefox, clear your history
* Switch to Private browsing (CMD+Shift+P)
* Create an identifiable tab (e.g., visit Google, search "private window 1")
* Close the window (CMD+W)
* Create a new window (CMD+N)
* Reopen previous window (CMD+Shift+N)

2. Regular browsing window can be reopened in a private browsing session, including their cookies:

* Launch Firefox, clear your history
* Create an identifiable tab with an identifiable cookie (e.g., visit GMail, login to your account)
* Close the window (CMD+W)
* Switch to Private browsing (CMD+Shift+P)
* Visit the site you were at, verify the cookie doesn't exist (e.g., visit GMail, you're not logged in)
* Reopen previous window (CMD+Shift+N)
* Refresh the page and see that the cookie still exists (e.g., you can browse your email!)

3. Private browsing window can be reopened in a regular browsing session, excluding their cookies:

* Launch Firefox
* Close the window (CMD+W) - Omitting this step stop this from working
* Switch to Private browsing (CMD+Shift+P)
* Create an identifiable tab (e.g., visit Google, search "private window 1")
* Close the window (CMD+W)
* Switch to Regular browsing (CMD+Shift+P)
* Reopen previous window (CMD+Shift+N)
* Your private window is back!


Actual results:

See above


Expected results:

Issue 1 is up for debate. I would say if you close a window in Private browsing, you shouldn't be able to get it back

Issue 2 is serious and should not happen

Issue 3 is serious and should not happen
