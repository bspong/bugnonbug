Every time I log off my computer, or restart, when I return, and try to start
firefox, it doesn't start at all. When I log off again to try and boot the
system back into order, a window appears saying xpcom:event reciever is not
resonding, end now, when I end now, another window appears asking me about the
profile.

I click the button to ask it to start firefox, and it start ok, but the rest of
my computer ha already started to logoff. When I close forefox down and
logoff, and then log back on, it give me the same problem.

How do I rectify this.

I have re-installed firefox several time from scratch, i.e. I have dowloaded
fresh version and then installed them.

My system is a Gigabyte board, with window 2000 professional, I have zone alarm
and norton.

Hope you can help...
