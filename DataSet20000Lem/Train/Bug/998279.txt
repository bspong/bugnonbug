[Windows, tab in titlebar] Preventing tab close slide/resize doesn't work if you move the mouse cursor (even within the tabbar) during the close tab animation
when closing tabs, there are multiple issues:

when the tab bar is overflown and when closing a tab that is not the rightmost tab, all tab to the right of the closed tab move to the left. if the tab par is scrolled to the far right, there will be empty room on the right side of the tab bar after the tab is closed. a soon a the mouse pointer leaf the tab bar, the tab move to the right to fill the empty room.

so far so good, but, when moving the mouse while the closing animation / tab movement happens, the empty room get filled also, which is wrong.

something similar happens when the tab bar is not already overflown, but tab got smaller than their default size. then, when closing a tab, all tab move but do not resize (which happens when moving the mouse away from the tab bar), but, when moving the mouse while the animation happens, the tab also resize, which they shouldn't.


especially the first part make it VERY annoying to close multiple tab with the middle mouse button because you must not move the mouse while doing this, if you move the mouse, you end up closing some tab that unexpectedly moved into the way.


this bug exists for ages, i even think it existed in the old non-australis theme. i also thought i already filed a bug for this a year or two ago, but didn't find it...
