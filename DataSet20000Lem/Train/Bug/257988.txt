Using the 3rd Sep 2004 nightly Win32 installer build cleanly installed I am
unable to access any audio or video stream from the BBC website. It crash at
the point where the site prompt the user to choose between real medium and
Windows medium - i.e. before any streaming actually occurs.

I can access and play stream from other websites. I have Windows Media Player 9
installed with the OS and patched via window medium and I am using Real
Alternative V1.2.3 from www.free-codecs.com for real medium content.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/aod/index.shtml?button
2. Select a radio channel


Actual Results:
Firefox display 90% of the next page - the final few image don't download,
then it crashes.

Expected Results:
Prompted me to choose between Real medium & Windows medium format

The crash wa reported by talkback but I've no idea how to retrieve the crash ID.
