Dynamic form field are not being submitted
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Background:

I have created a grid-like entry form that is generated on-the-fly by my JavaScript. As far a correctness of generated content is concerned I have tested it without dynamic generation and it is valid.

Problems occurs when I try to submit a form made up of those dynamically generated fields. Form is submitted but field value are NOT being transfered to the server, not via POST nor GET methods. This is not happening if field are defined statically and render together with the document.

Same code work fine in IE 5.5+

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a form with id attribute
2. Using JavaScript create new input element using document.createElement("input") with all required attribute (i.e. name, type, value, etc.).
3. Append created field into form element using formId.appendChild(inputElement).
4. Submit form.
5. Check for existance of the posted data in the server code,

Actual Results:
When trying to read posted field value from Request(asp, jsp, php), field is not present and value can not be retrieved.

Expected Results:
Field value should be posted to the server.

It look like browser doe not register any dynamically created input field a part of the form, and thus doe not submit them.
