When I start the nightly build of Minefield I get this error message. I am not sure the regression range, I believe it to be at least 6 weeks.

"The procedure entry point IsThreadDesktopComposited could not be located in the dynamic link library USER32.dll. "

Windows XP SP3

I get a similar message in a few other apps, Winamp wa one but they have since fixed this in the latest release.
