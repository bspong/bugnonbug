frequent history corruption with incorrect location bar

Using Firefox 1.5 RC1, I have been frequently running into situation where I will navigate back or forward through the history, and while the page change correctly, the location bar doe not update. Furthermore, the back and forward button are inappropriately greyed out (e.g., forward is greyed out after I've just gone back). Oddly, if I switch to a different tab and then switch back, the location bar is updated correctly, along with the back and forward buttons. This make me think this may just be some sort of UI problem. Unfortunately, while I almost inevitably run into this problem while browsing, even in safe mode, I have not been able to come up with a small set of step to reproduce it. This bug seems pretty bad to me, a it could really confuse a user. I haven't seen this, but it may be a security issue a well, if this bug occurs when navigating between a page with SSL and a page without it.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I don't have a consistent way to reproduce the problem. Once it occurs, however, it seems to stick. I'll go back / forward, and the location bar doesn't update. If I switch tab and return, the location bar becomes correct. Then, if I go back / forward again, the problem re-occurs.
