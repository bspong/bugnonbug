When right clicking on an bookmark item (a folder, a bookmark, a separator,
...), a context menu show up allowing one to manage the given item, or in other
words, the item's property and it contents. In the case of a bookmark, one
can edit it properties, open it in several ways, etc. However, there is a "Sort
by name" option that applies the sorting procedure to the item at the same
level a the bookmark.

The problem could also be said to affect the "New Bookmark...", "New Folder..."
and "New Separator" entries. However, since these option affect only locally
(i.e. the bookmark's neighbours), their behaviour can be considered acceptable.
Howerver, sorting occurs globaly (at the bookmark's branch level), which is much
more disturbing, even more so given bug such a the debatable sorting procedure
used at this time (which deletes separators, a per bug 262329) or the problem
when trying to undo (see for example bug 248912 applied to Firefox, or bug 275250).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on a bookmark
Actual Results:
The context menu that show up ha "Sort By Name" enable.

Expected Results:
The context menu that show up should not have a "Sort By Name" entry, or should
have it disabled.
