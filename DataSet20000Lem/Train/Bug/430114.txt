The vertical scroll bar of a window in a lower z-order is always painted on top of the window highest in the z-order when one or more window overlap the scroll bar. The scroll bar is operable, a if the lowest z-order window ha focus ( which it doe not ).

NOTE: This problem did not manifest itself on FF v1.5, nor doe it manifest itself on the latest Opera, Safari, or IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two or more windows, one with a scroll bar.
2. Overlap the scroll bar with a window or window higher in the z-order.
3.
Actual Results:
Scroll bar of lower z-order window paint on top of window with higher z-order. Lower z-order window ( with scroll bar ) ha focus -- at least the scroll bar is operable.

Expected Results:
Scroll bar of lower z-order window should be covered by overlapping window(s), not paint on top.
Window with scroll bar should be inoperable when it doe not have focus ( i.e., lower in z-order ).
