Firefox start only if previously run in safe-mode if some extension are enabled

Firefox exit with -1 exit status just after running it with no error message (before any window show up) .

If you run Firefox in safe-mode (clicking 'Quit' button on safe-mode menu suffices), Firefox would load normally for 1 time. After closing FF you have to pas through safe-mode to run it again.

The problem is connected with extensions, a if none are enabled it doe not occure at all. Specifically this extension (if enabled) will cause Firefox not to start at all if not run after safe-mode:
ReadItLater, CookieSafe, DownThemAll, WiredMarker (all current versions).

Any other extension other than dictionary would cause it to happen from time to time (I have checked TabMixPlus, Zotero, FireBug, DictionaryTooltip, AdblockPlus, each installed separetly on clean profile).

All the extension work fine, if Firefox start - i.e. once after each safe-mode.

Reproducible: Always
