The Bookmarks Toolbar SOMETIMES disappears and all Menus become inaccesible when new window is opened via Ctrl-N.

The existing Firefox window are not affected, i.e. Bookmarks Toolbar is still present and Menus are still accesible.

I can't reproduce it reliably; I'd say it happens 25% of the time. But it's annoying enough to make me consider reverting to ver 2.x.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Ctrl-N to open New Window
2. Or select File->New Window
3.
Actual Results:
The Bookmarks Toolbar SOMETIMES disappears and all Menus become inaccesible. This only happens on the newly-open windows.

Expected Results:
Open a standard Firefox window with Bookmarks Toolbar.

I've had this problem since ver 3.0.0 and now, 3.0.1.

Firefox 2.x did not exhibit this problem in the same system.

Extensions used: Flashblock, AdBlock Plus, AVG Safe Search. I don't use any FF themes. My Vista theme is "Windows Classic".

I don't want to install trunk build co I'm in a production enviro.
