Existing window ha toolbar icon only; open new window show icon and text

I just upgraded to Firefox 4.0. I configured my toolbar to display the "icons" choice instead of "icons and text" and indeed, no text is displayed next to the toolbar icons. Then I press the "New Window" icon in the toolbar. A new window open which show the same toolbar but with "icons and text" displayed. Using the customize dialog I can switch it back to only "icons", but every time I open a new window, the new window display both "icons and text".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox. Configure toolbar button to only show "icons". Ensure that one of the toolbar button is the "New Window" icon.
2. Press the "New Window" icon.
3. A new window is popped up that display text with the icon in the toolbar.


Expected Results:
The new window should have only displayed the icon in the toolbar, not the icon and text; I expect the new window's options/configuration to be exactly the same a the original window that launched it.

I am using the default theme. I have the web developer add-on, the firebug add-on, edit cs add-on, inspect add-on, JSView add-on, Addblock Plus add-on, and a few other add-ons.
