Mouse lock to a row and screen scroll at random during high CPU utilization flash apps

While using CPU-intensive flash application (typically game and the like), the mouse cursor will snap to a row (usually along the center) and all mouse movement is treated a rapid lateral movement; in the case of the content being on a page that is long enough to scroll vertically, the page will scroll at random, and usually a though the screen were circular (page will wrap around from bottom to top, and vice versa). Other browser element that would be interfered with (address and title bars, for example) generally remain unobstructed by this scrolling. If available, in some instances, the browser will return to a page 1-2 back in the history (as though Alt-Left Arrow had been depressed)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a flash application that engages high CPU utilisation (graphics and input intensive usually do the trick)
2. Interact with the app a normal; timing varies, but usually 10-15 minute of continued use are needed.
3. Wait for issue to occur.
Actual Results:
In instance where this issue ha occurred, problem will last anywhere from 10 to 20 seconds; if the browser doe not return to a prior page, generally normal function can be resumed, though usually with severe lagtimes in mouse movement, etc, within the browser window (that is, the mouse cursor is visible and move at it's normal rate once outside of the application itself, but any cursor unique to the application will be far behind).

Expected Results:
The browser/application/machine should merely slow down if the system is over-taxed; such movement (or restriction thereof) doe not appear to be expected behaviour.

In many instances, simultaneous keyboard and mouse input are occurring, but not in all circumstances.

For the most part, this ha occurred on system running Linux (Ubuntu Jaunty and Ubuntu Karmic among the recent), but a few incident have occurred in WinXP (last known in Windows XP Pro w/ SP2).

Several version of Firefox from the late 2.5 build to the current have been affected, a well a version of Flash from the same timeframe.
