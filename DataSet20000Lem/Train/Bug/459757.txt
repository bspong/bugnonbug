This page, and others I'm working on locally show the same characteristic using Project Seven Slide Show magic DHTML widget, and I've also had rendering problem using Jquery Accordion widget. Both utilize javascript/DHTML animation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to target page on Vista 64 bit, Firefox 3.0.3
2.Observe Slide Show Magic animation
3.
Actual Results:
DHTML animation show overflow of "stage" div on width to right side. Vertical resizing is jerky, if not 1-step of animation, with image rendering first, then stage resized properly in vertical dimension.

Using Jquery accordion animation, button in menu animated in a jerky fashion, like frame being skipped in a movie.

Expected Results:
In slide show magic, "stage" div should resize smoothly to the next image size in the slide show.

In Jquery accordion, button should move smoothly to new position.

Animations work properly in Internet Explorer 7.0.6001.18000 under Vista 64. Have confirmed that Firefox 3.0.3 render them properly under Vista Ultimate 32-bit.
