Mozilla should have debug builds, symbol server, and easy way to sync source code to a release
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier:

Maybe some of this infrastructure already exists, but I couldn't find any info on it.

The scenario is somebody that is developing a javascript application sometimes need to drop into the debugger to understand why Firefox is doing something a certain way. A typical DHTML engineer that ha some C++ debugging skill probably doesn't have the time to build a full debug release of Mozilla (the build ha gotten better but it still take a while to figure out and a long time to build). An engineer might also be debugging problem that are different in different version of the browser. Ironically, in some way it can be easier for an application developer to debug Internet Explorer since Microsoft provides a public symbol server (SRV**http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols).

Mozilla can do a lot better by providing a public symbol server, debug build version of all released builds, and an easy way to sync to the source code of a particular build (may already exist). In my ideal world, there would be a page "Debugging Firefox without building it yourself" that would provide link to all debug build that can be installed, a symbol server with public symbol that work with ntsd/windbg/VS (and I am guessing this can be made to work with other platform too but I don't know if the tool are that advanced), and a label or branch or whatever the CVS equivalent is to sync a client to the source code for that release.

This would have helped me and my fellow engineer numerous time with debugging problem we've hit in Mozilla. It probably would result in higher quality bug being submitted and possibly bug fixes.
