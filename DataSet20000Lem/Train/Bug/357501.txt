When trying to scroll a web page using the edge of the touchpad on my laptop, the cursor change to a "scrolling" cursor but the page doe not actually move. This happens in all window within Firefox including "View Page Source" and the Java Script console, however scrolling work fine with all other application including Internet Explorer and I am able to scroll firefox manually by using the scrollbar on the edge of the window.

My Laptop is an Acer Aspire 1693WLMi and the touchpad is a Synaptics TouchPad V5.9 I have downloaded the latest driver for this touchpad from the Acer website and this ha not solved the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure Virtual Scrolling is enabled from mouse property and check it work in another application.
2. run Firefox and open a URL with a page long enough to be scrolled
3. try scrolling the page using the virtual scrolling feature of the touchpad

Actual Results:
Mouse pointer change to a "scrolling pointer" (which look like a scrollbar with a normal mouse pointer over the top of it) but the page doe not scroll.

Expected Results:
Page should have scrolled.

I've rated the problem a minor because it's probably specific to my hardware and there is an easy workaround a I can still use the scrollbar.
