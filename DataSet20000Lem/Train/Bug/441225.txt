Using a Quick Search result in parameter initially appearing URL encoded

The Firefox 3 location bar apparently support displaying URL encoded characters, such a %20 a a ' ' (space), now. Which is great.

But, if I type the keyword for a Quick Search Bookmark I have defined and some text including spaces, first it place that text into the URL defined in the bookmark, URL encoding the spaces. A split second later, all the %20s in the URL are correctly replaced with ' 's, but what if that conversion after the fact wasn't necessary - what if the Quick Search Bookmark produced an un-URL encoded string to begin with.

Note: sorry if this should be categorized under the "Bookmarks" component, I wasn't sure.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Quick Search Bookmark if you don't already have one. For example, one with a location of "http://www.google.com/search?q=%s" and a keyword of "g".
2. In the location bar, type "g Mozilla Firefox", continuing with this example.
3. Press enter
Actual Results:
With this example, the content of the location bar are replaced with "http://www.google.com/search?q=Mozilla%20Firefox", then a split second later are correctly replaced with "http://www.google.com/search?q=Mozilla Firefox".

Expected Results:
The content of the location bar should be replaced with "http://www.google.com/search?q=Mozilla Firefox" immediately, not requiring the intermediate step.
