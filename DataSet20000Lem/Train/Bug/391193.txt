Refuses to contact the server upon hitting an error or certain response - have to restart browser to flush

When ever I've hit a problem, like 403, 503, not found due to unresolved domain.
The browser refuse to actually try again due to caching...

Example today, I wa having an issue configuring a web server and FF had got a application/octet-stream response. Due to FF's cache it will not actually "Go and Check" the server and just doe whatever is in the cache at the point in time. Opening FF on another computer (mstsc ftw) revealed that if FF had bothered to actually try again it would have got a 200 response and page full of html...

This is really annoying for DNS issue a well, the cache think it know best - no amount of forced refreshing (ctrl+F5) will let the browser actually "Go and Check" for a fresh response. Clearing the local cache and actually nslookuping up doesn't resolve it either. I connect to OpenDNS's dns server so you can actually ensure you are getting the correct result.

The only way to fix these problem is to close & re-open the browser. Not really an issue if the only tab you have open is that single one giving you issues. I never usually have just one tab open though... Restoring existing session just carry the problem over so you do have to make sure every tab is closed before you exit so you can start up on a clean slate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure LiteSpeed wrong
2. Access the site from FF
3. Get a response, (still broken)
4. Re-configure LiteSpeed
5. Retry the page in FF
6. Get a cached response
7. Open FF on another Computer
8. Get "fresh" response, working
9. Back to cached FF
10. Still serving cached response even though if FF bothered to actually check the server it would have got a different response.
Actual Results:
FF refuse to "check" the server for a different response
