Remove legacy generator from browser/.

If the code fit into async function and also it's test code, replaced legacy generator with async function.
for other cases, just replaced legacy generator with ES6 generator.

some notes:

* browser/base/content/test/chrome/test_aboutCrashed.xul
Task.jsm and Promise.jsm are no more used.

* browser/components/downloads/test/browser/browser_libraryDrop.js
|drop| function (previously |task_drop|) now return promise, so
|yield*| in caller is changed to |yield|

* browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_DownloadLastDirWithCPS.js
all function called by |runTest| can return promise, so changed |runTest| to async function and just await for them.
also, checkDownloadLastDir and checkDownloadLastDirNull didn't return value. fixed them.

* browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_downloadLastDir_toggle.js
what |testHelper| doe is Task.async, that can be just replaced with async.

* browser/components/privatebrowsing/test/browser/browser_privatebrowsing_windowtitle.js
|testTabTitle| is also used like Task.async, so replaced with async

* browser/components/sessionstore/SessionMigration.jsm
this can also use async, but I used ES6 generator since it's not test.
also, replaced |throw new Task.Result(state);| with |return state;|,
since ES6 generator can return value.

* browser/components/sessionstore/test/browser_capabilities.js
|createTab| return a promise that is resolved to tab.
so that can be rewritten by async that return tab.

* browser/components/sessionstore/test/browser_formdata_format.js
this test wait for the all tab to be closed,
so created an array of promises, and pushed all promise that is resolved
when the tab is closed, and the test finish when those all promise are
resolved

|testTabRestoreData| function doe partially Task.async, so replaced whole
function to async.
