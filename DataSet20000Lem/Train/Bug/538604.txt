Possible same-origin-policy regression in ff 3.5.7 (reproducible with OWASP webgoat 5.2/5.3)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Apologies if this is a false alarm (I am a noob ff bug reporter) - however it is reproducible on my system.

Some background:
================
1. Reproducible on ff 3.5.7 on window xp
2. Did not occur on earlier ff (can't recall the version but would have been le than 2 month ago).
3. Not reproducible for example on ff 3.0.15 (ubunutu)

I wa revisiting the OWASP webgoat 5.2 app. The lesson is "Ajax security -> Same origin policy", and noticed that ff no longer fails when you try to emit an xmlhttprequest to a different origin.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. fire up a localhost OWASP WebGoat 5.2 instance on port 12080
2. navigate to the "Ajax security -> Same origin policy" lesson
3. start firebug
4. try another url (that violates same origin) or try executing the code below from the console window

var xmlHttp;
xmlHttp=new XMLHttpRequest();
xmlHttp.open("GET","http://localhost:13080",true);
xmlHttp.send(null);
Actual Results:
I observe (in firebug) an attempted GET to the URL I supply.

Expected Results:
I expect ff to emit an exception, e.g. "Access to restricted URI denied" code: "1012"

I have the following addons installed (latest versions):

hackbar, firebug, tamper data, fireproxy standard, adblock plus, default user agent, page info, selenium ide
