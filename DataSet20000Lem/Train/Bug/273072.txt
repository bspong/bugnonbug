university,outer access may be forbidden) When I got the music list, I found,
there are two button after each song,one is used for "listening" and the other is
used for "download", when I use IE ,the both is valid,but when I use Firefox,though
I like it so much, the button"listening" just didn't work,it seems that ,the button
is hidden,I can't see it .so,I can only download the song ,but can't "listening"

it really troubled me a lot, I know firefox is much faster and steady than IE,I
like to use it ,but each time when I want to listen to the music ,i have to use
the IE. For my english is limitted ,i can't find what bug it exactly is ,so
,could you help me. Firefox user from China
