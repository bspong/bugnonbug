Firefox completely broken after upgrade to 3.5.7 and affected Internet Explorer

I have just upgraded my software to v3.5.7 based on a download offered through Firefox. I am using Windows XP64bit.
The software installed this morning and immediately the application fails to work.
I am presented with the upgrade information screen but cannot progress beyond it. The system hang and show a noscript prohibition. When I right click on the Noscript icon it give me only 2 option - Options (with noting below it) and about noscript.
When I try to switch tab nothing happens - I get an error message saying something like "This is embarassing...." If I choose the restart option I get Google front screen, but it doesn't work. I have to close the app.

If I relaunch the app the same thing happens - and I notice that the side menu (favourites etc.) isn't working.

I am having to use Internet Explorer to contact you but if I try to bring up my 'Favourites' option IE crashes. It will only work if I key in an address directly.

I cannot see any way to revert to the old version of Firefox so I am completely stuck.

Reproducible: Always
