After some time, or when opening certain website in a Firefox window maximized (or even normal window) on the second monitor, Firefox initially start to scroll very badly, with some delay and moving chunk of page at a time.

Soon after, it becomes very slow to respond even to it own menu like View or Tools and during this time, in Task Manager I see firefox.exe using 25% CPU (out of 4 cores, so I assume it's one core used)
At some times, it's hard even to drag the window on the second monitor to the first monitor, a half way the mouse loses control of the window. The only solution then is to use Ctrl+Alt+Del and kill the Firefox process.

I suspect it's something related to Javascript or with parsing CSS a when the scroll issue start to appear, the error console is spammed with message such a these:

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
Can't say it happens all the time, a this only happens with some website that open on the second monitor, others work just fine.
Therefore, I can't give suggestion to reproduce this.

I can only say that I see this happening often when opening techdirt.com on the second monitor, opening 3-4 article in new tab on the same monitor, scroll down each article to read it and some comment and then it start to scroll badly.
Less often, it happens with Wikipedia or fark.com

Actual Results:
Firefox slows down, not responsive (5-10 second to show menus), eventually ha to be killed using Task Manager even though only one CPU (25%) seems to be used by it.

Expected Results:
Well, it shouldn't happen.

This started to happen with the latest version or perhaps with the latest couple of versions... anyway, it's at best a 1-2 week old problem.
