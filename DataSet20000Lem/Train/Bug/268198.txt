Improving firefox's tabbed browsing architecture (not just UI improvements)

This bug give some suggestion to how firefox could improve it underlying
architecture in tabbed browsing for Firefox 1.1.

First of all, I think firefox should implement two mode on the UI level, tabbed
browsing mode and traditional browsing mode (aka. new window mode). User just
select their preferred mode and the appropriate setting will be selected. This
simplies the tabbed browsing preference in "Options.../Advanced" and make it
easier for novice users.

On the underlying level, we should implement the following preference
Browser.open.opennewfor.bookmarks (this option ally to the bookmark sidebar,
the bookmark toolbar and the bookmark menu)
Browser.open.opennewfor.history (this option applies to the history sidebar and
the go menu)
Browser.open.opennewfor.DDEcall (this option should also apply to the firefox
help system and the extension manager)
Browser.open.opennewfor.externallink
Browser.open.opennewfor.home
Browser.open.opennewfor.javascriptcall (if false is selected, popups will be
opened in the current tab)
Browser.open.opennewfor.middleclick (shift+click and ctrl+click should dod the
same thing under this: either they open a new winodw or a new tab)

Browser.open.opennewtab
Browser.open.openinforeground (this option also applies to new window mode. It
specifies whether or not the newly opened window will receive focus)

I am sure this bug duplicate the idea of other bug and some of the idea had
already been implemented. It would be nice if these bug are cosolidated into
one meta bug to be resolved.

I believe the proposed change will make fx's architecture le confusing and
will solve the tab browsing problem once and for all.
