Steps to reproduce:

Go to the bug (unrelated) here:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1144992

Click on the attachment gif, then click the back mouse button, and repeat until the page appears to be waiting to finish loading.


Actual results:

The page doesn't stop loading. This issue right now in this session is reproducible. I have a fairly clean profile here that I have been using all day, however I cannot reproduce this in a just-born clean profile. In the affected profile I have no extension and only H264 plugin.

I enabled a debugging proxy and I can see the right information is returned so I don't know why Nightly doesn't properly acknowledge the load. This happens in both e10s and non-e10s tabs.

What's very interesting is the second I turn on web developer tool (if they were not on) or turn them off (if they were on) the image will appear and the page load will complete. I tried this several dozen time at arbitrary time waiting for the page to load I would hit CTRL+SHIFT+I and the image would show. Another way to get the image to show and the page load to complete is to select another window.

I made a video showing the problem. It is confusing that there are two mouse pointer in the video and that is because the GIF image that is loaded actually ha a mouse pointer in it. The actual mouse pointer in my video ha a transparent yellow circle around it. The video is attached.

I will also be attaching a Fiddler capture of the session. Session #46 is the completed session that doesn't finish loading. Notice the CONNECT in session 47 and the reget in 48 when the page load (ie the gif is shown).


Expected results:

This shouldn't happen obviously.
