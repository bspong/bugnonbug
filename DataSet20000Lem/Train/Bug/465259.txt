Firefox stop responding to mouse clicks, in a seemingly random manner. Keyboard input is still accepted. Other application respond normally to the mouse. Switching focus to the Windows Task Manager and back to firefox fix the problem: sometimes only for one click, sometimes for a long period of time, but most generally for a few clicks.
The problem happens more frequently if firefox is being used via remote desktop, but also sometimes when on the machine locally.
Sometimes mouse input is partially accepted: you can do most things, but you can't select something in a dropdown. You can drop it down, but the highlight won't follow the mouse, and clicking doe not change the selection. Switching to task manager doe not fix this problem; you must navigate the box via keyboard.
This ha been going on for a few pushed-upgrades now, but unfortunately I'm not sure how many.
