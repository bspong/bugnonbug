i have noticed everytime i goto any web page firefox seems to load from the
cache rather then check for new updates. everytime i have to clear the cache
and reload the page to see a differnce. this doe not happen with just me. i
have turned all of my friend into mozilla addicts, and they complain about the
same problem. we go on alot of public forum where people update their
signeratures and avatars, but in order to see a change we have to clear the
cache. this even happens when i make change to web page i am personally
designing. it is just annoying. sure you can turn off cache, but i doubt
everyone will do that. so it remains a problem. this mainly pertains to
picture only...text load fine.

Reproducible: Sometimes
