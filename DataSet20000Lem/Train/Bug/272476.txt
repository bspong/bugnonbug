When Migrating from Internet Explorer 6.0, Firefox did not import password for password protected page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

When I migrated from IE 6, all my form usernames and password were imporeted,
but those for password-protected sites, which I had asked IE to save, were not.
I refer to the site where a javascript-like popup asks for username and
password, instead of a form-based authentication (the exact term eludes me).
Hope I am clear. Please feel free to email me if not - I will try and look up
the technical name for such authentication (I have never used it).
Thanks

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an account on a web-site with password protected pages.
2. Visit the site in IE 6, and enter your username and password. Let IE save the
id and password.
3. Install Firefox and import all IE settings.
4. Go to the website again in Firefox.
5. Firefox will probably time out.

Actual Results:
Firefox timed out every time.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have prompted me with the imported user id and password, just a
it would if I asked Firefox to save this authentication. FF loses IE's saved id
password for non-form based auth.
