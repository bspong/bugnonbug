user specific directory are created under C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data. I want to control where these folder go.
User-Agent: Opera/7.11 (Windows NT 5.1; U) [en]
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1

One annoyance I have with the browser: Firebird creates the following
directory under C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data
Mozilla
Phoeniz
Talkback

I am trying to run "clean" (not install anything directly on my machine). I
tried putting the folder in the same path a the executable (usb device) but
the folder were still created on my C drive.
Is it possible to disable the creation of these folders?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firebird from my flash drive, directory are created
2. delete directory / move them to the flash drive
3. run firebird, directory are again created on my C drive. I don't want this
behavior!

Actual Results:
Directories are created in an un-wanted area.

Expected Results:
I would like to be able to control where the directory are created. I don't
want thing stored in the registry either because I want to be able to run
"clean" -- no reg entries, no misc directory created on my hard drive.
