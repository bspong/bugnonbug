Hello, I'm a web developer.
I'm trying to perform some test and I cannot whatsoever completely disable the pop-up blocker.
I'm trying to open a very large number of new window in new tab from javascript: <script type='text/javascript'>window.open('http://www.whateversite.com')</script>
Even though localhost is permitted to always open new pop-up and most of all, even though "Block pop-up windows" is UNchecked, after the 20th tab the block icon appears in the bar at the bottom of the page and I get the message that Firefox prevented this site from openin 100 pop-up windows.

Thanks


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Completely turn off pop-up blocker
2.add any number above 20 of <script type='text/javascript'> window.open('http://www.yoursite.com')</script> in the body of the page

Actual Results:
it only open the first 20 new window and the rest are blocked, even though pop-up blocker is completely turned off, it still say Firefox prevented the site from opening the specified number of pop-up window

Expected Results:
I should be able to open from a site any number of pop-up window if the pop-up blocker is turned off.

In my setting i'm opening any new page in a tab in the current window.
