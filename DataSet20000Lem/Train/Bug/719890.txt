Pressing "backspace" in the location bar doe not delete the last character typed, if inline autocomplete is active
Steps to reproduce:

1. Focus the location bar.
2. Press the "g" key.
3. Press the "o" key.
4. Press the backspace key.

Expected results: "g" is in the location bar.
Actual results: "go" is in the location bar.

This happens because of bug 566489. After step 3, the location bar contains an auto-completed URL like "go[oogle.com]" (the "oogle.com" is selected). Pressing backspace deletes only the selected part, not including the last character typed.

I'm not sure of the best thing to do here. The current behavior make perfect sense if you are looking at the URL bar and see what is happening, but it wreaks havoc whenever I type fast and try to correct mistake a I go. It also introduces a mode error, where pressing backspace produce different result depending on whether the browser ha just found an auto-complete suggestion.

This ha already caused me to enter incorrect URLs twice in the last hour, and it wa confusing to figure out what happened. It's possible that this should be WONTFIX, but I'm hoping someone can come up with a creative solution to this problem.
