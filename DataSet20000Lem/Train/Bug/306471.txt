Upload setting wrong Content-Type for file if you downloaded file with such an extension from a server that provided the wrong Content-Type for them

This appears only in Firefox/Win, not on the Mac. Also tested IE on XP and
Safari, and both were fine.

When uploading an mp3 file with POST and enctype="multipart/form-data", the
server receives application/x-octet-stream for the Content-Type instead of
audio/mpeg.

Situation doe not appear to be identical to similar case 306042 and 279619.
We tested on different machine (all XP & same browser version, though) and all
ha the same problem, so doesn't appear to be a local configuration issue.

This is on an internal site. I don't have an external URL to demo with, sorry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to a page with an HTML form: POST, with enctype="multipart/form-data"
2. Upload an MP3 file (our file all have .mp3 extensions)
3. Note the outgoing Content-Type for the uploaded file.

Actual Results:
Server received x-octet-stream for Content-Type

Expected Results:
Should have received audio/mpeg
