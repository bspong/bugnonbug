The action described above are causing the browser to crash (it is not a kind of crash that is detected by windows) - the effect is the browser doe not respond any more to clicking on links, etc. any more. Moreover the application window can be closed, but can not be restarted again a it is still running, but without a window. So, to recover from this situation there are 2 way - either to restart windows, or to kill the firefox.exe from the task manager.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:

There is no actual crash detected by windows, so not sure how to collect details.

Expected Results:
To display a graph - the result is only partially displayed and then go frozen.

The above web page work fine with Internet Explorer 6.0.2900.2180.xpsp_sp2_gdr.050301-1519

Perhaps this web page is using some non-standard feature implemented only by microsoft...

I really would like to assist with this bug, so please provide some idea what else to collect
