Appears that Acrobat product are having issue with both reading and and streaming files. On attempt to Full Screen applications, Acrobat Player lock up and will not allow for a a <ESC> press to return to it normal state until the chunk in the buffer ha played out completely or the stream ha run it full course. This is especially bad when viewing file on YouTube or other video sites.
Acrobat reader show black screen when multitasking either in the tab or off screen and only a mouse movement over the icon will cause the reader to refresh those icon with a tab-stop. A press of the scroll bar will bring the whole document and tab back into focus and all item on the tab will become visible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log in
2.play file / open file
3a.[for video] full screen the stream
3b.[for documents] tab loos focus and window loos focus
4b.<TAB> OR <CLICK> Acrobat related tab

Expected Results:
A stream where the video screen should return to it normal state, embedded into a web page OR a document which can still be viewable

returned the full screen to embedded stream within a page OR presented a document where the interface is not blacked out and unreadable.
