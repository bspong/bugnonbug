Whenever you switch tabs, the accessible object returned by
AccessibleObjectFromPoint should be able to QI for ISimpleDOMText. However this
only work for at most one open tab (which tab this is change a you open and
clsoe tab and navigate inside a tab according to a logic I cannot determine).

Also this is a problem sometimes with just one tab if you click a link and go
back but in this case it doe not consistently fail but seems to most of the
time, especially if you go from a file clicked from teh desktop to open Deer
park and then click a link in that file to a website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Deer Park to any page, default alpha 2 page is fine
2. use my tester app from the above URL to see that the ISimpleDOMText is giving
data wherever the mouse is
3. ctrl+click any link to open a new tab

Actual Results:
Notice that either the new tab doe not work with the tester or the original tab
stop working
4. Now try closing the tab that work and notice the other tab that didnt work,
now works!


Expected Results:
all tab should work with ISimpleDOMText regardless of what order they were
opened or what tab were shut. All the tester app is doing is to QI's
ISimpleDOMText from the accessible object for the present tab. It work
inconsistently with multiple tab or in the same tab across multiple page in
history.
