It give all the information needed.

Also I stated in that thread that I reverted to an older Firefox. Which wasn't too much older than the current release ... and it also behaves abnormally to the stated condition in that thread.

Please note a per that thread this system is a G4 Sawtooth with 512 MB RAM running Mac OS 10.4.7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse the net specifically site with heavy usage of images, styles, and so forth. Like DeviantArt ... posting and looking at people art. As well a communicating inside their ShoutBox. http://shout.deviantart.com/popup. However this bug is reproduced on any site. Just a quick way to reproduce it is DA, so you don't have to spend alot of time to see it for yourself.
2.Try typing in new URL's after a while into the URL Bar or typing in form fields, either one in focus or one not in focus.
3.Close window/tab and reopen new window will fix the problem for a while. Sometimes copying and pasting text will fix. And will enable it to work in either case for a little longer. Then the same bug will reappear.

Actual Results:
Will disallow any typing in the URL Bar or typing in Forms. However text is selectable to copy, delete, paste, etc. Just won't let you type or delete using delete key.

Expected Results:
Allowed the character from keyboard to be typed in the URL Bar, a well a forms.

FF wa the basic installed version on 2 clean install system (G4 Sawtooth's). And replicatable on both. No additional plugins, features,etc., to either system wa performed after the basic install of 10.4.7 and then the install of FF.
