Download of a exe file (from Texas Instruments) fails due to mixed content
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0; WOW64; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/23.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130814063812

Steps to reproduce:

When downloading file from Texas Instruments like
one of the patch programmer
http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC3000_Wi-Fi_Downloads#Patch_Programmer
fails. Download doe simply not start.
Even if it fails, you get an email with a link inside,
which also fails.
(Registration required, therefore i cannot share the link,
because i don't know if my login/password is somehow in link...)
IE display (i have a German version, translated by myself...)
first: "Only secure content is displayed - would you display complete content"
second: "Would you download or save ....exe" (EXE!)

I already tried to temporarily to switch off Popup-Blocker, Ad-Blocker, "Warn me when site try to install add-on",
"Block report attack sites", "Block reported web forgeries". Still no success.
I also tried a nightly build from Firefox (which is one of the version 25), but no success.



Actual results:

Download fails with Firefox (but work with MSIE)
No download is started.


Expected results:

Download shall work with Firefox.
