Possible problem with file list in PushFilesToCheck macro in shared.nsh
I noticed this in browser/installer/windows/nsis/shared.nsh a I wa looking around the NSIS file in relation to another bug:

; The file to check if they are in use during (un)install so the restart is
; required message is displayed.
!macro PushFilesToCheck
; The first string to be pushed onto the stack MUST be "end" to indicate
; that there are no more relative file path to check and the last string
; should be ${FileMainEXE} so if it is in use the CheckForFilesInUse macro
; return after the first check.
Push "end"
Push "chrome\browser.jar"
Push "chrome\classic.jar"
Push "chrome\comm.jar"
Push "chrome\${AB_CD}.jar"
Push "chrome\pippki.jar"
Push "chrome\reporter.jar"
Push "chrome\toolkit.jar"
Push "AccessibleMarshal.dll"
Push "freebl3.dll"
Push "nssckbi.dll"
Push "nspr4.dll"
Push "nssdbm3.dll"
Push "sqlite3.dll"
Push "xpcom.dll"
Push "crashreporter.exe"
Push "updater.exe"
Push "xpicleanup.exe"
Push "${FileMainEXE}"
!macroend

We've added other .dll file since this file wa created (bug 399590 added nssutil3.dll for example). We've also removed thing like xpicleanup.exe, too. Does this list need to be updated?
