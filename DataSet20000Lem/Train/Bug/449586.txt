Crazy mouse when using PS2 mousepad

During the loading of certain web page (for example https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/query.cgi), using the mousepad of my laptop (Clevo 2700T - PS2 compatible mousepad) result in "crazy mouse" behaviour. This is not limited to hovering over links, and is evident even when the mouse pointer is initially over a blank area of the page.
Symptoms - mouse pointer jump to extreme top-right of page and/or extreme bottom left of page. Left-clicks are detected (consistent with the mouse-pad being "tapped" - could this be a result of intermittent mousepad operation, ie the continuous movement input from the mousepad is detected a discrete individual "taps" on the mousepad?). Right click are also intermittently detected (don't know what could be causing this) resulting in context menu appearing.
When testing on the same machine/webpage with a USB mouse the problem are not evident - no mouse pointer jumping, no left- or right-clicks erroneously detected.
OS version: Windows XP sp3
Processor: Tualatin P3-S 1266MHz 512kb cache
Memory: 1GB PC133

Jumping to the upper-right corner of the screen often cause firefox to be closed (due to the left-click detection activating the "close window" gadget). The crazy mouse behaviour then continues until firefox.exe disappears from task manager a an active process.

I also experience symptom similar to bug 442572 (FF3 Not registering Cursor/mouse clicks) intermittently - don't know if they are linked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open firefox (build Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1)
2. Navigate to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
3. Click on "search" link at top left of page.
4. Whilst page is loading, move mouse pointer using PS2 compatible mousepad.

HINT: To explore the bug without closing firefox down each time, activate the task manager, and drag it off the top-right of the screen to obscure the "close window" gadget of the firefox browser.
Actual Results:
Mouse pointer jump from initial position to either extreme top-right or bottom-left of screen. Pointer then jump between extreme top-right and extreme bottom left of screen. Mouse pointer movement info from the touchpad is interpreted a mouse button click (left or right).

Expected Results:
Mouse pointer should move smoothly from initial position a directed by user input to the touchpad

Bug disappears when using USB mouse (Microsoft USB optical scroll mouse).
Default theme.
