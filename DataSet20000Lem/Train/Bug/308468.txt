In the page http://www.yaravandenbroek.nl/lennert.html we make use of a
css-style sheet. The underlining of the 2 link on hover doesn't work the right
way. When the link are hovered they should be underlined. In reality only the
first link is partially underlined when hovering over it. When you leave the
link at the top, the line remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
We tried to reduce the error page to a minimum. The minimal condition to
reproduce the problem are:
* there are two link within one p-tag with a br-tag between them
* above the link there is a section for which the stylesheet defines the use of
the font 'courier' or 'courier new' at a size of 28pt.
* This all is surrounded by a div-tag
* The stylesheet defines that the link are only underlined when hovered

Actual Results:
the link are displayed incorrectly when you hover over them. The second link
will not be underlined at all, the first only get underlined over the length of
the second one. When the first link is left over the top, the line remains visible.

Expected Results:
When one of the link is hovered i should be entirely underlined. The line
should dissapear when the link is left.

The error occurs on serveral different window machines. Other browser don't
display the error.
