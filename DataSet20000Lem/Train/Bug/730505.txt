Performance problem with Firefox 10 (on Mac OS X)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_6_8) AppleWebKit/535.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/16.0.912.75 Safari/535.7

Steps to reproduce:

Within the last two week or so, I have noticed a performance issue with Firefox, which render it almost unusable. This seem to correspond with the upgrade from Firefox 9 to 10, so it seems likely Firefox 10 is the cause of the issue. My usage of Firefox have not changed in other ways, so I am not sure what else can be causing this drastic change in the behaviour of Firefox.



Actual results:

Two or three second after loading a webpage (or closing a tab), Firefox 10 becomes unresponsive, with the Firefox process consuming 100%+ of CPU usage, and this continues for more than 20 second before Firefox becomes responsive again.

I have many (100+) tab open on my Firefox, but this ha not been a problem before the last two weeks, and nothing much have changed during that time (except the upgrade to Firefox 10). I have Flashblock 1.5.15.1, NoScript 2.3 and RAMBack 1.0 extension installed, and my Mac (running Mac OS X 10.6.8) ha 12G of memory (of which about 3G is used by Firefox)


Expected results:

Before this problem, I have not had this unresponsive behaviour from Firefox when loading a webpage. Having this problem make Firefox almost unusable (in fact I am using Chrome to file this bug report)

I have restarted Firefox, and the problem is still here.
