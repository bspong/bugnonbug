Running Firefox 3 on host make VMware virtual machine slow, Firefox 2 doe not

A few of u at the University at Buffalo have noticed that running Firefox 3 on the host Linux OS make virtual machine in VMware Workstation 5 and VMware Workstation 6 run very slow. Firefox 2 doe not cause this problem. We have observed this behavior both on Ubuntu 8.04, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firefox 2 on your host
2. Run VMware workstation on your host.
3. Boot up your virtual machine (like XP, Vista, or Linux)
4. Observe the performance of your virtual machine
5. Quit Firefox 2 on your Linux host.
6. Start up Firefox 3 on your Linux host
6. Observe the performance of your virtual machine.
Actual Results:
You will notice a significant and very obvious degradation of performance in the virtual machine when Firefox 3 is running on the host a opposed to Firefox 2.

Expected Results:
I would expect that merely running Firefox would not affect the performance of VMware virtual machine so adversely.

As I mentioned above, we have observed this behavior with different version of Linux and different version of VMware workstation. We suspect that Firefox 3 is "doing something" to the host Linux's kernel that is causing the issue.

I am labeling this a critical, because this issue certainly could cause crash or loss of data in virtual machines.
