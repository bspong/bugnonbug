Poor performance and high memory usage in Firefox after waking up computer from sleep
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:51.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/51.0
Build ID: 20170125094131

Steps to reproduce:

Open Firefox and begin opening new tabs, memory usage increase on each new tab opened, memory usage doe not appear to reduce to previous level after closing tab based on Windows Task Manager data. Sites like Facebook, LinkedIn or YouTube that have a heavy medium load will use up memory faster then more text based site and it will be more apparent that not all memory is released when a tab is closed.

I ran 2 separate memory test run on about:memory done about 7 minute apart. The first test show the test shortly after launching Firefox, the 2nd after deliberately opening and closing a number of tab on varoius social medium site (for this test I used Facebook and LinkedIn)

*I tried attaching the file but couldn't a the file were too big and would take too long to upload, I'll add the data from the log in a reply.

Based on my tests, it doe not matter what site is used, a long the page being opened consumes enough memory to make a noticeable change in Firefox's memory usage.


Actual results:

Memory usage (RAM) gradually increase whenever Firefox is allowed to run continuously, such a during daily work usage or long video watching or social medium sessions.


Expected results:

When a tab is closed, all memory that tab used should be released back to the OS for general usage. RAM usage of Firefox should only be dependent on how many tabs/windows are open and the type and amount of content on those pages, not how long it's been running for.
