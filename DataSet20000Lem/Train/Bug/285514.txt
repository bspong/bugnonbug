Dear Mozilla Firefox developers,

First of all, thank you all for developing such a nice free browser to the users.

Here I encountered one thing that I feel need to be improved. Often user browse
at different pc's and they want to join the bookmars together from different
pc's, which to large extent, contain many same urls. By importing from the saved
single file 'bookmarks.html' under 'File' menu, the Firefox bookmark manager
simply put all exactly the same bookmark together, and I just cannot find a
way to delete the duplicate ones. May I know is there any way to remove these
duplicate bookmark when two bookmark file containing many exactly same
bookmark are joined into one? Thank you for your support.

Sincerely

Wangzuo
