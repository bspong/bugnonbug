Whenever Bon Echo run a search engine update check, it "randomly" change the search engine appearing in the search bar. I wa able to confirm this after I suddenly noticed my search engine changing before my eyes, accompanied with a lot of disk activity. When I went to about:config and checked the time for app.update.lastUpdateTime.searc-engine-update-timer, it matched the time of occurrence. Others have also reported being affected by this issue (see: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2485017#2485017)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure Bon Echo to "Automatically check for update to:" Search Engines
2. Install a few additional search engines, for good measure. :-)
3. Modify browser.search.updateinterval so the check occurs sooner (or more frequently), say 1 hour
4. Wait. It might take a few hit to present the issue.


Actual Results:
Too impatient so didn't try. I have seen this bug many times, and, a indicated above, others experiencing the issue have also mentioned it on the Mozillazine "Firefox Builds" thread.


Expected Results:
Checking for search engine update should not modify the user selected search engine.
