so... I Just downloaded the latest version...
No Spell Check unless you go to the spell check and chose USA CA ... EVERY TIME you want to spell check something...
the right mouse button no longer responds... (like when you want to save a pic)
it keep trying to dial my connection EVEN WHEN ONLINE ALREADY...!

this is an Improvment?
I have NO Idea how to get back to what works...
your help system if OVERWHELMING... I have NO Idea where to even start?
should I just dump Mozilla ? I hate to... I really liked it.
seems like it is really messing with my system... crashing my computer etc... I have run Norton and Spy bot repeatedly... and Still ZIP!

what the hell do i do?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I don't even know where to begin!
Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
A working browser?

why can't a Browser have a Spell check that learns your spelling error and fix them automaticly? that i would buy!

also when filing this... NONE of the little pull down worked.
