It seems that the firefox on mac can't handle umlaut in OS X. The Problem doe not appear to Firefox on Windows based systems.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.eggenbergermedia.com/Upload/
2.Upload an file with umlaut
3.You will see the PHP Array of the $_FILES array.
4.Check the file size behind "[size]"
5.Upload another file without umlaut
6.Check the file size behind "[size]"
Actual Results:
it creates a file with zero bytes.

Expected Results:
the file must have a size.

Please make a fix to solve the problem.
