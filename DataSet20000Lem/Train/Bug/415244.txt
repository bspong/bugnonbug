javascript "screen size/width" misuse -- we need a way to lie about it

1) the browser should do what is best for the user
2) javascript allows gathering the screen size the browser is running on
3) many web author (mis)use screen size a a viewport size estimation
-screen size != window size != viewport size
-on (apparently) large screen with "normal" sized browser window some web site render horrible -- with no good reason
5) _at least_ there should be an option in about:config to _overwrite_ what get reported in screen.hight and screen.width DOM variables, to overcome this problem

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have a large screen or make sure firefox think and report a large screen
(e.g. unrealistic 16000x9000 or realistic 1920x1200)
2. resize your browser window to normal "web width" (e.g. 1024x768 or 1024x1200)
3. surf to a website that think window size == screen size
Actual Results:
The web page render awful, because the content width get adapted to a width you don't have (horizontal scroll bar appears).

Expected Results:
I expect the web site to render a nice a if I would use the same window size on a e.g. 1024x768 screen.

I recommend the creation of about:config variable like "dom.reported_screen_width" at first. Maybe later something like "dom.report_window_size_as_screen_size" or "dom.max_reported_screen_width"...


The real reason to this problem is that some web author don't know that they do. The seed to the problem is that it is to easy and intuitive to get the screen size instead of the viewport size. The latter is more complicated to obtain with javascript.
