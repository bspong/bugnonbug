When using the "save & quit" tab feature in 3.6 while another session of firefox is running some or all the bookmark will be lost or corrupted,(you couldn't "save & quit" in previous version when another session wa running). The other session is usually a streaming web radio broadcast with limited menu options, which doe not shut down when the regular session is shut down using the "save & quit". Upon start up, especially after shutting down the streaming session, the bookmark will be effected.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:

2.shut down main session.
3.Now restart firefox (either after shutting down the streaming session or not)Some or all bookmark will be missing and/or corrupted.
Actual Results:
Some or all bookmark will be missing and/or corrupted. Gets worse with each restart until all bookmark are lost.

Expected Results:
"save & quit" tab feature should shut down all running session of firefox while preserving bookmark and tab in each session
OR
not allow the "save & quit" tab feature while other session are running a in previous versions.
