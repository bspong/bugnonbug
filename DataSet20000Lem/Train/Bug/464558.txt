Context menu doe not appear when I Right-click in the browseable area . When firefox3.1 load (and before/as it go to load the default google searchpage )the context menu appears. The moment the page is loaded and I right click anywhere in the browseable area, the context menu doe not appear. The context menu appears elsewhere in the browser(toolbar,addressbar , tab heading etc) - only the browseable area seems to be affected. This appears in all 3.1 release - even the nightly compiles. Please consider this a major bug

Reproducible: Always

1.Invoke firefox.
2. a soon a you see the browseable area, right click.

3. No menu, no action

Expected Results:

The software should have displayed the context menu at all time.
