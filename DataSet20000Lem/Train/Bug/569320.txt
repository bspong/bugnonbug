Again with another problem with Firefox 3.6.4 Beta. I updated the Beta to the latest one. And It ha another bug! AGAIN! When you view site with Flash, the CPU usage go high to 90% to 100% and then again, causing my laptop fan to go turbo mode. Seriously, can you guy fix this problem? I hate having an hassle to throttle down my processor down! I have the latest version of Flash Player and still causing problems.

Processor(Mobile AMD Sempron 3600+ 2.0 GHz)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch a site with flash player. YouTube for example. Watch a video and then monitor my CPU usage. I saw it spiking up to 90% to 100%
2. Restart browser and went back to YouTube and watched another video. Does the same thing again.
3. Restart browser, restart Windows, re-open YouTube and watched another video. AND still doe the same stupid thing.
Actual Results:
I still get 100% CPU Usage!!!

Expected Results:
Firefox should use le CPU usage. Like in 50 to 65%. Thats good enough. Other browser don't use 100% usage on flash.
