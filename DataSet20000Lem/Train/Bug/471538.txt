Custom URL protocol not properly registered by Firefox (it asks for application)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; da; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

I've been trying to create my own URL protocol. It actually work in IE7 but not in FF3. For reference, I've used these site for helping me:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa767914.aspx
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Register_protocol

Even more funny is that I at one step forgot to enter the "shell/open/command" location and both IE and FF complained about that missing. After entering it, IE opened the application a it should but FF asked for an application to open (even though it must know which one to open).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a foo.reg from the example on http://kb.mozillazine.org/Register_protocol and run
2. Restart Firefox if running
3. Enter "foo:" in the AwesomeBar
Actual Results:
The "open application" window pop up

Expected Results:
Just run the damn thing...

And don't tell me this is another "security feature"! I don't want to hear another "it's not a bug, it's a feature"!

P.S.
I *could* just tell it the program and then it'd be working, but seriously guys...
