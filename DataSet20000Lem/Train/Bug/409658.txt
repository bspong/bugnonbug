Any page displayed within www.facebook.com have a blue background (usually it is white). And the icon and arrangement within these page are messed up too. There are no problem displaying all other web pages. However, these page that failed to be displayed properly can be displayed in the usual manner using Internet Explorer. Attached will be the image of the same page showed by the 2 browsers. I have never had this problem until today. Please fix it asap. I tried uninstalling my firefox and reinstall the latest firefox but the problem still persists. (Erm, I cannot find any place to attach image of the problem (i printed the screen), please email me if you need the pics)
