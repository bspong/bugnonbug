According to the doc here:

http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/Link_Prefetching_FAQ.html

when prefetching LINKs:

* only <link> tag with a relation type of next or prefetch are prefetched
* we explicitly do not prefetch URLs with query strings.

However, it appears that on page on our network such a the URL above which contain the following:

<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Authenticated RSS: Life Beyond Code" href="http://blog.lifebeyondcode.com/blog/index.xml?secure=1">

the URL is prefetched according to our tests... Which it should not be, since the relation o neither next or prefetch and the URL contains a query string.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open URL such a above or http://accordionguy.blogware.com/ a another example
2. Moz prefetches secure url which contains a query string
3. Auth dialog appears

Actual Results:
User can click cancel on auth dialog, but site becomes unusable since auth dialog will appear on every page...

Expected Results:
It should not have prefetched a URL such a contained in this bit of html

<link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" title="Authenticated RSS: Life Beyond Code" href="http://blog.lifebeyondcode.com/blog/index.xml?secure=1">

thus not displaying an auth dialog
