When clicking on a link to open a file, e.g. attempting to download an MSI from the JetBrains website (see attached link), the browser prompt with a dialog entitlied "Opening <file name>". However the "Save file" button isn't initially enabled and take a long time to enable. The time interval isn't consistent either. Sometimes it take a lot longer than other times.

If this dialog is having to do work prior to saving the file then it should provide some kind of feedback to the user. I find myself staring at it in frustration far too often.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to attached URL
2. Click "Full Edition" to start file download
3. Watch resulting file dialog and feel the pain of not knowing when that "Save file" button can be clicked.
Actual Results:
I wait for the "Save file" to be enabled.

Expected Results:
I should be able to select "Save file" straight away. What the hell is it doing anyway???
