User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/5.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox Setup 3.6.14

After loading the file for Firefox setup 3.6.14, I wa told I needed to reboot to complete the instalation. I wa asked if I wanted to do that. I responded yes and the computer rebooted. When I attemtped to open FireFox, I wa told that I needed to reboot the computer to complete the installation. I wa asked if I wanted to reboot and didso. When the computer rebooted, it again ran the script. Aftward, I again attempted to open Firefox and wa again told I needed to reboot. I then attempted to uninstall Firefox and wa again told I needed to reboot to complete the installation, which I did. Again I could not open FireFox.

I wa then advised by a Geek Squad member to reinstall an older version. I attempted to do so but ran into the same popup telling me that I needed to reboot my computer to complete the recent installation
