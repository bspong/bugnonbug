509034 is a bug report going towards that direction.

What happenns: on logging into secure account pages, I get either a blank page (that I am allowed to refresh; i.e. it DOESN'T trigger e.g. the bank to ask you to go back to the inital login screen but insecurely allows the "back" and "refresh" browser buttons. - this implies to me incorrect encryption / lack of? / or low encryption).
Secondly, in the case freedompass.org, the entering of the tracking number draw a "blank"; unable to reproduce at the same time on Safari.

I have "downgraded" to 3.5.7, which behaves perfectly in all respect and.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
try the secure account pages.
Also, I submitted a survey and it did never say that I completed it but greeted me with a blank page.



Firefox 3.5.7 produce correct behaviour: http banking site will NOT permit "refresh" or "back" button on the browser, instead asking you to login back from the very start. All survey I have completed now run correctly.
3.6 ha a bug pertaining to http and certain element of http.
