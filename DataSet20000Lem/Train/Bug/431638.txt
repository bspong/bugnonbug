After having 2 google spreadsheet open for a couple hours, Firefox performance slows to the point where I am waiting 5+ second to change tabs. Within the task manager CPU usage for Firefox hovers around 40 - 50%.

Firefox behavior return to normal if I close the 2 google spreadsheets. I have repeated this process over 4x.

In a few cases, I wa attaching a file to an email within gmail (google apps) when I noticed Firefox performance wa degrading. This may be a red herring.

I have exported the 2 spreadsheet to xl and attached them to this bug report.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Gmail in a new tab
2. Open Google doc in new tab
3. Open spreadsheet 1 (attached) in new tab
4. Open spreadsheet 2 (attached) in new tab
5. Wait about 2 hours.
6. Perform some action in gmail such a composing email in a pop-up window and attaching files.

Actual Results:
Firefox CPU usage hung around 50%. Firefox became unresponsive and slow - about 5 second between UI update when switching tabs.

Expected Results:
Firefox performance should not degrade and CPU usage should not spike.
