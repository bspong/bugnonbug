There are some file whose name are written in Korean.
Mac standard encoding method for the file system is UTF-16.
When you try to see the local file listing with mldonkey's WEB UI,
(Transfer->Scan Temp ), it show discomposed Korean characters, while the Safari
display them correctly.
The used encoding method for the Safari and the Firefox is the UTF-8.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. put some file with Korean file name into the mldonkey's temp directory.
2. launch the mldonkey
3. http://127.0.0.1:4080 for opening mldonkey's WEB UI.
4. click "Transfer" and click "Scan Temp".
5. See if the Korean file name are displayed correctly.
6. Compare the result with other browser like the Safari.


Actual Results:
Please take a look the screenshot I will attach.

Expected Results:
Correct conversion to the UTF-8.

I don't think this problem is caused by the mldonkey, because if you open local
directory with file:///blah.. then you also can confirm that Korean file name
are displayed a discomposed.
