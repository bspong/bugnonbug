Form element (especially text-fields) are very slow since Firefox 1.0.3 Update
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; WinNT4.0; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

I have a slow 450 Mhz computer with Windows NT 4.0. With Firefox 1.0.2,
everything worked fine, but since I updated to 1.0.3, form element like
input-fields, textareas and listboxes are very slow and limp behind the cursor.
E.g. when I type "Hello World" into a textarea-field, I can see the whole text
one or two second after I finished typing.

This problem is very bad when I enter text into a phpBB-forum, in any other
form it is also slow, but not that slow a in the phpBB-forum (e.g. when I want
to edit a new topic).

The result of this problem is that it is heavily to edit text, because I always
have to wait until Firefox really display the text I typed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. For example, open http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/search.php
2. Enter a text into the seach field; Note that this problem exists only on slow
computer (not that 1,5 Ghz machine or something like that...)


Expected Results:
It should be that fast a in 1.0.2 ;)
