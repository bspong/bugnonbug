I currently have three browser on my PC. Firefox 1.0, Mozilla 1.8, and Internet
Explorer 6.0. As advised, I checked all three browser to see if the problem
appeared in all of them. Firefox wa the only browser that did not render the
picture involved. The picture are one that were in my Yahoo Album, and some
more posted on my Xanga blog. http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=Hanuman1618 ,
this is a link to the xanga to view and see if the problem occurs. The
disturbing thing is that the problem only occured a day or two ago. Before that,
all my picture on my xanga could be viewed. Also, the problem only occurs
sporadicly, and most site will show picuters, yet some, such a the one above,
will not. I also, tested to see if some alteration occured to firefox, by
uninstalling, and then re-installing a new profile. The last thing is, that if I
approximate where the picture would be, and right-click view image, the picture
doe appear in a seperate page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the site and see new pictures.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
No picture appear.

Expected Results:
The picture should have been rendered.
