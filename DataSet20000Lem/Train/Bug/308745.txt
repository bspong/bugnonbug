I'm running Win2K, firefox 1.0.6, Google Desktop 2 and Google Toolbar. At some
point while browsing (multiple firefox window open), the current window will
stop working properly and all link will bring up the "Save As" dialog box with
the link in the File Name box. All normal feature such a cut/paste and mouse
scrolling also stop. That is, mouse scroll slows, cut and paste do not work in
that window. If I close and ctrl+n from another window, everything is fine.
Normal functionality of Page Source stop a well. Cannot cut, paste, etc.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have more than one window open.
2.Use all continuously, going back to one or the other for search (I only use
google), browsing, etc.
3.Click link to open new pages, etc.
4.Eventually, the link stop working.

Actual Results:

depending on the link reference.

No crash.
