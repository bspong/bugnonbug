Width resizing problem with table containing DIVs with overflow set to auto.

This portal page contains several table object using DIVs with overflow set to
auto for scrolling their content. The code ha been double-checked by several
people and appears not to contain problems, and work fine in IE, Opera and
Safari. When you try to resize the width of the browser window in Firefox 1.0x
the DIV object in the 2nd and 3rd column appear to block width resizing.
Clicking Reload in Firefox make the problem worse -- then resizing the width
"locks" the DIV object so that they overlap onto the next column on the right.

Strangely, using Forward and Back (sometimes repeatedly) in Firefox solves the
problem. Then Firefox will resize the width of the table object containing the
DIV object correctly. Also, accessing the page with the URL
http://helpman.it-authoring.com/ (the trailing / is essential!) from a FRESH
instance of Firefox doe not display this problem -- this reroutes the browser
to portal.php via an .htaccess rule, and this appears to have the same effect a
using Forward and Back in Firefox. Entering http://helpman.it-authoring.com doe
NOT work, however -- then the width resizing bug appears again a described above.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL http://helpman.it-authoring.com/portal.php with Firefox
2. Attempt to resize the width of the page. Columns 2 and 3 block width resizing.
3. Click on one of the "View Thread in Forum" link in the "Announcements
section, then click on Back in Firefox. Width resizing then work again normally.
4. Visit the same site and click on Reload in Firefox. Then try to resize the
width of the page. The DIV object lock and overlap the adjacent columns.
5. Start a fresh instance of Firefox and visit the site using
http://helpman.it-authoring.com/ (WITH trailing /). Width resizing appears to
work normally.
6. Start a fresh instance of Firefox and visit the site using
http://helpman.it-authoring.com (WITHOUT trailing /). Width resizing will not work.

Actual Results:
Width resizing of DIV object in table with overflow set to auto doe not work
in Firefox unless you click on Forward and Back a couple of times. The DIV
object block width resizing of the table objects.

Expected Results:
Table object should get narrower normally to their minimum width, just a they
do in IE, Safari and Opera.
