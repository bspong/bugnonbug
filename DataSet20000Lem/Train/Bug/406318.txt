I have a table which requires different CSS styling for screen and print. For screen I need to hide a "Notes" column that should be displayed on the paper copy. I'm achieve this by including two stylesheets, meds.css is included with media="all" and media-print.css is included with media="print". In media.css I hide the column a follows

th.notes, td.notes {display: none;}

Then in the media-print.css I force it to be displayed using

th.notes, td.notes {display: table-cell;}

Everything work fine in firefox providing I only have a handful of rows, but with around 25+ column print preview and print hangs.

One last thing of note, the note column is actually a single table cell containing only &nbsp; spanning all the row in the table

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Navigate to the attached HTML sample
2.Click print preview
Actual Results:
Firefox hang before displaying the print preview page

Expected Results:
Firefox display the print preview page
