Firefox fails to open popup window under any condition though IE and Mozilla both work.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

The page I referenced above requires account login to access, so I copied the
source and included the source in an attached text file.
1. The window popup perfectly using IE or MOZILLA, believe it or not! But NOT
FIREFOX!!!!!!
2. All browser work the same whether or not POPUP BLOCKING is disabled. IOW,
disabling popup blocking doe no good in FIREFOX & enabling popup blocking
doesn't bother Mozilla (
3. The only hotspot that work at this site are one that do not open a new
window. If a hotspot open a new window, FIREFOX will not open it when clicked.
4. The cursor doe change to a hand over these hotspots.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. The public www.brownco.com site doe not show this problem. Popup window are
apparently used only once you have logged on to your account.
2. Examine the HTML code for the page I provided and the link address of the
popup window. Basically EVERY POPUP WINDOW on Brownco's customer-only site is
inoperative under
3.

Actual Results:
When you click on the TRADE column in the attached web page, nothing happens,
except a faint dotted window around the character >>. Disabling popups doe no
good, nothing happens.

Expected Results:
A window is supposed to pop up to allow you to trade a stock. This behaviour
correctly occurs using Mozilla or IE, but not using Firefox.

The following is the URL of a button that refuse to open a popup window like it
should:

javascript:window.name='mainw';winOpenTrade('/brownco/trade_stocks/trade_stocks_popup.jsp?brnTradeInstrumentType_requestscope=Stock&pageid=10&framework.html.RequestingPageName=brownco/quotes/stock_quotes_detail.jsp','&BRN_TRADE_STOCKS_QUOTE_SYMBOL_requestscope=','SUNW','Trade',660,360);

The "page source" obtained by right-click in the middle of the page, will be
attached in a "Create a new attachment link" to this bug report
