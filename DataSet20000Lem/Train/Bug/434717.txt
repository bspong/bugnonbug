This application us javaview and a custom java application available a
source in

http://www.menne-biomed.de/swallow/jswallow3d.txt.

On each selected swallow, memory decreases. Manual garbage collection doe not
help. After 4-5 swallow loaded, system crashes, Firefox hang in memory and
must be removed from memory via task manager.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Occurs under 4 different Windows operating systems.

Konrad Polthier, the author of javaview, ha recommended to explicitely destroy
memory, so a message is printed out on the console when the destructor is
called. This did not change the results.


Dieter Menne
Actual Results:
This work perfectly under IE, Safari and Opera, so I doubt it is a Java problem, a "timeless" claims.

It worked under earlier version of Firefox (1.x), and 2.0 , but not later version.

It wa reported two year ago already, but considered illegal.
