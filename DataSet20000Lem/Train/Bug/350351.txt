The main problem are that image which have nothing to do with photobucket show a removed or invalid. Another problem is that certificate keep popping up randomly referring to different sites. For example, if I am on www.xfire.com, a certificate referring to google.com come up and saying that it is coming from somewhere else. I can expand on this once I get a screenshot of it. Also when i go to some websites, it may just show a
"URL Failed
/site/laksd/asdkjm/ is invalid"

and if i go to the parent such a www.xfire.com, it will be at the right URL but with the google homepage actually showing.

Many site also just show a google error... PLEASE HELP MEH! IM DESPARATE! REINSTALLING DIDNT WORK!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to site
2.If error occurs, take screenshot
Actual Results:
One of the error occurs and I wait until later in the day when another problem is occuring and this one is temporarily working. The image problem is always like that unless I renew the image by linking it to a new picture. Others see the picture fine.

Expected Results:
Shown images, gone to sites, not shown errors.

This also occurs with internet explorer but I am guessing it is firefox related for the first time the error occured, it wa working fine on IE7.
