Firefox show a blank page when loading multiple PDFs in a terminal server environment
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1

Steps to reproduce:

When loading multiple PDFs in a browser, one after the other, in Firefox 3.6 we see a sporadic issue where sometimes the Adobe Reader plugin doe not get loaded, and Firefox just display a blank page (white/grey/black). The browser status bar show "Done" and nothing else is loaded even if the browser window is left for a long time.

The employee work with PDFs in Firefox all day long, and cannot use standalone Adobe Reader. The issue occur sporadically during the day and doe not follow any pattern.

After research from Adobe engineering it wa found that in some instance Firefox sends an NPP_DestroyStream event with a reason of 1. This will cause the Adobe Reader plugin to exit, which result in the issue. If the Adobe Reader plugin is modified to ignore this event, then everything seems to work.

After testing with Mozilla Firefox 10, the problem wa not reproducible, so we assume that the issue ha somehow been fixed by change in Firefox.

Can someone confirm if this is a known issue that wa fixed with later version of Firefox (3.6+)?


Actual results:

Blank browser window, Adobe Reader plugin is closed


Expected results:

Reader plugin to display PDF in the browser window
