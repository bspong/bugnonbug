The page will not print and the "Printing" dialog box is hung with "Progress: Preparing...". The Cancel button is disabled. The Browser is still active. Other tab can be opened. I am entering this bug report on a different tab of the browser that ha the problem. I wa trying to print the page to an Epson Stylus Photo R800 printer. I wa able to close the dialog box using the [X] in the top right corner. The content of the page contained a printable copy of XML code displayed. After closing the dialog box, clicking the printer icon again give a dialog box "Printer Error" with message "Not Available". clicking OK close it. Using the File,Print to print the page give the same "Printer Error" message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Got to a website that ha XML code displayed on the page
2.Click the Printer icon
3.The printer status show that it is Spooling but no page are available
Actual Results:
The print function seems to work a long a there is no XML code displayed a text. Sample:
<br>--------------- XML data --------------------------<br>
&lt;order_info&gt;<br />
&lt;order_type&gt;Individual&lt;/order_type&gt;<br />

&lt;store_info&gt;<br />
&lt;store_id&gt;4&lt;/store_id&gt;<br />
&lt;store_name&gt;Real Pizza&lt;/store_name&gt;<br />
&lt;store_location&gt;&lt;/store_location&gt;<br />


Expected Results:
Expect the page to be printed

Opening a new tab will not let the printer work. Closing the browser and starting a fresh copy allows the printer to work properly. Closing the browser doe not remove the print output that is spooling.
