Can't save web page from editor while displayed by Firefox 4.0, or even after closing tab.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

When developing a page, I hold it in an editor; display it in Firefox; make change in the editor; save new version [with same file name, in same location]; then refresh in Firefox.

However, since upgrading to 4.0, attempting to save the revised file in the editor fails, with this message:

"The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process"

Closing the tab in Firefox doe NOT help.

Only after closing Firefox, [with all the other tab I happen to have open], am I now able to save the edited web page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load web page into editor AND display using Firefox 4.0
2. Change page in editor and attempt to save.
3. Even after closing the Firefox tab the problem persists.
Actual Results:
Editor PFE generates the message:

"System Error: Unable to rename existing file <path+name> to keep a backup copy in <path+name.$$$> : [32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process."

Expected Results:
Editor should have saved file, [as it ha been doing for years], then allowing me to refresh the Firefox tab, displaying the revised web page.

Am not marking this a "Critical", although the current need for a work-around COULD cause data to be lost.

The page I'm "developing" are daily archive compilation of news item from assorted web sites. But other developer are doubtless affected / afflicted by the same problem. Am rather surprised that Firefox developer didn't notice it.

Compliment: page DO now load MUCH FASTER. This is appreciated. But ha it led to the problem I'm reporting?
