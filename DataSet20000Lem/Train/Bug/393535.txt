Hello, i did report strictly the same bug with FF 2.0.0.2 that have been fixed yet. But since 2 days, it is come back.
This last days, i have upgraded from o X 10.3.9 to 10.4.10
So i don't know if the problem come from FF 2.0.0.6 or from o X…

OK, there is the problem :
I cannot use the zoom, from the contextual menu, on the flash movies.
I tried with safari and camino, and it work well, so the problem doe not come
from flash player but from firefox.
What FF should do : when there is a flash movie, i can click on right button,
then a contextual menu appears and i can choose to zoom in or out, then flash
movie is zoomed in or out (seems logical ;-))
What FF doe (the bug) : when there is a flash movie, i click on right button,
then a contextual menu appears . But if i click zoom in or zoom out, :nothing
happens :-(



Expected Results:
Flash movie should be zoomed in or out.
