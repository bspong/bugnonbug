cursor move by itself, only in firefox;
User-Agent: Opera/9.02 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

I don't know how Firefox could be doing this, but this problem only happens in Firefox.

I'm having a new problem that started today in Firefox. I'm having to use Opera to file this bug report. My mouse cursor move by itself when in a Firefox window, usually within 10-15 seconds. First it wa drifting down, getting to the bottom in about 2-3 seconds. After a reinstall and reboot, I enter Firefox, in 5-30 second (random delay), the cursor move down and to the right corner of my screen (direction seems fairly constant -- but changed after a re-install and reboot).

If I operate solely outside of the firefox window, I have no problems. If I move into the FF window, there is a several second delay before the cursor will be dragged down and to the right, going to the corner of the screen. Movement stop a soon a I click outside of the firefox window (clicking inside the window ha no effect).

I tried disabling extension that were updated today (3 of them). Nogo.
Tried disabling all extension ('cept for talkback), restarted. Nogo.
Tried downloading 2.0.0.1 a a "whole" (it wa previously installed from 2.0 via an update). and reinstalling. Nogo.

It happens in any ff window (extensions, bookmarks, main display). It also happens after a fresh restart displaying "about:blank".

I've had it go for maybe 40-50 second without starting, but it's quite random.

I have no clue how this problem arose nor why it is confined to Firefox.
Still have problem -- the problem

---------------
Extensions updated today:
KeyScrambler (disabled, a it "dumps core"),
Trackmenot
HostIP
(they were the first I tried disabling a mentioned above).

Note -- this make the browswer unusable when it happens, but the chance of it happening would seem remote -- though I don't know the cause.

I'm running on Windows XP-SP2.
