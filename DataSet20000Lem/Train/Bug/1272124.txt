Reproducing and debugging the regression:

If you would like to re-run this Talos test on a potential fix, use try with the following syntax:
try: -b o -p win32,win64 -u none -t tp5o[Windows 7,Windows 8],g1-e10s[Windows 7,Windows 8],svgr-e10s[Windows 7,Windows 8] --rebuild 5 # add "mozharness: --spsProfile" to generate profile data

(we suggest --rebuild 5 to be more confident in the results)

To run the test locally and do a more in-depth investigation, first set up a local Talos environment:
https://wiki.mozilla.lorg/Buildbot/Talos/Running#Running_locally_-_Source_Code

Then run the following command from the directory where you set up Talos:
talos --develop -e [path]/firefox -a tp5o:tp5o_scroll:cart --e10s
