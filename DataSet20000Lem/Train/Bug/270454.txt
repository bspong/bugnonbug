"The document contains no data" & spyware removal
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; T312461; Q312461; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

I use a Dell PC with Windows 2000. Earlier, I used Firefox 1.0 for browsing
various web pages. Afterwards, I used Ad-Aware 6.0 and Spybot Search & Destroy
1.2 to clean the spyware and spy-like thing from the PC that I use. When I
tried to browse a web page with Firefox, I got a popup window Alert! with the
message "The document contains no data".

I opened IE and could acccess all the same web page that did not function in
Firefox. I went to the Firefox web site, using IE, and found a message that
this could be fixed by clearing the caches. I cleared the cache but still
could not access any web site with Firefox.

I reinstalled Firefox; still the same problem. I uninstalled and reinstalled
Firefox; still the same problem. I downloaded the Firefox installer again;
still the same problem. I opened a new profile each time; still the same
problem. I installed Firefox to a new directory (firefox); still the same
problem.

I downloaded and installed the complete Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT
5.0; en-US; rv:1.8a5) Gecko/20041117. When I opened Mozilla, the same problem
occurred.

Through the entire process, I rebooted the computer several time to see if I
could fix this, but Firefox and Mozilla still give the Alert! meassge.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox or Mzilla browser
2.Try to access a web page
3.

Actual Results:
The web page did not open, and the browser displayed the Alert! popup window
with the message "The document contains no data".

Expected Results:
Open the web page that wa requested.

The only thing that I have done differently today were to run the spyware
removal program Ad-Aware 6.0 and Spybot Search & Destroy 1.2. I assume that
they have changed something, which is not letting the web page through to
Firefox and Mozilla.
