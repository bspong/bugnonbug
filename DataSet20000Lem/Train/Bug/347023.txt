The upper 5 centimeter of my screen are filled with just the standard and most usefull bar and menus.
1 blue bar with website location and the firefox icon and a lot of empty space,
2 menu bar, with just the 7 standard menu and a lot of empty space
3 Toolbar filled with only the most used icon
4 the bookmarkstoolbar: great to have, I use it all the time
5 the tab bar

the last 2 are briljant and mainly the reason why I use Firefox, because they are so **** handy. But the downside is: they take up a lot of screenspace
the 3rd is absolutly essential

the 2nd you need and the first should be there,
but the empty space is completely unnescesary. Here we could compensate for the lost space due to the bookmarktoolbar and tab bar by [b]integrating[/b]or combining the menubar and the blue top bar with the firefox icon

This wil give you another centimeter (approx. 35cm2)of screenspace, which in my opinion is most essential for a webbrowser.
