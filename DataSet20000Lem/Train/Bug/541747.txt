I have been watching this for some time now (almost a year) to see if this ?bug? would be reported or fixed in future version and, still no go. Thought it wa about time that i report it. See bug 289692 https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=289692 for possible related issue. This page show a normal legend tag and the way it should look like. Then display a heading tag (in this case a <h2></h2>) nested inside a legend tag being rendered possibly incorrectly (not sure if this is the way firefox wa supposed to render this setup). Then further display a font tag nested inside a legend tag, this time being rendered correctly. Have tried this html code inside FF v.2.x and v.3.x and on various o (Windows & Linux) all with the same results. IE, Opera, and Chrome all display the heading correctly inside the legend. Only FF show it a part of the fieldset.
p.s. Using firebug it clearly show that it open the fieldset then open/close the legend then display the h2 content then close the fieldset. When you view source you can see that it is supposed to open fieldset, open legend, heading content, close legend, close fieldset.
I also understand that i can correct this using preferred stylesheets but i am just making you aware of the issue.
