I installed several addons including:
Foxclock
Noscript
FireFTP
Also installed and then un-installed FoxyProxy. I connect to the internet directly without any proxy.

Currently the Tools -> Addons menu doe not show any addons and doe not allow checking for update since it doe not show the addons even though the FoxClock and Noscript addons are functioning properly. Also Help -> Check for Updates show a blank screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Select Tools -> Addons
3.Also select Help -> Check for Updates
Actual Results:
The Tools -> Addons menu doe not show any addons and doe not allow checking for the update that are currently installed. It also doe not allow me to install new addons.
Also the Help -> Check for Updates show a blank screen.

Expected Results:
Tools -> Addons should show the list of currently installed addons and allow checking for update and/or installing new addons.
Help -> Check for Updates should either show no update available or allow updating Firefox if an update is available.
