When I click into a textbox, the cursor go into it, but it doesn't get focus. When I begin to type, it cause the keyboard shortcut to be started, i.e. if I type an 's' character, the save a dialog opens. The cursor key do not work either so am unable to scroll page up and down with keyboard. If I switch focus to another application then come back to firefox, I am then able to use the page a normal. Also, page up and page down now scroll through tab and doe not move the page up and down a the key name suggests.
