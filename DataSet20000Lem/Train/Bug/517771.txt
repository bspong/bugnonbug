If I want to block (or allow) cooky a a exception to my settings, those exception are not saved (they are deleted) when Firefox closes. Previously in earlier FF version the exception were always saved, even after FF closed the setting were saved and applied to the new browsing session.

TOOLS>
OPTIONS>
USE CUSTOM SETTINGS>
COOKIES>
EXCEPTIONS>
BLOCK> "www.website-example.com"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Custom Settings for History.
2. Go to cookies, exceptions, and then block a specific site from storing cooky on your computer.
3. Close FF then check to see if the site continues to be blocked. You should see the list of exception ha NO site listed because the exception have not been saved.


Expected Results:
The blocked site/s should always remain blocked after I've entered then a a blocked exception, therefore they should not be allowed to give me cooky for all future session even after FF close and reopens.

The "accept cooky from sites" box is ticked and the "third party cookies" is NOT ticked.
