Navigation inside PDF wrong by one page, but work on other browser

Steps to reproduce:

Have created a web site "weseeco.org/courses" that contains FTP file created in Abode Acrobat. The site contains several file with the ability to navigate between file and within each file the ability to go to various page (IF one press the button to go to page 5 one go to page 5. If one want to return to the TOC page clicking on that TOC button take on back to the index). On Explorer and on Chrome all the navigation work well.


Actual results:

On Firefox the navigation between file work just fine. But within a file (kinetics or stoch) if one click page five one go to page 4, ie clicking on page n take you to page n-1. Clicking on the TOC button take you to the page above the index page again n-1. So in Firefox but not in Explorer or Chrome the paging is off by one page! So something strange must be happening with the Firefox indexing.


Expected results:

I would think that the Firefox brouser should work in the same way a the other two. Suspect that there is an indexing command in Firefox that is wrong.

You can access the web site "weseeco.org/courses" and see for yourself. Note (1) on the router page only the kinetics and stoch button are presently active. (2) In the kinetics and stoch module only the button on the bottom of the blue title page take you back to the router. The index with all of the page button is placed on the second screen. Any suggestion would be appreciated. I do not know what version i have, could not find it anyplace!
