On our Intranet site we have button you can guide your mouse over to have a drop down menu pop up. Then you hover over your next selection and another menu pop up. When using Firefox 2.0.0.14, you can hover over the first button and the pop up menu appears but then you can't get to the second tier of the menu.

I just thought you guy might wanted to know that. Oh, i did try again with Internet Explorer to make sure it wasn't our website that wa bad but IE worked.

3.

nothing.

This wa on an Intranet website so it is internally so no one in the world would see this website. But it might effect other website or so, I don't know.
