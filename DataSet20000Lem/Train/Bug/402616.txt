The OS specific search patern ctrl-f ...etc should be used to raise the quick find menu rather than character on the keyboard such a "'". I'm begging someone to at the very least provide an option to disable the quickfind 'feature' easily without installing plugins.

The problem is input form are not the only venue for accepting keyboard input. By mapping arbitrary key to option such a quick find you break these applications. games, keyboard emulator/monitoring apps...etc all break.

Specifically we have an application which listens for credit card track input via a USB HID reader which doe not work with mozilla because the ' character in the track delimiters cause the quickfind to consume the remaining keyboard input.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type ' on any web page that doe not have a form input field in focus

Actual Results:
Quick find is raised

Expected Results:
Quick find should not be raised
