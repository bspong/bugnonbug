Program will not load after install
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Newest ver Firefox

Both Newest ver Firefox and Thunderbird Mail will not load after installation.
Initial install show working program, second time loading and thereafter will
respond with an hourglass on arrow icon (desktop) after a few seconds, then
nothing. Microsoft Outlook work most of the time, often Internet Explorer will
not load either. After much prompting IE will run. Attempts to reinstall will
have odd results. Reinstall program claim Firefox is running, but task manager
will indicate no program running. Reinstall will fail to stop Firefox and
freeze screen, sometimes. ReBooting will sometimes clear Firefox and it will
reinstall with working program, second attempt to load Firefox or Thunderbird
will fail to load after a few second showing hourglass on desktop icon.
Using IBM clone P3 1GHz with W2K Professional, lot of ROM/RAM memory and about
60 Gigs of space on 2 HDrives. Using new Hayes external 56K modem. When IE run
it run without problems. IE seems to fail to load only after Firefox is on the
system. Anxious to use both programs, not a fan of Bill Gates. Help.

Reproducible: Always
