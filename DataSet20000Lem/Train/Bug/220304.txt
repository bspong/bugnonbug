No "Select user" dialog to choose username/passwords: Must type username.

When there are more than one username/passwords for a form, the popup for
choosing and entering login doe not show up.

In MozillaBrowser it doe not show up, and it used to, in the past, in
MozillaFirebird.

Now we are forced to remember all login usernames. This mean trouble for people
like me that have ton of usernames at different sites, and cant remember them
all. Now I'm being forced to use a third party password manager which is far
from ideal.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In any site that requires logon, where you have two or more usernames:
2. Enter the site.
3. Page loads, but no expected popup prompt what username to use.
4. You are forced to type the username, if you remember it, and only then
password show up.



Expected Results:
I'd like for Mozilla Firebird to prompt me what username I want to use, among
those I have in the password manager. Mozilla Browser doe the expected behavior.
