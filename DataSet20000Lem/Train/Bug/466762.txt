JavaScript alert on startup make dropdown list in update panel unselectable with mouse

If I use ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript to send a JavaScript alert to the browser (such a for form validation), any dropdown list on the page that is nested within an update panel will be broken. In this case, "broken" mean that you cannot change the selected item in the list using the mouse. (no matter how hard you try). You can still use the keyboard to select the item though. It's in a very odd state.

Note: The only way I have found to "fix" the dropdowns once they get broken is to click to another tab on my browser and then click back. Then I can use the moust to select the dropdowns again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an asp.net page with an update panel in it.
2. Put an asp:dropdownlist object in the update panel.
3. Add a few listitem object to the list so you can select something
4. Click a button on the page to do a postback. In the codebehind, call this:
ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(this, this.GetType(), "blah", "alert('arrgh');", true);
5. When the page load again, you will get an alert on startup.
6. Now try to select something in your dropdown list

Actual Results:
you cannot select an item in the list with the moust. the first time you click on the list it open, and you can click on an item, but the list close and the previously selected item will still be selected. After this you cannot even get the dropdown list to open at all. You can use the keyboard to select though.

Expected Results:
Dropdown list should be selectable with the mouse.

This happens to me all the time. I'm creating a web application in asp.net and some validation must be doen in the code behind. So every time I try to pas on message about validation issues, I break the UI. Frustrating.
