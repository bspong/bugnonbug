When "document.body.contentEditable" or "document.designMode" are turned on, the right-click menu is switched to like it is in a text field (bringing up add to dictionary, etc). However, after the two thing are turned off, the right-click menu doe not revert back, even when you change pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on document.body.contentEditable and/or document.designMode (ex. through javascript:document.body.contentEditable = "true"; document.designMode= "on"; void 0;)

2. Edit the page a you want, and a you right-click somewhere look at the menu.

3. Turn off contentEditable and designMode (ex. javascript:document.body.contentEditable = "false"; document.designMode= "off"; void 0;)

4. Look at the right-click menu. It hasn't changed.

5. Navigate to other pages. Even though the editor is turned off, the right-click menu still act a though it is turned off.
Actual Results:
The right-click menu change normally when contentEditable and/or designMode are turned on. However, after they are turned off, the right-click menu doe not change back to normal.

Expected Results:
The right-click menu should have changed after turning contentEditable and designMode off.

A web designer could use this in his Javascript:

document.body.contentEditable = "true";
document.designMode = "on";
document.body.contentEditable = "false";
document.designMode = "off";

And wreck the user's right-click menu until he/she restarts Firefox.
