In our intranet site, we have cs drop-downs that occur in the menu. On one
page, we embed flash under the menu. The menu drop-down fine and we can roll
over them. As soon a the cursor hit the flash object, however, the menu
disappear. We have noticed that this doesn't occur on ie on a pc.

http://www.target.com seems to have partially solved the problem, but when their
flash object play or loops, the menu disappear for them a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.target.com
2. mouse over a menu item
3. drop down into the flash object, still hovering over the menu

Actual Results:
The menu cs menu disappears when you enter into the flash object or exit out of it.

Expected Results:
Allowed me to continue seeing the menu and choose the area!

We tested this in different theme and it wa the same in all. We tried it on
three different mac (osX) and it wa the same for all.
