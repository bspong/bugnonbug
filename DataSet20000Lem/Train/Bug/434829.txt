This bug may only appear in Linux. I discovered it in Firefox 3 Beta 5 on Ubuntu 8.04 64-bit.

Basically what's happening is that anytime you right click on a statusbarpanel icon, instead of showing you the context menu it automatically selects the menu item at the very bottom of the menu. So you're never able to select any other item from the context menu or even view the context menu. The only way around it is to click and hold the right mouse button and then drag it off the statusbar icon. That will cause the context menu to stay open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the extension below in Firefox 3 in Linux.

2. Right click on the cookiesafe icon on the statusbar.
Actual Results:
The 'Most recent hosts' menu item will automatically be selected and you won't be able to view the context menu.

Expected Results:
The context menu should open and remain visible allowing you to select any of it's menu items.

You can right click and hold the mouse button down to force the context menu to remain open.
