Would like a way to freeze a window even when supportDDEExec is true

I'm caught between two conflicting desires:

There are some window that I do not want to be hijacked when I click on link
in other program (because they are showing something important that I'm working
on).

At the same time, I'd rather not set supportDDEExec to false, and have a fresh
window pop up each time and clutter up my desktop (and bloat Firebird).

It would be really nice to have a "View" option to "freeze" a window (i.e. make
it immune to being hijacked by DDEExec). When a DDE request come in, FB should
pick one of the window that do *not* have this freeze flag set (but otherwise
using whatever algorithm it us now for which of those window to pick).

It should open a new window if there are no such windows.

There's no need (that I can see) to make this persistent in any fashion (e.g.
remember a per-site preference for this flag, or anything like that). A purely
transient flag is enough.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set user_pref("advanced.system.supportDDEExec", true);
2. Bring up an important page, among a bunch of other windows.
3. Click on a URL in an external app.

Actual Results:
1. Watch the window with the important page being hijacked :-).


Expected Results:
1. Some way to set a flag on that Window in the View menu, perhaps, to prevent
this hijacking of just that one window.
