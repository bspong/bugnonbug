While downloading a file via rapidshare or megashare etc. if the file is of 200mb
and downloading speed is slow(20kb/s) and the connection is lost for few minute
or is disconnected thyen the downloading should pause or an error must be shown or
must wait or reconnection(as in IE) but infact it is shown that file is completly
downloaded of 200mb and not even of the amount it ha been when disconnected
this cause many time problem a we cannot get it wheather the file is downloaded completly or not..
Its the problem even in latest Mozilla 5.0 So hope it eliminated in the next version.

Reproducible: Sometimes
