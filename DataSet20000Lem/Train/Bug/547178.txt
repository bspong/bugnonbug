I open a link in a new tab for a funnieststuff.net video. Most recent example:
http://www.funnieststuff.net/viewmovie.php?id=1591
Most times, when I try to close the tab, it close normally. Sometimes I can not close it without having to click on a sequence of crap generated by funnieststuff. I have screenshots of the process - email me if you want to see them. No other site ha ever interfered with closing tabs.

I've tried deleting their cookies, or even disabling them, but nothing seems to consistently turn the problem on or off.

I'm extremely surprised that a website can interfere with something a basic a closing a tab!

Then most recently, I opened one of their link in a NEW WINDOW. SAME PROBLEM - can't close the window!

I'm extremely surprised that a website can interfere with something a basic a closing a browser window!
