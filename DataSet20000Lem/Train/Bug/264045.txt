I think this is an easily preventable bug.

FireFox on Mac OS X wrap *File*-*Save Page As...*-*Text Files* email
when using an email client (I've tried two) at 72 characters. FireFox
*Help* doe not contain the word *wrap* when searched.
FireFox's definition of *save text as* is listed below.

I don't think this should be a default, not-adjustable behavior. I would
like to use FireFox but without this simple feature, it is not usable.
Saving email and web page a text is a useful tool.

I receive text output page by email that are often 132 character or
more. FireFox enters a ''backslash r'' character (ascii code 013) in
the middle of >72-character lines. This destroys any ascii formatting
that the emailed file ha or had. Why? FireFox recognizes the existing
line return and/or end-of-line character that are already in the text.

Why add character to text which much older browser treat correctly?

See example from Mac OS X browser FireFox 1.0 and IE 5.2.3 below. ICABX
on Mac OS X also save text correctly.

Thank You,

Steve Christon

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. email yourself a text file with ~132 ascii character per line
2. save that email a text
3. read the text file (1-3 on a Mac, don't know if this is bad on other system too)

Actual Results:
See the result above in *Details*

Expected Results:
Not wrap the text at 72 character

in *severity* below, formatting problem are listed under trivial/cosmetic,
whereas in real life, formatting is often the most important aspect
of communication.
