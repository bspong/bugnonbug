This bug seems to be related to bug id=458221. When trying to follow a link, from another Windows application, "FirefoxHTML\Shell\Open\Command" is appended to URL, and consequently the URL is incorrect. This happens:

1) When clicking on a link in a MS Powerpoint presentation.
2) When (Ctrl +) clicking on a link in an MS Word document
3) When (Ctrl +) clicking on a link in an Outlook email that I am writing. Note: The problem is not observer, when clicking on a received email.

Whether Firefox browser is already open or not, doe not affect the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a PPT or MS Word document that conatins an HTTP link
2. Ctrl + click on the link
3. Observe the URL in the browser
Actual Results:
Correct page did not load. Site dependent message. For instance: When Ctrl+clicking on https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=458221, I Get a page that say "'458221FirefoxHTML\Shell\Open\Command' is not a valid bug number nor an alias to a bug."

Expected Results:
Firefox should load the URL without "FirefoxHTML\Shell\Open\Command" appended to it.

I have not tested whether the problem arises from other applications.
