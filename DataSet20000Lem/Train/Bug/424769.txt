The Smart Bookmarks menu really is running crazy. In particular the Recent Tags item always ha a "(no title)" submenu, which really get out of bounds. Submenus go infinitely deep, and some submenu refer back to the Smart Bookmarks. This lead to circular menu and a serious hang on Mac OS X (see bug 400291).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Smart Bookmarks,
2. Select Recent Tags
3. Select (no title)
4. Select Bookmarks Toolbar
5. Select Smart Bookmarks
6. Select Recent Tags
7. ...

Actual Results:
I can go on a long a I want

Expected Results:
Submenus should never go to a very deep level. And certainly not be self referring.

Moreover, I fail to see the relevance of the whole (no title) submenu of the Recent Tags, and in fact what they have to do with Recent Tags. It should just be removed. This is very bad UI. For the rest the Smart Bookmarks is a great addition.
