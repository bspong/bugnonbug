Google map (classic mode) are slower with UA > FF 4
Note: this is using classic mode, not webgl.

I'm wondering why on Google Maps with a recent Firefox User Agent the tile appear blurry then it load higher rez image with a noticeable delay. It doe not happen every time but it doe most of the time.
Zooming in/out for a few second will reproduce that behavior (especially noticeable on zoom out)
Additionally the zoom is not smooth.


This make using map very slow.
Switching to another user agent (Chrome, Firefox 4, GoogleBot, etc) it doe not do that anymore and map are snappy again (I recommend Firefox 4 tho, the Chrome user agent break a lot of features)

Using Chrome with Firefox 12 (nightly) user agent doe not have that behavior.

It appears a if the data wa coming slower or if the request were queued, or something wa blocking Firefox for a short amount of time, thus i tried:

- Enabling/disabling SPDY (made no difference)
- Enabling HTTP request pipelining with SPDY off made thing a good bit better. Enabling pipelining with SPDY ha no effect (probably a expected).

I have the same experience with Firefox 11 (Aurora), probably is the same with older version a well.

I have reproduced this on a fast window 7 (i7 sandy bridge and high end nvidia graphics) and a fast laptop running linux (i7 sandy bridge a well, integrated intel graphics), so this isn't a "slow hardware" issue, and it doesn't seems to be a graphic driver issue either.

ps: activating webgl mode then switching to firefox 4 user agent (refresh page at this point) also make map a lot smoother (albeit not silky smooth) in webgl.
It would be jerky otherwise. It also display blurry tile with user agent of Firefox 12, and doe not with Firefox 4 UA. Odd. Can't reproduce in Chrome either. (tracking bug for webgl slowlyness is 697443)
