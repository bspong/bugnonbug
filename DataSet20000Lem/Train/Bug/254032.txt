Sometimes when i click on a link link in my email client (TheBat!) or Klipfolio
or my newsreader (Agent) then there will open a new tab but nothing will be
loaded and all other tab stop loading, too. The loading animation stop also.
Firefox hang but not completely. The process run at 0% CPU but ha to be
killed. It can't be closed normaly.
It _may_ be possible that it will close after a lot of time, because you still
can surf the web, but it is extremely slow. I can see my traffic, and if i
reload a page, there is for moment some traffic, then it stop and after some
time simple page are loaded. Generally speaking surfing is not possible in this
state.
In this case (it happens almost every day) i kill the process and start a new
one. Maybe because of TBE, all tab of the last session are restored, except the
last one opened.
This never happens if i open new tab in FF itself, only with URLS from other
apps. And it doesn't depend on the tab opened or the amount of already opened tabs.
