Closed window state getting corrupted when closing and reopening last browser window without exiting browser

Session state when closing and opening window in Firefox 3.6.8 and Minefield.

If the last browser window is closed and then reopened, SessionStore's session data get's into a weird state where there can be open (or closed) window with no tabs. I suspect this is caused by the new TabCandy implementation, but I'm not sure about that.

Here's the easiest way to reproduce the problem that I've found. After each step from #2 and on you can type the following into the error console to get the session state:

Components.classes["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsISessionStore).getBrowserState()

1. Open Minefield (I used Gecko/20100820) and load a page into a tab.
2. enable javascript.options.showInConsole preference to see errors.
3. Open the error console and check session state.
4. Close the browser window. Session state change slightly, but is still okay.
5. In the error console window type "window.open()" to open a new browser window. Session state ha changed and _closedWindows is now corrupted.
6. Open the History -> Recently Closed Windows menu. This will fail and the following error will appear in the error console:

Error: selectedTab is undefined
Source file: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 2109


Here's the before and after session state when I ran my test in a brand new profile with Minefield 20100820 nightly:

Before:

{"windows":[{"tabs":[{"entries":[{"url":"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/","title":"Minefield Start Page","ID":0,"formdata":{},"scroll":"0,0"}],"index":1,"hidden":false,"attributes":{"image":"http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico"}}],"selected":1,"_closedTabs":[],"width":1080,"height":1156,"screenX":425,"screenY":9,"sizemode":"normal","cookies":[{"host":".mozilla.org","value":"150903082","path":"/","name":"__utmc"}]}],"selectedWindow":1,"_closedWindows":[]}

After closing (still good):

{"windows":[{"tabs":[{"entries":[{"url":"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/minefield/","title":"Minefield Start Page","ID":0,"formdata":{},"scroll":"0,0"}],"index":1,"hidden":false,"attributes":{"image":"http://www.mozilla.org/favicon.ico"}}],"selected":1,"_closedTabs":[],"width":1080,"height":1156,"screenX":425,"screenY":9,"sizemode":"normal","cookies":[{"host":".mozilla.org","value":"150903082","path":"/","name":"__utmc"}],"title":"Minefield Start Page"}],"selectedWindow":0,"_closedWindows":[]}

After reopening (bad - lost the tabs):

{"windows":[{"tabs":[{"entries":[],"hidden":false,"attributes":{}}],"selected":1,"_closedTabs":[],"width":1080,"height":1156,"screenX":425,"screenY":9,"sizemode":"normal"}],"selectedWindow":1,"_closedWindows":[{"tabs":[],"selected":1,"_closedTabs":[],"width":1080,"height":1156,"screenX":425,"screenY":9,"sizemode":"normal","cookies":[{"host":".mozilla.org","value":"150903082","path":"/","name":"__utmc"}],"title":"Minefield Start Page"}]}



As you can see at this point the _closedWindows object is corrupted since the tab array is empty.

I've also seen a corrupted session state when calling getBrowserState() from my add-on during quit-application granted notification stage. The difference is that instead of the _closedWindow object having an empty tab array, it's the windows[0].tabs object that's empty.
