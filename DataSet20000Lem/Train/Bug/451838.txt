Memory leak? Large list (~25) of youtube video can bog down firefox, eventually entire system.

Hello,

I've noticed that going down the list playing one vid at a time to completion will eventually slow firefox to a crawl. Then, if you continue to play them the whole system will become unresponsive.

I can reproduce this error in safe mode on any page with about two dozen youtube videos. After about the 5th video, it becomes pretty obvious that something isn't right. The remaining 15+ vids haven't been touched, and are a the page load by default.

Possibly a flash issue?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a page with about 25 youtube video
2.Play video to completion, move on to next video, repeat. The vid should end up in the little coverflow gui.
3.After about 5-6 video firefox will bog down.
Actual Results:
Firefox becomes sluggish and unresponsive. If you continue to play videos, entire system will become unresponsive.

Expected Results:
I would imagine it should let me continue to play the video on the page.

This issue will consistently reproduce in safe mode with only one tab.

I'm using a G4 dual 1.42 PPC, 2GB RAM, latest version of osx,firefox.

Enjoy the vids. ;) Sorry, I looked for something le racy and only found worse example of male depravity.

My apology if this is a dupe, I read over the top 100, and searched for youtube.

Feel free to prompt me for any more info. I'm unsure how to produce error log or anything like that.
