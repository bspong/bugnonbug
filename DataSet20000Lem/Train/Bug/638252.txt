Actual Results:
My son ha Win 7 and it work OK for him, but I'm not sure what version of Firefox that he is running on.


Expected Results:
To be able to save a new bookmark under a specific folder, instead of having to drag it into the proper folder.

Do like the new capability of being able to sort by name within the sub-categories.

Please let me know when fixed.

Have a good day!!

Thanks!
