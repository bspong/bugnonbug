External file fail to load and cache will not clear through "Clear Private Data"

After browsing image-intensive web site loading a new page/refreshing a page fails to load some or all image and style sheets.

At this point trying to clear the cache through Tools>Clear Private Data fails - the Clear Private Data menu doe not appear. A very small rectangle appears on screen and the menu cannot be accessed.

Pages will not load correctly again until the browser is restarted.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse/repeatedly refresh image intensive site (fill cache?)
2. Try to access Clear Private Data option
Actual Results:
1. Eventually image and style fail to display
2. Clear Private Data menu is not displayed and cannot be accessed

Expected Results:
Refreshing pages/viewing new page should display all image and style sheets. Clear Private Data option should display.

Although this seems like two separate issue they appear to be caused by the same problem. The Clear Private Data not displaying problem only occurs when the caching/image display problem occurs.

I had this issue in earlier version of Firefox but up until the latest release it seemed to be fixed.
