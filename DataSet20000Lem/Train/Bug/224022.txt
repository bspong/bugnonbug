When you bring up the "About Mozilla Firebird" box and then click "Copyright
and contributor information", it brings up the info window, but immediately
foreground your previous window, so the copyright info window is hidden behind
it. If you blinked at the wrong moment you'd never know it wa there. It should
stay in the foreground.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select "About Mozilla Firebird" to bring up the about box
2.Click on "Copyright and contributor information"
3.Observe that the new info window flash in front of your eye and is
immediately placed behind your current window

Actual Results:
The window that the "About" box belongs to is foregrounded.

Expected Results:
The "Copyright and contributor information" window should remain in the foreground.

This is a Mac-only bug. I think it only began a a result of the fix for bug
170499, or at least I hadn't noticed it before then. I reported it in that bug,
but the bug wa still set a fixed and nobody replied to my comments.
