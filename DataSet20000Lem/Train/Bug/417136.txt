It is not possible to drag a URL from the address bar into a sub-folder in the bookmark toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open "Places Organizer" ("Bookmarks" menu -> "Show All Bookmarks...").
2. Create a new folder in "All Bookmarks" -> "Bookmarks Toolbar". The name doe not matter; I will call it "Root" for this example.
3. Open the new folder ("Root").
4. Create a new folder in "Root". The name doe not matter; I will call it "Sub" in this example.
5. Close "Places Organizer"
--
Assertion: The new folder "Root" should now be visible on the "Bookmarks Toolbar".
Assertion: The folder "Root" should contain only a subfolder named "Sub".
Assertion: The folder "Sub" should be empty.

Method A:
7. Select the address in the address bar and drag it into the folder "Root".
