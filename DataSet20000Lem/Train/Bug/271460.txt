www.m-w.com is an online dictionary.
When you query a word in the dictionary, it give you the meaning and next to
the original word there is a small audio icon in red.
If you hit that icon then a new window pop up and you can hear the word
pronounced (if you are using IE).
Firefox pop up a new window, but then the window doe nothing.
At the bottom of the window there is a message

"Having trouble hearing a pronunciation?
* Click here to listen with your default audio player.
* See the Audio Pronunciation FAQ."

and if you click on "Click here to listen with your default..."
Then it open up Real Media Player (which happens to be my default) and play
the pronunciation.

IE recognises the fact that Real Player is my default medium player.
It play the file a soon a the window open and you dont have to click on any
part of "Having trouble hearing........."

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto www.m-w.com
2. Type in a word into the dictionary box (say "bug")

If you click on
* Click here to listen with your default audio player.
Then it open up your default audio player and play the sound in that.

Expected Results:
A new window open up.
