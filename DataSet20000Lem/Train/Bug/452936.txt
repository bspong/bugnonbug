double-clicking any history-list-entry will connect the browser to the respective website.
This allows anyone with access to your computer to connect DIRECTLY to "Secure" website that are in the History List, without using log-ins or passwords.

The connection is possible after logging out from the "secure" website, closing the browser AND EVEN AFTER shutting down your system.

This constitutes a SERIOUS SECURITY BREACH.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to a "Secure" website (https) using login information and user password
2. Do whatever there and log off
3. Close website, browser and shutdow system
4. boot system, open FF3
5. open main menu History>>Show all History
6. double-click on the entry for the "secure" website
Actual Results:
you will be connected to the "secure" website WITHOUT USE OF login info nor password


Expected Results:
"secure" website that require user-passwords for log in, should not be available in this manner

In my case (bank website) the bank server report lack of activity (the login wa timed out) after 5 minutes, but this may not be the case with all "secure" website
