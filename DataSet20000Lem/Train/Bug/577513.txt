Browser hang and doe not allow to do anything for a long time, when clicking login button in this Banking site.

Enter any test username and password and click Login. I can't share my bank id and password :-) The browser hang for a while and doe not allow me to click on any other tab etc.

I saw the view source and there is a Java Applet that is invoked when clicking the Login button.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter the URL mentioned above.
2. If you see any Anti-phishing message from bank, click "Continue".
3. Enter some login id/password, say, test/test, and click Login.

Actual Results:
The browser should work normally.

Expected Results:
The browser hang for a while.

It seems to happen with the Java applet I think. Usually when a Java applet is invoked I would see a Java cup icon at the bottom right corner of Windows. But in this case, I did not see any. I have JVM 1.6 (6) on my machine, a I confirmed from the control panel. I am supposing that something is wrong while opening up the JVM or so, a my laptop is a office laptop.

But in any case, the browser should not hang for a minute or so. It should work in the background, and allow me to do some other stuff, while it is trying to perform the login stuff.
