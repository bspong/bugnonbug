when opening a pop up from a link within a frameset and then linking back to the
framset from a link within a pop up the following error occurs
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Access to property denied" code:
"1010" nsresult: "0x805303f2 (NS_ERROR_DOM_PROP_ACCESS_DENIED)"

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.jet2.hotelconnect.co.uk
2. pick a destination (better to pick a big city for this example) and a room
type and click 'search'
3. a hotel search result are shown
4. click on one of the hotel name to get into the hotel description
5. click 'hotel location'
6. a pop map with a map of the hotel location opens.
7. click on one of the hotel icon (red bulb with numbers) on the map
8. This should load the description you have picked within the frameset, blur
the pop up and put focus and the opener (the frameset)
HOWEVER the javascript fails and the following error is thrown:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Access to property denied" code:
"1010" nsresult: "0x805303f2 (NS_ERROR_DOM_PROP_ACCESS_DENIED)"

Actual Results:
The description page load within the pop up and not within the frameset
The javascript which is called by an onclick event fails and the href is used
instead

Expected Results:
page should have been opened within the frameset (works for IE)
