Tabs become messed easily
This is really outrageous! I need to restart my Firefox many time a day because
of this bug!

I have three-button-mouse. I have a habit to click many link with middle button
in order to open that link to new tab. I have configured my Firefox so that
middle-button of mouse open a link to nrew tab.

This happens too often: I click some link with middle button. Mouse cursor show
hour glass few seconds. Tabs go weird: New tab do not appear. Old tab can be
chosen and then they can be closed via that tab closing icon located in the end
of tab row. Only way to see those new tab that were opened _after_ tab went
messy is to close all other tab via that tab closing icon. But tab row really
don't show those tab althougt the content of each tab are shown.

I think this way you can make this bug happen: Choose some WWW-page that ha
many link that open page to new window when clicked normally with left button
of mouse and normal links, too. Now, click many link with middle button, both
normal link and those that open to new window. Keep you eye on tab row and your
mouse cursor. When you see both of these happening, you have reproduced my bug:

- Mouse cursor show hour glass few second
- tab row do not not change

After that click tab closing icon many times. You'll see also that page that you
just opened but tab row don't show it title.
