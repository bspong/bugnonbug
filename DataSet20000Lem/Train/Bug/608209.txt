Firefox cannot connection to the internet after v3.6.12 update. New profile doesn't affect problem. I wa on my normal site (e.g. facebook, facebook apps, radiostaion and game website) then I saw Firefox update for v3.6.12, and because I wa playing my brother on a game (WarcraftIII) I accepted the update and restarted firefox, after then it didn't reopen after a while (about 30mins) so I closed the process from Task Manager and restarted the firefox app. After that everything wa normal except for an abnormal loading time (of a few minutes) but it didn't affect me because I thought it wa my computer lagging but came to a surprise to me wa the fact that I couldn't connection to the internet; the quote "Unable to connect

show my error message. And, of course I wa still playing a game against my bro using a local area connection so I wa confused, I asked my bro if his connection wa ok - he replied yes. So I checked mine for problems, nothing. I even restarted my BT HomeHub Router and still nothing, so I checked IE8 (rarely use it) it it worked fine - so I suspected it wa an error on the update or my addons/my side. I later researched it and found out this update wa blocked and had problems.
