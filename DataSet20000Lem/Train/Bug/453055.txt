If you assign a helper app to a file type, then later uninstall the app, trying to open a file of that type will result in a dialog saying:

"[filename] could not be opened, because the associated helper application doe not exist. Change the association in your preferences."

The Applications panel in Preferences only list existing associations, and doe not provide any interface for adding a new one. However, the list is empty. This mean that once you have removed a specific helper app, it is impossible to open that file type ever again (short of editing mimeTypes.rdf, which is an unacceptable user solution).

Downstream this is Ubuntu bug 55428. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/55428

Actual Results:
Dialog a described.

Expected Results:
"The helper application set for this file type, X, could not be found. Please select a helper application." Helper select box.
