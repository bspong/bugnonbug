close multiple tab prompt confusing on multiple workspace
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/20071015 SUSE/2.0.0.10-0.1 Firefox/2.0.0.10

Under some circumstances, File->Quit fails with no obvious cause.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure multiple workspace under X. Details may vary with desktop environment (Gnome vs. KDE vs. ...)
2. Open a Firefox window.
3. Open at least one new tab (Ctrl-t will suffice).
4. Open a new Firefox window (Ctrl-n)
5. Move the new window to a different workspace by whatever method is appropriate.
6. Open at least one new tab (Ctrl-t)
7. File->Quit
Actual Results:
Assuming you haven't previously told Firefox not to warn in such cases, each window will get it own "closing multiple tabs" confirmation dialog, each dialog in it own workspace, and the window won't close until all the confirmation dialog are handled. In some cases, the first such dialog appears on a different workspace, and the user get no feedback; the visible Firefox window is dimmed but doe not close.


Expected Results:
One confirmation dialog, properly worded, ought to suffice for all windows, and it should appear on the current workspace. After confirming, all window should close.

I'm using Gnome/metacity.
