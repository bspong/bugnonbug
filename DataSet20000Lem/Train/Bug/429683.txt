When I try to load a page and something go wrong, such a I'm offline, or I've put in a bad server name, the simple error page are lot of text. This is an added question mark, especially for folk who don't care /why/ something broke, just that it broke. I propose to style the error pages, if for nothing else than to make it easier to debug my friends' problems.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type http://www.pqoweirutyasdfkljhzxcvmnb.com/ -> Address Not Found dialog

1. Try to access http://www.google.com/ while in offline mode -> Offline Mode dialog


Actual Results:
We get bland, white background page with text.

Expected Results:
I think the simple error page should have color themes. Offline could have a blue box in the upper right, or purple background. Address Oot Found could have a red circle or flashing text.

Gawd, I'd hope you'd never do flashing text or a purple background (so yes, get a designer to help), but the advantage of styling the error page are at least:

1. An end-user only ever ha to digest the information once. As soon a the user see the background color is red, the user immediately know she typoed her url. That's an ounce le time than to read what the exact error wa each time. It'll add up. (Read "Don't Make Me Think" by Steve Crug about time adding up in this manner and why it's important to worry about small things.)

2. For non-computer oriented folk getting help from friends, having a theme would make it much easier to debug over the phone. "What color is the background you see now? Blue? Okay, uncheck work offline in your file menu."
