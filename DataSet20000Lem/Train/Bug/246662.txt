For each button image on the lefthand side the button is supposed to look
depressed while the mouse is over it (onmouseover) and pop back up when the
mouse leaf that area (onmouseout). The button depresses properly when the
mouse move over it, but a soon a the cursor stop moving the button pop back
up. If you move the cursor again it trigger the onmouseover code properly
again, but the onmouseout code is triggered again a soon a the cursor stop
moving. I loaded the page in IE and it worked properly, I also replaced the
(mindbendingly complex) javascript code on the website with simple javascript
specific to each button and the problem persisted.

Should be simple to fix.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a web page with an image that ha onMouseOut code to change the image.
2. Move the cursor over the image.
3. Stop moving the cursor.

Actual Results:
The onMouseOut code executes a soon a the cursor stop moving.

Expected Results:
The onmouseout code should only execute once the mouse ha left the area of the
image.
