Minefield (Shiretoko) not usable with new Yahoo mail
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20081202 Shiretoko/3.1b3pre

Yahoo mail appears to be rejecting 3.1preb3 following a security update, but did not reject the prior version of minefield. The user agent string appears to have changed to say Shiretoko instead of Minefield, and this may be causing the problem. Yahoo mail reject the browser a unsupported, and will not allow me to view mail at all (at least not without reverting to the old mail interface.) It worked just fine with Minefield, with the exception that it gave a warning about the browser being unsupported.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Update to latest version of Minefield (following security update, see build identifier)
