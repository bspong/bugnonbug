It would be nice if folder on the Personal Toolbar Folder could be made to
act a a normal bookmark if clicked.

Here's my example: I have a "Google" folder with bookmark for Search, Mail, Images, Translate, Groups, Maps, etc. in it. 9 time out of 10 I want to use "Search". I would like the ability to just click on the folder without opening the drop-down menu, and take me to the normal Google home page. If I instead drag the mouse downward, or input any other motion, then the folder content could drop down and I could choose from them.

If you prefer, you can think of it this way. I used to have a dedicated "Google Search" button on my Personal Toolbar Folder. When Google started adding more services, I wanted to group them together, with "search" still my default Google action, but sometimes wanting to use other services. The closest I could get is to create the Google folder, but then I lost the ability to just click on the toolbar element itself to go directly to search.

Hopefully that make sense, though I have no idea if it's feasible to implement.

Reproducible: Always
