Steps to reproduce:

I opened FIrefox Aurora on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in a Unity session.


Actual results:

Recently, with the Aurora build (at least on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS), Unity launcher support ha somehow managed to break itself. You have to click the original icon to launch Aurora, but it appears under a second icon. Opening up other Aurora window group normally, but opening up another window containing, say downloads or add-on preference (for example, Adblock Plus) make yet another launcher icon appear, ungrouped with the rest of them. Also, the proper quicklists are missing with these new window (Right clicking give no option to open a new window) and no matter what I do, each different type of window open up under a different icon in the Unity launcher. The original launcher icon needed to launch Aurora also ha no white indicator dot next to it.


Expected results:

All window for Aurora should be grouped together under the one original launcher icon, just a in previous Firefox versions.
