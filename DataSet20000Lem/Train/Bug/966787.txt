Inspector html breadcrumb is unstable on deeply nested HTML
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

1 - open google.com (google homepage)
2 - open inspector
3 - in inspector, click the "Pick" button
4 - in the browser, click (select) "I'm feeling lucky" button
- Wait for inspector to settle down
5 - Mouse around the google home page




Actual results:

Inspector try to hilite the changing HTML in the inspector pane - watch the html breadcrumbs: for me, it scrolls.

In my app, which is much more deeply nested than google home page and contains a never-ending animation which modifies the html, the breadcrumb display almost never quits moving - it may pause for, say, 5 secs, but then start moving again for no apparent reason). If it doe eventually quit, it's when it reach the outermost HTML element (there are iframes on my page hence the "outermost").

Further, it may prove that this only occurs where the breadcrumb require "<" and ">" arrow (ie there is more data than can be shown in the available space). IOW, you may need to shrink your tool window to see this bug.


Expected results:

It should work like the doc say: "HTML breadcrumbs: this show the complete hierarchy through the document for the branch containing the selected element."

It shouldn't move in response to user moving the mouse or the HTML pane choosing to scroll doc change into view.
