Firefox freeze and is unresponsive (try to switch between tabs, for example) for several second during page load from the ynet.co.il web site, for news article from this site, probably due to page with many user comment on the article . This is a major news site in Israel.

When opening multiple tab of news article from this site, and since the website refreshes the tab automatically after some period of time, Firefox slows down and freeze a lot for several seconds.

This happens even when I use Adblock Plus to block all the flash ad on this page , so it probably is not related to flash

Tested on an Intel Celeron 3.2Ghz machine with 2GB RAM, Windows 7, but I believe it is a problem with all platforms.
The bug is both on Firefox 3.5 and on the trunk (Minefield)

Based on the URL from bug 401679 . I opened another bug since that bug summary wa about 100% CPU usage, and the main problem here is not the(almost) 100% CPU, which might be expected since it is a long page with ~2000
comments, but the lack of application responsiveness for some second when the
page load .


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the URL . Block flash ad on the page using adblock plus to filter the flash ad performance influence .
2. Try to switch between tab quickly during page load
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox freeze and is unresponsive for several second during page load

Expected Results:
firefox should be responsive and not freeze during page load
