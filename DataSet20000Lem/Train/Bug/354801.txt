I'm linked to google.com even if I use the italian version of Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060918 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060918 Firefox/2.0

I'm using the italian version of Firefox
When I use the embedded search engine Google, I'm redirect to Google.com web site. So that all the result of my search are loaded from english web pages.
For example if I search for "cane" (an italian word that mean dog) the result are all the english page that deal with the canes. No one of them deal with dog (in italian, obviously).
I've tried to install ffox on another PC on which ffox wa never installed before but the same problem wa still there.

I've just solved the problem changing the google.xml file. I've changed, in that file, all the item google.com to google.it and now everythig is ok.

I hope this warning is useful to you.

Bye and thanks a lot for your wonderful work.
