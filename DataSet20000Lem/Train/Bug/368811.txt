Firefox crash on exit after plugin install activated by InstallTrigger.install(xpi,installCompleteFunction)

After installing a plugin using xpinstall, and triggering the install with InstallTrigger.install(xpi,installCompleteFunction), the browser crash on exit in JS3250.dll if the Add-ons window (which pop up during plugin install) is closed after the last page.

I built a debug build of Firefox 1.5.0.9 from source and the crash happens in
JS3250.ddl:

nsXPITriggerInfo::~nsXPITriggerInfo()
{
nsXPITriggerItem* item;

for(PRUint32 i=0; i < Size(); i++)
{
item = Get(i);
if (item)
delete item;
}
mItems.Clear();

if ( mCx && !JSVAL_IS_NULL(mCbval) ) {
JS_BeginRequest(mCx);
>>>> JS_RemoveRoot( mCx, &mCbval );
JS_EndRequest(mCx);
}

MOZ_COUNT_DTOR(nsXPITriggerInfo);
}

After some debugging, I verified that during the install, the nsXPITriggerInfo receives the pointer to the callback function installCompleteFunction in the SaveCallback() method, which save it to the mCbval variable.

When install is completed, the callback is called and then the method

static void destroyTriggerEvent(XPITriggerEvent* event)
{
JS_BeginRequest(event->cx);
JS_RemoveRoot( event->cx, &event->cbval );
JS_EndRequest(event->cx);
delete event;
}

is correcly executed.

Then, when the last page ha been closed and the add-on window ha been closed, the destructor is called and crashes.
