I've used quite a few version of firefox (currently 3.6.8). this bug go back several versions. every time a new version come out, I hope that this bug ha been fixed, but no such luck.

there are 2 way to find the downloaded file:
- right-click on the file and select "show in finder" while the download is in progress (impossible if a small file is downloaded using a fast internet connection)
- open the download folder and locate the file manually.
