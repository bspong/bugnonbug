Ungraceful total rendering failure if some unknown resource is exhausted

Sorry that this is not going to be a very precise bug report, and possibly hard to replicate, but it look a if it is unreported thus far. This probably pertains only to window 2000 (sp4).

If I open enough tab in enough windows, when firefox try to render the final window, a nearly total rendering failure occurs. What I mean by this is that if a window need to be redrawn, either because it wa minimized or obscured, almost nothing is rendered in any window. A few icon (such a folder symbol in bookmark sidebar) are drawn, but no text is drawn. Components which are drawn on mouseover, however, do get drawn when the mouse pass over. If a window is restored from being minimized, only the graphic component of the decoration are drawn, not, e.g. the bar where it say "File" ... "Help".

This problem did not occur with the last released stable version of Firefox 2, drawing the exact same windows. (2.0.0.19). The total amount of memory being used when this problem occurs with FF 3.0.0.8 is about 300MB, on a machine with 1GB of physical memory. FF2.0.0.9 would use about 500BM of memory for the same set of url's. I am currently generating this problem when I open the 11th window, with something like 70 - 100 total tab open.

I see this problem reliably when I stress FF3 this way. Problem also occurred with at least 2 prior release version of FF3.

Also, I can tell you that at the moment FF is using 914 USER object and 1958 GDI objects. I have seen other resource shortage failure in win2k, and that is what this smell like to me. I don't think it's a GDI shortage, because other applications' window perform just fine.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open FF with no add-on
2.open a multi-url bookmark folder in tabs, with say 8 tabs. (I will attach a bookmark snippet for exact url and folder structure.)
3.create a new window (e.g. with ctrl-N)
4.goto 2.
5.repeat step 2-3 opening 11 window total.
Actual Results:
Once the 11th window try to render enough stuff, most rendering disappears and no normal method refreshes it in any window. Sometimes FF also hangs, or appears to hang.

Expected Results:
Normal rendering of all windows.

I will attach a piece of bookmarks.html which contains a folder with subfolders which cause the problem on my machine. (This is a bookmark folder which render fine on 2.0.0.19.)
