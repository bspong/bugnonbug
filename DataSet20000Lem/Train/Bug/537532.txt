Authentication detail supplied in URL are accessible even when history is disabled and tab ha been closed.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

In both normal and private browsing, even if history is disabled, if you access a URL like the following:

http://test:login@www.example.com/

And then close that tab, it is still possible to access the supplied credential by undoing the tab close and pressing ESC in the address bar.

This is probably only a problem in a very tiny number of situation (I note that almost no site authenticate this way any more except for FTP servers), but it just seems like the 'no history' aspect could be more complete.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open http://username:password@example.com
2. Close that tab
3. Restore that tab (CTRL+SHIFT+T)
4. Click in Address Bar and hit Escape key
Actual Results:
As expected, once the username/pass have been transmitted to the website, they are no longer present in the address bar (changes to http://example.com/ only). However, even if the user browse to other website in that tab, then close the tab, someone with physical access to the computer can still restore the tab, browse back through the visited pages, press Escape in the address bar on any site suspected of requiring this sort of login, and retrieve the credentials.

Expected Results:
Passwords probably shouldn't be shown to the user except when they are being typed in the first time.

I realize this is a piddly minor thing to file a bug about, but the other 3 thing I wa going to report have already been filed :P
