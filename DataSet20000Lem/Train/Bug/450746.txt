Using two profile at the same time and viewing page with plug-in (flash, pdfs) cause hang/~100% CPU utilization

I run two copy of Firefox at the same time, with separate profile (using the -p switch) so that I can use two copy of Gmail at the same time. About once a day one copy of FireFox will start hogging all of the available CPU time. At that point the only thing that will cause that copy of firefox to stop using all the CPU time is to kill it. Closing all window except for a empty blank window will not reduce CPU utilization.

I've used Process Explorer to check which thread is causing the problem, and it always seems to be a thread that reference a plugin (flash, shockwave, or PDF). This correlate with my experience that it seems to happen after I've used a page with a plugin of some sort or another. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen every time I load a page with a plugin.

While this bug is difficult to reproduce on command, it's unfortunately quite easy to reproduce given how I use Firefox - it occurred before I did an OS upgrade from Win2k (clean install, and I also created new firefox profiles) to Win2k3, and it also happened with FireFox 2.x before I switched to 3.x.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.make two profile
2.start two copy of firefox using the -p switch to load each profile
3.browse the web for 1-2 hour
Actual Results:
~100% cpu use
