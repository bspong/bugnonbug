Worked fine with my previous version a of yesterday. Uninstalled Firefox 3.6.3 to install new 3.6.4 today. Now button on Facebook (LIKE, HIDE, etc) do not work. The animation work so if I click the button it show it being depressed, but no action take place. No error in status bar, just stay reading DONE. I have updated JAVA plugin to the latest version (6.20) today to see if that wa the cause. However, it still doe not work with 6.20 installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to Facebook.com account
2. Go to a fan page or anything that ha the LIKE button, click it wont work
3. Go to your HOME page and try to hide any content. Click HIDE button and it fade the content but wont complete the HIDE process.


Expected Results:
After clicking LIKE on a fan page you should have the LIKE button changed to text confirming you like it. If you click HIDE the content should shrink and you will get a message asking if you'd like to hide all of that type, or cancel.
