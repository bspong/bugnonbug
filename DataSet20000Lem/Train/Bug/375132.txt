Links wont open first time Firefox is launched

When I start Firefox for the first time and try to click a link in my webmail, a new tab open but the link is not loaded. I must close the tab and re-click the link to load the link in a new tab. I am using Gmail specifically but the problem seems to be more general (see extra detail below).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Goto gmail.google.com (auto-login enabled)
3. Open e-mail in nobox that contains a link to open a new window
4. Click link
Actual Results:
New tab opened, but page did not load.

Expected Results:
New page should load in new tab on first click.

It appears the only link that are affected are those which open a new window. My preference are set to open new tab instead of a window. Interestingly, when I changed preference to open new page in a new window, the new window loaded the link on the first try. Even when I right-click a link and manually select "Open in new tab" it load the link properly (regardless of my preferences).
