Since I installed Firefox (from 1.5), I always have a hard time using the right click function of my mouse (obviously it's working on other application and it's function on my OS). One thing I observe is that my right click function the same way a my scroll wheel/middle button. what is happening is that every time i right-click (without releasing it), it will show the scroll up/down icon and when i move the mouse up/down, the page move up/down and then show the right click menu. another example is that when I right click into my bookmark toolbar (especially on my RSS feeds) it automatically open all the page (imagine if one of my RSS feed contain 50 feed it will open 50 tabs). This ha been bugging me for a very long time a the right click button on my keyboard doesn't help either.

I thought updating firefox browser will solve the problem but it wasn't.

Reproducible: Always




take note that I do not have any special software for my mouse or adjusted it setting to function differently than normal.

My right click function correctly just in this page: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/post_bug.cgi other than this page, it act like a middle button/scroll wheel
