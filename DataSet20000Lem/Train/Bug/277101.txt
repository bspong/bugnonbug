Print job fail; Mozilla think it's printing forever
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20050103 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a6) Gecko/20050103 Firefox/1.0+

Symptoms: When I click OK in the Print dialog box, no printing occurs. If I try
to select Print again, I get an error box that say (title) "Printer Error" and
(text) "Not Available." This continues until I exit and restart Mozilla. In some
case an attempt to load a new page after this error yield a message which say
that Mozilla cannot load a new page while it is printing.

The problem is recurrent but not consistently reproducible. Last night I wa
unable to avoid it when printing page from my PayPal account history; this
morning that works. A few minute ago it occurred when I tried to print the page
at http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.phtml?title=PDF; on retry, that worked.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select Edit/Print.
2. Click OK.
3. If no printing occurs, select Edit/Print again to reproduce the problem.

Selecting text before step 1 and clicking "Selection" in the Print dialog box
seems to increase the probability of observing the problem, at least with some
web pages.

Actual Results:
"Not Available" error, a described in Details.

Expected Results:
See Details.
