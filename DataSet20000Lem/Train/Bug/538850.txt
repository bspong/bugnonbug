When I need to empty a full mailbox, I need to be able to "delete all" or move folder to another location. When I am in Intenet explorer, the menu option needed to perform these function seem to be present. When I am in Firefox, they are not.
The problem is not exclusive to e-mail. For example, we have a "Sharepoint" application. Documents needing a signature are sent to Sharepoint by an administrator. However, when I am in Firefox, the drop down menu doe not have the option needed to allow the signature. When I am in Internet Explorer these option are present.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open web e-mail (not sure if the same think happens if not web e-mail, but it might)
2.Open "Deleted Items" folder
3."Select all"
4. Try to "Delete all"

Actual Results:
I can delete one message at a time, but not all messages. I get a message that I need to select at lest one message for deleting, even though I have already selected all messages.

Expected Results:
When I have "selected all" message and press the "x" for delete, I expect to delete all messages.

It should have allowed me to delete all message in the deleted item box (e.g., like the "empty deleted items" opion that I get when internet explorer is being used. I don't know if you have "Sharepoint", but it is the same type of problem. The menu option that appear in Firefox are limited and do not allow the kind of operation that are present when Internet Explorer is in operation. It basically mean that if I want to use e-mail or other operations, I have to be in Internet Explorer. Since I don't know when this will happen or not, it mean that I my use of Firefox is now restricted to non-work activities.
