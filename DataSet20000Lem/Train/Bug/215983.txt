tabbed browsing cause web page load to wait forever
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.2.1) Gecko/20021209

When I use tabbed browsing in Firebird 0.6.1, web page stop loading; the status
bar say "Waiting for www.whatever.com", but nothing is transmitted across the
modem. It only happens when I use tabs.

If I use only the man window, page load at an acceptable rate (33.6K modem, you
understand); but if I middle click a link, both the new tab and the original one
stop loading page and begin waiting forever (or at least longer than 10 mins).
If I close all tab but one, surfing resume at a normal rate -- unless I have
selected the option to always keep the tab-bar visible, in which case even just
having only the original tab open cause this problem.

It might happen only with dialup; file lookup from my hard drive appears to
function normally, and I don't have broadband. I am using an external US
Robotics 33.6 K modem and kppp to dail my isp.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run Firebird to your hears content.
2. Open another tab, or set "always display tab bar".
3. Wait forever.

Actual Results:
Modem statistic viewed with "kppp - details" show little or no activity across
the modem if tab are visible. Other internet application (irc chat, gaim) are
unaffected.



Slackware 8.1; custom compiled kernel 2.4.20 from stock sources; external US
Robotics 33.6K modem, dialup using kppp. Mozilla Firebird 0.6.1, fresh out of
the tarball or with addons/user preferences.
