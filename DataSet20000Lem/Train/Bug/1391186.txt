There seems to be some weirdness going on between Thunderbird and Firefox on macOS. When triggering a mailto link from Firefox 56/57 [1] Thunderbird before set a default email client loos these privilege. This doe not happen when using other browser (or FF 55, see below).


TB version TB 56.0b2, build ID 20170809184428
macOS version 10.11.6


1) Make sure TB is set a default email client [2]
2) open test pen [3] with Opera (or Chrome, or Safari)
3) Make sure TB composer window open on click
4) open test pen [3] with Firefox 56 or 57 [1]


Currently for me the link doe not do anything and when I switch to Thunderbird and check the "default mail client" setting all three checkboxes [1] are unticked.
In the attached screenshot you can see the setting modal with checkboxes unticked and a modal from Opera/Chrome asking to set a default email client, after I clicked the "mailto" with FF 57.


[1] tested Firefox versions:
Good FF 54.0.1 build ID 20170628075643
Good FF 55.0.2 build ID 20170814073321
Bad FF 56.0b3 build ID 20170815141045 (also checked with add-on disabled)
Bad FF 57.0a1 build ID20170816100153 (also checked web and browser console on click => nothing)
[2] Go to "TB > Preferences > Advanced > General > Check Now..." and make sure
all three checkboxes (E-Mail, Newsgroups, Feeds) are ticked

Note: Not sure if this should be raised against TB or FF tbh!?
