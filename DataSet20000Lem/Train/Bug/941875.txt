WindowBlinds skinning program break Australis menu
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.2; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131118030203

Steps to reproduce:

As far a I can tell there is some new nightly version 28 tab interface that ha been added within the last week that break the menu and render firefox unusable. It first started happening in the 64 bit version and ha now progressed to the 32 bit version. I can temporarily deal with this in the 32 bit version by reinstalling a earlier version dated 11/18 but nightly soon update itself and break again.


Actual results:

Starting the newer 32 bit version in safe mode result in a temporarily usable interface with big strange tab but functional menu but after clicking on tab and using the browser for a short while it manifest the same behavior. There seems to be some problem that WindowBlinds skinning make worse since if I unload WindowBlinds the newer version will work for a short time.


Expected results:

Nightly did not have problem before. Also when I reinstall there doe not seem to be any way not to install the Mozilla Maintenance Service and I think this is automatically updating me to the broken version.
