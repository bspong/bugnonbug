Had moved the browser to my second display. After finishing browsing, I disabled it. Later I started Firefox again, with the second display still disabled.

Firefox should then move itself to the primary display. Instead, it doesn't open any visible window, but crash instantly every time a start/restart of the browser is being attempted.

Workaround: Re-Enable the second display, launch Firefox, move it to the main window, disable the second display again. That can be done without even switching the second monitor on, but it's annoying that such a thing crash this fine product.

Just in case that this problem ha driver specific stuff in it, I am using AMDs display driver 8.11

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move browser to second display and quit it
2. Disable second display
3. Crash upon attempt to launch Firefox, everytime until the second display is re-enabled.
Actual Results:
A hell lot of automated crash report

Expected Results:
The browser should move to the primary display itself, when the most recently used display is disabled, just like VLC does.

Happened with AMD display driver 8.11 but I am pretty sure that I had the same problem some month ago with older version of Firefox and display drivers, even with a different graphic card. Just didn't report it then because I wanted to avoid having to register and create a new account for such a simple report.
