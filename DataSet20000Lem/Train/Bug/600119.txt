behavior after a user click a link is not very good
Clicking link is the most important interaction in a browser. I wa wondering why it felt like 16 thing were happening when I click a link. The answer is that our current behavior after a user click a link is not very good.

I've made a screencast showing what happens when I click on a link from TBPL to Bugzilla. Here's a play-by-play:

1.) hover effect on link (red underline). instant.
2.) target of link fade into location bar. faded text overlap star icon.
3.) star icon fade out
4.) link turn dark red a click down (instant)
5.) gray 0% progress bar appears in location bar, red X appears where refresh button was, tab title say "loading" (window title stay the same), tab favicon change to default (location bar still ha tbpl icon)
6.) progress bar draw blue in at about 66%
7.) thing stay motionless at 66% for a while
8.) back button becomes active, forward button becomes inactive, default document favicon replaces TBPL icon
9.) Window title change from TBPL title to Bugzilla title (it never say loading...). However, focused tab still read "Loading..."
10.) Tab title change to bugzilla. faded bugzilla target url drawn twice, overwritten on top of old URL, target URL once again drawn over star icon, progress bar still at 66%
11.) favicon change to bugzilla icon (still with overprinted text)
12.) overprinted text still visible in left of location bar
13.) favicon of tab change to bugzilla, bugzilla page drawn (overprinted text still visible), progress bar at 100%
14.) progress bar disappears, a doe faded overprint text
15.) red stop button stay visible for a very long time
16.) done
