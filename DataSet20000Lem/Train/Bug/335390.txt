Java button launch extra and faulty 'Mouse clicked' and 'Mouse released' event in addition to expected 'Action event'

Running an applet I get extra mouse event when a button is clicked. Some of these are incorrectly located giving anomalous behaviour.
Details:
1) printout from tracer println()s {Mac Java console log}:-
Mouse released X 320 Y 373
plotRect.contains(X,Y) false
barRect.contains(X,Y) false
Mouse clicked X 320 Y 373
plotRect.contains(X,Y) false
barRect.contains(X,Y) false
Action event java.awt.event.ActionEvent[ACTION_PERFORMED,cmd=Display gain,when=0,modifiers=] on button0
displayG
Mouse released X 320 Y 395
plotRect.contains(X,Y) false
barRect.contains(X,Y) true
Mouse clicked X 320 Y 395
plotRect.contains(X,Y) false
barRect.contains(X,Y) true
Gofile 300

2) Explanation
Note that the 'Mouse released' 'Mouse clicked' event occurring before the 'Action event' show position
X 320 Y 373 whereas those afterwards (which occur wheen the mouse is very slightly moved laterally show position
X 320 Y 395 (i.e. 22 pixel lower) This is interpreted a a click in the barRect and cause Gofile 300.

3)
To see this in action (there are no tracer printout in the web version) goto the URL <hrat.btinternet.co.uk>
login to the Developing Atlas (well down the page) [the same thing happens with the full Atlas but this requires a proper username/password pair]
For the Developing Atlas you can login using guest/EPTA2005
under Currently Available Records look at EEG
click on Display gain (wait - don't move the mouse pointer)
the gain will be shown a EEG channel 0.25 pixel per uV
NOW move the mouse very slightly sideways
if you have clicked in the centre of the button a new page (Page 20+10sec) will be shown (note that it may take a second or so to load) and the indicator in the position Bar will move to the X value of the click. The position Bar is 22 pixel below the centre of the Display gain button!
There are variant of this and I once crashed the whole system but this can always be easily duplicated.
I hope you can discover what is happening.
