Please refer to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355745 for the description of the bug. Upon analysis of the entry area in question (using at-poke), it doesn't appear a though the implementation is providing any useful text. Instead, it seems to provide a single embedded object character a the text. I think a proper implementation for the entry should probably provide the exact text being displayed in the entry.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Please refer to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355745 for the description of the bug.

Actual Results:
The accessible text for the entry consists of a single embedded object character. Also notice the very odd behavior when you edit the editable text area in at-poke - the entry in Firefox is populated with very bizarre results.

Expected Results:
I'd expect the accessible text implementation to provide the exact text that is in the entry. I'd also expect that editing the text in at-poke result in the exact same text showing up in the entry.
