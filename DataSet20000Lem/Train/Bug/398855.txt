packages-static cleanup, October 2007 edition
Created attachment 283839
Fix v.1

Same justification a bug 380895 and friends, that the spew of expected warning annoys #build during releases, with the added justification from bug 351476 comment 21 that I actually caught a bug by reading the "possible missing or unnecessary" spew, but only because I knew which one to ignore and which wa new.

Both:

* I finally noticed that packages-static is preprocessed, so we don't have to see the error from non-libxul file on libxul builds, or t'other way around, and can get rid of ucnative.xpt without bothering the person who us it

* progressDlg.xpt bit the dust in bug 391870, which sent it into exile in xpfe.

* bug 392845 set the precedent to get rid of packaging for extension that we hate, by removing two of the three bit for xml-rpc, so I'm adding in the missed nsDictionary.js from it, websrvcs.xpt from bug 332174, and the wallet* bit that for some strange reason we still try to package on windows, but not *nix.

unix/-only:

thing I should have gotten in bug 380895 when I did windows/:

* helperAppDlg.xpt is actually found in exthandler.xpt

* necko_jar.xpt wa removed by bug 248044, re-added by aviary-landing

* search.xpt is only build for MOZ_SUITE

* platform-forms.css wa removed by bug 272151

* pipnss.jar only contains a contents.rdf we don't build

new unix/ things:

* jsconsole.xpt went away in bug 243170, but it missed the unix/packages-static

* xremoteservice.xpt should have left Fx in bug 280725

* nsInterfaceInfoToIDL.js is apparently a part of websrvcs that wasn't ever packaged on Windows, only *nix

* mozgnome.xpt moved into xpcom_system.xpt in bug 354075

That leaf the intractable existing-profile-defaults.js on both platforms, and a few random thing I haven't figured a way around in unix/, which matter a bit le since the unix tinderbox parser doesn't actually catch "Warning: package error..." a an error.
