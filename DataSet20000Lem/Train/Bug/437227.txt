When navigating a web site, once the back button ha been used, the browser will return to that page when a link ( not just for that page, mind you ) is hovered over. If you are quick, and preposition your pointer ( after hitting the "back" button again) you can navigate to a different link, and set that is the new "persistent page".

Also, if you are careful not to bring the cursor over any other links, you can keep the behaviour at bay.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.cuddletech.com, navigate to blogs, read posting, consider ideas.

Always happens at site for which this is a problem, not all site are.
doe not always happen right away, response time tends to decrease,

Makes firefox almost unusable
