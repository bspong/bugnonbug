A SELECT list contained within a visible DIV contained within a TABLE increase
in size when a button is clicked, even if the button ha no action. I found the
bug disappeared if I made the DIV non-visible by removing 'border: ...; padding:
...;' from it styles. The bug also did not appear when I removed the DIV or
the TABLE from the page.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a <table>
2. Inside a <td>, place a <div> styled to have either border or padding and
styled with 'width: 100%'
3. Inside the <div>, place a <select multiple> styled with 'width: 100%', and
with options; close the select correctly
4. Inside the <div>, place an <input type='button'>
5. Finish the page
6. View the page in Firefox; when the button is clicked, the select increase in
size!
Actual Results:
when the button wa clicked,, the width of the select list increased.

Expected Results:
There should hve been no change in rendering (except possibly the button-pressed
effect)
