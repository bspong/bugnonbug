Something about this website force Fox to return a dialog box requesting permission to open/save the file a "application-trash". This is not a consistent behavior, but is something that ha happened a few time in the last week.

This conduct doe not happen every day I go to the webpage, but when it doe happen, the dialog box will appear many time in a row. Then, at some point, the behavior relents, and it will return a the expected web page. [today, it took 3 tries] When it doe happen, it persists both a a "click" and "control-click" into a new tab.

I have no idea whether it is a fault in the Fox process, or if there is something about the document a served up.

I do note that the message bar, in the faulted mode or with a normal return, both show the correct URL in the lower left message bar.

I request the URL from a local web-page on my laptop, which ha been unchanged for years. A few day ago, typing the URL in manually, also returned the odd dialog box.

Reproducible: Sometimes
