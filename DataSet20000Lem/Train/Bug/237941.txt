Even if all file and folder in the Bookmarks Manager are deleted until only
two nested folders, “Bookmarks” and “Bookmarks Toolbar Folder” are left and
Bookmarks look empty, some of the file in Bookmarks directory can be still
seen by using the “Search” field in the Bookmarks Manager. I do not figure out
why they appear a a result of the searching process after deleting them from
the Bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmarks-> Bookmarks Manager.
2.Delete all file and folder until two nested folders, “Bookmarks” and
“Bookmarks Toolbar Folder” are left.
3.Select the Bookmarks directory in the Bookmarks Manager.
4.After that, click the “Search” field and enter a character such a “a”, ”b”,
or “c”.
5.The result of the searching process is that some file in the Bookmarks
directory that we already deleted still appear in the Bookmarks Manager.

Actual Results:
As a result of the searching process, it still show some file in the Bookmarks
directory even if they are deleted.



Expected Results:
It should not show any file in the Bookmarks directory since all of them are
deleted from the Bookmarks.

Additionally, after the result of the searching process, I wanted to delete the
resulted file in the Bookmarks Manager, but delete function do not process
anything. In other words, the file are not deleted even if Delete icon is
highlighted after I select the files.
