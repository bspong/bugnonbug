I have installed Firefox 4 b10 and wa able to use it the first few time without much of a problem. there were a few time when it froze and I had to manually end the process after closing. However, I am now unable to do anything with the new beta because it is unresponsive immediately from startup. I have switched back and forth between 3.6.13 and beta 4 in order to close tab and see if that is the problem. Once I wa able to get the Session Manager to open up the tab I had before the hang, but it then froze again. I am not sure if switching versions, having over 10 tab open, or incompatible addons are the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get Frifox 4 b10
2. Open with several tab and navigate until it freeze
3. Switch to firefox 3.6.13 and repeat step 2
Actual Results:
A firefox 4 beta 10 which is frozen from startup (AKA useless)

Expected Results:
Not frozen! :)

I have tried reinstalling the beta, and a similar problem occurred in beta 4 (though not to it current extent, because after you closed the current tab in ff 3, the problem wa solved). No theme were used, but I have several addons a well a the addon tester which allows incompatible addons to run. It worked fine the first few time with the same settings. When I close the program, the ff window disappears, but the process is still there, but take up 0% cpu power.
