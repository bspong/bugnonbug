[OS X] Locale Switcher extension doe not work
Even if only the Mac version Firefox installs Locale Switcher, the following
error occur and do not work.
This problem is not generated in Windows and Linux.

If some language package are installed in the English version Firefox and this
Extension is installed, all the language installed in the Locale Switcher menu
of the Tool menu will be displayed.

But even if it chooses arbitrary languages, nothing happens.

Error message of JavaScript Console:
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004003
(NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER) [nsIPrefBranch.setCharPref]" nsresult: "0x80004003
(NS_ERROR_INVALID_POINTER)" location: "JS frame ::
chrome://locale-switch/content/switch.js :: eSwitchLocales_switch :: line 13"
data: no]
Source File: chrome://locale-switch/content/switch.js
Line: 13

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. The following option are turned ON and Firefox is restarted
javascript.options.showInConsole
javascript.options.strict
2. Locale Switcher is installed after installing some language packages.
3. Arbitrary language are chosen from the Locale Switcher menu of the Tool menu.

Actual Results:
An error message is displayed on Java Script Console.

Expected Results:
An error is not generated.(Language can be chosen.)

By the way,I received advice a this Extension is not dependent on OS.

I think that there may be a problem only in the Mac version at registration of a
menu, and acquisition of the information from it.
