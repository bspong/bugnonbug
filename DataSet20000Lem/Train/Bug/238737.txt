When we try and move a smaller application window over the Firefox window ,
firefox depicts refresh/repaint problem.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1)Open a couple Firefox browser window and open certain URLs within them.
2)Open a couple (or just one) other application (Paint in my example).
3)Resize the application to a smaller window and then move it over Firefox
window(s).


Actual Results:
The application frame leaf behind a trail of unpainted frame and leaf the
background unreadable.

Expected Results:
The application window should not leave any remains or trail behind while
moving. The browser window should be refreshed just in time while the
application window move over it.

opera.The refresh/repaint problem wa not evident.
b) we tested the application on slower computer running on low virtual memory
and fater computer with high virtual memory. Both gave almost similar outputs.

Importance of the Bug:

refresh, is so severe that no self-respecting software company should allow
known, egregious refresh bugs.
