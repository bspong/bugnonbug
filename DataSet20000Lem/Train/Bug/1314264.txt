[Preconditions]:
Install the latest zh-TW nightly build from http://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-central-l10n/
-if not in Taiwan or Hong Kong, set a Taiwan or Hong Kong proxy

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. After you installed Firefox open the folder where you installed the build and go to "defaults" -> "pref" -> channel-prefs.js and from update channel change "nightly" with "release". Save the file. Please wait two minute so change can take place.

2. Open Nightly with a new profile.

3. Go to about:config and type "app.update.channel". The update channel need to be set on "release".

2. When you use Hong Kong proxy:

https://www.google.com/search?q=+mozilla&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b
