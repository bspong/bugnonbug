Firefox fails to bring up the browser window after I close or minimize the window. I cannot open up another browser window until I either select Firefox from the current minimized windows, or force quit Firefox and open it up again. Ex. #1: I open up Firefox for the first time, browser window pop up, I close the window - I click on the Firefox icon on my permanent application side of my dock -Firefox doe not open up a window. Ex. #2: Same a Ex. #1 except that I minimize the browser window instead of closing it - same result. This happens all of the time, I have never been able to re-open up a minimized browser window or open a new browser window. This is the only problem I have with Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up Firefox for the first time.
2. Minimize Firefox to current application part of your dock.
3. Try to bring up the minimized window by clicking on the original Firefox icon (the one on the permanent side of your dock).
4. Repeat step 1-3 except close the window instead of minimizing it.

Actual Results:
No browser window wa opened. I had to force quit then reopen another session.

Expected Results:
I wa hoping that if I clicked on the Firefox icon, which I keep on my permanent application side of my dock because I use it so frequently, it would bring up the minimized window, or bring up a new window if no window wa currently minimized.

None.
