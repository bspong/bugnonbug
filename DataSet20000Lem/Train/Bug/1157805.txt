Cannot refresh source map from debugger
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:37.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/37.0
Build ID: 20150402191859

Steps to reproduce:

Step 1: on a page which includes `script.min.js`, I opened the debugger and viewed the original non-minified source (taken from `script.js` using source mapping).

Step 2: add `alert("HI")` to `script.js` and generate `script.min.js`.

Step 3: refresh the page, ensure that "HI" is displayed.

Step 4: view the non-minified source of `script.min.js` in the debugger again.


Actual results:

Debugger display old version of `script.js`, without `alert("HI")` statement.

Ctrl+R and F5 do not load the new version of `script.js`.

The following solution candidate also do not cause the debugger to display the new version of `script.js`:

- closing and reopening the "Debugger" tab
- closing and reopening the developer tool
- closing and reopening the tab where the site is displayed

The only solution I have found is to open a new tab and visit `http://localhost/script.js` (which display the new version).



Expected results:

I expected the debugger to display the new version of `script.js` (including the `alert("HI")` statement). Failing that, I would have expected either F5 or Ctrl-R to force a refresh and display the new version.
