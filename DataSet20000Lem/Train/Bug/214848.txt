Firebird 0.6.1 will crash when you're in the printer dialog box on a window
server 2003 system and you have long printer name (I found that over 30
character would do it). I have had the problem be sporadic if I use the File
-> Print menu to get to the printer dialog box, but if I use ctrl-p or the
printer icon I always have the problem. The print dialog box will open but if
you click on either "OK" or "Cancel" or try to change some print setting
Firebird will crash. Also, if you use the keyboard to get around the print
dialog box instead of the mouse everything seems to work fine. This problem
only seems to occur on window server 2003 machines.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set up a printer with a printer name longer than 30 character on a window
server 2003 system.
2.Use ctrl-p or print icon to open the printer dialog box
3.Click "Ok" or "Cancel" or try to change some printer setting using the mouse.

Actual Results:
Firebird will close/crash

Expected Results:
Print the page. (or cancel the printer dialog box)

I am using the Orbit 3+1 1.3.0.0.7.1 theme but the bug will occur with the
default theme and clean install.

The error reported in the Event Viewer is a follows:
Faulting application MozillaFirebird.exe, version 1.5.20030.7265, faulting
module user32.dll, version 5.2.3790.0, fault address 0x0003516c.
