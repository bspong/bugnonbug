Hey guys,

I'm not 100% if my problem is the same a that top known problem bug reported on above... but it looked pretty close to mine.

Basically, I came on my computer after closing all window and such 6 or so hour ago, and suddenly all my bookmarks... everything I previously imported from IE after a reformat and all saved since, every bit of search history, every bit of cooky or saved site in the search bar or web search bar for all recently viewed site - inexplicably gone out of the blue. It's a huge loss of... everything, but I'm not a steamed with it a I probably could be.

I'm not sure if it wa due to the latest firefox update, which maybe installed when I closed all window last time, or some unknown spyware or such there... but I wanted to make sure I reported it here incase anyone else ha had this happen, and in hope it doesn't have to happen to anyone else again. I'm pretty sure none of my lost data can be recovered in anyway, but would be more than willing to hear option available, if any, to recover that.

If anyone's willing to help or have any word of wisdom her - thank in advance, if not - no hard feelings. I honestly don't think there's a miracle cure for this one.

Take care guys,
Jay
