No URL info when mouse pointer is over image or link
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

1. I use alltheweb.com a LOT to search for images, etc. When I get a page of
image in IE 6.x, putting the mouse curser over an image show the associated
URL in the bottom line of the browser. Same for hovering over a link. Not so
for Firefox 1.0. Can this feature be implemented?
2. There seems to be no way to "page back" through the transaction on a web
window and move to any arbitrary point in the browsing session for that
window. It look like it happens, but it doesn't. Regardless of where I
happen to look like I am, if I do a single backstep (using left arrow key), I
find that the pointer is actually pointing at the end-of-browsing page. Ouch.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. See above.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
1. You never see the URLs.
2. You are always pointed to the last page in the list.

Expected Results:
1. Shown the url associated with the image, video, or link.
2. Allowed an incremental (by group) regression through all of the web page
linked to until one reach the desired point in that progression - back to
the beginning, if desired.
