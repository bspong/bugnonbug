Drop target area for tab-to-tab drop between Firefox window is very small when multiple tab are opened.

Use case:
User open two tabbed browser windows. User drag multiple tab from window number one to window number two with the intent to open the dropped tab from window number one a new tab in window number two (tab-to-tab drag and drop).

Current behavior:
When a tab bar becomes full in a target tabbed browser window, the drop target area is limited to small area above currently open tab (only a few pixels). Using a resolution of 1024x768 with a window spanning half the screen width, this condition is reached with only three open tab in the target tabbed browser window.

Suggestion:
Increasing tab-to-tab drop target area to include bottom status bar and toolbar area. i.e. dragging a tab to these area would open the page a a new tab in the target tabbed browser window. Suggest no change in behavior of the two current tab drop target (url box target & specific tab target).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open two tabbed-browser Firefox window each covering half the screen width.
2.Create 5 tab in the window on the left. Create two tab in the right window.
3.Attempt to drag all tab from the window on the left into the window on the right using existing drop target.
