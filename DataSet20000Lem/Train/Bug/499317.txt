I have two machine sharing an XServer (local to one of the machines). If I have Firefox running on one machine, and try to start Firefox on the second machine I instead get a second Firefox window on the first machine. This is apparent in a number of ways:
1. The home paget is the home page of the first machine.
2. The file system accessed by downloads is the file system of the first machine:
- This is the most important problem, and the way I worked out what wa happening, since I wanted to use firefox to download a file from a web site, and it ended up on the wrong machine.
3. p doesn't show firefox running on the second machine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an xterm
2. Start firefox with the command "firefox &"
3. ssh into a second machine with a different file system using the command "ssh -Y <<machine name>>"
4. Start Firefos on the second machine using the command "firefox &"

Actual Results:
Two Firefox window are displayed, both showing the Firefox home page set up on the first machine.

Expected Results:
Two Firefox windows, one showing the home page set up on the first machine, the other showing the home page set up on the second machine.
