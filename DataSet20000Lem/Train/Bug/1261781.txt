Add an inspector toolbar button to insert new element in the DOM
Similarly to how there is a + button in the rules-view to insert new rules, there should be a + button in the markup-view to insert new elements.

Why should the markup-view be primarily an inspection tool? I think it ha a role to play in authoring too.
My gut feeling is that while people are used to modifying style in the rule-view by adding/removing/changing properties, they're much le used to modifying thing in the markup-view, more often going back to their editor and refreshing the page to see the changes.

A simple + sign in the toolbar would make it consistent with the rule-view and allow people to add new element very quickly.

I imagine this would insert a new element a the last child of the currently selected element.

Technically adding this is very simple.
There are some edge case to take into account and question to answer however:
- should a <div> be inserted?
- should there be a modal displayed to enter attribute before inserting the element?
- if the document is XUL, should a <box> be inserted instead?
- if the document is SVG, should a <rect> be inserted instead?
- if the currently selected element is <head>, or <html>, <script>, <style>, etc... should we still insert an element or grey-out the button?
- if a pseudo-element is selected, the button should probably not work either.
