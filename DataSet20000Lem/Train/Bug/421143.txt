Pages won't load - Error Console FULL of "Error Parsing/Dropped Declarations"

I'm not computer savvy, but I've debugged my Sony Vaio before. I can read instructions, and research online. Would the Console2 app have blasted away these problems?

Firefox broswer: Pages dont load, or load soooooo slowly. Toggling Back< Forward> is an occasional "help." Mozilla is INSANELY buggy, basically unusable on this server: the Boston Public Library's.

I thought it might be my firewall or virus-ware - they insist it Mozilla.

I can reproduce these result anytime, if anyone want to see all the "Error Console" reports.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch browser
2. Try to open page
3. Sit staring at computer, fuming (LOL)
Actual Results:
Clearing cache may or may not help. Restarting, ditto. If a page loads, Praise Zeus! and sacrifice a young virgin. Memo to Red States: Send more virgins!

Expected Results:
In Browser Hell, do you expect the temperature to rise?
