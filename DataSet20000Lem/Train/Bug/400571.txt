Apologies if my terminology is unclear; I'm still learning this stuff.

This problem also applies to Firefox 2.0.0.5 on i386 Fedora 7.

If I create a form with a table, and a cell of that table contains another table... calling insertRow of the internal table cause a display problem. The row is inserted, but the containing table is not expanded, so the expanded cell draw over the top of the cell below.

deleteRow work fine however.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. display page containing form with nested table a described above
2. click button to add a row to the inside table

(See attachment for sample HTML file)
Actual Results:
A row is added but is not rendered properly. It appears that the cell containing the internal table grows, but only that one cell. Or maybe it's just the inside table itself. The expanded inside table is drawn over the top of the rest of the outside table.

Expected Results:
All the containing element of the inside table should be expanded to fit and redrawn

I viewed the same page in Safari and it had no problems, worked a expected.
