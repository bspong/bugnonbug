Steps to reproduce:

Since I upgraded my Firefox package a few day ago, every time the browser is started fresh with restored tabs, my second pinned tab break in an unusual way.


Actual results:

It turn light gray (on a dark theme) with a light blue effect on it and it doesn't behave a a tab anymore: It cannot be selected, moved or closed, and right clicking brings up the context menu for the tab bar itself (like when clicking empty part of it) rather than the context menu for a tab.

My open tab list start with 9 pinned tab and it's always the second tab, even if I rearrange them.

Disabling Tab Mix Plus addon doesn't solve the problem.

The ONLY workaround I found is this:
1, Open new window
2, Using Session Manager addon, reload session forecefully into the new window. Reloading session to same window doesn't work.
