When you go to customize toolbar, you can drag item onto the toolbars. However, this cause the bookmark to be replaced by "Bookmarks toolbar items" when in customize mode. This mean that all item dragged to the bookmark toolbar are placed on the far left end, and once customize is closed, those item are unmovable. Essentially, I want to be able to move item while the bookmark are present so that I can place them where I want, not just at end where they are unmovable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right-click on the toolbar area and go to customize.
2.Drag item onto the area that say "Bookmark toolbars area".
3.Close customize and see that all item are stuck on the left of the toolbar.
Actual Results:
Items are stuck on the left of the bookmark toolbar. You can't move them around.

Expected Results:
Should be able to either drag item around after customize is closed, or show the bookmark while customize is open so item can be placed between them.
