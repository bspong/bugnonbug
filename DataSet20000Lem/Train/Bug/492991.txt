I am posting this a a bug because I have encountered this problem through two of your software update and the reason I use your browser is because it supposed to be le susceptible to this kind of thing.
I use Internet Explorer in conjunction with Firefox and it only affect Firefox. The redirect happens about every 2 out of 5 search and changing search engine doesn't seem to affect it. I even get redirected sometimes when I am reloading a browser window to refresh it, say my weather page for example, so it isn't only a search problem. Searches do consistently produce the redirect though. I even switched to the Ixquick search engine and it didn't seem to help.

I have not found any online directs to help with this problem, but I will keep checking, but this would be a good one to engineer away from.

When the redirect happens, the load time for the browser page go up by 10 time or more and lock up all Firefox window and tab until the redirect page loads.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.do a search
2.
3.
Actual Results:
I have not been able to reproduce the problem by cutting a pasting the link i sent you. I get a "Server is too busy" message. Somehow a command ha gotten embedded somewhere that initiate the redirect. And once it doe the redirect is way too repeatable.
