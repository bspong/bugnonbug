I tried supporting the font in CSS but it made no difference:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/mm_entertainment.css" type="text/css" /><head>
.Old p {
font-family: "Old English Text MT";
font-size: 18px;
font-style: normal;
background-color: #FFF;
}

Expected Results:
Same a all the other browsers.

Should have used the embedded font.
