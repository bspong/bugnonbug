Yesterday I installed your beta, and saw that I had no "New Tab" icon on my navigation toolbar, which I had set up in the version your beta replaced. So I right-clicked on the toolbar, selected "Customize" and dragged the New Tab icon to the toolbar. I closed the program normally and turned off my computer. This morning I started it all up again, and again there is no New Tab icon on the toolbar. Amazingly, I go to the Customize window and there is now no New Tab icon there either! It seems to have vanished from both places.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Drag New Tab icon from Customize window to navigation toolbar
2.Close Firefox, shut down computer
3.Turn on computer, start Firefox
Actual Results:
New Tab icon is missing both from the navigation toolbar and from the Customize window.

Expected Results:
New Tab icon should still be in the navigation toolbar.

Unable to reproduce it myself without reinstalling Firefox.
