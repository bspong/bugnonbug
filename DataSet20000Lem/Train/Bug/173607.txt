fails to start, no message (on linux)
Hi,

I've installed phoenix 0.2 in /opt like I did on another machine (where it
worked) and it won't start. No warning. A window just appears for 1 sec before
disappearing.

I installed gdb and edited run_mozilla.sh and set moz_debug to 1 on line 278.
started phoenix, typed 'run' inside gdb (first time I use this) and here's the
output :

(gdb) run
