it's a variation of this bug that ha been marked resolved worksforme
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=222003 and a bug i filed a while
ago https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=295874

it may be mac-specific, but i've always found unusual reaction between cookie
dialog window and pages/other tab not loading in Firefox. This usually effect
Firefox when opening 5 or 6 page in the background (often site never visited
before) when the preference are assigned to always ask for cooky permission.

This is especially prevalent when opening multiple tab in the background (for
example, directing an r reader to open url's in your default browser and in
the background)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. 'Allow site to set cookies' and 'keep cookies: ask me every time' enabled
2. Open multiple url's (5 or 6), in tabs, from site previous unvisited in the
background
3. Wait. Leave Firefox to load the site in the background and then accept or
decline cooky dialog

Actual Results:
Most tabbed site will not load if Firefox is waiting for cookie acknowledgement.
Screen artifact are often visible across tabs.

Expected Results:
Loaded other tab in the background or wait for user to acknowledge each cookie
dialog and resume loading page(s)
