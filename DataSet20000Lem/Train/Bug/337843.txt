Firefox point to five different url in tab when attempting to preview jpg from Windows Explorer, due to space in path

I don't know if this is a bug in Firefox but I don't know where else to look right now.
When I want to preview an image file such a a jpg or gif by using the context menu item "Preview in browser" in XP, Firefox try to open five address simultaneously in different tabs. Here are the addresses:
file:///C:/Documents (this fails)
http://www.nasa.gov/
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/using/howto/security/settings.mspx
http://www.tallon.co.uk/

If I change the default browser for previewing such file to IE in Windows there is no problem, the image is opened in one IE browser window.
Maybe it is a bug in XP, or a virus of some kind but something seems to be corrupted. Any suggestion a to what to do? I would prefer not to use IE if I can help it but I do like to be able to preview in the browser out of Windows Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right click jpg or gif in Windows Explorer and select "Preview in browser"
Actual Results:
file:///C:/Documents [Problem loading page: Firefox can't find the file at /C:/Documents.]

Expected Results:
As above

Opened a separate window or tab interpreting the image
