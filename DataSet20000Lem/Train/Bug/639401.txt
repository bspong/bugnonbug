Firefox, unlike it predecessors, ha it bookmark pull-down menu on the Macintosh menu bar at the top of the display. I need it on the browser window toolbar because: I do research, I work on a large (30") display with two or three browser window open at once. Tabs don't cut it, it need multi window for side by side comparison. It is awkward to use bookmark when you have to jump back and forth and constantly check to see which browser window is selected.
We lost a lot when we no longer had the ability to delete, file and edit bookmark bookmark on the fly in the menu with a right click.
I have managed to make reasonable work-arounds using add-on and patch to Foxfire 3.X. I won't be able to test 4.0 until I can do the same to it.
Why not restore the elegant and powerful bookmark system of Mozilla/Seamonkey to Firefox?
Thank You
(PS: I tested pre 1.0 release Mozilla for many versions.)
