I go into Tools>Options>Advanced>Network>Settings

There I select "Manual Proxy Configuration" and enter my local network proxy settings.

I click "Save" and "Save" again.

At this point I am able to brow the network and internet with no problems.

I close out of Firefox by closing the Window. If there are multiple tab I am asked if I want to save and quit, quit, or cancel, I can choose save and quit or quit and have the same issue when I start up.

I restart Firefox and find that the network setting I make did not save. When Firefox close I notice that "prefs.js" is being overwritten with incorrect information during the shutdown process.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Change network setting so that I am using a "Manual Proxy Configuration"
3.Save network setting
4.Surf and have fun
5.Close Firefox
6.Restart Firefox
7.Find that my proxy setting have reverted to "No Proxy"
Actual Results:
My proxy setting are not saved after a Firefox restart.

Expected Results:
My proxy setting are saved and not reset.

No matter what I choose for proxy setting it is always reset to "No Proxy".

I would like Firefox to get the proxy setting from Windows "Internet Options" setting that I have to set for other application anyway. that would be the most convenient.
