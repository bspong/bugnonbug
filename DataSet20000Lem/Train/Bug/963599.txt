Different type of height value before and after alert() - Javascript
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

I created a div with a height size in %.
Example (what i did)
<div id="top">blabla</div> (height : 4%;)
<div id="body">blabla</div> (height : 92%;)
<div id="footer">blabla</div> (height : 4%;)

Then, I asked to javascript the $("#body").outerHeight() to do some stuff.
To debug my code, I printed [alert()] the value.




Actual results:

The result of printing are strange.

Code :
alert("Height value before an alert() : "+ $("#body").outerHeight());
alert("Height value after an alert() : "+ $("#body").outerHeight());

Results are :
Height value before an alert() : 92
Height value after an alert() : 732 (real value in pixel)


Expected results:

After the first alert(), Mozilla convert the % value in a px value. I really don't know why.

I tested the code with chrome and safari. They both return the value in %.

This problem is solved for me (I deleted my alert() and used the % value) but I think I found a real bug that can be big a problem for other webmasters.

Thanks you.
