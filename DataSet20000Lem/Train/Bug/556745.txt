I posted this originally to the forum and someone said file it here. Searched on "font" and "trademark" and didn't see it.

I have a number of font that use the trademark symbol (TM) in the font name. In the past Firefox ha been able to load these by using the base name w/o the (TM) symbol. This stopped working on or around Firefox 3.5. Now there's no way I can specify the name in a STYLE or .css (I have tried using unicode, *, "TM", etc.); instead I have to programmatically change the page after loading by updating the style from a SCRIPT section using the unicode for (TM). OSX version 10.4.4, Firefox 3.6.2.
