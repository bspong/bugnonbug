firefox 2.x ha shown memory leaking since the beginning but after the recent update to 2.0.0.12 the leaking is out of control. It go over 372MB of memory and large Virtual Memory usage also. I'm very dissapointed with this and wish there wa a way to revert to the prior release or UNDO or UNINSTALL a recent UPDATE. Is there? Firefox becomes sluggish after a while and then sometimes stop responding to keyboard input. Rarely entirely hang which is good but still it an annoying problem. I like to open many window tab upto 20 at a time and leave them open for days. Please advise.

Thanks!
Dave

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.launch firefox 2.0.0.12 begin surfing, open tab over time between 10 and 20 tab
2.allow tab to remain open for a few hour
3.browsing begin to slowdown. Eventually stop responding to text input/keyboard input. Have to restart firefox. Then problem repeat after a while again.
Actual Results:
browsing begin to slowdown. Eventually stop responding to text input/keyboard input. Have to restart firefox. Then problem repeat after a while again.

Expected Results:
browsing remains snappy and fast - considering I have 2GB of RAM and ton of disk space. it should keep running strong and memory usage should not leap up to 300+MB in just a couple of hours. When I restart firefox and restore the prior session and window that were open - the memory usage initially is only 128MB or so.

I have 2GB of RAM about 4 GB free on the C: drive where the OS is and some swap space. This problem started to worsen after recent update to 2.0.0.12.
