Mozilla appears to be limiting the width of the it browser window to that of
the desktop (i.e. the resolution of the screen). This is inconsistent with
standard behavior on the Mac. Allow window to be stretch a wide a the user
wants, multiple time the width of the desktop. This allows users, for example,
to take screen shot of website with large browser width, or simply to pan
within a site's content by dragging the window instead of using the scrollbar.

BTW, this is on an iBook in 1024x768.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Mozilla.
2. Drag part of the brower window off the left edge of the screen.
3. Begun to resize the window by dragging the resize handle in the lower left
corner of the window.
4. Attempt to drag the handle all the way to the right edge of the screen (i.e.
make the window a large a possible).

Actual Results:
The window stop growing when it reach the current width of the desktop.

Expected Results:
The window should have continued to expand until the resize handle reached the
right side of the screen.
