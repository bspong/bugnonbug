Any attempt to filter by more than 1 "tag" in the OSX 10.5 Wiki return all results. Reproducible in Firefox and Opera, but Safari behaves a expected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Example:

Wiki page "ONE" w/ tag "small", "odd"
Wiki page "TWO" w/ tag "small", "even"
WIki page "THREE" w/ tag "small", "odd", "prime"


--NEW Search w/ no criterion return all 3 pages. Displayed URL is:

https://<server>/groups/<group_name>/search/?q=


--NEW Search w/ tag "odd" return 2 result - ONE and THREE and show additional tag a checkboxes to further filter results. Displayed URL is:

https://<server>/groups/<group_name>/search/?tag=odd

----Check filter by "prime" SHOULD return just "THREE" but actually return all 3 result a if the search had been re-set. Displayed URL is:

https://<server>/groups/<group_name>/search/?q=&sortDirection=reverse&kind=all&sort=date

The same action in Safari produce this URL:

https://<server>/groups/<group_name>/search/?q=&sortDirection=reverse&kind=all&sort=date&tag=odd&tag=prime



SOS-APPL claim they can't reproduce it, but it happens for me on multiple client in multiple non-Safari browsers. Safari behaves normally.

Can anyone else at least confirm this so I can go back to Apple and lean on them?
Actual Results:
The search reset to no tags, return all results. If I copy the correct URL from Safari (see Steps to Reproduce) and paste into Firefox it show the correct result, but clicking another checkbox to add a third tag filter reverts to the empty search (all results)

Expected Results:
Adding tag to filter by should return increasingly smaller list of results.

Apple support claim they were unable to reproduce. I suspect this is a lie.
