Hello.
The problem Im reporting about also wa a bug in Firefox 1.5.x
But in the Version 2.0 of Firefox it's a frequent occurrence.
I have the problem on some site in the web.
Some example are www.eBay.de (no product-pictures), www.AllTheWeb.com (since Firefox 2.0 no preview prictures by picture search, only links), landgaya.plusboard.de (missing headline banner) .......
Insted of showing picture there are only little Symbols which should reprensent the pictures. Sometimes I can solve the problem by pressing F5 a long a the graphic is loaded correctly. But in most case I have no chance to display the picture right. Sometimes it is also the case that the website isn't displayed at all. When I press F5 or reload the page, FireFox will show it finally.
I hope you can solve the problem quickly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
You don't need to configure anything.
Just type in one of the URLs I reported and load the page.
Actual Results:
In most case the picture are displayed a symbols, but not a the picture themselfe. Try to use F5 to reload the page and sometimes it will work fine, but sometimes you still have the problem.

Expected Results:
FireFox should display picture instead of showing link or little symbol represnting that the file (picture) supposed to be missing. But if I try the Internet Explorer all the site are working fine.
