SyntaxError thrown during querySelector doesn't provide additional information about why it wa thrown (selector and node)
I don't know exactly what is going on here so please rename once it's investigated.

STR:
* Clone my fathom REPL test: https://github.com/mcomella/fathom-repl
* `git checkout 2786cf70bb8cd2afb986ac00478b6ced34e25d31` (this probably work with all revisions, but just to be safe)
* `npm install && npm run build && open public/repl.html` (`open` assumes OS X)
* Open the browser console
* Enter the following into the console:

var titleFinder = ruleset(
// Give any title tag a score of 1, and tag it a title-ish:
rule(dom("title"), node => [{score: 1, flavor: 'titley'}]),

// Give any OpenGraph meta tag a score of 2, and tag it a title-ish a well:
rule(dom("meta[og:title]"), node => [{score: 2, flavor: 'titley'}]),

// Take all title-ish things, and punish them if they contain
// navigational claptrap like colon or dashes:
rule(flavor("titley"), node => [{score: containsColonsOrDashes(node.element) ? .5 : 1}])
);

* Enter the following into the console: `titleFinder.score(document)`.
