This happens to Mozilla Firefox under Windows only. When you don't have Gothic language installed, a dropdown which ha a Gothic line in it will be resized and have a height of three or more time of normal. When you choose the Gothic option from the dropdown, you will notice there is a lot of white space above and below the text.

This only happens with Gothic text. For other languages, no matter you have them installed or not, this won't happen. Also, this doesn't happen for normal text; only dropdowns are affected (as far a I've noticed).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox on a Win XP machine, but don't install any language other than English.
1. Go to the URL I specified above, a an example.
2. Watch the dropdown on the top right!
3. Scroll to the top of the dropdown and choose the 4th item (the one in Gothic). Watch the white space above and below the text when the option is selected.
Actual Results:
As I said, the dropdown's height is augmented.

Expected Results:
A normal height dropdown :)
