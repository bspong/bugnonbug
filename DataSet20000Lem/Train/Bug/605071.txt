When scroll down/up the pages, often suddenly the text becomes totally non-legible / unreadable; text line move one on top or the other, font are displayed partially, image have (or partially made up of) line of even square block ('carree') which partially ruin the image displayed. This doesn't happen when I.Explorer is used.
The problem disappears when the page is either refreshed (F5) or scrolled up or down (outside the visible area of the screen) and brought back again into the view, where the page get re-drawn and that fix the problem until another part of the document/page get corrupted.
I suspect compatibility with a latest Professional ATI's Workstation 3D FirePro model# 8800 video card.
