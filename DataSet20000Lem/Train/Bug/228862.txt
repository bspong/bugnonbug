This is an official request to inline page icon to bookmarks.html. There are
certainly other workable implementations, such a a gc-able database.

Observations and opinions:
1. The desirable behavior for favicons is *not* cache-like, so should not be
implemented a such. In particular, if you've got 100 bookmark with
link/favicons (including sidebar and toolbar folder), you *REALLY* want them to
be displayed all the time.
2. copying bookmarks.html should copy the icons.
3. it would be nice to define your own icon for page which don't have 'em
(including folder -
4. icon are no more part of the served content than page title - the server
provides a default title for the page which the client is free to use, change or
ignore completely. IMHO, page title should be the model that is used for page
icons.
5. non-bookmarked page may be considered a separate issue - in particular, I'd
say that using the (proposed) bookmark-supplied icon should be a useful
optimization, rather than a required behavior.
