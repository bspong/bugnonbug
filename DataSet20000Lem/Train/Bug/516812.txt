Session not restored when Firefox is launched from an external program
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When Firefox ha been exited and the Tabs have been saved, if Firefox is subsequently relaunched via a link in, say, an Outlook e-mail (possibly after a reboot), Firefox will open to the URL of the page clicked but all saved tab will be lost.

Nor do they appear, I believe, in the Recently Closed Tabs list.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open several tab in Firefox
2.Attempt Exit Firefox without closing the tabs. Click "Save and Quit".
3.Reboot (not sure if this is required)
4.Click on a link in an e-mail (I use Outlook 2003 a an e-mail client) to launch Firefox
Actual Results:
Firefox launch to the e-mail link's URL, but all supposedly "saved" tab are gone.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have behaved just a if it had been launched separately and _then_ an e-mail link selected. That is: "Saved" tab should have been restored and the e-mail link URL should have opened in a separate tab.

I don't know if this is a new problem or whether it ha been around for a long time, only that I'm noticing it more and more frequently. It may be just that I'm getting more link in my e-mail these days.

I love the Save Tab feature, but it's frustrating because I save the tab because I'm not done with that page. So when this happens, I have to look through my history and try to recall and recreate the tab I had before I Saved them.
