Whenever I close my browser, it forgets any login information I have provided
for any site (using the "save my password" option on each site). I have tried it on google, Wall Street Journal, and other sites. I close the window, it requires me to re-login to each site. Across the same browsing session, it stay logged in fine. I recently upgraded from FF2 and this bug did not start until after about 24 hour of use. Strange, huh?

Accept cooky - yes (no exceptions)
Accept third party cooky - yes
Keep until - they expire

Always clear my private data when I close firefox - no
Ask me before clearing private data - yes

After I reopen FF3, when I look at saved cooky they are shown, but they just don't seem to work.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a website and "remember my login info"
2. Close the browser
3. Try to go back to the website you logged into

Actual Results:
Websites requires login info again

Expected Results:
Should stay logged in (since I've told it to)
Sorry, I should have specified that.

Similar to bug #434226, with several difference (24 hour delay before bug observed, cooky are not wiped out when FF3 is closed.)
