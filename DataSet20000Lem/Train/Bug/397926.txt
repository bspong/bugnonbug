Using a scripted history.go(); command to navigate back to a page in FireFox doe not seem to function properly. Specifically, the result of using 'back' doe work and the expectation is that history.go() function the same a 'back' in term of repopulating page state and other thing (such a 'viewsource').

****** WHEN YOU GET BACK TO THE FIRST WEBPAGE... *******

When you get back to the first page by pressing 'BACK' or using 'history.back();' everything seems to be pretty good. BUT when you get back to this page using history.go(-2); then FireFox ha some very interesting problems!

If you were using history.go(-2); in IE... you should see:

- The text you typed is still in the second field.
- The text entered by the onbeforeunload event is still in the 3rd field.
- Selecting 'ViewSource' from the menu show the proper source code for this page.
- The Persisted field is left blank (because Microsoft doe not support the onpageshow event - which is OK)

If you were using FireFox you INCORRECTLY see:

- The text you typed is NOLONGER in the second field!
- The text entered by the onbeforeunload event is NOLONGER in the 3rd field!
- Selecting 'ViewSource' from the menu show THE WRONG SOURCE CODE for this page!!!
- The Persisted field is FALSE (is should be TRUE)

Another observation, event.persisted seems to always yeild a 'FALSE' (in field #3)
even when using 'back'. Maybe I am using it incorrectly?
