Cross Frame display problem
The JavaScript statement below only work once.
top.[frame name].document.location.href = [some URL]
For example, if this statement is used with www.cnn.com and then
www.mlxchange.com, the target frame change to www.cnn.com but not to
www.mlxchange.com. No error trap are set a far a I can tell. Note that I
can use the same statement with text file repeatedly. For example, I can use
top.[frame name].document.location.href = [filename].txt repeatedly. Maybe
something to do with the security change mentioned in the release note ?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. write a JavaScript function that includes code like the example in the detail
2. call the funtion with www.cnn.com, the frame will change
3. call the same function with www.mlxchange.com, the frame won't change

Actual Results:
The step above were part of a program that I had written before. Note that it
work with IE and Netscape.

Expected Results:
top.[frame name].document.location.href = [some URL] should work more than once
