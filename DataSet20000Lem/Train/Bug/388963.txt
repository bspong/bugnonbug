CookieSafe and NoScript should be part of the core Firefox product
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.4 (Ubuntu-feisty)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.4 (Ubuntu-feisty)

I think that the combination of the CookieSafe and NoScript extension is exactly how cookie and script security should work in Firefox:

* No script and no cooky by default.

* If I want to allow cooky for a site, I go to the site, and it's two click (and no typing!) to allow cooky for that site, and that site only.

* If a site need JavaScript, again it's two click to enable script for that site, and only that site.

The default when Firefox is installed could be "cookies for everyone / script for everyone" to make advertiser and newbie happy. Then a couple of checkboxes marked something like "Restrict cooky to site you trust" and "Restrict JavaScript to site you trust" could switch to secure mode and turn on the UI control equivalent to NoScript and CookieSafe.

Reproducible: Didn't try




I wrote up some <a href="http://meta.ath0.com/2007/02/02/firefox-hint/">notes</a> on NoScript and CookieSafe on my web site for anyone who doesn't know how they work.
