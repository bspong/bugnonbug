Flash randomly load when displayed in an iFrame

Flash is randomly not loading/displaying. Usually the first time I hit the page it shows, but if I open a new tab and go to it the flash doe not load. When I view the source I can see the flash code there, but the movie is not loading. The flash right-click menu doesn't even show when I right click the area it should be in. I'm using SWFObject to embed the flash, but I've also tried just straight HTML object/embed code. This issue is also occuring in Flock. I am using Firefox 1.5.0.7.

You can test this yourself by going here and clicking the "Activate Lightbox" link. The lightbox contains an iFrame which is loading the flash. This is the only situation I have encourted issue with flash in Firefox. NOTE: The flash may load the first few time the page is hit, but usually once the page is opened in a new window or tab it then start to not load.
