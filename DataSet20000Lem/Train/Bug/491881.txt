FireFox fails to queue printing operation when "Selection" is utilized for a table
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.6, Ant.com Toolbar 1.3

When I highlight part of a page that contains a table, go to "Print...", and utilize the "Selection" radio option, nothing is loaded into the printer queue.

Please note, mine is a networked printer; I do not know if that is contributing to this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Highlight portion of page containing tabular data
2. Go to "Print..."
3. Use "Selection" radio option
4. Press OK
Actual Results:
Small alert box pop up telling me it is processing. However, unlike most print operation of length, no status bar or percent done is shown by the box, it simply disappears after a brief moment.

Expected Results:
Status bar should fill to 100%, operation should be entered into the print queue, and document should print.

Again, this over a networked printer; I do not know if that is important.
Also, the website being printed wa secure and requiring of log-in.
