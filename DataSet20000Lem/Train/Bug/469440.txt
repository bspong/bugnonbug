If you write to a window or say append to the window DOM any change should be visible right away but aren't in this test at http://www.webneurons.com/delaybug.htm. A window is opened and written to, then followed by a 3 second programmed delay, and finally a second window is opened and written to. However with Firefox the text written to the first window doe not appear until AFTER the delay and at the same time a the text to the second window appears. SeaMonkey also doe the same.

IE doe not do this, nor doe Netscpe 4.79. For these browser the text is displayed in proper order.

The same problem occurs too if writing several time to the same window with delay between writes. All text always appears right at the end rather than in sequence.

This mean that javascript logging routine don't show output in real time and ruin this important feature of logging.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Please go to http://www.webneurons.com/delaybug.htm
2. Try it with IE, then try it with Firefox.
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox display an empty first window, then after a delay of 3 second display the text "First Window" in the first wiondow and display the second window with the text "Second Window". IE display in the proper sequence.

Expected Results:
Firefox should display the first window with the text "First Window", then after a delay of 3 second display the second window with the text "Second Window". IE display in the proper sequence.

There is something strange going on that cause Firefox to hold all the written information to a window until the very end of the program rather than displaying it a it happens.

I could find no way round this.
