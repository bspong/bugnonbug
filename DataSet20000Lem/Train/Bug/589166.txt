Its sense consists in that that the user go on what or to site and together with them the page of extortioner (usually pornographic maintenance) opens.
On which opening the user did not do inquiry or it ha simply cluck on what that a harmless picture with competently made "virus" text.
At opening of this page all job of a browser (it is impossible to pas under open tabs, is blocked the menu and so on, the browser is not closed regularly) is blocked and this page cannot be closed, browser restart on mean of removal of it process of the dispatcher of problem and fast closing of page help only while that ha not had time to be loaded, otherwise the situation repeat often.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Transition to page with a going in cycle script.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Browser job (it is impossible to pas under open tabs, is blocked the menu and so on, the browser is not closed regularly) is broken browser restart on mean of removal of it process of the dispatcher of problem and fast closing of page help only while that ha not had time to be loaded, otherwise the situation repeat often.

Expected Results:
I the bad programmer, do not know if fairly...
It is probably necessary to give le than the right to scripts, to make possibility of their hot blocking and to exclude cycling possibility. Also it would be desirable that job of the menu of a browser did not depend on open pages.

I would would like to inform on small vulnerability (if it is possible so it to name), a a matter of fact vulnerability it is not but break correct (regular) job of a browser and is very unpleasant phenomenon extorting purchase of paid service at the user to continue job with a browser further (and after all in him the important tab for the user) can be open many.
For skilled or simply resourceful user it is faster an unpleasant situation, and for the novice user which will not guess to restart a browser and quickly to close harmful to the contribution (usually it helps). It without a target situation. At the best it will reinstall a browser or will pas to use of other browser and in the worst will pay to extortioner money if only to clean this page from a porno the maintenance and to renew normal job of a browser.
As far a I know many browser are subject to this not essential, but during too time of the extremely unpleasant vulnerability.
