After a period of browsing the very first tab fails to close, when attemping to
close following error appears in JS console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebProgress.removeProgressListener]"
nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame ::
chrome://global/content/bindings/tabbrowser.xml :: removeTab :: line 839" data: no]

this error appears when trying to close either by using the middle mosue button
or my using right-click "Close Tab".

Also the when simply switching to the problematic tab the following error
appears in JS console:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code:
0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIWebNavigation.canGoBack]" nsresult:
"0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame ::
chrome://browser/content/browser.js :: UpdateBackForwardButtons :: line 115"
data: no]

Also, sometimes when trying to close the problematic tab by using middle click,
when it's *not* in focus, cause the whole tab bar to dissapear, but it
reappears when a new tab is created.

much more rarely the following error is seen in JS console (compared to other
two errors:

Error: CPxPop17 is not defined
