Since latest automatically downloaded upgrade of Firefox, it will not work. It loads, than either freeze and can only be closed by the use of "Force Quit" or re-booting, or it crash and a notice appears asking if I want to report the bug to Apple. I don't. It's not Apple's problem. There is a bug in the latest downloaded upgrade, and Firefox is now unusable untill it's fixed. In the meatime I have switched to Mozilla a my browser, which work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Turn on computer
2.Click on firefox in dock to load browser
3.Firefox load then freezes; rainbow sphere in place of cursor begin to turn; impossible to quit Firefox. Only solution is to use "force quit", but this doesn't always open because cursor doe not reappear, in which case I have to re-boot. If it doesn't freeze, then a soon a I select any program to open, it crash and I get a notice saying it ha unexpectedly quit and asking if I want to report it to Apple.

Actual Results:
Same a above.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have functioned normally.

This is only since the most recent automatically downloaded upgrade of Firefox, just a few day ago. Since then, it is unusable. I have switched to Mozilla a my browser, which work normally.
