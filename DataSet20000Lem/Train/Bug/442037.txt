When viewing an image greater than the size of the current window, it is automatically resized to fit. In this situation, pressing the keyboard shortcut for zoom in/out (ctrl+plus, ctrl+minus, respectively) doe not work a user would expect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Ensure your FF window is smaller than you test image
2. Open a large image - see example URL
3. Observe that the image is resized to fit your window
4. Press ctrl+plus five time
5. Observe that the image get larger
6. Press ctrl+minus with the intention of zooming out slightly
Actual Results:
7. The image jump back to about 90% of it original (fitted) size

Expected Results:
7. The image is reduced in size slightly, to a size equivalent to having pressed ctrl+plus exactly four time in step 4
i.e. pressing ctrl+minus should be the exact opposite of pressing ctrl+plus (as it is when zooming entire HTML pages)

- this only affect image which are automatically resized to fit the window
- this problem appears not to happen when you use the View->Zoom menu instead of the keyboard, which strike me a a little strange
