The bug is located at the moment to open the URL described above.

When I try to access to URL www.notebookcba.com.ar, the browser just show the indicator of process but nothing happens. Finally is necessary that kill the process and restart the browser.

Notice that when I try to access to the same URL using another "default" browser, just load a few seconds, and show me a empty web - even say "Ready" in the status bar -, that's the reason because I report the issue, maybe is related with some webpage's detail that Firefox couldn't handle.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to access to the URL www.notebookcba.com.ar.
2. Notice that the browser crash when try to open that webpage.
Actual Results:
The browser crash and the only way to use it, is restarting it (killing the process and open again).

Expected Results:
Just should open a empty web like I see in another browsers.

I don't know that is related, but i'm behing a proxy to web access, however i try with different browser from the same host.
