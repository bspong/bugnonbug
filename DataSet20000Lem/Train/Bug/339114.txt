To quickly print several page from the shown website, I open them up in several tabs.

So that I don't have to constantly load Adobe Reader, I keep that open on the second tab (first tab being the webpage and every other being another link)

When I have about 15 tab open with Adobe files, I will quickly print them all, but in the printer, in place of one sheet, will be the first Adobe file (second tab).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up several Adobe Acrobat file in consecutive tabs.
2. Print all the tab one after another very quickly.


Actual Results:
One sheet will randomly be the first tab contents.

Expected Results:
Printed the file that wa actually in the tab.

I'm in an office setting over a network. The printer I am printing printing to is the Xerox Document Centre 460.

I'll also add that the printer also stopped responding to print job from FireFox, but would work in IE. It would even say "1 document pending" in the tray, but no print job would come through.
