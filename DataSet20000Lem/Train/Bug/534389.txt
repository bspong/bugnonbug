When Firefox is closed, and tab are saved:

If one or more tab are web page protected by a htaccess password, Firefox complains "This is embarrassing" and say it had trouble restoring one or more sessions. It asks to close the one you think may be the problem.
By ignoring/trying again, it seems to work the next time, but this is quite annoying to have an alert pop up nearly every time I open the browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open multiple tab
2. at least one tab should be a web page protected by an htaccess password
3. provide htaccess credential
4. close the browser and select the option that save tab for next time the browser is opened
5. open Firefox
Actual Results:
The alert that say "this is embarrassing" pop up saying it had trouble recovering one or more sessions.

Expected Results:
tab all open and the htaccess prompt should pop up for each different site that is protected. Once entering credential the site should load a they normally would.
