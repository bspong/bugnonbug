Sometimes, when going to webpage that I have a saved password for, the software security device pop up asking for my master password. I click cancel for legitimate reason (the why isn't relevant) and the dialog appears again, asking for my password. A related issue, alough this may not be a bug, is that when I go to a website, it will prompt me for a password when the website first loads, then again when I click the password field.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website where you have a saved password (I tried mail.google.com)
2. Prompt will appear asking for master password.
3. Click Cancel
Actual Results:
On the two run I tried this, the first problem outlined in my summary would not occur, but the second one did (when I chose a username from the username drop down menu and then clicked the password field).

Expected Results:
When clicking Cancel, the dialog will re-prompt you.

Checking the Error Console on the advice of a Mozilla Developer friend, I received one of the exact same error below for each time I clicked cancel.
