Command line url open in new window if you miss out "http://"

From the command shell, if you run "firefox http://www.mozilla.org", it open
that url. "firefox -new" will open a new browser window, but there isn't a way
of openning a new window with a specified URL. ("firefox -new
http://www.mozilla.org" doesn't work).

Or is there.... I found this strange behaviour, where if you leave out the
"http://", it open in a new window.

"c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe" http://www.mozilla.org
Opens the page replacing whatever window you had open.

"c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe" www.mozilla.org
Opens in a new window.

Nice quirk - but is this intentional? If so how do you open a https:// site in
a new window?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. "c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe" http://www.mozilla.org
2. "c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe" www.mozilla.org


Actual Results:
Window openned over previous browser window with step 1
Window openned in new window with step 2

Expected Results:
Always open in new window?
