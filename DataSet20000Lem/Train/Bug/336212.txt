Academic scientist are asked to review manuscripts. Each journal ha it own site on the "manuscriptcentral" website. The journal CHEST and the journal American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine send email asking if I will review a manuscript. Firefox allows me to get into the REVIEWER CENTER of "manuscriptcentral" for both of the journals. However, when I click on the word that should provide an upload of the pdf file, Firefox hang up and I am unable to upload. If I switch to Internet Explorer, both journals' pdf file upload quickly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. One must be invited by medical journal to review a manuscript
2. One get a login and password
3. One log into the journal's site
4. One is admitted to the REVIEWER CENTER on Firefox
5. One then attempt to click on html word to upload the pdf file

Actual Results:
pdf file always fails to upload -- Firefox just get hung up in the process.

Expected Results:
pdf did not upload

If Mozilla were to contact the medical journals' IT people, (CHEST and American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine) you might find what is blocking the upload of their material. I have already emailed both journal IT people and told them of this problem.

I wish to continue to use Firefox, because I want to avoid IE. However, I must use IE to actually upload the medical manuscript files. Then I switch back to Firefox.
