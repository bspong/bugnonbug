mozilla-xremote-client "mailto()" return failure, but make Firefox try to launch the mail program

I'm using the 2003-12-06-09-trunk gtk+xft2 Linux build. I also use (well, am
trying to use) Thunderbird 0.4 a my mail program, although Thunderbird doesn't
directly affect this bug.

When Firebird is running and Thunderbird is not,
mozilla-xremote-client "mailto(me@example.com)"
exit with status 3, indicating failure, a it should. However, Firebird still
get the command, and try to launch the system default mail program.

This is particularly bad if the system default mail program is a Thunderbird
wrapper script that contains the above command (xremote || launch a new
thunderbird) -- it lead to an infinite loop creating thunderbird windows!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firebird.
2. mozilla-xremote-client "mailto(me@example.com)"


Actual Results:
Exit status 3, but Firebird launch the mail program.

Expected Results:
Exit status 3, and nothing happens, so the script that called xremote can detect
failure and launch the mail program itself.
