Named anchor get incomplete focus from in-page jump and no focus from out-page jump.

When Firefox jump to a named anchor within the same page, the keyboard focus only partially move to the target. The target is not rendered a having the focus and doe not respond to the enter key. However, pressing tab move the focus to the next item and, after this, shift-tab move the focus back to the original target, where it now responds to the enter key. If the target named anchor is on a different page, the keyboard focus doesn't move to it at all but to the normal first focus item on the page. Internet Explorer work correctly in both circumstances. I first saw this in Firefox three year ago but assumed that it would eventually be fixed. It still exists in version 3.0.7. I have tried using name instead of id and adding tabindex (-1, 0, and 1) to no avail.
Example:
<div class="TaskBar">
<ul>
<li><a id="xzln" href="thumb.html#lnxz" title="To Multi-Level Thumbnails">
Next<img src="loright.gif" alt="" title="" class="LoNav" ></a></li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- End Taskbar -->
<p>
<a href="#xzln" style="text-decoration: none; white-space: nowrap;" >
Next<img src="loright.gif" alt="" title="" class="LoNav" ></a>

Clicking the <a href="#xzln" anchor cause Firefox to shift the display to the <a id="xzln" anchor but the keyboard focus move incompletely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Target is <a id="something" href="somethingElse"
2. Launcher <a href="something"
3. Click on launcher anchor
Actual Results:
After clicking on the launch anchor the target is not rendered a having the focus and doe not respond to pressing Enter. But it doe respond to tab or shift-tab, correctly jumping to the next or previous page element. And once at either of this, reversing (shift-tab after tab or tab after shift-tab) take the focus back to the original target, which now render correctly and responds to Enter. This is the behavior when both the target and launcher are on the same page. If they are on different pages, the target doe not get the focus when the launcher try to jump to it.

Expected Results:
In both in-page and out-page jump to named anchor, the target anchor should immediately be rendered a having the focus and should respond fully a having the focus, i.e. to Enter and not just to tab.

The problem ha existed in Firefox for at least three year and ha never existed in Internet Explorer or Safari. I have tried hard to find a workaround without success.
