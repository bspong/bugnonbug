Firefox 4.0 crash while trying to load the "Bill Pay" page at ingdirect.com

After logging in to https://ingdirect.com/, attempting to visit

Make Payments -> Bill Pay

cause the browser to crash with this error:

firefox: malloc.c:4471: _int_malloc: Assertion `(bck->bk->size & 0x4) == 0' failed.

Disabling all extension and plugins made no difference, nor did creating a fresh Profile and using this to visit the problem site, so it appears to be a glitch in the browser itself. Also, previous version of Firefox, including 3.5.x, 3.6.x are able to render the Bill Pay page without crashing.

Reproducing this bug will require an account at ING Direct, since the problem page can only be reached after logging into their secure account area.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit https://ingdirect.com/
2. Log in with a valid ING user ID and passcode
3. When the main page appears, click "Make Payments" tab at the top
4. Click on the Bill Pay option on the subsequent page

(site display "Hang on while we grab your bill pay information", with a spinner graphic; browser crash a few second later)
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, losing all open window and tabs. If launched from the command line, this error appears--

firefox: malloc.c:4471: _int_malloc: Assertion `(bck->bk->size & 0x4) == 0' failed.

Expected Results:
Load & display ING's Bill Page page.

Default theme. No extension or plugins. x86 Linux (32-bit).
