When entering an invalid URI with keyword.enabled=false, the error page doesn't go into the tab's history
STR:

1) Set keyword.enabled = false
2) Open a new tab and load, say, https://hg.mozilla.org/
3) Type "2600::" into the address bar and hit enter

I'd expect to be able to go Back from the resulting error page, but instead Back is disabled.

If you do this instead:

1) Set keyword.enabled = false
2) Open a new tab and load https://hg.mozilla.org/
3) Click on "mozilla-central"
3) Type "2600::" into the address bar and hit enter

then Back will be enabled, but it'll take you to https://hg.mozilla.org/ (the first page) rather than https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central (the second one). So it look like the error page just replaces the currently-loaded page without interacting with the tab's history at all.

If you enable e10s on a current Nightly then the problem seems to go away (although e10s ha other issue with loading these error pages). I can't test with e10s on the build where this started showing up though, because on those build it refuse to activate for me.

Regression range: between 2014-11-17 and 2014-11-18's nightlies.

I'm not sure which bug regressed it; none of them look particularly likely. Last year's hourly build are of course long gone, so I can't narrow it down any further either.
