Web page won't load after installing videodownloader

OLD AND NEW BUGS:
I like a previous user listed above received the same error message when using videodownloader on youtube: "Fatal error: Call to undefined function: youtube_get() in/home/.decca/javimoya/videodownloader.net/vd/test.php on line 56"

After having this problem, I also found that I can't get to the videoloader web page that provides an online videodownloader to use if you didn't want to download the application into your toolbar. I get the following error message: "Page cannot be found
The page you are looking for might have been removed, had it name changed, or is temporarily unavailable.
Please try the following:
* If you typed the page address in the Address bar, make sure that it is spelled correctly.
* Open the javimoya.com home page, and then look for link to the information you want.
* Click the Back button to try another link.
Problem: Unknown Error -1."
This happens regardless of which approach I take to link to this web page:
http://javimoya.com/blog/youtube_en.php
http://javimoya.com/
videodownloader.net/

I've already tried clearing cookies, history, and cache. In XP, I also tried disc cleanup utility and system restore. After system restore, firefox browser stopped working-it wouldn't automatically start with my earthlink total access a it usually did, and it wouldn't start when I clicked it's icon. After uninstalling and reinstalling firefox, the videodownloader toolbars were gone but I still couldn't access the videodownloader web page: http://javimoya.com/

How can I fix this?
