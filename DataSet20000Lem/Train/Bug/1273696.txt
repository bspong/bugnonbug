This is a great new feature, but the addition of the descriptive text plus button ha been done in such a way a to make the error page a a whole difficult to use.

The new text appears directly below the error in a way that doe not differentiate the problem from the solution.

Additionally, the user is now being presented with four possible UI interaction upon hitting this error: two buttons, one hyperlink and one checkbox. Both button reload the page, the link take them to a lengthy help page, and the checkbox appears - to the user - to do nothing.

I know that this page is the result of much deliberation, but the design might be a bit fragile to introduce this new functionality in the way it exists now.

My suggestions:

* If both button reload the page ("Try again" and "Restore default settings"), consider combining them into one button instead.
* The "learn more" link is no longer contextually relevant. It could be moved back up to the area directly below the two bulleted items, since it directly describes the error and not the new feature.
* The two sentence starting with "It look like your network security setting ..." might be redundant, since we have already detected this condition and present a button. This could be shortened.
