Hello Dave,

There is nothing in Canvas that would cause Mozilla to fail opening the Help
file. We make a generic call to the browser which is all that's necessary for
Explorer on Windows or Mac and Safari on the Mac. We can notify Mozilla's
developers. But I believe this will need to be addressed on their end.

A work-around of creating a Shortcut to the Help file should launch Mozilla.

Thank you for your interest in Canvas,

The only thing that happens when I strike F1 or try Help>Electronic Manual is a
momentary hour glass. After that . nothing. I have uninstalled and
re-installed with the ''Complete'' install option.


My OS is WinXP Professional.
My browser is Mozilla Firebird.
My version of Canvas 9 is Standard.
I have installed Build 689.

My Canvas 9 license number is w9181-aab-eqlvh-uxtnkj

Hopefully you have an easy fix for this problem.

3.

Actual Results:
Nothing happens

Opened the file \Program Files\Deneba\Canvas 9\Help\help.html

I don't know whether the bug is in Canvas9 or in Firebird. As you can see from
the correspondence above the Canvas folk disclaim responsibility.
