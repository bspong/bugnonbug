Download destination prompt doesn't move to the front after picking "ok" from the "you have chosen to open a file" prompt box. The download destination prompt should be highlighted and sent to the front by default. The prompt briefly move to the front, with the "Save" button highlighted in blue, but then the browser window immediately move back to the front. This cause some confusion, because pressing "enter" upon seeing the blue highlighted "save" button from the download destination prompt will cause firefox to launch another "you have chosen to open a file" from the highlighted link on the browser page...an infinite loop of "you have chosen to open a file" prompts.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click a link to a file, such a a .doc file in firefox.
2.Press enter when the "you have chosen to open a file" prompt appears (which selects the highlighted "ok" button
3.Press enter again, and another "you have chosen to open a file" prompt appears, instead of firefox confirming the original download destination that is already highlighted.

Must have preference set to have firefox prompt for download location at every download.
Actual Results:
An infinite loop of "you have chosen to open a file" prompt boxes.

Expected Results:
Saved the file at the chosen/last used destination.
