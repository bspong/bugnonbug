This is tested on 19-Feb Trunk on W2K.

After surfing for 1-1.5 hour i encountered a problem where a if i used middle
button smooth scroll and a soon a i let go of the mouse button i would be
taken to any random site in my history list.
So to see if i could replicate the problem i used the X in the upper right part
to close Firefox down, no error occured.

I restart Firefox , no error again.

And i still had the random reloading of my current page to the history page
(same page most often a before).
Now i close Firefox with the X again and go check Taskmanager and the
Firefox.exe had not been shut down.

After shutting down the exe file manually the erratic page loading disapeared.

This may be two different error , but they occured together so i keep them here
a one a well for now.
So far i have encountered this problem 3 times.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Surf for a few minute with multiple tabs.
2.Hold down middle key and smooth scroll to bottom of current page.
3.Let middle key up a if you were done scrolling once you reach the bottom.
4.If the error occurs the page should now reload
5.Close Firefox with the X in the upper right corner.
6.Check Taskmanager.
7.Firefox.exe is still visible in the process list.

Actual Results:
1.Current page is reloaded to a page from history
2.Firefox isn't shut down completely.

Expected Results:
1. Not reload the page when middle mouse smooth scrolling is used
2. Exit the Firefox.exe correctly when the X is used to shutdown the application.
