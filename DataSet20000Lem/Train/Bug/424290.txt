While the autocomplete location bar will correctly show ftp address with usernames, when you select one, the username is left out. For example, let's say that I initially went to a site at ftp://username@test.com (Firefox asks for my password after I have typed the url).

The next time I want to go to that ftp address, I start typing ftp:// and the autocomplete option "ftp://username@test.com" will show up in the list underneath the location bar. When that option is selected though, the url change to "ftp://test.com" and Firefox will try to log into the FTP server a anonymous.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to an FTP site that requires a username.
2. Leave that site
3. Type a couple letter of the ftp server and select the autocomplete option

Actual Results:
Firefox will try to log into the FTP server a anonymous

Expected Results:
Firefox will ask for the password of the username and log into the FTP server with the shown username in the location bar.
