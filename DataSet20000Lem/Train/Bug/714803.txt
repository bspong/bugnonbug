Firefox doe not range check for valid window coordinate at session restore
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 2011092900

Steps to reproduce:

This bug ha happened several time to me, on various Firefox version and on Windows, Linux and FreeBSD.

Had Firefox open with many tabs, lot of them with Flash content (animations, videos).
Played a youtube video in fullscreen and the bug appeared.



Actual results:

Flash plugin crashed.
When restarting Firefox, browser window(s) were visible for a short moment, then disappearing, being placed outside of the screen. I confirmed by window spy program (forgot which one) on Windows and FvwmIdent on Linux).
These window were accessible only by maximizing via task bar.
When trying to resize, they "disappeared".
This bug appeared several time over the years, on Windows and Linux machines.

As this particular session wa a big one with several browser window and tab open that I didn't want to delete, I looked at sessionstore.js and found the following entries:

,"width":1293,"height":972,"screenX":-4662,"screenY":0,"sizemode":"normal",
,"screenX":6384,"screenY":-127,"sizemode":"normal",

After fixing the negative and out-of-range numbers, Firefox displayed the window correctly at restart.

Expected results:

Firefox should do a simple range checking for valid screen coordinate before moving the window to the location stored in sessionstore.js after creating them.

By the way, this would avoid the same problem which occurs when the screen resolution is reduced and the Firefox window would be off-screen at the new, lower screen resolution.
