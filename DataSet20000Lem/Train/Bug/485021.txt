Apparently browser is redrawing background earlier than it ought to be? Problem is better described below.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use javascript to swap the bottom layer background picture. Have a fully opaque layer covering it.
Actual Results:
Top div background picture when changing background picture on bottom div.

There are two divs, cs positioned one on top of the other. To produce a fade-in effect, a script change the opacity of the top layer. When the top layer get to 100% opacity, the bottom background picture is changed to the same picture that is on the top. Both divs go blank while the picture is switching.


Expected Results:
I expect the opaque top div to cover the changeover of the bottom div.

This is *not* a timing issue, it happens *every* time no matter what the timeout settings.
