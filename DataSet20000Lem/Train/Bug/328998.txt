Reproducible: Always

You need Java installed.
Java 1.4.2 or 1.5.x will do. it happens with either.
You also need the "Java 3D" plugin. Available from the site in question http://www.downloadjava3d.com, or directly from the "java3d project" pages.

OR

Repeat, but this time open the URL in different windows.


Actual Results:
_All_ instance of Firefox on the desktop crash.


Expected Results:
Should render a 3d applet in both windows, or render successfully in the first and fail gracefully in the second.

I think this is a critical bug because this could be used maliciously in 'tiny' applet to crash all instance of Firefox that are running.

I'm not yet sure if this bug could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
I will attach a stack trace and any dump file that I can.
