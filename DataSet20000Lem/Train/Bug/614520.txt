It is not a crash, it is very unpleasant problem. I saw this problem 3-4 times, but can't generate for special.
My browser save history of resent tabs. Often I work in browser all day long without restart session. Open and close many website and many cm of this websites. During editing site in cms, many target window open by wisiwyg, uploads files. Of course at the end of the day I close all this new window and in history must save only two-three tabs.
But on restarting browser I see all new windows(not only my tab from history of tabs),which were opened in resent session - it can be 30-50 windows.
I can't understand, what condition born this problem. May be it is great time of the session of browser or it is feature of whis new window
