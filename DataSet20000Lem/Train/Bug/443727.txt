Can't start Firefox 3.0: looped fatal error
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.15) Gecko/20080625 Ubuntu/7.10 (gutsy) Firefox/2.0.0.15
Build Identifier: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.0&os=linux&lang=en-US

I'm running Gutsy.
I installed Firefox 3 (final release) by downloading it from mozilla and it ran fine for a couple of days, but now whenever I try to open it crash with this error:
Error: in guard: symbol required but got: Error: fatal: looped fatal error

I think it may have had to do with the "Add Bookmark Here" extension, which I installed the last time before it started crashing.

I deleted the directory containing firefox (i.e. ~/firefox), then unzipped a fresh copy from mozilla. I tried deleting the ~/.mozilla folder. I also opened the old version of Firefox 2 (which run ok) and uninstalled "Add Bookmark Here". None of these thing have worked though, I still can't run Firefox 3.


I deleted .mozilla then created a new profile using the command firefox -p.
So now Firefox 2 had no extension installed. I also now have Firefox 3 beta 4 (out of the repository) and that work fine too.
But the full release of Firefox 3 from the mozilla site doe not work - it give me the fatal loop error.

I have tried following the instruction on ubuntuzilla but these result in the same error message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download Firefox for Linux
2. Extract archive
3. Try running firefox
Actual Results:
Crashes immediately with:
Error: in guard: symbol required but got: Error: fatal: looped fatal error

Expected Results:
Start
