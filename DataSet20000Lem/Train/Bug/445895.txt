The example I gave is a page that is trying to load an active x control, but it also happens reliably on Blackboard when I go into anything editable. It doesn't seem to like me to be able to enter data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to joelrosenberg.com
2. Click on "Joshua Fund" (in list of button on left side)

Actual Results:
Firefox close and give me a message that say it ha encountered a problem & ha to close. I also get a message in my system tray that say that Windows DEP ha closed this program.

Expected Results:
I should be able to view the page. It work ok in IE. It worked ok in Firefox 2.
