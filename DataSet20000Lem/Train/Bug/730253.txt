Slow script dialog on Firefox startup open in top left corner and leaf behind unclosable gray box

Screenshot of the strange gray box

STR:

1) Open Firefox at the same time a a bunch of other program
2) Have chrome/add-on code trip over the 'slow script' dialog.

AR:
A slow script dialog is shown on the top left corner of the screen, under the title bar of the appearing Firefox window. Moving the window doesn't move the dialog. Clicking 'continue' in the dialog leaf behind a strange gray box (see attachment).

The box doesn't go away, seems able to take focus if you click it but ha no visible/findable way of interacting with it, doesn't show up in exposé, doesn't stay with the window if you move the window, and just continuously sits in the top left corner obscuring whatever is underneath it, including other applications. Quitting Firefox make it go away.

ER:
There's several options:
1) don't show a dialog, just continue
2) show a dialog attached to the main window once that is open (probably impossible a UI JS is single-threaded)
3) show the dialog but fix this stupid gray box, whatever it is.

Filed this in Firefox/Untriaged a I'm not sure which core component is to blame here, and/or how best to fix it. Input wanted?
