Task manager report Firefox using on average >200,000k memory, multiple tab (3-4+) raise memory usage to >300,000k, cause browser to temporarily (1-3 minutes) "freeze" on loading new page. On "freezing" Firefox's CPU usage spike to over 85% causing the system to become extremely slow, or stop responding altogether. during period when Firefox is frozen, cursor change to "working" (hourglass) while hovering over page, but change to "working in background" (normal cursor w/ hourglass) when hovering over the window's top bar (where %pagename% - Mozilla Firefox is displayed at left). The maximize/restore down button is also disabled during these occurrences. task manager will not report Firefox a "not responding" unless the main window area is clicked on during the "freezes" in which case the browser must be stopped by ending the process "Firefox.exe"

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open 4+ tab in same browser window
2.direct each tab to different website
3.open more tab a necessary, pointing each to a new URL
Actual Results:
browser became unstable- freezing, and process needed to be terminated in some cases.

Expected Results:
Page loading would be understandably slower, due to higher network activity, but, a Firefox is a local application, it should have continued to run normally.
