I have tried this both on a Vista SP1 pc and an XP SP2 pc and find I get the same error.
In my network I am running Checkpoint Secureplatform NGX r65 enforcement modules. The build of these is HFA_02, Hotfix 602
When I browse them via https://10.10.10.10:444 (for example) I get a pop up message saying
'Cannot Connect to server.
Make sure the device is up and running, and that you area llowed to login from this machine'
If I press ok then the Secureplatform webpage load but if I try and log in I get the message
'Cannot login.
Make sure the device is up and running, and that you area llowed to login from this machine'
