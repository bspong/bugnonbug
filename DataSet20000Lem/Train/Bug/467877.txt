I suspect Firefox of clearing private data on exit even though this is unchecked and not desired.

On the above website, we offer free tarot readings. To get them, the visitor must fill out a form to give u their email info. To get to this form, the first time visitor click on "Free Tarot Readings." Once this info is filled out, free reading are accessed. However, if Firefox is closed and then reopened, the same visitor returning to our website will find that the website asks them for their email info AGAIN, even though Clear Private Data On Exit is unchecked! I am not technical but our web programmer say this is a Firefox issue from the latest builds. I hope you can fix it. This problem doe not exist if someone access our website with Safari or Explorer.
