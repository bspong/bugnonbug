Location bar autocomplete leaf ">>" if there is a better autocomplete result
Since the location bar autocomplete feature is enabled by default, I find myself sometimes having to fight with it to get the URL I started typing and not the browser suggestion. Sure, I can disable this feature, but I guess that the normal user won't do it ever, and I prefer to see this problem fixed rather to workaround it by myself.

When I type in the URL bar, I know what I meant to type. When I want to go to the specified URL and my browser suggests me something longer, I press on the spacebar, which doe remove the suggestion a it is also the selection, but add the space character. Most of the time it is enough, and I get to the right destination.

Sometimes, though, the browser insists that I am wrong, and reminds me that it ha better suggestion. This end up with the ">>" string after my typed location and the suggestion the browser has. Since I am typing fast and not always watching carefully the location bar, this end up by requesting a page such a "http://example.net/foo >> http://example.net/foo/bar/index.html", which will return HTTP 404 error a there is no such resource on the server.

Steps to reproduce:
a. Start by typing the address of one of your favorite sites.
b. When the browser suggest to type a longer address and you prefer to go to the top level or higher level folder, press the spacebar.
c. You will end up with something like "http://mozilla.org.il/board/viewtopic.php? >> mozilla.org.il/board/viewtopic.php?t=10916" and the browser will request the page "http://mozilla.org.il/board/viewtopic.php?%20%20%3E%3E%20mozilla.org.il/board/viewtopic.php?t=10916".

Expected result:
I'd prefer the spacebar key to paste a space character without the suggestion with ">>". As far a I know, there should never be any use for ">>" in suggested URL so it is unnecessary. Currently the only way to get the right result is to type the delete key, which doe remove the selection without placing the suggestion, but is more difficult to locate this key by fast blind-typing.

(This bug is very similar to bug 348844, but is about the location bar autocomplete rather than the email autocomplete, both sharing the same widget control)
