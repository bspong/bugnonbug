documentation of known issue for firefox 3.5 linux release fails to mention known critical bug that these version hang on startup waiting on a futex when libsafe ( and possibly other library ) are preloaded.
note that this is a serious documentation flaw, since it took me a lot of effort to figure out why the new version hung on startup, and then to search bug report to get a hint of what might be causing the problem, and then to test by removing libsafe from my preloads.
note that not only must it be removed from LD_PRELOAD, but also from /etc/ld.so.preload.
a simple statement in the release note warning user about this would have saved me a bunch of trouble.
a an aside on the actual problem, there appear to have been multiple bug reporting variations, all of which were marked a duplicate of some other bug, which ha lot of comment debating it and how or whether to fix it.
that bug is serious, and appears to be due to a basic design flaw.

Reproducible: Always
