Session Restore (and Undo-Close-Tab) restores bug page with "Reset Assignee to default" and "Reset QA Contact to default" checked
STR:
0. Be logged into bugzilla (and have editbugs)
1. Have a bugzilla.mozilla.org bug page open. (e.g. this one)
2. Quit Firefox, saving your session if prompted.
3. Start firefox (restoring your session)
(Note: I have "restore session" set to happen automatically in the Firefox preferences; not sure if this is required to trigger the bug.)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
When the bug page come back up, it's got the Assignee & QA Contact field both a editable textfields (as if you'd hit the "edit" link next to them), and the "Reset Assignee to default" and "Reset QA Contact to default" box are both checked.

This bit me earlier today -- I opened a bug page, then restarted firefox, and then added someone to the CC list for the bug -- but I inadvertantly cleared the bug assignee in the process.

This bug happens 100% for me on today's nightly, but never happens with yesterday's nightly. (performing the full STR with one nightly or the other)
Regression range is:

which includes some session restore patches. CC'ing zpao, who wrote or reviewed all of those patches, in the hope that he can tell which might have broken this.

P.S. edmorley say he hit this in today's nightly, too, in Win7 wow64
