Screencast showing the issue

Reproducible on:
latest Firefox 31 Beta 7 (Build ID: 20140703154127): Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0

latest Nightly (Build ID: 20140704030208): Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0

STR:
1. Launch Firefox.
2. Navigate to http://mixedpuppy.github.io/socialapi-demo/ and activate the social service.
3. Make the browser half screen (use the sticky edge from left or right).
4. Open ~15 chat panel (until the cloud icon appears).
5. Minimize all chat panels.
6. Make the browser full screen (use the sticky edge from UP)
7. Close chat panels.

The issue is intermittent so if it doe not trigger from first try please toggle between Half and Full screen and open/minimize/close panels.

Expected results:
The panel close and the cloud icon disappears after closing enough of them.

Actual results:
The icon remains on screen until browser restart.

Notes:
1. I wa able to reproduce it only on Ubuntu.
2. It`s an intermittent issue.
