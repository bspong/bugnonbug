The processor use by firefox seems to increase over time. This is most notable when visiting page like gmail where content is loaded after the initial page load. I've also noticed that I can consistently increase the processor use by closing a tab while something in a page is loading (while Gmail is refreshing, during a youtube video, etc). This processor use doe not go down after closing the main browser window and letting it sit idle for hour with no download or other browser activity. Tested and reproducible on multiple OS X machine a a new install, in safe mode, and with extensions.

By restarting firefox, the processor use go back to normal, but will climb up again over the course of a few hour browsing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load page with dynamic content (like gmail, youtube, hulu, devianart, or the bugzilla ticket submission.)
2. While new content is loading or the page is otherwise "active," close the tab.
3. Repeat multiple time to increase processor use more and more.
Actual Results:
Up to 90% processor use, not going down even when firefox is closed.

Expected Results:
Shouldn't use the processor while idle
