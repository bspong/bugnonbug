When upgrading newer build, launching with option '-p "profile name"' open wrong page if profile name contains whitespace
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; ja-JP; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040906 Firefox/1.0 PR (NOT FINAL)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; ja-JP; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040906 Firefox/1.0 PR (NOT FINAL)

A Japanese friend always launch Firefox from shortcut, with commandline option
'-p "profile name"'. He/She creates new profile named '1.0 PR', with this
profile, Firefox sometimes open wrong page http://www.prnewswire.com/.

I can reproduce this problem, so I report to bugzilla.

We found 'sometimes' is changing Firefox build to another one. With same build I
cannot get this problem, but _first time_ with newer build I can get this.

In statusbar, Firefox access to www.google.com. This page seems to be opened
by Google's feeling lucky. The top result of searching 'PR' is
http://www.prnewswire.com/.


I think this is caused by 'extensions/themes compatibility checking system'. I
modified buildID in compatibility.ini to older one, I can get this problem even
if I use same build.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create new profile named '1.0 PR'.
2.Launch Firefox with this profile.
3.Upgrade Firefox to newer build.
4.Launch Firefox with commandline option '-p "1.0 PR"'. Don't forget double quotes.
Actual Results:
Firefox open http://www.prnewswire.com/.

Expected Results:
Homepage(s) should be shown.
