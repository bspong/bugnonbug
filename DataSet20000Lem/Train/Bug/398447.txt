bookmark keywords should have a default string

if I create a bookmark of http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=&btnG=Search+News&q=%s with a keyword of "news", then it's great if I want to search for news on a particular subject.

But if I want to get the main news page with the various headlines, I'd need a separate bookmark, because simply typing "news" give me http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=&btnG=Search+News&q=%s which give me a page that find all the story with a "s".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. bookmark http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=&btnG=Search+News&q=%s with keyword "news"
2. type news at the url bar and hit enter.
3. discover a list of story that include an "s" a a distinct unit.


Expected Results:
The easiest thing to do is to omit the "%s". In this case that would have given me "http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&ned=&btnG=Search+News&q=" which actually works.

I would personally prefer a 2 URL system, 1 for when a string is provided, and 1 for when it isn't. If you don't want to change the GUI, there's probably something clever that could be done so that if you enter a standard URL it work a above, but if you do some fancy thing ff know what to translate the keyword to when there is no string.

To try to explain that better:
1) If you give a bookmark a standard URL "http://foo.com?q=%s", and with a keyword "bob", then "bob bar" becomes "http://foo.com?q=bar" and "bob" becomes "http://foo.com?q="

2) But (as I think that you can't have a space in a URL) if you change that bookmark's URL to "http://foo.com?q=%s http://foo.com" (note the space) then "bob bar" becomes "http://foo.com?q=bar" and "bob" becomes "http://foo.com".

Does that make sense?

Thank you very much. Be well.
