Intermittent freezing of Firefox 3.6.6 Vista 32 SP2. Must use task manager to force quit the application in order to use software. It will immediately relaunc the application and run fine for 5 sec to 5 hours, but will hang. Acts like a memory leak, but could be one of the plug-in added on causing issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. simply open the application and leave it open.
2. Make sure Java, Adobe and all other plug in are loaded into system
3.very intermittent, but happens daily
Actual Results:
this is an intermittent problem that manifested itself in 3.6.4 and continues in 3.6.6. It is possible the Win 7 code is creating an issue, a third party plug in is causing the issue or Firefox ha a memory leak. It is very similar to a memory leak in the way it acts. Task manager force quitting the plug manager seems to resolve the issue temporarily.

Expected Results:
force quitting resolve the issue temporarily

The software should not lock up or provide warning when the plug in manager cease to work properly.
