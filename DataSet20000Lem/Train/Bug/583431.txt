Firefox seems to skip frame (stutter) with D2D/DW on.
Visually, it alternate between smooth and jumpy a multiple time a second.
IE: smooth->jump->smooth->jump->...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1a. Enable Direct Write (Not D2D)
1b. With arrow key scroll up/down
1c. Now enable D2D, notice same behavior

2a. Enable D2D and run IE9 Spinning Logo Test
2b. Move the spinning image down the screen (so partially hidden)
2c. Make sure they spin slowly
Actual Results:
1. With DW, there is is visual stuttering on the simplest websites. More complex one might be very difficult to scroll.

2. Images do no spin smoothly, there is visual stuttering.

Expected Results:
1. Smooth scrolling without stuttering (Just like without DirectWrite)
2. Visually smooth spinning logo

For the spinning logo test, the FPS counter doe not detect this and show constant 50-60FPS with default settings.

The Fox News URL is an extreme case, most of the time stuttering is not that severe.

Enabling D2D alongside DW doe not in any way assist the performance degradation while scrolling.
