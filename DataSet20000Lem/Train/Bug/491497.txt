When accessing FogBugz on a local secure server I now get the error '[Authentication required], Enter user name and password for http://...., followed by auto-filled User Name and Password. This work fine on Internet Explorer 6.0. I believe I have seen this problem on a previous version of FireFox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Attempt to login to local secure FogBugz Server.
2. The the error dialogue box '[Authentication required], Enter user name and password for http://...., followed by auto-filled User Name and Password appears.
3. Cannot login using either FogBugz or Server Username/password combinations.
4. If I hit OK the dialogue box continues to appear. If I hit Cancel, then the HTTP Error 401.1 'You are not authorized to view this page' appears.
Actual Results:
As above.

Expected Results:
I should logon to my FogBugz Home Page.

Works fine, and consistently, on any version of IE.

I've put the Severity a Normal, but I could put it down to Minor if the workaround is 'Use IE instead' (Which is what our IT department says).
