All browsing maintains a choppy appearance and take longer than normal. I have un-installed and reinstalled Firefox many time but the flickering remains. If I try to watch a video it flicker throughout, while trying to type the onscreen text is behind the keyboard stroke and doe not appear on-screen smoothly, but flickering and momentarily freezing (making typing e-mail very difficult) and the cursor that is used when typing is constantly flashing much faster than is normal, a if it is experiencing numerous and rapid little glitch or freezes. The problem is that the choppyness affect all aspect of my browsing and especially my ability to write e-mails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just need to turn on Firefox and begin browsing in some way
2.Is felt worst when I try to type and e-mail or watch a video
3.
Actual Results:
It is a problem that happens everywhere, each site. I simply need open Firefox and it is slow (I am connected to a T3 University network) - then if I try to type a message or online text field it is very choppy and hard to type - the word come but very late and not smooth at all. If I try to watch an embedded video the video is also choppy, flashing with a black screen very breifly every couple of millisecond


The Software should operate smoothly a it ha done for me in the past.


Additional Information
I am using the default theme. I use Windows Vista on a brand new Dell Ispiron 531S desktop. The choppyness doe not occur if I use Windows Explorer.
