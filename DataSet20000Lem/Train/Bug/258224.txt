"Open in tabs" in bookmark close all existing tab without warning, even if
multiple tab are open and you have "Warn when closing multiple tabs" turned on
in the Firefox configuration.

Middle-clicking on a folder in the bookmark toolbar will do an "Open in tabs".
It is very easy to accidentally middle-click on one of these, because I usually
middle-click bookmarks. Contrary to what you would expect, middle-clicking a
folder in the bookmark doesn't open them in new tab but close all existing
tab and replaces them.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Tools > Options > Advanced > Browsing and make sure "Warn when closing
multiple tabs" is turned on.
2. Middle click a folder in your bookmarks.


Actual Results:
All my open tab are gone and replaced with new tab for the folder entry

Expected Results:
Display warning first (or open the new tab *in addition to* the current tabs).

Classifying this a a bug rather than enhancement since the "Warn when closing
multiple tabs" feature is broken here.
