system monitor report increase memory usage from 23% to 50% after le than 1 hour on firefox ... with NO reduction after closing firefox out. the stress ha fan on HP pavilion going like crazy. (w/little to no correspondence in CPU or network usage). have to reboot machine to get it back to normal.

memory usage occurs with or without flash movie running. first thought wa flash 10 problem (older flash on window same thing), memory escalation continues after flash uninstall. browser plugins include sun java.


new install 64 bit unbuntu 10 on HP 64 bit system. all updated.

same machine, ha window 7 ... and no problem w/firefox memory usage.

so something not jiving with ubuntu linux 64 bit and firefox.

would investigate more, but do not have IT education to be much more help.

hp pavilion
64 bit
quad core AMD
3 gig ddr3
500 gig onboard w/100 gig linux

realtek pcie ethernet highspeed cable connection

netgear router

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install adobe flash, sun java, on 64 bit sys w/ubuntu 10 64 bit (updated)
2. 1080i 30 hz HD resolution
3. launch firefox, watch memory usage climb and stay there
Actual Results:
have to reboot machine after using firefox, to get memory usage back to normal

Expected Results:
same

window 7 power setting to power saver (re hdd drivers)
driver issue w/ATI graphic and linux-supplied ATI driver-resolution at highest 1080i HD.

flash ALWAYS play worse in firefox on linux than firefox in windows. all choppy on fullscreen .... hardware acceleration is wrong.

this much memory usage when just running the browser is alarming and will have to stop using firefox altogether.
