In version previous to 3.0.9 Cognos 8 HTML and PDF report would render correctly, in 3.0.9 an issue wa introduced in Firefox where they would appear blank, and certain customer are still seeing this issue in 3.0.10.

PDF report are rendered through the Adobe browser plugin (as opposed to something on our end) however it doe not appear to be loading up either.

Nothing on our end ha changed, so this definitely appears to be a code issue in Firefox.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a Cognos 8 environment
2. Run any report in HTML or PDF format
3. Experience error

Actual Results:
Against test environment in-house Cognos is not able to reproduce this error, however certain customer are seeing this issue with correctly configured environments.

Expected Results:
Properly render the HTML and/or PDF report a in previous version and a is seen in Internet Explorer.

I understand that this may not specifically be an issue in Firefox, however since result are not consistent between version of Firefox (with Cognos content/configuration remaining static) I suspect there ha been a large change in how our HTML/PDFs are handled.
