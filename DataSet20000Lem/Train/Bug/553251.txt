Nearly same Problem:
It is not possible to customize the toolbar via the suggested standard procedure:

1. On the menu bar, click View, go to Toolbars, and then select Customize.... The Customize Toolbar window will appear.
2. Drag and drop item
3. When you are finished making changes, click Done to close the Customize Toolbar window.

As soon a the selection “Customize” at the toolbars is being selected, the Firefox browser menu become grayish and cannot be used (clicked on) any more. It is still possible to drag and drop item and clicking “done” to finish. However, after a restart of Firefox the change doe not appear - but browser menu can be used again.

For troubleshooting, Firefox ha been restarted in Safe Mode and toolbars and control have been reset. Yet, the problem still remains: it is not possible to customize the toolbar.

Also, it ha been tried to overwrite the localstore.rdf-file by an older localstore.rdf-backup-file, but this did not work either, except of reinstating status quo.

So I wonder: how can I make change to my toolbars?


Reproducible: Always
