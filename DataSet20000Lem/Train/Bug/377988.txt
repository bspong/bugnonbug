javascript "new windows" set to open in a new tab, they do so once, and all further link reuse that tab

I configure Firefox to force all "new window" call to a new tab- this work fine... [browser.link.open_newwindow set to 3, browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction set to 0], however when I click a javascript new window link- available from the supplied URL, any of the bold text link at the bottom left of the page- I notice it will open a new tab correctly 1 time, and in all subsequent link of the same type, it will instead open in that first new tab, not creating new tab for each link a Firefox 1.5 did (and still does, I reinstalled it after noticing this problem).

I have found no information about why online, though I have found evidence others are experiencing this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set your browser.link.open_newwindow setting to 3, and browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction to 0.
2. Go to the supplied URL.
3. Click a bold text link to open a new tab.
4. Click another link and it will open in the previous tab.
Actual Results:
The second (and any subsequent) link will all reuse the single new tab.

Expected Results:
It should open each link in it own new tab.

No other relevant information. I apologize if this report is flawed in any way; it is the first time I have had to file one. I hope this issue is resolved, a it seriously hamper the functionality I wa used to. Thanks.
