vBulletin 3.8.6 - Smiley "control" fails in FF4
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101117 Firefox/4.0b8pre

vBulletin 3.8.6 open up a pop-up window to get more smileys. On the pane on the right hand side, you can see a "More...". This fails in FF4, but work fine in 3.7. Another issue is that you cannot click on ANY smiley to put it into the textarea (as you usually would).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
- open up link a provided above
- log in with following credentials:

username - bugzilla_test
password - ff4
(I put this up because I wanted to avoid the site getting inundated with test accounts...)
-----------------------------------------------------

- try to click on any smiley. It must be possible to get the smiley into the textarea, displaying a "code" like :confused: or :mad: or whatever in there.
- try to click on the "More..." link at the bottom of the "Smilies" pane on the right.
Actual Results:
- no smiley will be put into the textarea when you click on a smiley; all click are ignored

- the "More" link won't open a popup, but instead behave a if you had clicked some sort of "Top of page" button: staying on the same page, but causing it to scroll up until the end.

Expected Results:
should not happen. Since the popup-window is independent of the popup blocker in this case (issue will happen also if popup-blocker is inactive) it should open in any case.

Works perfectly on Firefox 3.7 nightlies (tested various ones).
Also work fine on Opera.
