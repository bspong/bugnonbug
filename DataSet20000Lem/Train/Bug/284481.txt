Downloading Japanese text support add keyboard language icon to taskbar

After downloading and installing Japanese font support from
http://download.microsoft.com/download/ie5/IME/5.02/W9XNT4/EN-US/JAMONDO.exe an
icon related to the Keyboard Language pop up in the taskbar whenever I start
Firefox. This in itself isn't too much of a problem, but the icon persists
whenever I shut down Firefox, and have to go through the Properties and change a
setting before I can remove it. I only have one Keyboard language installed,
being English (United States.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install the Japanese font support at
http://download.microsoft.com/download/ie5/IME/5.02/W9XNT4/EN-US/JAMONDO.exe
2. Restart Firefox.

Actual Results:
An icon regarding keyboard language popped up in my taskbar. At the same time,
however, I do have Japanese text support.

Expected Results:
Well, the inclusion of the icon in the taskbar wasn't exactly expected --
there's normally no way to add it to the taskbar if you have only one keyboard
language installed.
