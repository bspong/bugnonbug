Folks: Memory leak have been dismal in version 2 and appear to be a bad in Version 3 RC1. The app start out at about 28mb and quickly balloon to 100 mb (just load one of the CNN videos). The memory doe not get released after closing the tab or window, the browser get slower and slower and at about 250-300 mb, the browser no longer load new pages, just sits there loading and need to be killed. Once restarted, those page load fine and quickly. Until it's up at 200 mb again...

My system ha a dual core AMD 2.8GHz with 4 GB of RAM, so there is not problem here....

I strongly suggest to not release this browser until these memory leak are fixed. Opera can do it, we should be able to do so, too. After all, we want this to be the best and fastest browser on the market, no?...

Thanks and keep up the good work! Vs 3 is very fast when it works....


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browser
2. Load any pages, particularly those with multimedia content (it happens with all pages, multimedia just speed it up)
3. Watch the memory footprint. Keep running until it hit around 250-300 mb
Actual Results:
Browser sits there no longer able to load new page or link

Expected Results:
fast performance throughout, regardless of how many page were loaded and closed.

Release all memory of previously loaded page
