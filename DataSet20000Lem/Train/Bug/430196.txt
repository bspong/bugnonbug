The Lycos site using Trellix work until I try to edit text on a web page. I click the edit text link. It open and stops. The WYSIWYG Page I usually see doe not load instead I get something that look like a messageboard posting space. The box is totally dead. The text doe not load. I cannot post new text to it either. The button for link B I U color don't work nor doe the edit HTML which is NOT one of the Trellix 'webpages for idiot or very lazy' option that appear in FF 1.5.

I mean I can go the FTP route but this is a pain.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log into trellix account
2.go to website
3.select page to edit
4. select text on page to edit via Edit Text link
5. Click link
6. Load page
Actual Results:
You get a page with control that have NOTHING to do with Trellix's except for a lone little remove the space above and below this check box and text. Everything else is missing.

Expected Results:
It should have loaded the Trellix 'website for morons' page with full control in white and no gray background allowing me to rapidly edit the text and slam it back up.
