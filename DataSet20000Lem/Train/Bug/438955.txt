When restarting a FF session when I have MANY (often >100) tab opening, sometimes (~5-10% of the time) the navigation toolbar button are totally messed up on the right hand side, to the right of the search box, with a display of an extra 5 row of twenty or so button on each row. These extra five row of twenty button all appear to act a ONE huge button.

Closing Firefox and starting again eliminates the problem, with the session and UI displaying normally the next time, until it happens again, with no known trigger.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have MANY tab open (I don't know the minimum number, but I'll often have >100 tab open at a time, when it happens)
2.Close Firefox
3.Restart Firefox
Actual Results:
5-10% of the time, the navigation toolbar UI is messed up, on the extreme right hand side, with a display of an extra HUGE button that is twenty icon wide by 5 row deep, with ~85 icon displayed in it.

Expected Results:
The navigation toolbar should display normally, without that extra button, with the ~85 icon on it there.

See screenshot at http://img443.imageshack.us/my.php?image=ffrc2whentaxedjw4.jpg for best way to understand what is going on. Note rectangle around icon on the right. That's because I had the cursor over the area, making it highlight like that, a if those icon are one big button.
