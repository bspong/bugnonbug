With many tab open when the browser ha been minimized a number of time and you hover over the icon to preview the content of tabs, the preview doe not correctly display (black, or missing completely). Once this happens and you try and click the browser to re-open the window to it previous state, the browser refuse to open back up. Once the browser is in this state even completely quitting the browser and then opening it again doe not fix the problem, it immediately minimizes and no browser window is opened.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a FF window and many tabs.
2. Minimize the window, hover over the icon in the tray to peek at the tab contents.
3. Select a tab from the preview.
4. Open the tab and then minimize the FF window again.
5. Rinse and repeat a bunch of times, hopefully it will result in this problem, ha happened to me a bunch of times.

Going to rate this major since when it occurs it render the browser unusable.
Actual Results:
Browser window stopped opening, preview of tab wa black or missing completely. Only way to re-open the browser wa to open FF 3.5.5 to clear all tab and then open 3.6b2 again. When I opened 3.5.5 the window started a small a possible, even though this wasn't the state it wa left in (so small no page content were visible, it wa a tiny box).

Expected Results:
Tabs display correctly and browser open correctly when selected from the task bar.
