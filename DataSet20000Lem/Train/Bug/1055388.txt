Console is a part of the page
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.143 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Open a scrollable (more than 1000px of scrolling) page with jquery included (not a problem with jQuery). Then open the developer console.
Execute a javascript (jQuery) code that say you the value of page scrolling:
$(window).scrollTop()



Actual results:

It will return a wrong number. Better explained, it return a correct number but "wrong", because the console is a part of the page. So, when you open it up, the page space (and the number) being smaller. If I must start an animation at a precision scrolling page "value" (or position), with the Firefox value it will start in the wrong position.


Expected results:

If I should start a j animation at the position 824, if I open the developer console (monitor resolution: 1920x1080 - iMac 21.5) and scroll the position 824 (found on G.Chrome) which is the same (as rendering) on both browsers, on Chrome with
"$(window).scrollTop()" I will get 824, but on Firefox I will get 560 (depending by console sizing), because the size of the console influence the scroll position.

Solution: don't let the console be a piece of the page but only of the browser window (it should pop up OVER the page). Thank you.
