Excessive CPU and memory usage on at least 6 different system
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008071719 Firefox/3.0.1

NOTE: I have experienced the following on 6 uniquely different systems, ranging from 1.5ghz 256mb ram to 3.2ghz 4gig ram

Other application open: none other than bare system software (e.g. window manager)
System state: ranging from fresh install to couple month old
system resource usage before: load average: 0.01, cpu usage: 0.5%

after opening firefox and loading a couple of tab (max of 7):
cpu usage: at LEAST 60%, load average: 4.xx

resourse usage of firefox being left idle for an hour: no change

after firefox either crash and close itself, or stop responding and is force killed, or in the rare instance it accepts a standard quit message:
same resource usage a before using firefox. In Windows it can often be impossible to kill firefox in this state and requires a hard reset (as firefox is using almost 4 gig of memory on that system!!!!!!)

Example pages: Google, Gmail, Hotmail, MySpace, Youtube, Facebook, and almost any other site with moderate usage of image and/or cs and/or javascript

Most noticable performance bottleneck: loading pages, closing pages(freeing up memory - can take some minute to close after receiving a quit message), or switching between tabs. Can take substantial time to switch/render the tab (tespite the tab control responding instantly). closing a tab can also take substantial time despite the cross responding to the click.
Sometimes using the scrollwheel on an un-rendered tab cause the rendering engine to kick in instantly

Number of time Firefox ate up massive system resource and stopped responding/disappeared trying to get to this site alone: 3

Operating system this ha happened on are Windows (XP/Vista), Ubuntu Linux (Hardy), Debian Linux (Etch)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use Firefox and watch system resource


Expected Results:
Firefox consumes an acceptable amount of resource a Firefox 2.0.0.14 did
