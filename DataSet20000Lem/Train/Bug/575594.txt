When retrieving a section of HTML containing a textarea with long text content and a carriage return - newline line separator starting at index 4096, Firefox mis-parses and insert an additional cr-nl into the DOM at that position.

This bug doe not occur unless the line separator is cr-nl specifically, and doe not happen with direct API call to set the textarea content.

The web page above illustrates the situation and compare to alternative solutions.

This bug ha been observed with several operating system (linux, o x, windows) and several Firefox version prior to 3.6.

This bug would be trivial anywhere else except in a case where machine parseable content is entered through a web page, e.g. in a wikipage notation list where an empty line indicates the end of the list.
