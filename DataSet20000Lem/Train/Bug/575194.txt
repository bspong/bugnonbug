Bookmark button misbehaves when personal-bookmark widget is moved to menu bar
The auto-created bookmark button seems to work fine if the personal-bookmark widget is on the bookmark toolbar.


1. bookmark widget on visible bookmark bar
with a visible menu bar = NO bookmark button!
open a new window = NO bookmark button!
restarted browser new window = NO bookmark button!
hide and reshow menu bar = NO bookmark button!
hide and reshow bookmark bar = NO bookmark button!

2. bookmark widget on hidden bookmark bar
with a visible menu bar = NO bookmark button!
open a new window = NO bookmark button!
restarted browser new window = NO bookmark button!
hide and reshow menu bar = NO bookmark button!
reshow and hide bookmark bar = NO bookmark button!

3. bookmark widget on visible bookmark bar
with a hidden menu bar = bookmark button on bookmark bar
open a new window = bookmark button on bookmark bar
restarted browser new window = bookmark button on bookmark bar
reshow and hide menu bar = bookmark button on bookmark bar
hide and reshow bookmark bar = bookmark button on bookmark bar

4. bookmark widget on hidden bookmark bar
with a hidden menu bar = bookmark button on navigation bar
open a new window = bookmark button on navigation bar
restarted browser new window = bookmark button on navigation bar
reshow and hide menu bar = bookmark button on navigation bar*
reshow and hide bookmark bar = bookmark button on navigation bar

(*) bookmark button disappears while menu is visible

However, I've placed the personal-bookmark widget on the MENU bar for easy recall and dismissal with the ALT key. With the widget on the menubar, all hell break loose and there is no telling where the bookmark button will or will not pop up next especially on new window or after a restart.


5. with a visible bookmark bar
bookmark widget on visible menu bar = bookmark button on menu bar
open a new window = NO bookmark button!
restarted browser new window = NO bookmark button!
hide and reshow menu bar = bookmark button on menu bar

6. with a hidden bookmark bar
bookmark widget on visible menu bar = bookmark button on menu bar
open a new window = NO bookmark button!
restarted browser new window = NO bookmark button!
hide and reshow menu bar = bookmark button on menu bar
reshow and hide bookmark bar = bookmark button on menu bar

7. with a visible bookmark bar
bookmark widget on hidden menu bar = NO bookmark button!
open a new window = bookmark button on navigation bar
restarted browser new window = bookmark button on navigation bar
reshow and hide menu bar = NO bookmark button!
hide and reshow bookmark bar = NO bookmark button!

8. with a hidden bookmark bar
bookmark widget on hidden menu bar = NO bookmark button!

reshow and hide menu bar = NO bookmark button!
reshow and hide bookmark bar = NO bookmark button!


What ultimately is or is not proper behaviour is up to the developer to decide but a it stand now this user doe not think the above is correct and certainly not what I would expect.
