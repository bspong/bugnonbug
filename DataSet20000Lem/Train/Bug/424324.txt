When restoring a session, rather than opening all the window at one size in a cascading position, would it be possible that the location and size of the window also be restored - like how Safari re-opens all window from last session.

For example, I always have about 4 window which always have the same location... for example my calendar which sits on my secondary monitor at 100% width and 70% height, while the web based email client sits behind it at 70% width and 100% height, while the window with phpMyAdmin sits top/left on my main display, and the main development window sits top/right on my main display.

Its not a major issue, but every time I restart Firefox (install/enable/disable extensions, software upgrades, etc), it mean that I have to re-size and re-position all the windows.
