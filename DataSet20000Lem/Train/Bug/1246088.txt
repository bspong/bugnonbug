Element picker break after I try to pick an element in Youtube HTML5 embed object
>>> My Info: Win7_64, Nightly 46, 32bit, ID 20160204030229
STR:
1.A) Open http://www.stalker.pl/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=134&start=6276 (from bug 1240471)
Scroll the page so that the Youtube HTML5 embed object in the first post in that thread
wa aligned at the center of content area (vertically)
1.B) Open the following "data:" url
> data:text/html,<div><div><div style="height:340px; width:50px; background:red;"></div><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/eoUf1bbMTa8" width="560" height="340"><style>div{display:inline-block;}
1.C) Open the following "data:" url
> data:text/html,<div><div><div style="height:340px; width:50px; background:red;"></div><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eoUf1bbMTa8" width="560" height="340"><style>div{display:inline-block;}

2. Open devtools, dock the toolbox to the bottom side of window, resize it so that the Youtube
HTML5 embed object wa partially clipped by toolbox, but red play button wa still visible
3. Switch to Inspector tab, click Element picker.
4. Move mouse pointer to the red play button in the Youtube HTML5 embed object. In this step, make
sure that mouse doesn't move over anything else on the page but the Youtube HTML5 embed object
5. Click left mouse button
6. Click Element picker again
7.A) Move mouse to the red play button in the same manner a in Step 5.
Then move it in a straight line to the 1st STALKER icon ("radiation") in the poster's info
7.B) Move mouse to the red area on the left
7.C) Move mouse to the red area on the left (the same a 7.B)
8. Click left mouse button

AR: After Step 4 and Step 8 nothing happens.

ER: Either X or Y
X) After Step 4 the youtube button in markup should be selected in markup
Y) Ok, let it fail in Step 4, but Element picker at least shouldn't be broken
and the element from Step 7 should be selected in markup after Step 8.

I don't know if this can be called "regression". Change ranges:

The mechanism is very similar to the one described by me in bug 1228675
