HI!!

THE BROWSER CRASHES IN A CONSTANT WAY.
SOME OF THE REASONS ARE: JS3250.DLL, CONFLICT WITH DR.WATSON32,
CONFLICT WITH NTDLL, .

SO, IN A MAIN WAY; THE JS3250.DLL ERRORS HAVE BECOME PRESENT IN **ALL** VERSIONS,EITHER STABLE OR BETAS SINCE QUITE A WHILE NOW.

SO INSTEAD OF RELEASING NEW BETAS WITH EXTRA FEATURES, YOU HAVE TO FOCUS IN FIXING THOSE ERRORS OF JS3250, AND QUITE FLANKLY AND DONT KNOW HOW YOU HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO FIX THE FILE IN ALL THIS TIME.

YOU SHOULD CHECK LINE BY LINE OF THE PROGRAMMING CODE, TO FIND THE PROB., AND TO CHECK IF AN EXTERNAL OPERATION OF JS3250.DLL (ANOTHER FILE OF THE BROWSER), OR A SUB-RUTINE STARTED BY JS3250 ITS AFFECTING IT.
AND THE RESTORE SESSION, ITS NOT A WELL-BEING OPTION OF ALL THE PROBS.

WELL, HOPING THAT THIS HELPS YOU, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO IT CAUSE INDEED FIREFOX ITS THE BEST THERE IS, BUT MUST FIX THOSE ***VITAL ERRORS***.

ALSO YOU SHOULD KEEP THE BOOKMARKS FORMAT OF THE STABLE ONES, THE ONES OF THE BETAS ARE NOT QUITE GOOD.
