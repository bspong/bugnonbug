Steps to reproduce:

Installed Firefox 6.0.2 nut i think it wa actually updated from the previous edition, instead of being a completely new installation.


Actual results:

After I installed Firefox 6.0.2 and then launched it for the first time, it keep trying to install the update and after it's finished checking and doesn't find anything, no update, firefox browser open up with two tabs. the first one on the left and visual is the What's new in Firefox 6.0.2, while the next tab over is my home page of google. Any way of avoiding the what's new in firefox tab everytime i open my browser?


Expected results:

I think it should've been a completely new installation, even though i removed firefox completely from my control panel and remove programs, but i also cleaned out the registry from anything having to do with firefox, with a good software program that doe it automatically. After that i tried a brand new installation with the same problem.
