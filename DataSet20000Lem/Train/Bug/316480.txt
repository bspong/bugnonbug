The problem only seems present in Firefox 1.5. In a CSS design, an unordered list is made horizontal. The second-level list will appear vertical a opposed to horizontal. Identical code will render correctly under Firefox 1.0.7 and IE 6. I've made more than a few attempt to convince the second level list to be horizontal, but no amount of hacking seems to work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a page containing the HTML and CSS a listed in the link.
2.Display the page.
3.

Actual Results:
The menu will display vertically, rather than horizontially.

Expected Results:
The menu should be displayed horizontally sharing the x positioning of it's parent.

I will be the first to admit this should could be a problem with my code, but it's stumped the people I've exposed it to, including myself. For this particular design, a modification of the CSS would produce an effect similar to what's desired, but would lack infinite nesting abiliites.
