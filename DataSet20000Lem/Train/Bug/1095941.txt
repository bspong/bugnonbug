When I shut down my Ubuntu without closing Firefox I always get "Embarrassing" message on the next launch
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:33.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/33.0
Build ID: 20141013200408

Steps to reproduce:

* Shut down my PC, without closing Firefox first.
* Log in and start Filrefox.


Actual results:

Next time I launch FF, I get "Well this is embarassing" message.

I get it _every time_ I open FF, because I never explicitly close FF on logging off.

And every time I have to hit "Restore" (because that's what I need), and every time it restores successfully.

(Note: this behavior stay with me like for ever, since the first day I've installed Ubuntu 12.04. It's not only for the latest FF build.)


Expected results:

Don't show this message if FF is able to open my last session.

I suspect the problem here is that shut down look like a crash to FF under Ubuntu. And so, on a boot up, it think that last session crashed, and last but one crashed a well.

I'd like to:

* either be able to tell FF to not ask me for confirmation and always try to restore right away (provided that there would be a way to manually disable this behavior in profile folder if it in fact did make FF go into a dead loop in some distant future)

* or, preferred but probably more complex, fix FF to NOT treat Ubuntu shut down a a crash.
