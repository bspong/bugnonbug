In my tool bar I keep two bookmarklets:

one that move the window to one half of the screen
javascript:%20resizeTo(screen.availWidth/2,screen.availHeight);moveTo(0,0)

and one that move it to the other half
javascript:%20resizeTo(screen.availWidth/2,screen.availHeight);moveTo(screen.availWidth/2,0)

When I do the following
1.run a dual head setup with my powerbook 17in a secondary display on the left my benq19in LCD a primary display
2.have firefox completely on the secondary monitor
And I click on the bookmarklet that move the window to the left side of the screen, it move the window to the right side of the secondary monitor. The right side bookmarklet work a it should, on both the secondary and primary, also I should mention that the left side bookmarklet work fine on the primary display.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
get yourself a machine with o x tiger
get another monitor
put my bookmarklets in your tool bar, because come on, they're pretty sweet. Give them the name "<-" and "->" and they will look real nice in your bookmark bar. And if you want to get real fancy make a bookmarklet with the name:
-
location:javascript:%20resizeTo(screen.availWidth,screen.availHeight);moveTo(0,0)
now you'll have a left halfbutton, a full screen button, and a right half button.
