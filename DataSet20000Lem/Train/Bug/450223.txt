This is a separate bug report to bug 449193, which ha been labeled Tech Evangelism. Note that the owner of the website in question ha been informed, so this report is solely to find the bug causing the crash.

When opening the website www.europcar.de, Firefox freezes, which probably ha to do with the site being very badly coded (XHML, CSS and Javascript validators show a large number of violations). However, a local copy of the page load fine, which render creating a test case impossible. This bug should be fixed soon, a the website owner stated that they are working on the problem and without test case it won't be possible to find out what the bug in Firefox is once they fix their site.

A peculiar thing is that after loading a local copy of the site, even the online version load correctly. When the Firefox cache is emptied, however, the crash occurs again. It seems that the problem occurs when the website is loaded into cache.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load www.europcar.de --> freeze

But:

1. Open local copy (html only with added <base href="http://www.europcar.de">)
-> no freeze
2. Open www.europcar.de --> no freeze
3. Clear cache, open www.europcar.de --> freeze
Actual Results:
Firefox freeze and doe not accept any mouse or keyboard input, neither on the website nor in the Firefox menus.

Expected Results:
Firefox should not freeze, no matter how badly a website is coded.

These two error appear in the error console when opening the local copy:

Error: Permission denied for <file://> to get property HTMLDocument.open from
<http://www.europcar.de>.
Source File: http://www.europcar.de/EBE/module/js/home.js
Line: 186

Error: urchinTracker is not defined
Source File: file:///C:/europ4.htm
Line: 2618

Note that the second error only occurs sometimes.

The urchinTracker seems to have to do something with Google analytics, a
there is a piece of code a few line above the error that read <script
src="https://ssl.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript">. This .js file contains the urchinTracker() function.

Loading the online version of the website leading to a crash doe not display these errors, a the browser freeze before. Loading the online version without crash (as described above) doe not display these error either, but a lot of warnings. The warning also appear when loading the local copy.
