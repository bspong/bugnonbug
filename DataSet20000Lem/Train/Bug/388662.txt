Hello, I have a server (more information on it here: http://vintage.tsfsc.com), the connection detail are below:

FTP
----
Address: ftp://kdxvcfa.dyndns.ws
Username: guest
Password: guest

HTTP
------
Address: http://kdxvcfa.dyndns.ws:8080
Username: guest
Password: guest

KDX
-----
Address: kdxvcfa.dyndns.ws
Username: none needed
Password: none needed

But the most important obviously are the ftp detail here... When trying something like ftp://guest:guest@kdxvcfa.dyndns.ws I get a error stating that the connection wa reset meanwhile connecting to the server is just fine in a FTP client such a Transmit. I can only guess that something with regard to Firefox's FTP support is broken? Hopefully one of the devs can check this out and fix this issue in the next release a it is nice from time to time to have good working ftp server support in your web browser...

Thanks, keep up the great work guys! :)

P.S. I'm on Mac OS X 10.4.10 with a Intel Mac Mini 1.66ghz Core Duo
