I am unable to use "Move to" drop down menu on the hotmail.com webmail website to move email to my folders.
The "Move to" drop down menu works, when the number of folder in the drop down menu is le then or equal than the size of the drop down menu. You can select the folder to which you wish to move the selected (by the check box) email message, and the email is moved. However, the "Move to" drop down menu no longer works, when the number of folder in the drop down menu is greater the size of visible folder in drop down menu and you have to use the drop-down menu scroll bar. Once you scroll down the drop down menu and release the left mouse button, the drop down menu close and you are unable to select the folder name from the drop down menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go do hotmail.com
2. login to your account
3. make sure in the "Move to" drop-down-menu you have number of folder that requires using scroll bar (the number of folder is bigger than the drop down menu)
4. go to "Move to" drop down menu and scroll down using the scroll bar
5. attemp to select the folder on the left in the "Move to" drop-down-menu
Actual Results:
After scrolling down, and releasing the left mouse button, the drop-down-menu will close.

Expected Results:
After scrolling down and releasing the left mouse button the "Move to" drop down menu should stay open such you could select the folder on the left from the drop down menu.

I did not have this problem in the earlier version of firefox. I do not have this problem in the Mozilla.
