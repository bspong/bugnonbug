Sometime when I am browsing with multiple window open, a window in the
background will ask to set a cookie, but since it is in a window in the
background I am not aware of it, but the foreground window halt for what seems
like an unknown reason. I would like for when a website that is being browsed in
a background window is requesting to set a cookie, the window in the foreground
continue to operate. Also if a website in a tab is requesting a cookie, the
cookie request sheet should only popup when that tab is selected not before.

Bottomline a cookie request in one tab/windows should not inhibit browsing on
other window

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Clear all of your cookies.
2.open a site that take a while to load and want to set a cookie in one window
3. open a new window and browse normally,
4. when the site in the background is ready to set it cookie, the browsing
session halts.

Actual Results:
firefox freeze until the cookie set request sheet get an input

Expected Results:
see detail above.
