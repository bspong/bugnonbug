Steps to reproduce:

Unsure exactly. My computer wa at the lock screen, and I know Firefox wa running in the background. I wiped my keyboard with a duster cloth, a I often do, and then proceeded to unlock the computer. Upon doing so, I noticed I wa not able to type anything into Firefox.


Actual results:

Firefox doe not allow me to type anywhere. The only key that still work in Firefox is the TAB key. All other key do not function whatsoever. The keyboard work in all other application perfectly normally.

Firefox continues to function other than the keyboard input not working. I can browse to website in my favourite using the mouse and click on links. However, the keyboard will not function in ANY text field.

I have attempted to use a different keyboard, with identical results. I then attempted to use the Windows On-Screen Keyboard, with identical results. Computer ha been rebooted, Firefox uninstalled, profile removed (basdically a CLEAN install of FF), still not working.


Expected results:

I should be able to type in all text fields.
