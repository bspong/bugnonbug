Certain pop-ups(i.e.-Away.com) that leave me hanging are becoming a common occurance & are getting very annoying

Everytime I get on the internet, certain pop-ups, like Away.com(which pops-up everytime I get on the internet now), lock me up on the internet to where nothing on the internet responds & I have to close & restore the session. I have your pop-up blocker installed, but this doesn't seem to work. At, least Mcrosoft Internet Explorer ha better pop-up blocker than you do, although they have their problem too. Isn't there any way to block more pop-up while using you for the internet? What need to be done?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Getting on the internet through you
2.Not long into session, Away.com pops-up

3.Nothing responds, & error message appears telling you that program is not responding & will close session
Actual Results:
Program closed. And, I restored session, noly for it to happen again.

Expected Results:
Blocked the pop-up or at least close pop-up without locking up internet.
