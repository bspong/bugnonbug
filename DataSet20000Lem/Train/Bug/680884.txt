Google Maps mouse wheel (zoom) also trigger page scroll
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:6.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0
Build ID: 20110811165603

Steps to reproduce:

On page that have Google Maps component(s) embedded with mouse wheel zoom (scrollwheel option) enabled, use the mouse wheel over any of these component while the page ha a higher scrollHeight than the height of the viewport and the 'overflow' property is not set to 'hidden'.



Actual results:

After the map start to zoom in/out, the page also scroll one step up/down just like it should whenever someone us the mouse wheel for scrolling. I experienced this about 95% of the time; sometimes it work a it should, though, a mentioned in the question below.

I tried this with a vanilla install of FF6 on windows/x64 and osx 10.6 platforms.

(or any other google map example)

This bug is claimed to have been fixed since the release of FF 6.0 and is related to the DOMMouseScroll event:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=650950


Expected results:

In all major browser and in FF <= 5 the expected behavior wa to zoom in/out and to _not_ scroll.

In FF 6.0, the DOMMouseScroll event _does_ propagate or "bubble up" somehow despite the contrary being explicitly stated in the documentation or an effectively similar mechanism trigger a page scroll almost every time I use the mouse wheel.
