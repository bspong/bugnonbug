Throbber never stop on page with missing image

(Only tested on local page (with local image links) since that way I know that
it's not a server issue.)

When I load a local page containing a missing image (that is, I specify a SRC
that doesn't exist), sometimes the page never finish loading (throbber never
stops; progress bar at the bottom never go away; stop button is still enabled)
a if it is busy waiting around for my hard drive to find the missing image. :)
This only happens sometimes; I'd estimate about 50% of the time.


Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a local HTML page with an <img src="dummy.jpg"> type link.
2. Load in Firefox.
3. If that doesn't do the trick, reload a few time until the problem occurs.
For me it seems to happen about every other time that I reload. So: Reload, it
works; reload, throb forever; reload, works... etc.

Actual Results:
Page load essentially forever (I haven't tried leaving it for a couple of hour
to see if it will really go "forever"). Stop button works.

Expected Results:
Page should finish loading and stop. =)
