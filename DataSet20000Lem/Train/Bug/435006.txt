As of Firefox 3.0rc1 the use of named or numeric entity in add-on install.rdf or DTD file cause errors. This problem did not exist prior to RC1.

1) Named entity no longer work in install.rdf file and numeric entity must be used instead.

2) Both named and numeric entity cause error if used in DTD file or at least the use of the name or numeric entity for '&' sign cause errors.

Version 1.1 of the extension Classic Compact Options https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6969 demonstrates the error caused by the use of named entity in install.rdf when the extension is installed on Firefox v3.0rc1. Replacing the named entity in the file /install.rdf and S:\Web /locale/en-US/prefwindow.dtd with their numeric entity equivalent (e.g. replace "amp" with "#038" will demonstrate the error that is generated when the extension option panel is opened.

The work around is to use numeric entity in the install.rdf file and to avoid the use of named or numeric entity in DTD file all together (which is what I did for Classic Compact Options v1.1.2).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Add the named entity for '&' ("&amp;") and quote mark ("&quot;") to the <em:description> field in install.rdf and to a <!ENTITY string in a DTD file of an extension.

2) Compile then try to install the extension on Firefox 3.0rc1 (should result in JavaScript error).

3) Replace named entity in intall.rdf file with numeric entity and then rebuild extension and install extension.

4) Open the window that reference the DTD file with the named entities, you should get an error.

5) Replace named entity in DTD file with numeric entity then rebuild and reinstall extension and try to open related window again. You should still get the error.

6) Remove numeric entity from DTD file then rebuild and install extension again. The error will go away.

3) replace
