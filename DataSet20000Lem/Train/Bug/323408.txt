Firefox sometimes transpose letter in HTML textboxes and the address bar/search bar while typing, problem exists since version 1.0.5
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Firefox very often randomly move the cursor back a space or two while typing within a textbox, address bar, or search bar, for example, when I enter my Yahoo! ID to log into my email (TJ_Mott) sometimes move the cursor back while I'm typing and in the textbox it will have "tj_ottm" because of this problem. This can make it very frustrating and difficult to log into websites, especially when entering passwords. For long entries, such a this bug report, I have found it easier to type it all in Notepad and copy/paste into the textbox. I originally thought the problem wa spyware or a virus, but I've been searching for month and have not found anything responsible on my system. A friend recently installed Firefox and had the problem within minutes. I have noticed this since version 1.0.5, and I am currently using version 1.5. It is NOT a hardware problem.
