The problem is self revealing. The lack of a local disk cache, and use of strictly "auto sizing" in RAM cache make navigating this site absolutely rediculously slow--I'm talking 5 minute or more to reload 8 high re pic on 1 page. Merely closing the tab or window that is displaying the page will cause all of the huge high re picture file to be reloaded from the remote web server every time the page is re-visited. This is unacceptable performance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the page, wait for everything to load once
2. close tab or window
3. Open new tab or window, and revisit the page

Actual Results:
It take on the order of 5 minute to download the page again, over a 1.5mb/s broadband connection.

Expected Results:
Load the page/images from disk, and display the page in seconds, not 5 minutes.
