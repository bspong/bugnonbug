When manually appending http:// into the urlbar, the autocomplete popup refuse
to appear, unless I type backspace after beginning to enter the TLD. Thus, if I
type http://am, the popup will not appear. Hitting backspace at this point,
such that http://a is displayed cause autocomplete to appear with all the site
in the history with a TLD starting with "a". Note that out of habit I almost
always type in http:// when entering a url. Immediately typing the beginning of
the url (without prepending http://) cause the popup to appear a expected
(even if http:// appears in the history file). Thus, typing just "a" in the
urlbar cause http://www.amazon.com a well a all other site which have a TLD
beginning with "a".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open a new tab
2.type http://foo
3.hit the backspace key such that http://fo is displayed
4.all website with TLDs beginning with "fo" appear.

Actual Results:
The autocomplete popup appears only after hitting the backspace key

Expected Results:
The autocomplete popup should appear a soon a I begin typing in the TLD; step
3 should not be necessary.
