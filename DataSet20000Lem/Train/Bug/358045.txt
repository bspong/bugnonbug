This problem occurs when you setup Firefox to warn you if closing many tab at once and you are trying to uninstall Firefox (2.0) and you have several tab opened in a Firefox opened window.

When the browser is opened and you try to uninstall it, the uninstaller wizard tell you it need to close it in order to uninstall Firefox. If you click "Ok" on the uninstaller wizard popup, you should get another popup in the browser window asking you to confirm the closing of all opened tabs. Clicking cancel on this popup (the browser one) close the browser anyway.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a browser with many tab and make sure you setup Firefox to warn you if closing many at once
2. While the browser is opened, start the uninstallation of Firefox (Configuration Panel, Add/Remove programs)
3. Click next a first time, and then, when asked, click Ok to confirm you want the uninstaller wizard to close Firefox automatically.
4. Your Firefox browser should brings you a confirm dialog to close all the tabs, click Cancel.

Actual Results:
Firefox close while the Cancel option ha been selected.

Expected Results:
Firefox should not close.

It seems in fact this is a crash of the browser. Since after successfully uninstalled Firefox and installed it again, the first browser launch of this fresh installation start with the session crash retrieval popup.
