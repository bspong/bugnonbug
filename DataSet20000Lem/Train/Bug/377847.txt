I have more than 500 bookmarks!!! To delete some of them I selected some and hit delete button. The delete button vanishes, while bookmark remain selected. Closing Manage Bookmarks window and then restarting the window restores Delete button. Bookmarks that were selected for deletion do not appear (they are deleted)!!
The same problem exists when I try to move bookmark to a folder, or creating a new folder. I have to close and restart Manage Bookmarks window to update it contents!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.

3.
Actual Results:
* I humbly believe Firefox cannot handle more than few hundred bookmarks. Try installing bookmark in excess of 400 entry and try deleting some of them. Am sure the problem will reoccur!!
* Try creating new folder while you have more than 400 entry in bookmarks. You may need to restart Manage Bookmarks window to update it content



I tried un-installing Firefox and reinstalling it, including removing all entry in registry and profile backups, but the problem persists!!!
