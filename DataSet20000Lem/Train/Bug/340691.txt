When searching from Google, Yahoo, MSN or other search sites, if any part of the search phrase contains the word "create table", an error occurs.

The word create table have to appear together, in order, without quotation marks. My guess is that it think it is a SQL command.


The error is:

The connection wa reset
The connection to the server wa reset while the page wa loading.


The same search is Okay on MSExplorer so it appears to be a firefox issue.

1.Go to any Search Engine
2.Type in a search phrase containing the word create table.
3.

Actual Results:
The connection wa reset

The connection to the server wa reset while the page wa loading.
