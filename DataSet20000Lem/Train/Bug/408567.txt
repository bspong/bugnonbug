At the top of the web page at http://www.kokudzu.com/ is a leaf pattern produced by a GIF file. The area around the leaf is transparent in the pattern so the background yellow color show through. In print preview (with background pattern print enabled) the background yellow is visible through the transparent areas, which is a it should be. When printed the leaf are squashed vertically, and the transparent area print a white instead of yellow.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.kokudzu.com/ to view the home page.
2. Do File/Page Setup and make sure "Print Background" is checked.
3. Do File/Print Preview. Note that area around leaf at to of page is yellow.
4. Send to printer, or print to PDF if you have it.
Actual Results:
Examine the print and note that the area around the leaf is white, and the leaf are squashed to fit inside the border of the title area.

Expected Results:
The print should match the print preview: Yellow around the leaves, unsquashed leaves.

The white-print problem also occurs in IE 7, so the handling of transparent area must be a general browser problem.

I am attaching image that illustrate the problem. The image were created from screen captures, but the problem is seen on two printer made by two manufacturers. The problem is also seen when the print output go to a PDF creator.

I know of no workaround.
