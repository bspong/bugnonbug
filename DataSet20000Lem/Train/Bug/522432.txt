Servlet --x--> Ajax: Ajax code not getting servlet response
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090909 Fedora/3.5.3-1.fc11 Firefox/3.5.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090909 Fedora/3.5.3-1.fc11 Firefox/3.5.3

Hi - I originally posted the question here.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1554123/servlet-x-ajax-ajax-code-not-receiving-servlet-response

Also posted it here... hoping for a helpful *and* quick response.
http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/forum/1/471001

But no helpful response so far, not even acknowledgement that this is / is not a bug. On my end, I have verified that that code is working fine on IE 6.0 / Windows XP / Tomcat 6.0.20. Meaning, this is a bug with Firefox 3.5.3 / Fedora 11 combo.

I'm really stuck and need your help, so please... help!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. You can the working HTML and the working servlet code in stackoverflow link listed in the Details section above.
2. Once again, this code DOES work fine on IE 6.0 on Windows XP; only Fedora platform is the problemm.




This is being a show stopper for me. Would greatly appreciate if someone could suggest a solution or even a workaround... fast! Thanks in advance.
