Slow downloading of image to "My Pictures" using Windows software.

Thumbnails and fullsize image are downloaded from the internet instantly but the transfer of the fullsize image to "My Pictures" take many second to several minute depending on the size of the final image. Examples are the enlarged product image of the TigerDirect site. I do not have this problem with Internet Explorer or with the Yahoo browser supplied by SBC. If the problem is with the Windows image software, is there another Image Program that would be better? Also, all other function are suspended during the lengthy dowmload to the file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to TigerDirect and select a specfic product.
2.Enlarge the product image.
3.Download the image to memory/HD using Windows.
4.Repeat using IE.

Actual Results:
I sit and watch TV while the image are being transferred to my PC files, sometimes I doze off.

Expected Results:
Same a IE and Yahoo!
