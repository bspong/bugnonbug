If Firefox is installed on a system running Firebird and Firebird wa last
closed with the download manager open, it will be open on the left side of
Firefox every time Firefox is ran and cannot be closed by mean of Ctrl + E or
hitting the 'X' on the upper right corner of the Download manager frame.

Reproducible: Always

2. Open Firebird and open the download manager (ctrl + E)
3. Close Firebird
4. Install Firefox without uninstalling Firebird
5. Open Firefox
(Note: need not install Firefox, is reproducable on a system with both browser
installed)

Actual Results:
Firefox openned with a Firebird-style download manager open (as apposed to the
new slave-window style of download manager) and doe not respond to the normal
command that would close it.

Openned a normal, being unaffected by the last state of Firebird, or openned
with the new download manager open.

No specialized software installed (themes, extensions, or otherwise); just a
clean install.
