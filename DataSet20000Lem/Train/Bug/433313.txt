Excessive memory usage by XmlHttpRequest

Using xmlhttp.responseText when xmlhttp.readystate = 3 cause Firefox to claim between 2 and 10mb's of memory for each use of xmlhttp.responseText

I speculate that the XmlHttpRequest object is copied, and not updated for each use.

This page demonstrates the problem (though I am not the author and have no control of the page):

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Request a reasonably large file (+200kb) using XmlHttpRequest.open (async mode)
2.
in the onreadystatechange event handler use the following line (here we suppose the XmlHttpRequest is called xmlhttp:

if (xmlhttp.readystate == 3) {
t = xmlhttp.responseText;
}

Actual Results:
For each call to the eventhandler Firefox us between 2 and 10mb of extra memory, eventually sending the machine to a crawling halt because of writes to the pagefile.

Expected Results:
no extra memory usage. the xmlhttprequest object should just have an updated value.

I have tested this on different files, and tinkered with the line so I am reasonably sure that I got it right.

The problem make it impossible to create at download progress bar because of the large amount of memory used.

Also I really don't know this, but I guess bad guy could use this to do bad stuff.
