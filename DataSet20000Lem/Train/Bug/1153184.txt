Persist CSS filter presets for reuse
Bug 1055181 add a nice CSS Filter tooltip to the rule-view, which help with adding/removing/updating filter function to the filter cs property of the selected element.

It would be nice if this new tooltip allowed to save/restore filter presets.
Once you're happy with the change you've made, you might be interested in saving the exact list of filter function and their value with a name, so that you can later restore it.

User workflow:
- select the element to be styled
- add filter: none; in the rule-view
- click on the cs filter tooltip button
- in the tooltip, add some functions, blur, drop-shadow, hue-rotate, ..., tweak the values, sort the functions, ...
- hit the "save filters" button
- the tooltip now show a text input to enter a name for this new preset
Later, when inspecting another element, on another page:
- add filter: none; in the rule-view
- click on the cs filter tooltip button
- in the tooltip, hit the "restore filters" button
- the tooltip now show a list of saved presets, with their names, and filter function
- hit one of the presets
- the tooltip now show the filter values, with the right functions, in the right order, and with the right value
