All of my bookmark are organized in folders. When I pull down the bookmark to see my list, it doesn't reflect what I've done in term of organization. Yes, my folder are still there, but there are single web page also listed, one that I have either organized into a folder or deleted. However, they show up on the pulldown menu. When I go back in to organize the bookmark to get rid of these random pages, they don't exist in the window used to organize bookmarks. I keep waiting for a new release to fix the problem, but maybe I'm the only person OCD enough to notice that my bookmark aren't exactly how I set them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pull down bookmark list and see random page listed.
2. Go to "organize bookmarks" to delete these pages.
3. Pages don't exist there for me to be able to delete them; they only show up in the pulldown.
Actual Results:
Exactly what I said above happens.

Expected Results:
There should be those page listed in the 'organize bookmarks' window in order for me to delete them, but they do not exist.

That's all.
