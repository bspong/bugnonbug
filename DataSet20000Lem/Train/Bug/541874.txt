I'm an application developer and I'm finishing a javascript testing tool. But when I run it on Firefox, I see a rendering problem. The tool ha a console that is a draggable HTML element (using MooTools) and one part of it can be "minimized" to expose element behind it. But when I minimize it and drag the element, the element that were not visible but are now, drag with the element, a if it were part of it.
I have a demo page to

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
You need a complex html to reproduce this bug. You need a hidden element inside a draggable element, being dragged over some HTML content. It seems to be a refresh problem because you can still interact with the content behind it, and passing the mouse over something that redraws it, will show the content that should be visible.
If you need some HTML code that reproduce the problem, I can send you some.
Actual Results:
The content that just become visible, but is behind the hidden elements, is dragged with it, just like if the hidden element wa visible. (It's a rendering problem, dificult to describe it, sorry).

Expected Results:
Should redraw the element every time the element over it is dragged.

If you need more information about this, feel free to contact me.
This doe not break any functionality but user normally don't pas the mouse over thing that they can't see.
