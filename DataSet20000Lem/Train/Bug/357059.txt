I tried to install Firefox 2.0 RC3 over my existig installation and it did not completely upgrade. My extension and setting were there, but it never checked for compatability (Sessionsaver did not work in 2.0 -- if I clicked "Resume Session" it created a tab called "Undefined" that could not be closed without restarting the browser, and my session wa not restored). Also it did not import my bookmarks. (Luckily everything is back to normal now that I reinstalled 1.5.0.7.)

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have FF 1.5.0.7 open, download FF2.0 RC3 installer
2.Run installer, let it close FF
3.Start Firefox 2.0 RC3

Actual Results:
The installer didn't even acknowledge that I had 1.5.0.7. It just told me to quit Firefox then continued installing.

Expected Results:
It should ask if you want to clean install or upgrade.

Maybe the automatic update when 2.0 is released will work properly (is there somewhere I can get that?), but what about user that want to test it before it is released?
