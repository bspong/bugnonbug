Run another experiment with automigration on beta 52 to learn more about how successful the new undo method is
We learned from previous version of automigration experiment on beta that a significant proportion of users, whose data we automatically migrate from another browser, do not take active action to keep / not to keep that data, and instead have the option to do so removed because of change to their bookmark or passwords, or because they sign into sync (after which we could, at that time, no longer guarantee that removing data would not also lose "new" data).

We've since made change to the automigration "undo" functionality such that it is now possible to "undo" those change (ie choose "Don't Keep" for the data when asked by the notification bar) even after other change to bookmarks, history and password are made (either by the user themselves or by them signing into a sync account).

We'd like to know what impact these change have on the number of user that choose to keep or throw away the data we imported for them, by running another experiment on beta. We would also learn from this experiment how successful the new method of "undo" is (ie how often it encounter errors) and how fast/slow it is, in order to gauge how to prioritize making that process faster (and where we should do so).
