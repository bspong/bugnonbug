Windows and tab are not always restored after Reseting Firefox

Windows and tab are not reset all the time after a Firefox reset. I managed to reproduce the issue several times, some time when resetting Firefox having several tab and window opened (in the first window - 2 pinned tabs, 2 normal tabs; in the second window with one tab opened) but in most of the case I reproduced the issue when resetting having one Firefox window opened with one pinned tab and a normal one.

Moreover if I click on the Restore button from the Welcome Back! page, Firefox will be closed without being automatically opened afterwards.

Reproducible: intermittent

Steps to reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox having one pinned tab and one normal tab (in a single window)
2. Go to the about:support page and chose to Reset Firefox
3. Wait for Firefox to be opened and in the Welcome Back! page, click on the Reset button.
4. Repeat step 1-3 until the window and tab list in the Welcome Back page is empty.

Expected results:
The tab opened in step 1 are present in the window and tab list each time. Clicking on the Reset button open the window and tab from the Welcome Back! dialog.

Actual results:
The tab are not reset and Firefox is closed when clicking on the Reset button.
