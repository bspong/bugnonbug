[Reset Firefox] Select which data to preserve/recover (advanced options)

Here's an example UX design:

1. User click "Reset Firefox", open dialogue:

=================================
Are you sure …?

Firefox will try to recover the following data:
• Your Bookmarks
• Your browsing history
• Saved password
• …

Firefox will not recover and fully discard the following data:
• Addons
• Currently opened tab and tab group
• Personal setting
• Website preference
• Customizations and Themes
• …

[Let me chose what to preserve] [Cancel] [Reset Firefox to factory defaults]
=================================

2. User click [Let me chose what to preserve], change the dialogue into the following:

=================================
Choose what data Firefox should try to recover when resetting your profile:
[X] Your Bookmarks
[X] Your browsing history
[X] Saved password
[X] …
[ ] Addons
[ ] Currently opened tab and tab group
[ ] Personal setting
[ ] …

[Use recommended defaults] [Use the selection above]
=================================

3. User selects "Addons" and "Currently opened tab and tab groups", and deselects "Your browsing history".

3. a) User click [Use defaults]. This will return him to the screen under [1] with no change made to the selection.

3. b) User click [Use the selection above]. This will show a confirm screen that is actually the modified screen under [1].

=================================
Are you sure …?

Firefox will try to recover the following data:
• Your Bookmarks
• Saved password
• Currently opened tab and tab group
• …

Firefox will disable but still try to recover the following:
• Addons

Firefox will not recover and fully discard the following data:
• Your browsing history
• Personal setting
• Website preference
• Customizations and Themes
• …

[Let me chose what to preserve] [Cancel] [Reset Firefox to factory defaults]
=================================

4. User click [Reset Firefox to factory defaults]. Day seized.


Wording may be a bit verbose, but (a) I wanted to be a precise a possible, (b) there is no reason to be le precise when this ship because the user trigger a destructive operation here.


Also, you can see that the user decided to keep the addons via ticking the checkbox, but the reset tool will disable all of them automatically (and tell the user what it is about to do). This should be covered a a follow up, though. (I thought I've seen a discussion about preserving addons, with reason for and against it. The main point against it wa that addons are the culprit of most broken Firefox profile and thus should not be restored automatically. The UX design above provides a possible solution with not restoring addons by default, and even if restoring them, they will be disabled.)
