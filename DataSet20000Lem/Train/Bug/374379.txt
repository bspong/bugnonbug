I found a workaround for a bug in firefox that allows me to enter tab into text areas.. and I went to click it, and I expected the little notification thing to show up at the top of the browser or the install extension dialog to show up..

Neither did! it prompted me to download!?!

I realized that having a few dialog open might screw thing up, and when I closed the add bookmark toolbar then tried again, the warning showed up at the top of the screen, and I wa able to allow the site and install the extension.



Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to URL that is not in your trusted download zone
2. click add bookmark (maybe in another tab)
3. (I also have the Add-ons dialog open to Installation, and I have 4 pending installs)
4.click on the .xpi
5. cancel the download
6. close the add bookmark dialog
7. click the .xpi
8. observe proper warning message to show up

Actual Results:
included in step to reproduce

Expected Results:
have the same behavior with or without other dialog box being open.

This may be an implication of other bigger problems.. but probably not

(inconsistency with handling stuff to install)
