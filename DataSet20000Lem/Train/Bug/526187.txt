This happens during my first browser session everyday. I launch the browser, focus the location bar and try to key in "gmail" in order to bring up "https://gmail.google.com" from my history. In earlier version of FF, I could do this without problems. Starting with FF3 (or probably FF3.5) however, there is a delay of several second (3-10 seconds, yes TEN) before I am able to select the desired entry. During this time, the browser freeze and I am unable to type in anything at all.

I assumed that this wa my anti-virus software acting up but this happens on my personal laptop a well (which ha no anti-virus software installed).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Restart computer (Important. This happens only on the first FF instance of the day.)
2. Launch FF
3. Focus location bar
4. Start typing any string which ha a match in your browser history.

Actual Results:
The location bar freeze after several second after some 3-4 character are entered.

Expected Results:
Location bar should work smoothly like it did in FF2.

1. This could be related to the fact that I don't usually shutdown my computer at the end of the day. I set it to hibernate.
2. This could have to do with the fact that we have anti-virus software installed on our office computers.
