I've been struggling with a bug in one of my javascript projects. Eventually I noticed there's a difference in behavior between the PC and Mac versions, even though both are latest version...

This difference make it hard to use event.layerX since the Mac-version is unusable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This HTML code:
<div id="div1" style="width:150px" onmousemove="GetPosition(e);">
<div id="div2" style="width:1000px; overflow: hidden;">
<img src=""><img src=""><img src=""><img src=""><img src="">
</div>
</div>

The javascript
<script>
function GetPosition(e)
{
var posX = e.layerX;
}
</script>
Actual Results:
in Windows version, posX ha the mouse position relative to div2 (note: strangely enough it's not relative to div1, where the even is triggered)

in Mac version, posX appears to be relative to every individual image inside div2, even though the number are still way off...

Expected Results:
Although posX should be relative to div1 logicall (my personal oppinion), the least you could expect is that the javascript engine generates the same result in both PC and Mac version...

I used 2 simple test machine where no specific theme or addons were used.
