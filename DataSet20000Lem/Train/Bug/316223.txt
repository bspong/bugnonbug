When I attempt to import my exported bookmark Firefox crash (not responding and then crash)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bookmark over 550 differnet link and sort them, with the help of map and seperators, and then export them in "manage bookmarks"
2. Import them in "manage bookmarks"


Actual Results:
Firefox crash (not responding and then crash). A few time my computer crashed too and I had to reboot.

Expected Results:
I expect to be able to import my exported bookmark without any problem despite the amount of bookmarked links, 10 or 1000.

I think the problem is related to the amount of link the exported HTML-file include, that is beeing imported. I have tried to import other bookmark that I have exported, with only a few maps, seperators and actual link and that worked fine. Today wa the first time I had a problem with this, the cause is that I wa arranging and sorting all my saved link (saved in txt file etcetera).
