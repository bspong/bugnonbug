It doe fire the onload event when the file are remotely hosted.

To test, pls pull
git clone http://git.sugarlabs.org/git/karma/mainline.git
git checkout conozco
git checkout f4dd5c36

try examples/Conozco-Uruguay/index.html
The City name of the state of Uruguay will still be visible even though they should be hidden. The program should hang with the message "Karma loading" because there is a main loop waiting for the onload event to fire.
