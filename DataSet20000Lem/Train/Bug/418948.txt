When scrolling a page that us a transparent background on some element with a fixed background on the body of the page, the scrolling is tremendously slow and sluggish, and CPU usage shoot up. I'm not sure what the exact circumstance of the problem are, but these are the circumstance in which I can reproduce it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit the URL given.
2. In the very bottom right corner of the page, use the 'Forum theme' drop-down selection box to change the theme to 'Spaced out'.
3. Scroll the page and look at CPU usage a well a what is rendered in the browser window.
Actual Results:
The screen update very slowly and Firefox responds very slowly to input, a it is using a lot of CPU resource (up to 90% on my system) to render the screen while it is scrolled.

Expected Results:
Should render the page much faster, with no noticeable lag. Compare the scroll speed and CPU usage when using other theme on that site, such a the default 'Red'n'Black' skin.

Computer is an AMD Athlon XP 2600 with 1.5 GB RAM. Using default Firefox theme.
