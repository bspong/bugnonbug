Can't use multiple profile concurrently.

I created two profiles, let's call them "A" and "B". I started Mozilla with -P "A". While Mozilla wa running, I launched a second copy with -P "B". The second window actually used profile "A", and no error message wa given.

Why I want to do this: I have multiple Yahoo mail accounts. Yahoo us cooky to identify a user. In order to log in to a second mail account, you first have to log out of the first one. However I want to create a crude process to log me into all my Yahoo mail account with one click of the mouse. As presently implemented, this isn't possible with Mozilla.

Related Discussion: #117222 suggested opening a new cookie container whenever the user owned a new tab with Ctrl-N or Ctrl-T. This generated a great deal of discussion over a long period of time. #245070 suggested a mechanism for switching profile when Mozilla is running. My automation tool are pretty crude (SendKeys function in JScript), so I rather suspect that such a solution won't work for me. #23260 suggested showing which profile is active. 135137: Multiple Gecko based application cannot share profile data -- doesn't seem this would be a problem if I explicitly specify different profile on the command line.

At the very least, the second launch of Mozilla should bring up a message box telling me that I'm not going to get the profile I asked for!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Mozilla with profile "A"
2.While first copy is running, launch Mozilla with profile "B"

Actual Results:
Both window use profile "A"

Expected Results:
Second window, and any window opened with Ctrl-N from the second window should use profile "B".
