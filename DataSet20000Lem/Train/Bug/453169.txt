When accessing http://favorites.live.com and after sign-on with valid account, the favorite are not displayed and the following error is reported in the Error Console:

Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111
(NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIXMLHttpRequest.status]" nsresult: "0x80040111
(NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)" location: "JS frame ::

:: line 61" data: no]
Source File: http://js.shared.live.com/xugouxKQdlbopFQsKLF0!Q/B/AtlasCompat.js
Line: 61

The source line in question is:

Web.Browser._Private.cleanupFirefox = function(el,obj)
{
var newXML;
if (el.status==200)
{

where I guess el is of type nsIXMLHttpRequest.
Do not know of any workaround for user facing this issue against 3rd party web
sites.

Problem did not exist with FireFox 2.X.
Problem is observed also from Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X
10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070206 Firefox/3.0.1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://favorites.live.com
2.Sign-on with proper account (you can create one for free)
3.Your favorite will not appear and error will be produced
Actual Results:
Web page show no favorites, error is posted in Error Console a indicated above.

Expected Results:
The favorite should have been displayed without errors.

This problem prevents the favorites.live.com user from using the service with FireFox 3. Had to revert to FireFox 2.x version to get me using the service again. No workaround is known to me.
