FF 3.5.0 onwards show the new/updated add-on info tab every time

My problem is similar to this problem reported:

488096 min -- Wind nobody@mozilla.org RESO INVA Everytime i load Firefox browser 3.1 beta 3 the add ons window pop up

Somehow after I upgraded to FF 3.5.0 via Check for updates, every time I start up FF 3.5.x onwards it will show "FF ha been updated" info tab along with any new/updated add-on info tab that I have added/updated after FF 3.5.0.

Somehow during the FF 3.5.0 upgrade, there must have been a hiccup and FF 3.5.x onwards forgets to reset the info tab after the first time.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FF
2. FF then show FF updated info tab along with new/updated add-on info tab

Actual Results:
1. I then have to close the tab - very annoying...

Expected Results:
FF should show "FF ha been updated" or new/updated add-on info tab once only then reset to your default home page tab only on next FF start up.
