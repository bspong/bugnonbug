Steps to reproduce:

I have XP SP3. When using a very high speed connection (Google Fiber), Firefox either crash or XP restarts or dump memory (blue screen of death). This ha happened many times. It only happens when using the ultra high speed connection. It is very easy to reproduce when on news website that load and pre-load lot of content.

Steps:
1) Use XP and a high speed connection
2) Start visiting news website that load and pre-load lot of content, such a www.msnbc.com, but I have reproduced it on various news websites.
3) Visit page until your computer crashes, usually within a few minutes, a you open various pages.


Actual results:

I have noted one of several result repeatedly:
1) My computer usually will suddenly begin a physical memory dump, giving me the "blue screen of death",
2) A few time my computer ha just restarted, without the "blue screen of death", a friend with XP ha also had this occur several times, or
3) My friend computer will usually just have Firefox crash.

I have been able to reproduce this repeatedly and a friend using a different computer and the same fiber connection ha also replicated it. We have done it at two different locality that have Google Fiber connections.


Expected results:

I should have been able to continue using the browser and my computer.
