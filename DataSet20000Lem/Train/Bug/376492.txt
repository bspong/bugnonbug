Apple Safari place in /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ the following plugins for Java Appletes :
Java Applet Plugin Enabler
Java Applet.plugin (10.0.2)
JavaPluginCocoa.bundle (11.5.0)

If JavaPluginCocoa.bundle is present (Java Applet Plugin Enabler and Java Applet.plugin can also removed) firefox fails to accept on a called applet with a modal login popup window the login password. Thereafter login popup reappears continuous and firefox ha to killed to get out of this situation. If the Plugin JavaPluginCocoa.bundle is removed from /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ Apple Safari fails to load the applet but on firefox the applet login is sucessfull. I think the problem could be resolved, if firefox is not allowed to load the JavaPluginCocoa.bundle even if it is present in the /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ folder.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. place the Apple Safari plugin JavaPluginCocoa.bundle to /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ (should be already there)
2. open in firefox an applet with a default login request, enter user and password to appropriate field -> password can not be entered to the field -> login process fails

****
3. remove the Apple Safari plugin JavaPluginCocoa.bundle to /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/
4. 2. open in firefox an applet with a default login request, enter user and password to appropriate field -> login process is successful (assuming user and password are correct)
Actual Results:
with Apple Safari plugin JavaPluginCocoa.bundle present at /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ firefox fails to accept password at an default applet login.

Expected Results:
firefox should work independently of the presence of the Apple Safari plugin JavaPluginCocoa.bundle in /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/
