Up until 5 day ago I could access the website with no problem. Now when I try to do the same thing, the browser crashes. I can pull the same site up on MSIE, so it is a valid website and functioning properly.

I thought it wa an add-on problem, so I got rid of all add-ons. No help. Then I reloaded another copy of FF, newest version, thinking any bug would clear out. No help.

I checked the security system for both Windows Vista, the HP desktop I am using and Trendmicro security software. I am not the swift when it come to diagnostics so I amy have missed doing something that would have helped the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FF. Type in http://www.sigmakappa-phoenix.org
2. Click on Enter. Wait, Screen go to muted white and a MS dialog box show up telling me that Windows is closing FF, also offering to find a solution online.
3.Browser closes.
Actual Results:
The Windows dialog box state that Windows" Data Execution Prevention ha closed FF. Then the browser closes.

Expected Results:
FF should be able to open http://www.sigmakappa-phoenix.org, a it had done previously (past 5 day ago).

I also tried opening FF in safe mode. Still had the same problem. :-(
