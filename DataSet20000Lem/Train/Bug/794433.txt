Can't launch metro browser using latest elm nightly
Something isn't quite working right yet with nightlies. Will keep poking at this.

1) Uninstalled all version of firefox

2) Purged the registry of ~95% of metro/desktop/zip build related entry (will attache a reg script)

3) set IE a the default browser through control panel and confirmed metroie work

4) deleted all firefox related start menu entry in:
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs

5) Installed the latest elm nightly

6) from firefox on the desktop, clicked - option -> advanced -> general -> Make nightly a default button

(Nightly had 1 out of 8 default to start, after it had all 8)

7) closed desktop firefox

8) Launched metro.

There wasn't a nightly shortcut in the metro interface to open. (This might be due to past unpining of older Nightly icons.)

9) Opened up C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs, right-clicked the Nightly link, and selected pin to start menu.

From metro, the link launched the desktop browser.

10) Reset the default browser again and tried the metro start menu link, same result.

Looking at the shortcut, linktool provides the following:

PKEY_AppUserModel_IsDualMode found
PKEY_AppUserModel_ID found value: 'EEFEA8717BC47F65'

So link prop look good.

Misc. notes:

- the latest elm uninstall didn't remove the Nightly start menu link
- the control panel opened in the background, despite being closed prior to setting the default browser. We should file a tracking bug on this to record any issue by users.
