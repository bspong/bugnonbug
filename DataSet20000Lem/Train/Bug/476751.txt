should have left and right border, well it doe - if you scroll around middle of the page it is there, but is not the the top nor bottom.

When about one third of the content is removed border are all the way. It doe not seem to be related which part of content is taken out, but rather the total height of the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/page/cid/news.html
2. As page is loading, there is border around the main content region that seems to disappear before page load finishes.

4. Use Firebug (or any other tool) to remove about one third of the content - now border are all the way along the main content.
Actual Results:
Only part of border is visible

Expected Results:
Whole border should be visible
