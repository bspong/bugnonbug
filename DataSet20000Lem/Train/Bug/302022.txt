The patch for bug #292737 blocked the exploit to execute arbitrary code with a
javascript URL in the "Set a Wallpaper" dialog. On the one hand it is blocked
because the context menu option is disabled when the image is not valid, on the
other hand it is blocked by a check inside setWallpaper.xul (static check for
javascript scheme).

By changing the src attibute of the image file with a setTimeout function, it is
possible to get the context menu with active "Set a Wallpaper" option and then
inject another URL into the dialog. The scheme check inside the dialog is still
working, but you can get around the usual url check and access local file for
example.

This doe not lead to any active vulnerability right now (well, beside the
"evil" ability to make the user set another background image then he see in the
page and in the preview *g*). But the ability to access arbitrary file look
like a recipe for trouble to me. Am i paranoid? Anyway, I suggest fixing the
"timing" attack vector if possible. Is a fix like this used in other places?


Reproducible: Always




<img src="test.jpg" onmousedown="setTimeout('doit()',1000)" width="300"
height="200" id="myimg">
<script>
function doit(){
myimg = document.getElementById("myimg");
myimg.src = "file:///C:/WINDOWS/Web/Wallpaper/Tulips.jpg";
myimg.width = 300;
myimg.height = 200;
};
</script>

An interesting side effect is that the old image keep being displayed when you
change the src attribute and width/height. I would expect a broken image icon.
