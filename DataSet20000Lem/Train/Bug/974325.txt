Some toolbar button keep being moved/readded to some toolbars after a restart
I don't have specific STR for this bug, but I noticed that it mainly happens when I move stuff around, on the next restart, my toolbar layout get messed up even more.

I keep having the same toolbar item being moved/readded to some toolbars. This is REALLY annoying, and I can't live with this anymore. It started happening one or two week ago.

This issue doesn't happen in safe mode or on a clean profile.
I'll try to restart with addon disabled see if the issue still happens.

Additional info :
The button that are readded/moved :
- Copy/Paste control (to the navbar)
- Zoom control (to the navbar)
- Home button (to the navbar)
- Find button (to the navbar)
- Some Classic theme restorer item that I removed from the toolbars (to the navbar)
- Some addon icon (mainly jetpack ones, to the ctr addon bar)
- A flexible space from CTR (to the addon bar)
