Actual Results:
Get popup warnings/confirmations, see detail

Expected Results:
User should not be prompted for information.

I believe it is a bug to have warning message boxes, after all warning have been disabled by the user. These are usability issue that detract from an otherwise excellent product.

If a browser advertises a pop up blocker, it should not cause them itself, especially if the user chooses to turn them off.

If user request a page refresh, he should not be asked "are you sure".
