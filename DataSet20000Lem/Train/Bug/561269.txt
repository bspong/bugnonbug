Random Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library crash while browsing Firefox.

I've looked around for this similar issue with others, and they all came across quite the same. But I noticed that there's had different detail at the bottom.

My error show the following:
______________________________________
Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Error

Runtime Error!

Program: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

abnoraml program termination.
_______________________________________

This happens randomly, it usually happens between 2-4 hour of browsing.
There are no step I can reproduce, I'm usually browsing my forum and or facebook when I come across this error.

Weird thing is, it ha never happened to me before. This started a few day ago.
I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still having the same error.


Reproducible: Always




I am using the "BlackFox V1 1.1.5" Theme.
I have AdBlock plus and Java Consoles a add-ons, along with Wyyo.

Two thing that I thought were quite strange about my plugins though:
1) MetaStream 3 Plugin - "disabled for my protection"
2) Hotbar Firefox Plugin - no idea how and why that got into my plugins
