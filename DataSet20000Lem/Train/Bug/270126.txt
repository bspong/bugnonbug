Import during install of Firefox fails to collect any shortcut to local HTML
page from my Favorites folder. It doe however manage to import all of my
"Internet Shortcut"s.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a local HTML file in IE.
2. Drag the document icon from the location box onto IE's Links bar (this
creates a Shortcut, rather than an Internet Shortcut).
3. Install Firefox and import IE favorites.
Actual Results:
Firefox import all internet shortcuts, but no (regular windows) shortcuts.

Expected Results:
Firefox's link bar should contain all shortcut (internet or otherwise), or
internet shortcut to the same shortcuts. Changing a local file link to a URL
would just involve prepending it with file:/// and reversing any backslashes.
Changing a UNC path (eg \\machine\share\file.html) file link to a URL would
involve prepending it simply with file: and reversing backslashes.

A workaround for the import problem would be to copy the shortcut into Firefox
by hand, but this can be time consuming and frustrating (since it's awkward to
compare the content of the Favorites folder with those in the bookmark
manager, and painful to add new shortcut for each link missing).

Also, technically speaking, file: URLs should not need rewriting at all (they're
meant to get passed unchanged to the underlying filesystem), but Firefox doesn't
seem to do this the way I'd expect either. Opening UNC file directly into
Firefox result in URLs like "file://///machine/share/file.html", which is silly.
