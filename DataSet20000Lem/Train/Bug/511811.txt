High PF Usage when opening Yahoo Mail in Firefox 3.5.X

I've noticed that PF Usage sometimes sky rockets, memory usage go above 1,4 Gb and this is happening only after I upgraded to FireFox 3.5.x onward (I've been using FireFox since 0.7 version).

At first I thought this wa random until I realized it wa happening only when I used FireFox and more specifically when I wa checking my Yahoo Mail account. Same thing happened when I upgraded FireFox on a notebook and opened Yahoo Mail.
Thing is it doe not happen every time so I'm not sure which part of Yahoo Mail + FireFox trigger the high PF Usage but if I use FireFox and no matter how many tab I open with various site opened a long a I don't open Yahoo Mail it work just fine.

When it happens it totally slows down my machine and I normally have to 'kill' FireFox from Task Manager by 'End Process' otherwise it doe not go away.

Any idea how to fix this problem?

I would really like to stick with FireFox but this problem is really very annoying.

Thanks and keep up the Great work!
