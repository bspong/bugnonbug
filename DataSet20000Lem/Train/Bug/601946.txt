Build ID in application.ini and pref 'browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID' do not match
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0b7pre) Gecko/20101005 Firefox/4.0b7pre

Build ID in application.ini and about:support 'browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID' (which is the same a Firefox.exe->File properties->Version->Build ID) do not match.

There ha been confusion about which Build ID is correct; in the latest two nightly forum thread http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2005457&start=73 & http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2006153&start=60.

FWIW
In searching to see if this is a know bug (or an expected result), I have found bug talking about the possibility of dropping the Build ID completely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the application.ini file in the Minefield application directory, and look at the [App]->BuildID=
2. Open 'about:support' and check 'browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID', or in Minefield directory look at Firefox.exe->file Properties->Version->Build ID.
3. The Build ID in step #1 & 2 are different.
Actual Results:
The Build ID in "application.ini" and "about:support->browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID" (or Firefox.exe->file Properties->Version->Build ID) are different.

Expected Results:
The Build ID should match?

If not which Build ID is real?
