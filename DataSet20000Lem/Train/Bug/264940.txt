UI broken and firefox turn into a big useless blank webpage
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Opera 7.60 [en] (IBM EVV/3.0/EAK01AG9/LE)
Build Identifier: 1.0PR full install version...cannot get build identifier string from moz

I did install FF 0.9 and then install 1.0PR over it without uninstalling FF0.9.
I never had any problem with it until after I updated some extensions. I
thought it might be because of the FF1.0PR installing over an old version but
then I uninstalled the whole mess and I still get the same result.

I cannot click on the UI. I click on the URL bar and I get a scrollbar that
sits on the left side of the FF window. I cannot click on any of the menu at
the top of the FF window. I can interact with the menu using alt+<key> key
but graphically FF doesn't show the menu being opened at all. I can type
something in the search box but nothing show up. FF connects with Google but
show the same blank page.

For a graphic example please look here:

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install strange extensions<?>
2. carelessly install FF 1.0PR over 0.9<?>
3. uninstall said jumbled installation and watch the same result occur?

Actual Results:
I'm not sure what the cause is so the above step are actually just guesses.

Expected Results:
Run and open to firefox's default homepage with responsive UI.
