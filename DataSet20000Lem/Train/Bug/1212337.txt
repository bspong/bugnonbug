Search term with empty suggestion break future valid suggestion from displaying
Occurs on 41 and 44, OSX 10.11, Google a default search, suggestion are on.

Searching for a term that doe not have any result in the response array, for example:

https://www.google.com/complete/search?client=firefox&q=ç©

responds with:

["ç©",[]]

Will stop future valid suggestion from displaying in the suggestion list, even though the response to those search contains an array of suggestions. A restart of Firefox will fix this, but that shouldn't be needed.

Steps:

1. Perform a search for a known good search (such a "a") to verify search suggestion are on and working, 10 suggestion should be returned in the network response a expected, and those 10 suggestion should be displayed in the suggestion list.

2. Perform a search with a term that doesn't return result (such a the above example, "ç©"), note that no suggestion are returned in the network response and nothing is displayed in the suggestion list (perhaps a message should be shown in the suggestion list? Like "No suggestion for search <search term>").

3. Perform a search again for a known good search (such a "a"), 10 suggestion are returned in the network response a expected, however they are not displayed in the suggestion list.

No future search suggestion will display until firefox is restarted.
