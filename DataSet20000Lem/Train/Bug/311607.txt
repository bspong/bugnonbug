There's an option to "Select new tab opened from links." However, I want
basically the same feature if the destination tab is already open. In previous
version of Firefox, I've been able to set the option to do so. v1.5 beta 1
seems to have taken that option away.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a webpage with selectable links, eg. my.yahoo.com (first tab).
2. Open new tab (second tab).
3. Select (go back to) the first tab.
4. Drag any link from first tab to second tab. Release mouse button.

Actual Results:
Focus remains on first tab. Second tab, which is now loading a new page, remains
in the background.

Expected Results:
(Given the appropriate customizable option), second tab should be brought to
focus/foreground when mouse button's released.

Again, I realize the developer may prefer the current behavior (though I'd be a
bit surprised). But at least give u the option so we don't have to click on the
tab every time.

I'm filing this under minor bug rather than enhancement because it's a
previously available feature that's been lost, whether by chance or choice.
