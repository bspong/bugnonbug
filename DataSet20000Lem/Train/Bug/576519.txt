If a picture or a different downloaded object (also website to be stored) is tried to save using the "save as" option, a longer delay occurs (in my case about one minute) until a message is shown "C:Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/modules/XPCOMUtils.jsm:165" or similar.
After confirmation that the unresponsive script ha to be executed, the script end successfully.

This strange behaviour happens just ONCE per firefox session, all subsequent save are carried out immediately errorless.

This behaviour occurs since FF3.0, not with former version


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox
2.Choose any object to be saved
3.Choose "Save as"

Actual Results:
Delay of ~1 minute (screen freezes)

Expected Results:
Message unresponsive script "C:Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox/modules/XPCOMUtils.jsm:165"
should script be stopped or not

Sometimes (maybe in one case of 30) the script run through the first time without message....

Tried already to install FF new, without addons resp. in safe mode, nothing helped
