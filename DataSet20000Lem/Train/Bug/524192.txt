When connecting to an FTP URI through a proxy with the username and password embedded in the URI, we get a superfluous authentication warning message.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.3) Gecko/20090824 Firefox/3.5.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

We have to have user connect to an extranet server to retrieve and view files. We do this by launching Firefox with the URI a a command line parameter. The URI is to an FTP site that ha the username embedded in it like this:

ftp://username:password@ftp.site.com/path/to/file.ext

This ha worked fine for some time when we were connecting directly. Due to contractual requirement we are now required to establish all connection through a proxy server. We're using Squid 2.6.STABLE18 on Ubuntu 8.04 server, and authenticating the user to the proxy with NTLM authentication. This work fine in all tested circumstance except for the one above. When we try to connect to a URI like that, we get the following incorrect warning:

You are about to log in to the site "ftp.site.com" with the username "username", but the website doe not require authentication. This may be an attempt to trick you

Is "ftp.site.com" the site you want to visit?

[Yes] [No]

Selecting [Yes] will connect just fine and retrieve / view the file in question. Selecting [No] will result in an authentication error with the FTP site.
