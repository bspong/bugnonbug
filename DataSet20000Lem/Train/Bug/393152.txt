When I go to this page I get the following message:
Norton Internet Worm Protection ha detected and blocked in intrusion attempt.

Intrusion: HTTP MS IE Object Element Data DoS.
Intruder: images.apple.com(81.23.243.153)(http)80)).
Risk level: medium.
Protocol: TCP.
Attacked IP: my ip address.
Attacked port: nsvt-stream(1570).

The page http://www.apple.com/nl will give me this:
Norton Internet Worm Protection ha detected and blocked in intrusion attempt.

Intrusion: HTTP MS IE Object Element Data DoS.
Intruder: localhost(http-proxy(8080)).
Risk level: medium.
Protocol: TCP.
Attacked IP: localhost.
Attacked Port: my port.

This happens on the Apple site more often than not, although I use FireFox only. It doesn't crash FF, the page or part of the page just won't be loaded because Norton block them. But Norton doe assume that it's IE and that it ha the same vulnerability.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to one of the sites.
2.Use Norton Antivirus (might be a problem though) :(
3.Look at the window that Norton flash at you.
Actual Results:
Window won't load: all is blocked or part of it.

Expected Results:
Same thing, Norton flash the message.

FF is causing Norton to react to a vulnerability described for IE. This is odd and make me wonder if FF ha the same problem. I am not technical enough to research this more and I hope you can help.
