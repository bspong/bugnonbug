network.protocol-handler.app.mailto sends "mailto:" prefix with address
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040213 Firefox/0.8

This may only be a gentoo problem (thanks to emerging and compiling the source
separately), but currently, after setting network.protocol-handler.app.mailto
and setting the location to "/usr/bin/MozillaThunderbird", the location of the
Thunderbird startup script a set up by Gentoo, I found that it worked properly
except that it wa sending the "mailto:" prefix along with the address. I know
I can use perl and/or awk to offset this, but I'd rather see it fixed in Firefox
^^;;

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.pipian.com/ with network.protocol-handler.app.mailto set to
some program (presumably Thunderbird, but it might happen with others)
2. Click on the pipian@pipian.com link at the bottom
3. Watch a your mail app open a to-box including mailto: with the address.

Actual Results:
The external mailto app (in this case Thunderbird) opened with a To address of
mailto:pipian@pipian.com

Expected Results:
The to address should have read "pipian@pipian.com"

Just so you know, here is the content of MozillaThunderbird (for the 0.4
ebuild) partially edited by me IIRC:

#!/bin/sh

# This is the Gentoo Thunderbird startup script
# Additions, suggestions?
# contact astralstorm <astralstorm@gorzow.mm.pl>

export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME="/usr/lib/MozillaThunderbird"
THUNDERBIRD_PATH="/usr/lib/MozillaThunderbird"

if [ -z "`/bin/ps x | /bin/grep \"[0-9] ${THUNDERBIRD_PATH}/thunderbird-bin\"`"$
# No MozillaThunderbird running
${THUNDERBIRD_PATH}/thunderbird $@
else
# MozillaThunderbird running
${THUNDERBIRD_PATH}/thunderbird -remote "mailto($@)"
fi
