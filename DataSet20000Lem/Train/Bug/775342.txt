ZDNET.COM redirects to ZDNET.COM.CN on subsequent visits, Only FF and not IE
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0
Build ID: 20120717110313

Steps to reproduce:

From my Boston based Verizon ISP, whenever I first visit www.zdnet.com (216.239.120.66) using any version of Firefox it work a expected, but on any future visit I am redirected to www.zdnet.com.cn (118.67.120.299) using either IE9, FF or a ping command.

To clear this anomaly, I need to reconnect my Verizon GT704WGB modem. Once cleared, it work a expected.

Using IE9 only, on my first or any future visit to www.zdnet.com (216.239.120.66) it always work to the correct address.

Only when I use Firefox doe the redirection to www.zdnet.com.cn occur.

When I use Firefox inside a Virtual Machine, I get the same redirection issue to www.zdnet.com.cn (118.67.120.299) using any connection through my Verizon modem, until I reboot the modem. This included the host PC's internet connections.

I have scanned my Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 PC with multiple virus and anti-malware program with no report of issues.

The problem/redirection issue appears to be with www.zdnet.com and Firefox.


Actual results:

ZDNET.COM go to a ZDNET.COM.CN China site (118.67.120.299)


Expected results:

www.zdnet.com from the United States should go to US site (216.239.120.66).

This correct behavior occurs with IE9 a expected.

It fails with any recent version of Firefox
