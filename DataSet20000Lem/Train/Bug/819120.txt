Steps to reproduce:

I used Firefox to open Google (https://www.google.com) a normal. I typed "firefox" into the search box. The drop down menu showed the word "firefox" a well a other choices. I pressed Enter.


Actual results:

The page would not load. I also tried pressing the blue "search" button and the result on the drop down menu. Nothing worked.

The same problem also happens no matter WHAT I type into the search box. I am just using "firefox" a an example.

I used the Web Console to look at the problem. A screenshot is attached. The GET request seemed to be fine, but then I got a strange "HTTP/1.1 204 No Content" error. That seems to be the problem, but I don't know what it means.

I have another PC (Windows XP, Firefox 17.0.1) that ha the exact same problem. Google worked fine on both PCs several day ago. I have tried regular Google (http://www.google.com) and the same thing happened. If I go to the Google setting page and turn off "Google Instant", everything works, but without the "Instant" feature.

If I refresh the empty Google page, my result are displayed a normal.


Expected results:

The Google result should have loaded after I pressed Enter or pressed the search button. Also, I should add that IE8 and IE9 worked fine... the Instant result actually loaded.

I also tried using my 10.5.8 Macintosh, with Firefox 16.0.2. The exact same problem happened.

I should also add that I tried using Firefox's Safe Mode. It did not work. I have tried disabling hardware acceleration and enabling the referrer (I disabled it). Nothing worked.
