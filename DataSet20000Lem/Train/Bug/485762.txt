I have downloaded Firefox 3.0.8 a few hour ago. On restart all my bookmarks, including bookmark toolbar, and history have disappeared.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032608 Firefox/3.0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032608 Firefox/3.0.8

I have checked under your forum and on other reported bugs. It is similar to the problem reported at 482127. Before I got to this bug reporting page, I had tried following instruction on restoring bookmark from your forum, but that doe not appear to have worked (I added the following text: DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib ; export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ;
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin" in the Terminal box in Utilities.

Since then restarting I now also have lost the use of the back and forward buttons.

I have never had such a problem with a Firefox update previously.

I am reluctant to attempt to apply all the step in 482127 a I don't think I have the technical knowledge to do so.

Can you please advise? I understand that bookmark are backed up 5 time a day and that there is a need to act quickly.

Thank you
