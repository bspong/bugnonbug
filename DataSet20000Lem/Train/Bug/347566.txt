Modifying the default font size from 16 to 14 in Firefox 1.5.04 can cause entire section of a page to not be displayed in the print preview or on paper when actually printed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Modify default font size such that to 14,
2. Go to this URL http://maps.yahoo.com/dd_result?newaddr=W+End+Ave+At+Murphy+Rd&taddr=2905+North+Mount+Juliet+Road&csz=Nashville%2C+TN+37203&country=us&tcsz=Mount+Juliet%2C+TN&tcountry=us
3. Notice that their are 6 line of driving directions.
4. Click File - Print Preview.
5. Notice that their are fewer than 6 line of driving directions.
Actual Results:
In my case, I can see in the print preview line 1 through 3:
1. Start on WEST END AVE (at W END AVE & MURPHY RD in NASHVILLE) - go 0.2 mi
2. Turn Left onto I-440 EAST - go 5.8 mi
3. Take the I-24 WEST Left exit toward NASHVILLE/KNOXVILLE - go 1.0 mi

Expected Results:
I'd expect to see when viewed in print preview or when printed to paper, what I see in the normal browser window, which is 6 line of driving directions:

1. Start on WEST END AVE (at W END AVE & MURPHY RD in NASHVILLE) - go 0.2 mi
2. Turn Left onto I-440 EAST - go 5.8 mi
3. Take the I-24 WEST Left exit toward NASHVILLE/KNOXVILLE - go 1.0 mi
4. Take exit #52B onto I-40 EAST toward KNOXVILLE - go 12.7 mi
5. Take exit #226B/TN-171 NORTH onto MT JULIET RD[TN-171] toward MT JULIET - go 3.3 mi
6. Arrive at 2905 N MOUNT JULIET RD, MOUNT JULIET, on the Right

It may be necessary to make other change to the font preference in order to reproduce. I initially thought that this error wa caused by changing all proportional font to be Bitstream Vera Sans. However I wa able to reproduce the problem by only changing the default font size setting. In my case the default wa 16 and my custom setting wa 14.

This bug sorta caused me to miss a funeral and should be fixed if can be replicated and actually doe affect other users.
