In the Bookmarks menu on the top, if you right click on a grayed out option (e.g. Subscribe to This Page... when you cannot) and then click "copy," it copy the url of all your bookmark in that menu. While this might be useful, if you have a lot of bookmarks, it kind of crash firefox for a few second because there's so much text being transferred to the clipboard. I don't see why you can copy something that you couldn't normally right click.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site with no RSS (e.g. Bugzilla)
2. Go to bookmark menu (alt+b on Windows) and right click on "Subscribe to This Page..." then click copy
3. Open a text editor and click paste--you should see all the url for your bookmark
Actual Results:
It copied the url of all of my bookmark in that menu

Expected Results:
First of all, there shouldn't be a "copy" option for an option which you can't normally click--you can't really copy the "Subscribe to This Page...". Also, it probably should have copied the text "Subscribe to This Page..." or nothing at all.

If you have a lot of bookmarks, this might make FireFox not responding for a few seconds.
