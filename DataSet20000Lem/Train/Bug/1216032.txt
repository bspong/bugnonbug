"FindBar Tweak" addon disables the "layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation" pref, breaking double-click text selection on OS X
Enabling the "FindBar Tweak" add-on now disables the "layout.word_select.stop_at_punctuation" pref, breaking double-click text selection on OS X.

STR:
1. Install FindBar Tweak addon:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/findbar-tweak/
2. Double-click a word in the address bar URL.

RESULT:
The entire URL is selected instead of just the word double-clicked. Other FindBar Tweak functionality seems to have stopped working recently and may be related to this problem.

I bisected this regression to the following pushlog, which back out three billm bugs. So backing out these bug seems to have *caused* this FindBar Tweak problem?!
