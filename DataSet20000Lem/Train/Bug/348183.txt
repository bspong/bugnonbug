scenario where clicking cancel in the "closing window with <n> tab open" prompt close the window, instead of keeping it open
scenario where clicking cancel in the "closing window with <n> tab open" prompt close the window, instead of keeing it open

this may be related to bug #331457 or bug #327139

step to reproduce aren't perfect, but I am able to reproduce this.

1) quickly open many tab at once, using ctrl t
2) hit the close [x] on the window
3) get the confirm to close window with open tab prompt
4) hit cancel

expected results: window doe not close
actual results: window close

in my console I see:

JavaScript error: , line 0: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returne
d failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIDOMWindowInternal.focus]" nsr
esult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/c
ontent/bindings/tabbrowser.xml :: setFocus :: line 773" data: no]

it is coming from the elemet.focus() call in setFocus() in browser.xml

function setFocus(element) {
document.commandDispatcher.suppressFocusScroll = true;

if (element instanceof Window ||
element instanceof NSHTMLElement ||
element instanceof XULElement) {
element.focus();
}
document.commandDispatcher.suppressFocusScroll = false;
}

gavin, perhaps we should wrap that call to focus with a try / catch in addition to figuring out why it is failing?
