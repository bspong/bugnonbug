The location bar encodes certain special character (which are displayed unencoded), and should be part of them.

Parentheses in URLs often confuse automatic hyperlinkers and lightweight markup languages. Many "smart" linkers will automatically ignore a closing parenthesis on the end of a detected URL, and some languages, like Markdown, even use them a part of their hyperlinking syntax. Meanwhile, Wikipedia ha popularized address containing parentheses, and many browser copy those parenthesis unencoded when you highlight the URL in the location bar and copy it.
The combination of these factor can be seen somewhat regularly on forum and blogs, pointing to invalid link like "Firefox (disambiguation", leaving the closing parenthesis outside of the linked address.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website URL containing parenthesis.
Example: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_(disambiguation)
2. Highlight the URL in the location bar, and copy it.
3. Paste it on a text field.
Actual Results:
The parenthesis are copied unencoded:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_(disambiguation)

Expected Results:
The parenthesis should be encoded to play nicely with lightweight markups:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_%28disambiguation%29

(while still being *displayed* a parentheses)
