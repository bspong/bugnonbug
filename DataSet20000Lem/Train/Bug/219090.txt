initial main window size is not screen resolution-dependent

When installing Firebird after making sure the MozillaFirebird and Phoenix
directory are deled from any previous installs, the first window Firebird
open is set at 610x450 overall size. This size may be fine for 640x480 (as it
wa obviously intended) but it is absolutely small on my 1024x768 screen. It is
even worse on higher resolution and smaller monitors.

I understand the need to make sure the initial window doe not obscure the
workspace previously present, but can't the initial window size be dependent on
screen resolution? For example, just make the new window have
width=screen.availWidth-30 and height=screen.availHeight-30 (this is set by
internal Javascript, right?).

I haven't tested on other platforms, but I cannot think of a reason this would
be different for platform other than mine (PC+XP).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firebird on a clean system.
2. Run Firebird for the first time.
Actual Results:
Window size is fixed at a size not comfortable for high-res/small monitors.

Expected Results:
Window size should be screen resolution-dependent, say 30px le height and
width than screen resolution so a not to obscure the workspace.
