Mac OS X 10.3.9 - only Admin. account have permission to open Firefox 1.5
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.75C-CCK-MCD {C-UDP; EBM-APPLE} (Macintosh; U; PPC)
Build Identifier: Mozilla 5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

I placed Firefox 1.5 in the Applications folder of Mac OS X 10.3.9. I found that "Adminstrator" account could open it, but "Managed" account could not -- a window popped up saying "You have insufficient permission to open this application" (or word to this effect) even though Get Info said "Others" _do_ have "Read only" permission.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. While in an Administrator account, download Firefox 1.5.dmg; double click the disk image. A new window open showing graphically what to do next.
2. Drag the Firefox icon into the Applications folder a instructed by the graphic. Double click the icon and observe that Firefox open (you may have to do this two time before it actually open -- that is the subject of another bug report by someone else).
3. Now switch to another user account of type "Managed", double click on Firefox icon in Applications folder, and see the window pop up saying you don't have sufficient permission.

Actual Results:
See item 3 above.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have opened normally in the managed accounts.

There is a workaround suggested by an Apple Care representative: Temporarily change each Managed account to an Admin. account, open Firefox while logged in to each of these accounts, and then change them back to Managed; afterward they retain their ability to open Firefox at will.
