URL bar force Google search instead of actually going to website.

Steps to reproduce:

First of all, fuck you for making me register with your website to report a fucking bug. Seriously. Fuck you. If I get one piece of spam from you, this is going on a Twitter account with 50,000 followers.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start typing the URL of a website you frequently visit in the URL bar of the latest Firefox. For example, If you frequently visit "reddit.com", start typing "redd" and "reddit.com" will show up for a split second. Now, if I press "enter" while "reddit.com" is showing up in the URL bar, I expect this browser to take me to reddit.com. However, a soon a you press "enter", Firefox submits a Google search for "redd" instead of taking you to reddit.com.

This seems to qualify for your client reward a it is a serious security threat. Firefox force the user to submit a Google search query before actually going to the website. This is huge. It mean Firefox submits thousands, if not million of unwarranted search result to Google every day.

This may not seem like a big problem to an every day user, but please make this known to the top people at Firefox.

This is a MAJOR PROBLEM. This is forcing Google to show irrelevant search results, record the browsing habit of million of users, and is quite frankly pissing me the fuck off every time it happens.

I would appreciate a monetary reward. Please let me know how I can receive this reward.


Actual results:

Firefox forced an unwarranted Google search for "redd", exposing my browsing habit to Google.


Expected results:

Firefox should have went straight to "reddit.com" instead of forcing a Google search for "redd".
