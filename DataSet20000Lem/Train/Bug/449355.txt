This also applies to attempting to close tab in the browser. This doe not appear to be a mouse sensitivity problem a attempting to click on the same link in the same page in Safari doe not result in this problem. This occurs a very high percentage of the time, although not 100% of the time. Note that after trying this in Safari, the problem appeared to go away in Firefox. However, the problem occurs in Firefox quite frequently.
