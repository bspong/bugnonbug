I recently updated my Quicktime software. Since then, when I select Real Player
a my preferred audio player, I get the window with "open with Quicktime Player
(default)" and no other options, then I get the "unsupported transport" in the
Quicktime player. This ha happened at the http://www.npr.org and at other site
offering Real Player. The problem doe not arise in Safari or Explorer. NPR sent
me the following solution, but it did not work:

"For Macintosh OS X:
In the Finder, locate the folder where your Web browser downloads it files.
This default to the desktop folder. In the list of files, find one that end
with ".smil," for example: "npr1337.smil." Right-click (or control-click) on the
".smil" file in the Finder, and select "Get Info." In the window that pop up,
click the triangle to the left of the "Open With:" text, so that it point
downward. (If it is already pointing downward, there is no need to click it.)
Click on the drop-down box that say "Adobe GoLive CS (default)" or "QuickTime
Player", and select "RealPlayer." Click "Change All." Restart your Mac."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on any "Listen" button
2. Select "Real Player" a the preferred audio player
Actual Results:
A dialog box appears asking me what Firefox should do with this file. In the
open with option it say "Quicktime (default)" with no other options.

Expected Results:
In the "open with" list it should give me the Real Player option, then launch in
Real Player
