Possible bug entering Standby in WinXPPro SP3

I updated to v3.6.10 when it wa first released.

I like to keep three iteration of Firefox open, each with various individual tabs.

Since updating to the current version roughly one in every 5-10 attempt to enter Standby mode my display will blank, but the fan continues to run -- the unit obviously not going to sleep, but unresponsive to mouse, keystroke or key combinations.
(There are no active downloads in-progress at the time.)

The only way to resolve this is to force a shutdown by holding down the power button.

Upon power-up, when I restart Firefox I get two tabs. The focus is on the second tab which is your 'Welcome to 3.6.10' a if I had just updated.

The first (hidden) tab is the 'well, this is embarrassing...' tab.

I have now switched to entering Standby with only one iteration of Firefox open, and so far have not had the above phenomenon.
But I would like to be able to have more than one Firefox pane open.

Could you please check this out?
Thanks.
