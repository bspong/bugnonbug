Using "Load Images", "For the originating website only", and "Exceptions" to block ad
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Firefox is an absolutely excellent browser. Just have to say that up front. On
thing that I think would make it even better is if I could choose "Load Images",
"For the originating website only", and then choose exception for those two
rules. For example, many news site have most of their presentation image
hosted on their site, but then have their image or Macromedia ad hosted off
site. There are just a few website that I have visited where pertinent content
for the page is hosted off site, and those site would be the "Exceptions".
Also, more sophisticated site are starting to use javascript to
document.write('<IFRAME SRC="http://ad.doubleclick.net..."') or
document.write('<scr'+'ipt language=javascript
src="http://a.tribalfusion.com..."') ad into their site, but the content is
still off site. I have used Guidescope to block image in the past, but it
cannot handle the Macromedia files, and blocking them through the browser would
be the best option.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox.
2. Go to www.cnn.com.
3. Notice that it host it image at i.cnn.net.

Actual Results:
Front and center image wa blocked.

Expected Results:
Been able to track this page a an exception to the rule that "All page should
load image only from their own site."

I used the Advanced Query to check Bugzilla, and it didn't seem like there wa a
similar feature request/bug report.
