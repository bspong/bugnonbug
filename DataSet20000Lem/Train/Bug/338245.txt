Problems ha happened twice now, seemingly random. All of a sudden, each keystroke produce double text output. For example, typing "car" will produce "ccaarr". I'm working with a MBP 2.0GHz with 2GB RAM, and the version of Bon Echo 2.0a2 listed above. Mac OSX 10.4.6, all update current.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in text box (I've seen it in forum reply and username/password fields)
2.Each keystroke produce double output
3.

Actual Results:
Each keystroke doubled

Expected Results:
Keystrokes should produce normal, single output

I've just been using this version for a short time; I've come across this issue twice now in two days. Seemingly random. 1st time wa logging in to community college e-resources site. User-name and password field produced double text output. Same thing tonight attempting to reply to a post in the Camino forum at Mozillazine. Closing the affected window and opening a new one make the issue disappear.
