I have a few folder in my personal toolbar folder (right above the tabbed
browsing bar), which open a drop down menu of the link in each folder. When I
click on a link in that drop down menu, often I am not taken to the desired
site. The page I am currently on blinks, and the info bar a the bottom say it
is resolving the hostname, but the browser doe not go to the site I wanted to
open. Sometimes it work the first time, sometimes the 2nd time I click on it,
but most of the time, it take 3 click to get the browser to react and go to
the page I want.

1.open page in browser
2.click on folder in personal toolbar folder
3.choose a link in the drop down menu that drop from parent folder
4.desired site doe not open until 2nd or 3rd click
Actual Results:
most of the time, nothing until I repeat the step above several times.

Expected Results:
it should have taken me to the site the first time I click on the link.
