Bookmarks scrabling when large filesize and bookmark manager is used.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

So, my bookmark file is ~2185 KiB.

I wanted to create a new folder and drag it to a section with other web-related folders, but when I opened the manager, which I've done multiple time before, (not with ver. 0.3 though), to change the order of the bookmark by dragging and dropping the new folder to it's correct spot, all folder position were scrambled.

Moving one folder in the bookmark manager now cause a random (even though I'm not sure it's a cryptographically secure random function :P) scramble of the bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf like a maniac and bookmark everything! (important step! programmatic iterative data may not produce same result ;))
2. Make your friend gaze in awe at your big bookmarks.html file over 2185 KiB.
3. Start Firefox.
4. Open the Bookmarks manager.
5. Get annoyed at the bug.
Actual Results:
What I described in the details, obviously.

Expected Results:
Not scramble my bookmark folders...........!

Default theme, some extensions, mostly web developer extension and the occasional ad block plus. Bottom-line is that I've had these extension a long time without any problem such a described. The only new extension is Aptana debugger service 0.2.8.13677.

Kick-ass computer. Don't think this matter though :p
