Link to "Search" in LH frame freeze and fails to execute. Command will not complete. Was not a problem in previous Firefox version, and is not a problem when executing in another browser (Safari).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.link to browser page from Finale 2008 program, OR
2.copy/paste URL in address bar
3.click on "Search" button in lower portion of LH frame.
4.closing/reopening browser doe not correct the problem.
Actual Results:
Link to "Search" in LH frame freeze and fails to execute. Command will not complete. Was not a problem in previous Firefox version, and is not a problem when executing in another browser (Safari).

Expected Results:
link to the next menu on the Finale 2008 help website, displaying a new search field w/ button at the top of the LH column. NOTE: the "search" field at the top of the page (approx. 2.5" from LH margin) is a different link.

Was not a problem in previous Firefox version, and is not a problem when executing in another browser (Safari). Suggests that the problem is a bug in Firefox 5.0 for Mac OS X (I am running 10.4.11).
