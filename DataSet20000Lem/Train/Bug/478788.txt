Bookmarklets that contain javascript window.open() function do not work when placed under a folder in the Bookmarks Toolbar. It work fine when placed alone on the Bookmarks Toolbar.

It's not an add-on or extension bug/incompatibility, a I've tested with all add-ons/extensions disabled and even tested with safe-mode and still doesn't work.

Here is the bookmarklet: javascript:popw=window.open('http://google.com','_blank','height=250,width=400');if(!document.all)T=setTimeout('popw.focus()',50);void(0);


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create new bookmarklet with the location as: javascript:popw=window.open('http://google.com','_blank','height=250,width=400');if(!document.all)T=setTimeout('popw.focus()',50);void(0);
2.Place new bookmarklet INSIDE A FOLDER in the Bookmarks Toolbar.
3.Test new bookmarklet by clicking through the folder and then the bookmarklet itself.
Actual Results:
No results. No pop-up.


Expected Results:
A window pop-up with the specified site should pop-up.

If the bookmarklet wa placed in the Bookmarks Toolbar itself, a pop-up would occur (as defined). Or, if the bookmarklet wa clicked on from the "Organize Bookmarks" dialog, it would also work.
