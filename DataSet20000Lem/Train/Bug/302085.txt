Sorry, I see that this is filed in the wrong section, however it is too much
time for me to backstep and find the proper "product". I cannot update the
theme (I use Sphere now). Says it cannot find installer script. I also cannot
seem to upload any other themes, nor extension into Firefox. I thought using
1.0.6 would fix it a it wa present in 1.0.4 a well. Neither work correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Help Viewer
2.Click on Index -- Index menu show up
3.Click on ANY topic in index, and nothing happens. The main page remains. No
other option change the content (opening screen) on the help viewer screen.


Actual Results:
Described above. Also when I try to install ANYTHING, it say it cannot. I
cannot change it, a the "Extensions" screen is blank, no matter what I do.

Expected Results:
I suppose it should've shown me the topic? And, should've insalled the theme
and extensions?
