While receiving a message from a friend in the Facebook chat, I wa inputting text on another site, and whenever the sound, The little pop that signifies you've received a new message, a well a the notice on the tab, show up, My ability to input text is lost UNTIL I reply to that message. If I don't respond to that chat, I'd either have to Close the chat itself, or close the facebook page for my ability to input text to be restored fully.

It is only certain site that I have experienced this on, Not every site ha this issue. I'd have to do some more extensive testing to find out a list of some site that have the issue and perhaps a common component can be found.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into facebook
2. Initiate a chat with a friend, or perhaps have a friend just initiate a chat with you. (Generally, my friend chat me first, when this happens.)
3. Before they respond, Open a new tab and try typing something in another page, or even on facebook, Try typing into the status update field until they respond. When they do, notice your ability to type on that page is lost.
Actual Results:
I could not type until I closed the chat, or responded to it.

Expected Results:
I should still have been able to type.
