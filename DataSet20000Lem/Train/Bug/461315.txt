I am trying to print a pdf generated document from my bank (www.handelsbanken.se). This used to work in previous Firefox version, but have stopped working with Firefox 3. The bank offer a print adjusted version of my banking information in a PDF format. I believe the character set used is iso-8859-1. I have asked the bank and they claim the problem is in Firefox. The printer used is a standard Dell printer.

I did restart firefox3 after every attempt below to make sure no stale data would ruin further print requests. I found the following:
1)If I use the printer friendly option the bank present on the homepage I get a totally garbled output. Correct layout, but random junk letters.
2)If I press print preview of the homepage and do print the preview I get correct data, but obviously not a printout adjusted to the paper size.
3)If I first use print preview, dismiss this page and then use the printer friendly option I get _correct_ result from the pdf.
4)If I first try to print the pdf file and then view the print preview the print preview suffers from the same _junk_ character a when a pdf is printed.

My conclusion is that most likely Firefox fail to initialize some data needed for printing pdf files. The code for print preview must fix the issue, but only if a regular print request ha not filled the uninitialized data structure with garbage data.
