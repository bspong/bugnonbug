I could see something similar locally when running with --run-until-failure (which run the test 30 time or until it fails, whichever come first), although the number were 9 and 8. I'm not sure if that matters; the placement'd value are all matching the actual items, so it's the skipintoolbarset item that's throwing off the count - which is the search splitter.

AFAICT this is caused by the fact that UpdateUrlbarSearchSplitter doesn't account for the possibility that the splitter might already be present inbetween the two, and then remove itself (because ibefore get set to neither the urlbar nor the searchbar). In certain race condition with the overflow and resize handler, I suspect we might now call this function twice in succession with the same item present, so we should fix that. So I did, and this fixed the problem for me locally. Patch in a second, I'll do a try run too.
