a setTimeout or setInterval using console.log fails unexpectedly and cryptically
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0

Steps to reproduce:

setTimeout(console.log,0)
setInterval(console.log,0)
setTimeout(console.log,...) // seems to happen regardless of argument
setInterval(console.log,...) // seems to happen regardless of argument

The latter two case can include additional argument beyond the delay; this seems not to make any difference to the outcome.


Actual results:

For each example, the console displayed:
uncaught exception: TypeError: frame is undefined

This message wa marked a displayed multiple time in the console for setInterval, a one would expect.


Expected results:

Ideally:
The first case should have printed a blank line to the console.
The second case should have printed the same a the third, but repeatedly.
The third case should have printed all argument including and after the 3rd, joined by spaces, at the interval declared in the second argument.
The fourth case should have printed the same a the third, but repeatedly.

However, due to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749489, more consistent behaviour would be for the example respectively to perform a do:

setTimeout(function(){console.log.apply(this,arguments)},0)
setInterval(function(){console.log.apply(this,arguments)},0)
setTimeout(function(){console.log.apply(this,arguments)},...)
setInterval(function(){console.log.apply(this,arguments)},...)
