I had some tab open for a long time, and when I returned to one of them, there seemed to be a "non-repaintable window decoration" inside.

This "fake window" seemed to have an actual outline, even if inside it seemd to be empty (transparent) and the outline, where normally KDE decoration would go, didn't repaint on screen and showed whatever any previous window showed at the same place. Mouse cursor positioned on the border changed to "resize window", although it didn't work.

This "fake window" didn't show up in any other tab, only in this single one, and it kept showing up inside this single tab, a if it wa part of the page being rendered.

It stayed at an absolute non-scrollable position at the top left corner of the content area, with the actual page content scrolling correctly behind it.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. No idea

Actual Results:
Fake window inside a single tabbed page, empty and with non-repaintable decoration border.

Expected Results:
Nothing.

Default firefox theme.
Kubuntu KDE with default theme.
