Things that should clear history don't.
- delete, drag to trash, clear private data
Changed home page work for current session, but not for new session.

Something is blocking update to Firefox memory? I've got to switch back to Safari if I can't get this fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Select desired home page
3. Go to Firefox preferences, general, and choose current page for homepage
4. Open new tab and see new home page
5. Browse some site and then click 'home' button to verify correct functionality
6. Close Firefox, reopen Firefox
--> Old site is show for home page
Actual Results:
After updating home page for a given session, the next session reverts back to previous home page.

Expected Results:
New home page should still have been current for the next Firefox session.

Browser functionality for deleting browsing history seems to also be frozen in time. Have not been able to delete browsing history. Was not using 'private mode'. Don't know what that is exactly and don't want to find out. Firefox 2.x.x allowed home page update and deletion of browsing history. I don't know of a feasible work-around.
