Once there are many tab open an arrow appears to the left and also to the right of the tab to allow you to scroll through the open tabs. If you scroll through the tab by rapidly clicking the arrow the browser then open a new tab. I believe this is occurring because of the functionality that seems to exist if you double-click on a tab it will open a new one for you. I do not believe this double-clicking behavior should be used for the arrow that allow you to scroll through your tab since it hinders the functionality of scrolling through your open tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open many tab (20 or so)
2. scroll to through the tab using the arrows. Don't scroll by clicking and holding, but rather by clicking the arrow repeatidly.
3. Don't put a big pause between you clicks, pretend you are trying to scroll through your tab quickly
Actual Results:
The arrow that provide the scrolling through the tab interpret my repeated click a double-clicks and open a new tab.

Expected Results:
When the arrow are double-clicked it should scroll through two tab in the direction of the arrow you clicked. In other word double clicking on an arrow should scroll twice, not open a new tab.

This is just pure speculation on my part but it appears to me that the the arrow tab look very much like normal tabs, but very narrow. It may be that these tab are inheriting all the functionality of a normal tab, but it should not be inheriting the "open a new tab on a double-click" functionality.
