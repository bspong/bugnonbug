Greetings!
I would like to report a major bug in Firefox 2.0.0.17 a well a 2.0.0.18. In 2.0.0.17, when I open the link http://www.tataskyplus.com/, Firefox simply shuts down (all open tab are automatically closed), without providing any reason or bringing up any dialog box. Windows also doe not provide any reason for shutting the browser (such a "Application need to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused...blah...blah...blah"). Also, I have not tried to open this link in Firefox 3. I'm not a fan of IE, but just a a feedback, this particular site open just fine in IE 7.

I then downloaded the latest update for Firefox 2 (updated to v2.0.0.18). The problem is present in this version too, except that now, Windows brings up an error dialog (firefox.exe ha caused an exception and need to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience).

Thanks for going through this feedback (and for providing u with such fantastic product like Firefox and Thunderbird).

May God bless you all.

-Amit.

Hopefully, the detail provided by me above will enable you to reproduce the problem.

I have categorized this problem a 'Critical' since if a user open the above mentioned problematic link in one tab, while he/she is doing something important in another tab (such a modifying a buy or sell order on an online stock trading page), he/she is bound to have a tough time, perhaps, even incur a financial loss.

Thank you for your time in going through this bug report.
