The proxy configuration (specifically the "automatic proxy configuration URL" ) in Firefox doe not get set correctly when using IBM/Lenovo Access Connections v4.1.x software. Access Connections is used on laptop to change configuration based on the network being connected to.

Reproducible: Always

1. Verify that Firefox is set to Direct Connect to the Internet (Tools->Options->Connection Settings->Direct Connect) and quit Firefox
2. Create/select a profile in Access Connections v4.1.x that us an automatic configuration script (from the profile->Additional Settings tab->check Override Proxy Configuration->click Settings button->check "Use Automatic Configuration Script"->type in address "http://foo.com/proxy.cfg"
3. Connect using that profile
4. Run Firefox and check the proxy configuration setting

Actual Results:
Automatic Proxy Configuration URL radio button is selected but URL text field is left blank

Expected Results:
Automatic Proxy Configuration URL radio button is selected and the URL text field is set to "http://foo.com/proxy.cfg"

Ever since Lenovo/IBM updated Access Connections to v4.1, I've run into this bug. Prior version of Access Connections worked correctly. I've verified this problem on two different ThinkPads both running Windows XP SP2. The bug occurs in Firefox 1.5.x a well a 2.0 beta 2.

I suspect the problem is on the IBM/Lenovo end but the 4.1 release coincided with a 1.5.x maintenance release of Firefox.
