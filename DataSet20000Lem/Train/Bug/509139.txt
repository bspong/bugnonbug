I can't send any file to any website on a slow GPRS connection.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13

My connection speed is 60-200 kbps thru GPRS. (my modem is mobile phone, window mobile 5, htc wizard.). I haven't that problem on my last internet-connection 2 mbps thru ADSL.

Always, when i am sending a file (any extension, any size; including photos) to any website (imageshack, gmail, rapidshare - all sharing-file websites) progress bar on website stop at 30-70% (no matter how long u will wait). Then, when i am closing tab, firefox hang on, and i have to close process thru CTRL+ALT+DEL (taskman.exe).

Problem doesn't exist on IE, Opera and Google Chrome.
Problem is same, even if i close all firefox addons.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
2. Go to imageshack.us (or any sharing-file website)
3. Click browse, and select image-file.
4. Click "start upload"

Actual Results:
1. Firefox will start uploading, then firefox will stop uploading on 30-70%
2. If you will try to close the tab with imageshack, firefox will hang (only option to close firefox is end process in taskman -ctrl-and-del)

Expected Results:
Upload file with positive result.

My OS: LEGAL Windows XP Professional XP 2
Firewall is ON
Antyvirus is Avast.
Internet connection is 230.4 kbps GPRS thru window mobile phone.
Problem doesn't exist on other browser (IE, Opera 10 beta, Google Chrome)
There is no problem with another application on my computer.
