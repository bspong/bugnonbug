I have a Logitech MX1000 Wireless Laser Mouse which ha side button for 'Back' or 'FWD' selection. It worked prior to Firefox version 1.5.0.5, but not since. It doe work in all other 'non-Firefox' program and Windows XP Pro functions. I have to use the 'back/forward' arrow in order to change page in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox v1.5.0.5 & later
2. Select any webpage
3. Press 'Back' button on mouse to return to previous page
4. "Hour Glass" appears next to the pointer briefly at first touch of mouse button, but nothing else happens. The 'hour glass' doe not reappear with subsequent press of the button.


Actual Results:
In order to return to prior webpage, it requires clicking on 'back' arrow in toolbar, or Right-Click on mouse then select 'Back' in selection window.

Expected Results:
It should have flipped back to the prior webpage a it ha done in the past prior to version 1.5.0.5

My mouse 'back/fwd' function button do work with Internet Explorer, iRider, and Opera browsers.
