When trying to sell an item on Ebay motor using Mozilla, It will ONLY let me enter my description via HTML. There should be another tab by the description box that say "STANDARD" to not use HTML. There should actually be two tabs, one say standard, one say HTML, neither are present, and it is stuck on HTML only. It work properly on other browsers, and I contacted e-bay to make sure it wa not a problem with them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Sign in to ebay
2.click sell item
3.pick a category under ebay motor
4.select your selling format
5.at the bottom of the title/description page look at the description box.
Actual Results:
I wa missing information on the page, and missing an option to use the standard selling format.

Expected Results:
It should have gave me other option around the item description box

Did clear all cookies, and cache. Used e-bay live help to try to figure out the problem, but all wa ok on their end, work properly with other browser.
