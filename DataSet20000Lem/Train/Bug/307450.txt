I tend to open all my email page a soon a I get to work (4 of them). Usually
the 2nd or 3rd tab that I attempt to open by right-clicking on the Personal
Toolbar entry and selecting "Open In New Tab" from the menu simply doesn't open
the tab. It doe nothing except close the menu. I need to right-click and "Open
In New Tab" again for it to work. This occurs every morning unless I pause
about 2 second between each tab opening.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click on a Personal Toolbar entry
2. Select "Open In New Tab"
3. Repeat step 1, 2 and 3 immediately.


Actual Results:
Sometimes the tab simply doesn't open. It is quite repeatable if you can
perform step 3 to 1 above with le than a 1 second spacing.

Expected Results:
If I select "Open In New Tab" from the menu, then the tab should ALWAYS be created.

I have no theme loaded that I am aware of. I run a basic Firefox.
