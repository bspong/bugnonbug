Sometimes when I right click on a typo,the spelling list window open and shuts really fast a I click it and I cannot select the word I need corrected. In an instant,the scroll bar move to the left of the window I'm typing in. (See picture) The writing is also reversed and if I type,it's typed in in reverse.
This started happening this week.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Misspell a word.
2.Select the word.
3 Right click on the word.
Actual Results:
What will happen is the window that you select the correct word from open once and close very fast before you can respond.

Expected Results:
The scroll bar move to the left of the window. No word can be corrected with the spell checker because the window won't stay open long enough to select the correct word.

The window should stay open and the correct word should be selected.
The scroll bar should not move to the left and the content of the letter should not reverse.
The theme I'm using is KDE Pumpkin.
