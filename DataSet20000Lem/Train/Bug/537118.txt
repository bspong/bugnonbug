When I highlight some text in a text box and press CTRL-C it is often not copied to the clipboard. Pressing CTRL-X to cut and using the Copy function on the context menu work OK.

It seems to happen at random. So far I have only observed it happening with in-page text boxes, mostly single line one rather than multi-line text areas. The Awesome Bar doe not seem to be affected.

One site which almost always doe it is imageshack.us. Other sites, including Bugzilla, do it from time to time. It seems to happen more often when the text ha been filled in by the web site, e.g. the image link on imageshack.us. Only Firefox is affected, other apps work normally.

I have tried a clean profile, it still happens. It also happens on my work machine from time to time which ha a completely different profile and is running on Windows 7 x86.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter text into text box or have web site fill it in
2. Select some or all of the text and press CTRL-C
3. Selected text is not copied to clipboard, verify by trying to paste it.
Actual Results:
Text not copied

Expected Results:
Text should be on clipboard

I thought it might be related to the "Copy Plain Text" extension, but a it happens with a clean profile that rule out extensions.
