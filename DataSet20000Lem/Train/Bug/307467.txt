call to a SQL autoinc query work properly on IE not on Firefox

I've been working on it for 2 day now !
I made a php page that call this query to an Interbase database :
SELECT GEN_ID(IDD_GEN,1) AS TOTAL FROM RDB$DATABASE
This increment an autoinc called IDD_GEN by 1.
If I call this query 4 time in a row and I write down the 'TOTAL' value it
give me 1,2,3,4. If I press 'Refresh' it writes 9,10,11,12.
I first thought it wa php. So I wrote the most simple script I could (=connect,
send sql, write page, close). Didn't solve it.
Then I thought it wa SQL. So I tried it 'by hand', opening, querying 4 times,
and closing. Didn't solve it (i.e. it increment one by one).
Then I tried it on IE 6 and it worked like a charm (1,2,3,4. If I press
'Refresh' it writes 5,6,7,8 and so on) !
It can't be a cache problem. It seems it's the way Firefox sends it data or...
or... I don't know actually, but what's for sure : it's neither php nor the
database type (Interbase) or connection that cause this bug, because the same
page behaves properly with IE.
I tried to make it a w3c compliant a possible, so it may not be the way my
page is structured.
I tried to change my profile to a brand new, empty profile, with NO plugins (the
alert message box told it), and it gave me the same result.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create a simple php script doing the step 2 to 7 :
2.open a connexion to an interbase database where there's an autoinc variable
3.call a SQL like that : SELECT GEN_ID(VALUE_GEN,1) AS TOTAL FROM RDB$DATABASE
4.write down TOTAL to the page
5.repeat step 3-4 many time
6.close connexion
7.write down the result
8.refresh the page
Actual Results:
* With Firefox 1.0.6
- If you try 9 time you can read : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
- After refreshing you can read : 19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27
Seems like, after sending everything to interbase, it's sent a second time.
* With IE 6.0 :
- If you try 9 time you can read : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
- After refreshing you can read : 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18


Expected Results:
- If you try 9 time you should read : 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
- After refreshing you should read : 10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18
