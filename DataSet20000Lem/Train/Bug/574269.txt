I click on radio button and tick boxes.
Half way through the site say 26 validation error and asks me to start again.
I did this 3 time and error continued till gave up.
I assume cookie problem.

I redid the form OK using Opera Mini 4 on Nokia 6230 (Java MIDP) so the browser ha a bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. answer every question (click radio button or tick box)
2. 1/2 way through 26 validation error due to site seeing field not entered
3. restart at question 15
4. repeat ad infintum or quit
Actual Results:
26 validation error - question 15 (multiple radio button question) ha red star next to all part of question (about 20) saying not filled in which I did fill in and redid several times.

Form is never finished.

I assume cookie is not being handled correctly so form data is lost when click 'continue' for each page.

Expected Results:
Form go from page to page and no error and form submitted after about 10 page

Cookie should save state between page so the form is submitted a one long data entry.

Opera Mini 4 on Nokia 6230 (Java MIDP) work fine with no validation errors.
So it is the browser not the form or Website. The form is crossplatform.

I can't upgrade Firefox on my EEEPC 701SD a ASUS is not maintaining a compatible build. Debian build do not work on ASUS build of Linux.

Browser is set to accept cooky and 3rd party cooky but error still occurs.
