While at the above website, when using the Amazon.com's enhanced image viewer, Foxfire close itself with an error message saying "Foxfire ha encountered a problem and need to close"

The crash always happens after the document in the viewer ha already downloaded. It doe not make sense that the document downloads and then foxfire ha to close. This doe not happen with Internet Explorer. I cannot help you any more than this, I am not competent with programming. I did take a screen shot of the error message if that will help. I will need you to send me an e-mail address to send it to you. Also, it seems to occur if I use the system for a long time, not a short period of time, which also make it a bit confusing.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download the viewer into FoxFire
2.Begin using the viewer. I cannot say how long it will take to replicate. You may want to try to use the Census downloads, they seem to make it happen quicker.
3.
Actual Results:
The software closed by itself, saying there wa an error. For some reason, this error is being sent to Microsoft. Don't you have an error reporting method?

Expected Results:
The same thing happened.

You can reach me at the above e-mail address.
