Ctrl-left and ctrl-right switch between active tabs. I think this ha always been the case.

However, in FF before version 4, they worked differently in text entry boxes: there, they moved the cursor forward or backwards a word at a time. This is a well-understood and general convention.

However, in FF4, all the beta I have tried, pressing ctrl-arrow in a text are or editing box, like this, will switch to another tab altogether. I know this is a small bug, but it is a huge irritation for anyone who edits text in a browser, for instance in gmail.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tab in a window
2. type a few word into a text entry box
3. Press ctrl-left-arrow


Actual Results:

Actual behaviour: the whole page vanishes and the previous tab is displayed. Pressing ctrl-arrow repeatedly will cycle through all the tab to the original one where text wa being edited. So it's not lost. It's just needlessly hard and irritating to edit.

Expected Results:

Expected behaviour: the cursor move to the beginning of the previous word in the text editing area

This seems to happen with a completely clean installation, though I am in fact using several tab management addons (tabberwocky; tab group manager)
