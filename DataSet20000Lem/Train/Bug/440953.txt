While the new SSL warning dialog may be good to discourage average user from ignoring ssl warnings, user who know how ssl work are extremely annoyed by it. Additionally, the warning for untrusted certificate and certificate that are issued for the "wrong" domain (for example with "www" in front of it) are very similar now, while they were clearly different in FF2.

I suggest to:
- create an hidden about:config option "show quick SSL error buttons" which make the following button appear on the ssl warning page: "ignore warning, connect insecurely", "show certificate" and "trust certificate".
- make the "valid cert but wrong domain" and "expired" warning clearly distinct from the "invalid cert" dialog (maybe only in the "ssl expert mode")

- AND/OR -

- create an hidden about:config option "use old SSL warning method"
- add an option to remember the decision to the old "wrong domain" dialog
