I have a username/password saved for lala.com yet upon entering my username the password doe not fill in. I am a developer for the site and have tried many thing to fix the issue. See additional information to see

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign in to Lala.com using the in-page sign in dialog (just click sign in)
2. Enter your email address/password
3. Sign out of Lala
4. Check your password manager to verify that a username and password have been stored for www.lala.com
5. Begin to sign in to Lala again
6. Enter your email address again
7. Notice that the password field is not auto-filled when you enter your email address
Actual Results:
The username/password are not entered into the appropriate field

Expected Results:
The username/password field in sign up should be pre-populated

There are several thing to note here, but some of these have already been ruled out a issue preventing the password manager to work a expected:

1. Lala.com performs client-side rendering. That is, the sign in form is not in the DOM until the user click the sign in link. (visit the site without JS enabled to see, or do a simple "View source")
2. The site us an iframe to securely send the login info to the server and handle the response.
3. The page is using http, the iframe is using http
4. The sign in form element ha a target=<iframe id>
