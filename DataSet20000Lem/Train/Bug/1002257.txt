ff28 debugger won't debug, doesn't always load file
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140314220517

Steps to reproduce:

http://jesusnjim.com/bugs/ff-debugger-wont-debug.htm
ctrl-shift-i
click debugger
F5
(some sort of code view should be there now)
click file
right click file to see if there is context menu
click all the button in the debugger toolbar





Actual results:

- list files, but show no code (has no code view) - tried all the button and right clicking and clicking I could.
- can't edit or debug any files, the bar containing the filename stretch across whole window and are dead to the world
- earlier when code wa buggy(er), it gave a strange error message about a reference error: x is undefined. there wa no "x" in any related file. I did have variables.
- earlier and many time in the past, it also refused to load buggy j files, seems like j wa "dead to the world" because of my sometimes bad syntax. a debugger should always load file and debug, even with buggy code. that's it purpose, right?


Expected results:

- debugger should always load file
- debugger should have some sort of some sort of code view
