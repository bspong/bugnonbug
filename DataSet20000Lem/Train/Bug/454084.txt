After opening several tab/windoes, firefox keep a substantial amount of ram (up to 1MB for 15-20 open tabs/windows), and then keep that a window are closed. When Firefox take most of the RAM available, all activity slow substantially -- sometimes 1 minute to switch between windows. It is not possible to close some windows, continue to use others and then open new windows.
