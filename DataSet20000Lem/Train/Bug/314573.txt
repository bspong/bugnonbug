Extensions are able to inlude a html file within the chrome directory. this html file and it's javascript have higher priviledges than page loaded from the internet. It is possible to include an almost blank html file in an extension which reference a javascript file from the internet. This javascript file can then use document.write statement to write html to the file within the chrome directory. This html document created from the external javascript statement will then have normal chrome priviledges even though the page wa effectly loaded from a remote internet location.

With this vulnerability it would be possible for a regular useful extension to propagate through the community unnoticed and then once widespread adoption ha been achieved, change the remote javascript to include some malicious code that will have chrome priviledges.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the priviledge test extension that is attached
2. navigate to chrome://privtest/content/test.html
3. this chrome html page will load a j file from yellowgorilla.net and in this j is a javascript statement to show the firefox preference page. something that chrome priviledges are needed to do.
4. Click the "Options" link to show the option page

Actual Results:
the option page is displayed

Expected Results:
a the html page wa effectively loaded from the internet, the javascript should not be allowed to execute.
