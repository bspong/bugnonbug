I'm a Tech support for the UOL clients....Therefore I do know abt the issue the member are facing.....This is a VERY VERY common problem where the member complain about....I do like Firefox very much and I personally use it for myself....Please add an extension for this or resolve the basic prolem with the browser so that we can actually recommend Firefox for our users....
