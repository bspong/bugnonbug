Ability to bookmark launcher for native OS applications.
Firefox Bookmarks are currently a useful way to organize link to web sites. Functionality traditionally implemented in native client applications/programs is now often being implemented a web application accessed via a URL. For a user to get a task accomplished they may utilize a combination of native client application and web-based applications. Unfortunately, Firefox bookmark can only be used to organize link to web-based application based on their URL. It would be useful if Firefox bookmark could also link to launchers/binaries of native applications. This would allow user to organize launcher using the same tag and folder used to organize web sites. It would also allow application to be launched from the Awesome Bar. This would provide a more seamless experience for user since they could organize way to get thing done using a single organizational structure regardless of whether the application is implemented using web technology or thick-client technologies.

Currently, it is possible to bookmark a link to a file on disk, however the default behavior for such link is to copy the file to a new location. The desired behavior would be to run the file in place.

A secondary benefit of this feature is that it would provide an alternative option for organizing and running program to the new Start menu introduced by Microsoft in Windows 8. An Awesome Bar-based solution to running web or native application would provide a consistent user experience across operating systems.
