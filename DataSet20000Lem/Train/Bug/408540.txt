Instead of opening http://www.radioparadise.com, we get this in Firefox URL box:
file:///N:/Music/Radio%20Paradise%20-%20eclectic%20online%20rock%20radio.url
But in XP (w/Firefox 2.0.0.11), website is opened a expected.
The internet shortcut we clicked wa created in MSEI (by the way, how to do that in Firefox? Right-click from website doesn't appear to offer "Save Shortcut"!)
Here is content of .url:

URL=http://www.radioparadise.com/
