Steps to reproduce:

Step1. Open the Firefox and go to Options-->Content and change the background colour and text colour to white (In general to same colour)
Step 2. Open the browser again and now user want to get default setting for background and text colour so go to Options-->Content


Actual results:

Step1. The colour of the background and text are changed successfully
Step2. User is not able to see anything except some of the check box and dropdowns. There is no way that user can change the text and background colour

I have uninstalled the Mozilla and reinstall it again but still the user face the same problem of not seeing anything on the page so user can not change the setting for colour of Background and text

Because of this problem the Mozilla becomes unusable on that box which is a serious issue


Expected results:

The expectation is that either the changing of the background colour and text colour to same colour should be stopped or once we uninstall and reinstall mozilla it should take u to the default setting
