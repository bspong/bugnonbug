Strange behavior in creating directory for saving profile
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030728 Mozilla Firebird/0.6.1

When user is initially creating a profile there is doubt a to the name of the
directory that will be created to store settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From do window .. MozillaFirebird.exe -p
2. From Profile manager Create new profile
3. Profile manager start with Default Profile
If you start typing in a different name you have doubt a to the name that
will be used to store the user settings.
There is a screen display showing Your user settings, preference Bookmarks and
mail will be stored in C:\Documents and Settings\...\Phoenix\Profiles\
4. Type a name for the new profile (I used Test)
at the T Phoenix\Profiles\
at the Te Phoenix\Profiles\T
at the Tes Phoenix\Profiles\Te
at the Test Phoenix\Profiles\Tes
5. Backspace one time Phoenix\Profiles\Test with profile name displayed a Tes
6. Add the t abain to the profile name and the target change to
Phoenix\Profiles\Tes

Actual Results:
After typing in the name I wanted, the program did create the correct directory
name. This is a visual thing. The user should see the name of the directory
that will be created. Why display the target if it is not going to be valid?

Expected Results:
I would have expected the display to show
Your user settings, preference Bookmarks and mail will be stored in
C:\Documents and Settings\...\Phoenix\Profiles\Test
(Or whatever wa actually typed into the profile name)
