Steps to reproduce:

Full Screen Does Not Come Back After Minimizing Firefox to the Taskbar.

I work in full screen almost exclusively ... the toolbar, the tab and the URL are still displayed while in full screen.

Historically, when I minimized Firefox to the taskbar so that I could go to the desktop or to Windows Explorer, when I finished what I wa doing and re-selected Firefox it would go back to full screen. Now, it doe not go back to full screen. I can still see the taskbar. I have to press [f11] two more time to get back to full screen.

I have tried with and without addons enabled. Same behavior. I have reset Firefox ... same behavior.

I have totally uninstalled Firefox using Revo Uninstaller and reinstalled version 30.0 from scratch. Same behavior. I upgraded to version 32.0.0 and to version 32.0.1 and to version 32.0.2 when they became available. Same behavior.

Yesterday morning, I uninstalled Firefox using Revo Uninstaller and installed version 24.0 from scratch. I could minimize to the taskbar to access the desktop ... when I selected Firefox again, it opened fully full-screen (with just the URL and the toolbar and the tab visible).

This morning I upgraded from version 24.0 to version 32.0.2. I now have the same problem with full screen not coming back from minimizing Firefox.

I'm using Firefox 32.0.2 and Windows 7 (64 bit). The problem showed up in all version of 30.

Thanks.



Actual results:

When I minimize Firefox to access the desktop of Windows Explorer and then select Firefox again to maximize, the screen is not maximized ... the taskbar stay visible at the bottom of the screen. I have to press [f11] two time to get Firefox back to full-screen.


Expected results:

When I minimize a full-screen Firefox and then maximize a full-screen Firefox, the window should re-open in full-screen mode. It doe not.
