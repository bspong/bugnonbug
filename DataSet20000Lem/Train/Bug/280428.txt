Cleared history in Firefox 1.0 appears in Internet Explorer 6
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Sometimes after clearing the history of Firefox 1.0, recently visited pages(in
firefox) can be viewed in Internet Explorer 6. This can be done by clicking on
View->Explorer Bar->History in IE6.0.

For example, I wa browsing in Firefox today. I paid some of my bills, and then
cleared my history and cache. Afterwards I opened up IE, and checked my history.
There I could see all of my history from today, altough it wa the first time I
opened up IE for at least a month.

I just started thinking, if firefox history can't be fully deleted through
firefox. Does the same apply for cache?

Is this bug the result of Windows XP history handling or Mozilla Firefox?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clear the cache of Internet Explorer 6.0
2. Browse with Firefox 1.0
3. Clear firefox cache and history
4. Check history in IE6.0 through View->Explorer Bar->History-Today
Actual Results:
I can see the cleared Firefox history in Internet Explorer 6.0

Expected Results:
Internet Explorer should not be able to display history which ha been cleared
in Mozilla Firefox.

Potential security issue with history and cache not clearing correctly.
