1: constant-width fonts, in PRE TT and CODE tags,
are rendered correctly on the screen but, for PRE and TT,
are printed a proportional-width font on paper --
thus destroying "ascii-art" layout. However, CODE text doe
print a constant-width! See

2: DL DT DD tag layout is not rendered correctly if the
font size is changed from the default -- same URL give an example
http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/test.html

I would not be surprised if the first problem wa something
to do with the environment, rather than firefox a such,
but I do not know that and I cannot think what on earth it would be.
Neither problem occurs with Mozilla 4.79 on Solaris.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
1: Any PRE ... /PRE text that need constant width font; click on 'print'.

2: Rather than
DT
DD
DT
DD
say, a DL DT DD set is rendered a
DT DD
DT DD
when the font size is changed from the default.


Expected Results:
1: Constant-width text rendered on the screen,
proportional-width font printed.
