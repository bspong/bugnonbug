User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0) Gecko/20111108 Firefox/8.0 PaleMoon/8.0
Build ID: 20111108104037

Steps to reproduce:

Just general browsing, opening between 40/80 tab every day.

I've talked about this bug with the author of Palemoon (www.palemoon.org). This is (for those who don't know it) a browser which is much like firefox. The author of palemoon think the memory leak is a bug within firefox, and therefore requested me to fill a bug report on this website. See our discussion at http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=348


Actual results:

The memory usage of both palemoon and firefox go beyond every limit. Usually at the end of the day, both browser use about 3.0 gb of memory. A large part of this is caused by a j memory leak. About 1 gb of memory is used by my subsonic medium streamer (see www.subsonic.org). Another 1 gb is used by 'a pool of memory for wich use is unspecified'.

Since Palemoon is my standard browser, i've installed the latest Firefox this morning. I've set all my plugins, extensions, bookmarks, general settings, etc to be the same a with palemoon. I've copiëd a session file to my firefox profile folder and opened it. In this session are all my frequently used tab including Subsonic.

I've started both browser at the same time. I use palemoon, and firefox just sits there with 37 tab open. These browser are now battling with each other. Wich one can use the most amount of memory? Currently the fresh firefox install is winning the battle with over 1.8 gb of allocated memory. See the attachment for more information.

Expected results:

I do not expect both browser to use more than 1 gb of memory.
