This ha happened twice, the first time I uninstalled FF and removed all the Profile directory and all Mozilla folder in both Application Data folder under all user name and reinstalled, the error then reoccured after a few weeks, there wa no apparent change made to/in FF that caused the problem. However I do now recieve crash more often than usual, however the module is reported a unknown.
