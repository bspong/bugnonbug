Download manager get file size wrong.

The download manager give file size that are inconsistent size of the downloaded file reported by Mac OS X Finder (version 10.6.5). I noticed this when I downloaded a 9.5 MB file from the web; downloaded manager listed the file size a 9.1 MB.

I believe this bug is caused by two different definition of the unit: megabyte.

The Mac OS X Finder us decimal file size unit in which 1 megabyte is 1,000,0000 bytes.

I suspect Firefox us binary file size unit in which 1 megabyte is 1,048,576 byte (1024x1024 bytes).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a file from the web.
2. Once downloaded is completed write down the download's file size shown in the 'Downloads' window.
3. Find the file in Mac OS X Finder.
4. Open the "Get Info" window and compare the file size with what you wrote down in step 2.
Actual Results:
The file size shown in the 'Downloads' window (Download Manager in Firefox) is different to the file size should in the 'Get Info' window (Finder).

Expected Results:
The two file sizes—Firefox's and Finder's—should be identical.
