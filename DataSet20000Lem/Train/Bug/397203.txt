Yahoo mail account login stuck in loop from mismatched certificate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7

After I sign into my Yahoo account, and before the mail interface page loads, Firefox give me a message that says:

"You have attempted to establish a connection with "mail.yahoo.com" However the security certificate presented belongs to "login.yahoo.com". It is possible, though unlikely, that someone may be trying to intercept your communication with this website. If you suspect the certificate shown doe not belong to "mail.yahoo.com", please cancel the connection and notify the administrator."

Viewing the certificate offer nothing and cancel is obvious.

If I choose "OK" it then get stuck in a page load loop until it finally time out. Main mail interface page doe not load.

I have cleared cache, cookies, everything and this did not solve the problem.

I have 2 other Yahoo mail account and they work fine.

Problem began after previous (not last) FF update.

Yahoo account work fine with IE 7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to Yahho mail account
2.May or MAY NOT get certificate message
3.Page load loop. Main interface never page never loads.
Actual Results:
Exception to above is that I do not always get the certificate message. All other action the same.

Expected Results:
Yahoo mail main interface page should download.
