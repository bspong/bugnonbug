In the Yahoo mail text box, when I hit the "apostrophe" key it launch the "Quick Find" bar at the bottom of the screen and doesn't type the "apostrophe". This just started when I installed the latest Firefox 3 update.
I'm using Windows XP

The other bug is that the spell checker doesn't give me spelling option when I right click on a word it ha hi-lighted a wrong. But it doe work in a text box like this.

I haven't noticed these problem in any other program or website and they both work in this field.

Thanks,
dave
