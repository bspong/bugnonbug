CAPTCHA is broken in Firefox for WIDE VARIETY OF SITES in Windows 64 Desktop Version 54.0.1 and earlier version (last 6 month at least) running in http
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0
Build ID: 20170628075643

Steps to reproduce:

Captcha is broken in Firefox, either because the CAPTCHA is not displayed when registering for new accounts, OR when displayed it doe not allow for the input of the displayed character in a manner that the CAPTCHA engine find acceptable - it prompt for the proper input over and over again. CAPTCHA for the impacted page all work in Chrome or Internet Explorer. This is an issue for the 64 bit Windows version (desktop PC). I'm currently using 54.0.1 but it ha been an issue for month now; at least the last couple of versions. It happens in a WIDE VARIETY OF SITES, BUT ESPECIALLY at any financial service website that requires secured registration.


Actual results:

Submission of requested input (characters) fails with an error message that required character WERE NOT submitted. This happens 100% of the time. When CAPTCHA exists and is not displayed it is impossible to troubleshoot the issue - the only way you know other than cryptic browser error is to go to IE or Chrome where it is displayed properly (and work a intended)


Expected results:

The CAPTCHA should display and the right input SHOULD satisfy the CAPTCHA or RECAPTHA engine. At first I thought this wa a NoScript issue, but it happens even if NoScript is disabled, although NoScript make troubleshooting it more problematic when it won't display the CAPTCHA
