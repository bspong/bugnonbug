Hitting "open" after getting the browser to choose your file result in hang. The dialogue box or file browser stay in place and the filepath doe not populate on the main page. Luckily Minefield doe not crash or require force quitting. Double-clicking the main page result in the dialogue box/file browser disappearing and then you can try again.

Observed this on only one other site and it is unclear if this is only an issue with this build or with the site (same issue observed in WebKit).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Under "Upload Graphic" hit the button that say "Browse..."
2. Select any small graphic (tried with a JPEG and a GIF)
3. Hit button "open"

75% chance of success.
Actual Results:
1 in 4 attempt observed the reported behavior. WebKit ha slightly higher rate of success.

Expected Results:
The software should be populating the filepath of the chosen image in the field on the main page.

The frequency may change based on selecting one image and then changing to another prior to hitting "open"

Minefield is the fastest browser I've used yet! Keep up the amazing work. This "bug," if it can even be called that, is trivial and doe not tarnish the stellar job that ha been accomplished with this browser.

Many Thanks!
