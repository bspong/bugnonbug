2. Double click on the keyword cell associated to a search engine and add it a keyword (eg yh for yahoo)
3. Click outside the textarea or press Enter
4. Select another search engine and add it the same keyword a in step 2

Expected results:
User should be informed that the same keyword ha been already used.
When the Preferences are displayed in separate tab, the following message is used: "You have chosen a keyword that is currently in use by "<search engine>". Please select another." and the same keyword cannot be chosen twice.

The textarea remains displayed no matter what field are clicked after that: http://i.imgur.com/j4IbOXk.png
