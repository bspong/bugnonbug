I don't know if this quite class a a bug, whether it's fixable, or whether indeed, it should be 'fixed', but I'll go ahead and explain.

It is possible to place text-off screen in such a way a to add text in when a block of text (such a a URL) is copy/pasted a Firefox appears to select text based on the code, not on-screen location.

In the day and age when people are told to copy/paste link to site to avoid fake links, this is a pretty easy way to falsify a link. It's not entirely effective, a it's easy to spot when you paste, and doesn't help with security certificates, but if one us a long URL and mask it cleverly, it could be an effective tactic.

Check the link for an example.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page in which text ha an element inside, which is positioned off-screen.
2. Copy this text.
3. Paste.
Actual Results:
Off-screen text is pasted a well.

Expected Results:
Only what you see selected should be pasted, one would presume.
