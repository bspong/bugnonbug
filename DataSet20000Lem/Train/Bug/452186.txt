Please note this ha been reported, several time noted a not confirmed etc. I have tried to clear the browsing history dropdown under the address bar. Using Control-Shift-Delete, or dropping down the tool bar and selecting clear private data. The help screen for this show a menu when the clear private data is selected. I get no such sub menu. When I select either Ctl-Shift-del, or select clear private data, there is no response. I am still left with several address under the address bar.
The website that are there are:
