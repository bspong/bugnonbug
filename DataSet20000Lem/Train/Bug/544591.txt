"Save and quit" prompt for closing browser with one tab open
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I have a single tab open and I choose to close the browser ("X" button or "Alt+F4"), I get the "Save and quit" prompt. I have the "Warn me when closing multiple tabs" option selected; however, if I repeat the process of closing the browser with a single tab open and select the option "Do not ask next time" and hit "Quit", the only difference under Tools>Options>Tabs that ha changed is "Warn me when closing multiple tabs." I selected it again, and repeated the process for verification. I know that on older builds, Firefox would just exit in the case of one tab being open, which I find more convenient and believe that it should not be determined by the "Warn me when closing multiple tabs" option.
Also of note is that closing the tab with "Ctrl+W", which will close Firefox, doe not produce the "Save and Quit" prompt.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have one tab open
2. Have the option "Warn me when closing multiple tabs" set
3. Close the browser with "Alt+F4" or "X button"
Actual Results:
The "Save and Quit" prompt appears

Expected Results:
Closed the browser since multiple tab were not open
