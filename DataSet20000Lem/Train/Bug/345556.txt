My cursor move by itself...always to the left.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: I cannot tell. See problem below.

My cursor is moving quickly to the left all by itself. If I attempt to type, I end up typing over anything that I try to type. It's almost a if my LEFT ARROW button on my keyboard is constantly pushed down. (It's not--that wa the first thing I checked). I have Norton, AVP, and spam-blocking software and I'm pretty sure that it's not virus-related.

I would list my version of Firefox, but I cannot click anything in/near the browser window or on the toolbar (if I try on the toolbar--it constantly move to the left). I have tried reinstalling FIrefox and it still doe it. I do not have this problem with Internet Explorer. Sorry, I couldn't give you more specific info on my Firefox build, but I can't click on the HELP/ABOUT portion of the menu window.

Actual Results:
When I click on the Firefox icon on windows, Firefox start a normal. My homepage is Google. The cursor is blinking in the Google browser/search window.
