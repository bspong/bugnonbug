I wa reading Asa's blog which linked to
http://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2005/08/30/9-days-untill-15-beta/.
There they had two link (both being tinyurl because the url wa huge). After
going to one of those pages, I started to look at the url. I took my mouse and
started to go through the url. I stopped somewhere in the middle and all of a
sudden, the url wa written passed the edge of the location bar, over the go
button and the search box. I could also do it when I dragged to the left.

Sorry if it is hard to understand, but I don't know how to describe exactly how
it happens.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the bugzilla website (it ha a long enough url)
2. Take your mouse and start highlighting the url towards the right
3. Sometime in the middle let go of the mouse
4. The url is now overwriting it boundary

5. You can also do the same highlighting to the right.

Actual Results:
The url overwrites the search bar. It act a if the location bar expands
completely to the right.

Expected Results:
The url should always stay inside of the location bar. It should never go out
of it.
