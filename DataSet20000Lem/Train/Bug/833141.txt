Mozilla 18.0.1 not rendering message when using flash player ExternalInterface.call functionality, specifically, alert

Steps to reproduce:

when using a flash player there is an interaction between flash and javascript. to do this, we use the standard ExternalInterface.call("name of the j function").

Essentially, there seems to be a hold in the execution path that is not allowing the browser to display an alert box when it being called through flash->js.

if you use the example attach (open it and extract, then open the html file using firefox 18.0.1), you should click on the refresh button, and a j alert message should display "Refreshing Preview - please wait..."

if this is run on an older version or the same version from mac, this work perfectly, it only in the pc version running on 18.0 browser where it hickups


Actual results:

when you hit on the refresh button, the browser stop functioning, a soon a you click on another window and click back to the same firefox window. the alert is display and normal behavior return to normal...


Expected results:

when you hit on the refresh button, an alert should be display with a message saying "Refreshing Preview - please wait..."
