After upgrading from 3.5.8 to 3.6, I noticed a dramatic drop in performance (delayed and stuttering scrolling, delayed typing in forms, security camera video feed flickering between on and 'unavailable', etc.) I tried upgrading to 3.6.2, but didn't see any improvements. I restarted the computer (after taking it home for the night); still no improvements. I rolled back to 3.5.8, and it appears to be working correctly again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade from 3.5.8 to 3.6 (or 3.6.2)
Actual Results:
Typing is delayed in forms/text entry areas, such that character appear in spurts. Scrolling is no longer smooth (checking and unchecking the smooth scrolling preference make no difference.) Streamed camera footage is intermittent.

Expected Results:
Responsive typing and scrolling, continuous camera footage.

I have 100+ tab across various sites, a well a a separate window with a Web cam feed. I haven't tried to reproduce the problem with a single window with one tab. Let me know if you'd like me to do so; I threw the 3.6.2 version into an archive folder, so it's readily available.
