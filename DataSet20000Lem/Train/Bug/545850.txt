Firefox crash frequently without warning or reason
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox ha been crashing regularly with no reason or explanation, usually after being open for 5 or 10 minutes. It and Thunderbird both crash within fewer than 5 minute of when I open the other. Since I frequently access websites, using Firefox, from link in emails, using Thunderbird, this is especially frustrating.

I always immediately install the latest update for both programs.

The Mozilla Crash Reporter fails to report 95+% of the time and it won't let me finish this message. The multiple problem seem to have started when you abandoned a working Crash Report software for the new, non-working one.

I have run all diagnostics (including full scan by my completely up-to-antivirus program several times) but can find nothing wrong on my end.

I don't want to abandon Firefox for Apple Safari or Google Chrome and I don't know any other email client that I would be able to use like I do Thunderbird.

If this go through would somebody please do something!!!!
