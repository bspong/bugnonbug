Failed to open url with name defined in host file, and unable to do Domain lookup.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2

While this is OK in previous version of Firefox, at least in FF1.5, it work fine.

But after upgraded to FF2.0b2, I find that if I use the name rather than IP Address defined in window *hosts* file, It just say that "The Web site cannot be found".
e.g. I defined a name in host file, with entry like 'mary 192.168.0.111',
I type with http://192.168.0.111/, ok, no problem, but if I use http://mary/, just the above problem.

And another problem is in the domain name lookup.
e.g. my computer is in domain like *some.company.com*;
there is a computer with name john with apache running, if I type http://john/, no page returns,
but if I use http://john.some.company.com/, then everything go fine now.
Of course the IP address also works.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. define a entry in host file (WINNT/system32/drivers/etc/hosts), like 'mary 192.168.0.111'
2. open url with string like "http://mary/"
3. the page will fail to load. but with "http://192.168.0.111/" will be fine.

Actual Results:
Just a blank page like "The Web site cannot be found"

Expected Results:
The same result a type with ip address.

I do have kaspersky anti-virus software installed. Other software are just normal.
