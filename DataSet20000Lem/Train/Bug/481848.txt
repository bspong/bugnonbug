Some extension are inactive since update to 3.0.7: WOT, Adblock, Torrent toolbar

In Add-ons Manager:
Adblock Plus - Options are available. I had to subscribe filter manually, however.
Adblock Plus Elements Hiding Helper - no option available.
TorrentBar - no option available.
WOT - noptions available

Effectively:
1: WOT doen't warn me about dangerous website or give me any option to do so.
2: Adblock appears to be subscribed to filter Dr. Von Evil, but doesn't appear in right-click menu or block any kind of adverts.
3: TorrentBar doesn't appear in toolbar or give any options.
4: A minor technicality - Skype extension doesn't work either or appear in toolbar, but don't need that anyway.

Chatzilla, FoxyProxy and NoScript are the only extension incorporated in toolbar customization.

Strangely enough, AutoPager IS in the toolbar, I think I'll uninstall that anyway, but might help you to sort this if you know that. The AVG SafeSearch is OK, and I have actually had that and WOT working at the same time.

Everything else appears ok

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox from official website
2.Install the following extensions: English/portuguese dictionaries, CoolPreviews, Download Statusbar, Forecast Enhanced, Foxmarks, FoxyProxy, Smart Bookmarks, WOT, Adblock, NoScript, Pithdark (theme), Chatzilla
3.Login Foxmarks, Locate city in Forecast, activate Default in FoxyProxy, subscribe to Dr. Von Evil filter in AdBlock, apply theme
Actual Results:
Same thing

Expected Results:
Hopefully restore functionality of WOT and AdBlock at least

I went to IRC in firefox and they said to go to WOT and AdBlock bug report pages, but I think that won't work, seeing a problem affect many different extensions.
I tried different themes.
All Add-on were OK with previous version.
