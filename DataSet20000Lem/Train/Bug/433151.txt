Draggable RSS link are wrong! Can result in orphaned links. Crash can be triggered.
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: latest nightly win32 (05/10/08)

Unlike bookmarks, which are locally managed, RSS feed are remotely managed (and temporary) and a such should be treated locally a static content.

Although individual feed link cannot be dragged into another RSS feed folder, they can be moved outside of their own feed folder, and in doing so the link becomes orphaned when the RSS feed is refreshed, with a duplicate link respawning in the original feed folder. Initial right click on orphaned file cause immediate Fatal Error crash (in XP) and doe not trigger the Crash Reporter. Upon restart, the orphaned RSS link remains and right click function correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a folder on the boomarks or navbar and populate with live r feed folder(s)
2.Click on folder on toolbar, and from within a r feed folder, drag a link out, into the parent (non-rss) folder.
3.Refresh feed.
4.Right click on the resulting orphaned link from the toolbar folder menu.
Actual Results:
Instant fatal error. No crash reporter. Upon restart, orphaned r link still orphaned, but now right clickable.

Expected Results:
RSS live feed should be static a per ff2. This is a regression. Remote link should not be locally editable/draggable.

None.
