In FF: Bookmarks | Organize Bookmarks
In the Bookmark Manager: File | Import from File
Import an old bookmark file.
The the favicon is empty

In FF: Bookmarks
There too, the new bookmark have an empty favicon
In FF: Bookmarks | Open all in Tabs
All bookmark get opened, the tab show the favicon, the bookmark still have an empty favicon.
Instead of opening all bookmark at once, open one after the other by clicking on each of them individually.
Now the bookmark list show the favicon. I think sometimes the description is read from the Web Site too, a you can observe in the bookmark manager, but I cannot reproduce it. At least the description is fetched from the Web page for new bookmarks.

I suppose this is an unintended behavior. If the bookmark get enhanced by the favicon when you open the page one after the other, it should also get updated if you open multiple page simultaneously.

I would also appreciate if the description would be determined from the web page too. I would not mind whether only empty description would be filled or if even existing description would be overwritten.
