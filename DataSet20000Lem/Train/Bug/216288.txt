At random time firebird stop responding to keyboard/mouse input.

This usually seems to happen when I'm trying to type into the url bar so it may
be focus related however once firebird enters this state, it hang completely.
No keyboard input is accepted nor is any mouse input. Minimizing and
redisplaying the browser result in correct redisplay, but no user input is
accepted. The browser must then be killed by hand.

Simple test like switching window (or switching desktops) seem to make no
difference.

I have tab extension and radial context installed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start browsing.
2. Switch to url bar to type/change a url.
3. Repeat until browser hangs. Eventually firebird pretty much always hang
when I do this, but how long it take varies from a few minute to a few hours.
Actual Results:
Browser hangs. Does not accept keyboard/mouse input.

Expected Results:
Not hang.

Linux - several release of linux do the same thing. I dont use window often
enough to know if it occurs there.

Tab extension and readial context installed.
