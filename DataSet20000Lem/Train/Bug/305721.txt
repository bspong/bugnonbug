Right-clicking the empty space in the bookmark toolbar and selecting "New Folder" sometimes creates a folder in a counterintuitive location

To reproduce this bug, you have to have a folder on the bookmark toolbar and at
least one bookmark in that folder. You also have to have some empty space at the
right side of the toolbar. Do the following:

1) Expand the folder from the bookmark toolbar so that you can see the bookmark
on the popup menu. Right-click on the bookmark.
2) Dismiss the context menu any way you like.
3) Right-click on the empty space to the right of the bookmark toolbar.
4) Select "New Folder".
5) The new folder dialog appears, click "Ok". Notice that no new folder appears
on the bookmark toolbar at the top level.
6) Open up the subfolder where your bookmark wa located in step 1. Now you
should be able to see where you created a new folder.

By right-clicking on the empty space and hitting "New Folder" I would expect to
create a new folder on the top level of the bookmark toolbar. Instead, the
folder is created in whatever folder contains the bookmark/folder that wa last
right-clicked. This doesn't seem to make any sense.

I would guess that some tag is being placed on the last item that is
right-clicked... Maybe this ha something to do with the line that is drawn on
submenu to indicate where the new item will be positioned..? Might be related
to either bug 271107 (no "insert here" line on the bookmark toolbar) or bug
252131 (location of newly created folders/bookmarks).
