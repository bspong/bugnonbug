A feature I haven't seen so far in any browser: a link filter

Similar to a spamfilter, that put bogus mail straight into the trashcan, I'd
like to have a filter system that doe the same with link to bogus webpages. By
bogus link I mean link that a normal user would never want to click on.

Examples for bogus links:
- advertisement banner
- sponsor
- link to porn page
- link to weird cgi script
- ...

I think it would be a great feature if a browser could just hide such links, by
following a list of rulesets (simple RegExps would be sufficient for me). Surely
everybody ha noticed that more and more page get filled with junk banner and
stuff. I want to allow my browser to hide such page content from me (or replace
it with some kind of symbol so that I know something is hidden there).

It would make browsing a lot faster, because:
- banner image don't have to be loaded
- 'real' link wouldn't be hidden under load of bogus one
- You Only See What You Want To See

A more general filter, that doe not only allow to filter links, but Images, or
HTML Contents in general would be great, too.

It could also help to restrict browsing feature for children. Don't allow link
that contain 'xxx', 'fuck', etc. and most porn page won't work anymore... or
hide/disallow 'bad language' in general.

It would be great to see some development in that direction :-) In my opinion,
it would be a great new feature for a browser that already contains a whole lot
of great new feature :-)
