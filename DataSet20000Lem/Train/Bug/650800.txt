I have been unable to find a way to start or stop this behavior. I also am not sure I have the correct Firefox vocabulary, so I must be more verbose than I'd like.

The rightmost widget of the tab bar is a downward-pointing arrow. Clicking this should show all tabs.

When I click the button, a window without titlebar or grab area appears. This window ha a search bar in the middle. Below it in a grid are thumbnail of my tabs. I will call this the Tab Preview window.

Normally, the Tab Preview window ha it top anchored to the bottom of the tab bar, it width match the width of the tab bar, and it height fill most of the browser window below. When the browser window is not very tall, the tab window ha height greater than the window size, in order to display all the tabs.

Sometimes - and I have not been able to determine what trigger this - the Tab Preview window appears in the wrong place with the wrong size. It appears anchored in the top-left corner of the Firefox browser window. Its size match the size of the toolbar and tab bar region. This is basically the opposite of where it should appear! It is completely unusable in this state.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
* Click the Show Tab Preview button (or whatever it's called).
* The Tab Preview window might or might not appear in the right place.
Actual Results:
The Tab Preview window appeared sized to the toolbar.

Expected Results:
The Tab Preview window appears over and sized roughly to the displayed tab.

I also can't figure out what make it stop doing this. Sometimes, showing the Panorama and going back make it stop, but sometimes it doesn't. It is very frustrating. I will attach a screenshot of the misbehavior.
