Both in the FF 3.5 and in the current nightly a above, basic keyboard navigation in the medium list is broken. You cannot use cursor key to navigate along the listbox entry to preview them. Which is a complete nuisance in term of usability when you are looking for a certain image and are forced to click them one by one instead of much more efficient cursoring down. I sometimes wonder how such thing can go unnoticed...

Steps
1) Open Tools > Page Info > Media
2) Focus first item of medium listbox
3) Try to press cursor down at least twice in a row (!)

Actual results:
After first cursor down, focus automatically shift to "Save" button, which doesn't help an inch a it's (supposed to be) the default button on that page anyway! Using keyboard navigation only, try getting focus back into the list and preview the next couple of image without banging your head against the wall.

Expected results:
TB should never ever move the focus away from where I placed it, especially not in list box with item that cry to be selected/viewed one after the other.
Cursoring up and down the list should just work, a in any other such list.
