"Tile Tabs" add-on and Greasemonkey together with e10s make browser unresponsive, slow to load page
Well, technically it doe work. With e10s activated the add-on still behaves exactly the same way a before.
BUT: the browser itself becomes pretty much unusable. It take very long for page to load, and when they're finished, it still say "Connecting..." in the title. It can take several second to completely switch from one tab to another and then it get rather messy. Only one tab at a time will be displayed properly, all other tab become either black if the browser is maximized, or white if it is not. The element are still there, i.e. the cursor change it appearance when hovering above text or links, but they aren't shown and cannot be interacted with. Only when switching from maximized to windowed mode the current tab will be displayed properly and all other tab will turn black/white instead. Also tab cannot be closed.
Other item like the menu or the bookmark seem to work just fine.

And one last thing regarding tile tabs: When I first tested it's functionality with e10s enabled it worked pretty well. After experimenting with the behaviour of tab a described above I again tried to tile some tabs. Specifically, I wa at wikipedia.org and wanted amazon.com to be above it. After a couple of seconds, in which the displayed tab flickered (sometimes showing both tabs, sometimes none), Nightly started opening new tabs. Then it asked if I wanted to stop a script that wa executed by amazon.org, but it didn't help. I restarted Nightly in safe-mode, closed amazon and all blank tab and restarted again. Since then, every time I start Nightly with both e10s and tile tab active, it immediatly begin to open about one new tab per second.

Ok, that is pretty much all I found until now. I might comment again when I solved the new-tab-issue.
