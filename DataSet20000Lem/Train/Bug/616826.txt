I'm often outdoors, browsing using my smart phone.

When I do this, FF show a strange behaviour:

Whenever I visit a domain for the first time after having connected to my mobile phone Internet provider, FF fails to retrieve the resource.

If that happens, FF first display "looking up {some domain} ..." in the status bar for, say 30 seconds, then quits by showing the "page could not be retrieved" error page. - Clicking the [Try again] button then finally retrieves the resource's content.

IE doe not show this behaviour, so I suppose the faulty module is in FF.

This happens with approx. 80 % of all connection attempts.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect a smart phone to your notebook, either by USB or Bluetooth
2. Enable Internet Sharing (on Windows Mobile 6.1 phones)
3. Enter some URL
Actual Results:
FF display "looking up [URL] ..." in the status bar for approx. 30 seconds. Then it quits retrieving the resource.

Expected Results:
FF should either wait for the DNS server's response or perform another, more successful, method of retrieving data from a DNS server.
