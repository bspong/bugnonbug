Subscribing to live bookmark "stars" the bookmark but selecting the star bookmark again
If a user subscribes to an RSS feed a a live bookmark, visiting the feed location will show the star filled in on the location bar, indicating it is a bookmark. If the user selects this star, instead of being shown the existing live bookmark's information, the location is treated a a new bookmark and added to the "unsorted bookmarks" folder. From that point on, all interaction is with this new bookmark.

If the dialog for bookmark and the star aren't really going to interact with a live bookmark, we should not show the star a filled in when the user visit the feed location after making it a live bookmark.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to a feed url (such a http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot).
2. In the preview, select "Subscribe now"
3. In the "Add Live Bookmark" dialog, select "Add", which will place the feed on the Bookmarks Menu.

Result: Star on location bar is now filled in.

4. Select star with a single click

Result: "Page Bookmarked" dialog come up showing the bookmark is now in "Unsorted Bookmarks" (which it is). This mean that there is now a bookmark for the feed in the "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder and a live bookmark with feed item in the "Bookmarks Menu" folder.
