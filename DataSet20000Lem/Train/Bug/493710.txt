quick follow up to a crash report, after said crash i restarted it gave this

=="Well, this is embarrassing.Firefox is having trouble recovering your window and tabs. This is usually caused by a recently opened web page."==


so i figured u may be interested in the knowledge that not only did it crash it also failed to recover, and to clarify it wasn't an apparent conflict with the page/s. because it and all the tabbed page were open for quite a duration of time. and i think i wa either scrolling or bringing Firefox back into focus when it just disappeared with an instant crash. then during the following restart it froze due to the length. and then received the "trouble recovering" error wa on www.elitebastards.com if help at all.
had alot of tab open. cache must have been occupied a fair bit all tab were mostly webpage with graphic elements. mostly wikipedia article and an instance or 2 of googlesearch and maybe a sourceforge.org tab still open and 1 or 2 elitebastard.com hardware article (with some images, chart table and comparison screens) left it idle for 5 or so minute then focus and or scroll the focused page.

also this is a follow up to a crash report sent from this I.P address. where a the crash report only sent the crash info i thought i would add further information about the crash and the added fact it failed to recover the session

sorry for not including any technical statement or the crash report itself. if the log is stored locally, if it is tell me where it is and i will send if requested in regard to making it easier for you to link it to the crash report in question)

also a note: haven't reproduced due to time constraint and limited (expensive) bandwidth, the session in question the tab were opened over a period of 4-5 hours. so maybe the time wa a factor too. , well hope that this is helpful in some way, and sorry if it isn't because i know it rather vague.

Reproducible: Didn't try
