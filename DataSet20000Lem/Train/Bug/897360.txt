Steps to reproduce:

I had written HTML with following Code

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<title>Test Page</title>
<script src="script1.js" type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
</script>
</head>

<body>
<form action="Default.aspx" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input id="file1" name="file1" type="file" />
<input type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>
</body>
</html>




Actual results:

because of adding script1.js in header or anywhere in document.body it doe not show file-selection-dialog box with manual click on browse button.
in script1.js there are lot of functions, it work fine on Internet Explorer in all version even file also get uploaded. if I remove the script1.js file from html source.
then it show file-selection-dialog box in firefox v.22 too, also file get uploaded.


Expected results:

I need to know that is there any javascript part which restricts or prevents to show file-selection-dialog box for security threats.
