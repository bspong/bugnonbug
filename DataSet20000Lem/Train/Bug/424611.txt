sidebar contentWindow NS_NOINTERFACE exception after re-opening

From an extension's chrome code, the following javascript work until you close the (overlayed) sidebar and re-open it:

var sbNode = document.getElementById("sidebar");
if ( ! sbNode.contentWindow )
return null;
return sbNode.contentWindow;

As long a the sidebar ha not been closed and re-opened, the contentWindow is returned.

Once the sidebar is closed and re-opened, just the check for "( ! sbNode.contentWindow )" throw an exception which I catch and print as:

Exception trying to get sidebar: locally MSG=[Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsIInterfaceRequestor.getInterface]" nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://global/content/bindings/browser.xml :: get_contentWindow :: line 0" data: no]

This problem doe not seem to exist in pre-FF 3.0 versions.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open custom/overlayed sidebar
2. Close custom/overlayed sidebar
3. Open custom/overlayed sidebar
4. Attempt to get sidebar contentWindow via chrome code with:
var sbNode = document.getElementById("sidebar");
if ( ! sbNode.contentWindow )
return null;
return sbNode.contentWindow;

Actual Results:
The 'if' condition throw an exception.

Expected Results:
Content window should exist and no exception should be thrown.


This is reproducible in the FF extension I am working on, and doe not happen on pre-FF 3.0 versions. I don't think there is anything peculiar about my extension in regard to this bug, but I have not attempted to reproduce this bug outside my extension.
