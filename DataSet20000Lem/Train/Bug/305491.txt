Using the css:hoover to display static content ist buggy if the displayed
content overlap the anchor causing the hoover. In my actual example a thumbnail
is overlapped by it fully sized version positioned "static" with higher z-index
on the page. When the larger image is "between" the mouse-cursor and the anchor
then the hooover-event seems to end. This result in image-flickering when
moving the mouse.

<a style="a:hoover span {display:block}"><img><span
style="display:none"><img/></span></a>

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create something like <a><img src="thumbnail"><span><img
src="largeimage"></span></a>
2.
Use following styles:
div.content a span {display:none; position:fixed; top: 0px; left: 0px;}
div.content a:hover span { display:block; }
3. Move mouse so that the image (in the span-tag) is displayed over the
thumbnail (content of a-tag).

Actual Results:
The displayed image is being removed immediately after the a:hover is executed.
When moving the mouse the image containted in the span-tag is flickering

Expected Results:
The image should stay on top until the mouse leaf the bound of the
overlapping image with the higher z-index.
