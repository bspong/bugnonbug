After loading Google Maps to my default location, the Search Maps feature cease to work. The map doesn't display any of the location "pins", and it will not refresh the map to any location entered in the Search Maps field. Google Maps work just fine in IE 7 and had worked just fine before the 3.0.1 Firefox upgrade. I reloaded Firefox suspecting that a file had become corrupt, but the reload produced the same results. I am running XP Home SP3 on a Dell Inspiron 6400 with 1GB of RAM and an Intel Centrino Duo T2050 at 1.6 Ghz

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://www.maps.google.com
2.Enter a location in the Search Maps field
3.Click on the Search Maps radio button
Actual Results:
The hourglass cursor appears for about one second then disappears. The word "Done" appears in the lower left corner of the screen, but no result are shown and the map doe not refresh at the new location

Expected Results:
The map should have refreshed on the new location, and the location "pins" should have appeared at the appropriate place on the new map. In addition, the Search Maps detail should be displayed along the left side of the screen associated with the corresponding location "pins".

I have only begun to experience this problem since upgrading to 3.0.1.
