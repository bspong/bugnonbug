AOL - Webmail - Service Unavailable in Firefox 3.5.5 and SeaMonkey 2.0 - Mac OSX 10.5.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_5_8; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.8 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0.4 Safari/531.21.10

As of Monday or Tuesday, I have been unable to access AOL Webmail using Firefox 3.5.5 and Seamonkey 2.0.

I believe I may have had a similar problem intermittently with either Safari or Camino, but both of these seem to be working well now.

I have several active AOL names, so I keep a version open in each of my browser so I don't have to sign in and out all of the time. I use a similar system for Gmail, a each browser more or le represents a business entitity.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to webmail.aol.com
2. attempt to sign in on Either Firefox 3.5.5 or SeaMonkey 2.0
Actual Results:
When the problem first began, on FF and SM, it would possibly open the mail inbox window, and then immediately reload and / or sign out. In Safari, it wa a loop until I minimized the window or closed it. I think this is AOLs problem, a Safari and Camino seem to be working normally now. FF and SM I just get a Service Unavailable and a code that link to a Windows trouble page. I'm using Mac OSX 10.5.8

Expected Results:
I open my email in box.

As I said, I think AOL might have changed something recently, a it seemed to happen to FF SM and Safari almost simultaneously with Safari eventually working normally.

I cleared Cookies in FF and SM a suggested, and it seems to be working now without a restart of the browser.

Thanks
