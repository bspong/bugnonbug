Get rid of redundant "Keep until" option

There are a number of "Keep until" option that are redundant with the Clear Private Data tool. The Clear Private Data tool clear these piece of data when Firefox exits, if configured to do so; we do not need another place to do the same.

Here are the example I've noticed:

- Privacy:Download History
Remove file from the Download Manager: Upon successful download
When Firefox exit
Manually

This entire dropdown can be eliminated. We know that the CPD tool will remove the file "when Firefox exits" if configured to do so, and can remove this option. The resulting option can then be reduced by making "Manually" an implied negative case of a checkbox:

[X] Remove file from the Download Manager upon successful download

- Privacy:Cookies
Keep cookies: Until they expire
Until I close Firefox
Ask me every time

The "Until I close Firefox" option is again in the CPD tool. I do not understand the use for "Ask me every time" here; that would quickly get annoying. The CPD tool can be set to ask every time for you; and will allow you to check and uncheck cookies, history, downloads, etc. That can replace this option.

This entire dropdown should be eliminated.
