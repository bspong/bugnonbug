dns locker adware resides only on firefox but not detected, possibly by maintenance service
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; Trident/7.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Steps to reproduce:

during the last 2 day orange firefox and firefox for developer were infected by DNS Locker adware. other browser including Edge, IE11 and Chrome are completely intact and clean.

PC us ESET nod, fully protected. there wa no risky web surfing, no infected emails, no new application installed.

checking the system according to guides... there were no suspicious application in Programs and Features, no unknown add-on and extentions on browser(s). also, all suggested registry key are clean and valid.

The most recent installs in Programs and Features are Mozilla Maintenance Service, only two day before malware started to show up. also "Block reported attack sites" section of option only contain two default firefox related domain a exceptions, add-on and market place.

the above increase the posibility that this malware ha been installed by firefox update and is limited to it, maybe a a hidden add-on.



Actual results:

after reviewing many guide and how-tos and performing many checks, I uninstalled firefox, delete all related folder and cleaned registry, then installed a fresh copy. in the second run dns locker showed up!

the only thing i could do wa bloking related ad link via NOD:
*.adnxs.com
*.amazonaws.com
*.atemda.com
*.bestpriceninja.com
*.bidswitch.net
*.clkmon.com
*.cloudflare.com
*.contextweb.com
*.criteo.com
*.dnsqa.me
*.eshopcomp.com
*.gmdelivery.com
*.icontentkey.com
*.k1wmm.com
*.ltmmty.com
*.metrigo.com
*.quantserve.com
*.smartadserver.com
*.teracreative.com
*.visadd.com
*.yabidos.com

this prevents ad to activate but firefox CPU usage is too high.



Expected results:

if there is an add-on it must be visible in Add-ons Manager, at least in safe mode. so what is this?
