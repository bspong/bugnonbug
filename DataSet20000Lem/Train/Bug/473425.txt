When downloading a file and selecting 'Save File', a file dialog appears to select where the file should be saved.
If you want to create a new folder, you can (or could before) click the right menu button to get the Explorer context menu. I observe the following oddities:
- the New menu item only ha 1 child, called 'New' itself which will create a shortcut
- the New menu fails to show all other item such a 'New Folder' or any file type that can be created with this context menu
- when moving the mouse over other item in the top-level context menu, some of them (in my case Tortoise CVS items) lose their icon

Now, this only happens the first time I right-click. If I close the context menu and right-click again, the menu is fine.

It look like a bug in the generation of this menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site to download a file, for example sourceforge.net
2. When the download-dialog appears, select 'Save File' (your firefox should be configured to prompt you for a location)
3. When the 'Enter name of file to save to..' dialog appears, click right on a white area in the file list
4. Move the mouse to the 'New' item of the context menu

Actual Results:
The context menu child of 'New' only show the item 'New'

Expected Results:
The context menu child of 'New' should show at least:
'Folder'
'Shortcut'
------------
'Text Document'

I'm running Firefox 3.0.5 on Windows XP Pro SP3 with the latest update (13 jan 2009).
