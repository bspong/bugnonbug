I have seen several time this problem in the past two week but it's hardly reproducible (it seems random). Several tab are open. A web site open a popup window (example, to let the user grant access to a twitter account), you close the popup manually using the native window cross button (upper right corner of the popup window). The popup close and immediately the browser "Confirm close" dialog box appears (as if you had clicked on the cross button of the main browser window).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I had this issue, among other sites, after installing the F1 addons for Firefox
While having several tab opened :
1. Install the addon https://f1.mozillamessaging.com/(the browser restarts)
2. Open the setting window (from the addon UI) https://f1.mozillamessaging.com/settings/
3. Add a twitter account (a popup opens)
4. Allow access and close the window
Actual Results:
The popup close and the "Confirm close" dialog box appears

Expected Results:
The "Confirm close" dialog box should not appears
