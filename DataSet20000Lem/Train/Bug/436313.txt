Accented (ISO-8859-1) character are rendered in a random, non Latin font

While performing test with an internally created font I noticed that accented characters, e.g. á, à. ê etc. are NOT rendered correctly in FF3.0/RC1. Initially I believed the problem may be the use of our font, however I have now discovered that the problem also exists when any font (via a style) is specified, or even when NO font is specified (i.e. use the default browser font - e.g. Times New Roman).

The curious thing is that the page render correctly but almost a soon a everything is painted the *accented* character are repainted using an (apparently) randomly chosen, non-latin font e.g. Hebrew, Cyrillic etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a simple html file containing a line of ASCII letter (aeiou) and a line of accented character (áéíóú)
2. Open the file in FF3.0/RC1

Actual Results:
The first line of text appears correctly (aeiou)
The second line briefly appears correctly (áéíóú) before being rendered in cyrillic characters.

Expected Results:
The accented character should have been rendered in the default font, in this case Times New Roman.

If simple line of text are used then the problem is easily reproducible. Mixing accented character with non-accented character appears to mask the problem.

The following html fragment may be used to verify the existence of the bug:

<html>
<head/>
<body>
<!-- ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ -->
<!-- <br/> -->
<!-- áàãâéèêíìîóòõôúùû ÁáÀàÃãÂâÉéÈèÊêÍíÌìÎîÓóÒòÕõÔôÚúÙùÛû -->
<br/>
This appears in Times New Roman: aeiou
<br/>
This appears in cyrillic: áéíóú
<br/>
</body>
</html>
