The basic idea of this interface change/enhancement is to allow search easily
and logically for user of any level of technical skill from the
location/address bar, doing away entirely with the need for a separate search
bar. The idea is not to make it more awkward for advanced users, in fact I
believe it is actually simpler and faster still.

The basic design I am suggesting is a follows. This replaces both the current
location bar and search bar.

<icon>[address or search term]<go><search><icon>

KEY:
The first <icon> represents the favicon, just a it doe now

The text in [ ] represents the location (now also search) bar where you type

<go> This is a small go button. Lots of user will not use this, but _many_ le
advanced user (which Firefox will start to encounter more of) will simply not
know what to do otherwise. My parent are prime examples.

<search>This button would search using the current search engine. Rather than
just saying "Search" it should in my opinion also name the currently selected
search engine (e.g. "Google Groups" or "Google UK") underneath the word "Search"
(or perhaps something like "Search for this on"). This second line of text would
change when the search engine is changed. It is _critical_ that this button have
a tooltip (or something) pointing out the keyboard shortcut for web search (see
below) from the location/search bar.

<icon>This is the icon representing the search engine (e.g. the G icon for
google, the Y icon for yahoo etc) which you would click on to select the search
engine (as it is now, but without the search bar on the right). When shifting
between multiple search engine with the same icon (e.g. google uk, groups, etc)
you have the added benefit that the search button also give the name of the
current engine.


Essentially, you get a a cleanup of the GUI and the cutdown in complication by
having to use a keyboard shortcut to jump to a search and back again. You press
enter for an address (and le advanced user have the comfort of a tiny 'go'
button), and you use the keyboard shortcut (now in the nightly builds) for web
search to do the search. This is the same a clicking on the search button.

Now there is a shortcut for web search put into the nightly builds, this is
obviously going to be the shortcut of choice for most advanced users. It's
quicker that having to jump to the search box first. As for the le advanced, I
am certain that most of them will feel more comfortable clicking a 'Search'
button than having to click to the search box (plus the particularly le
IT-literate may not know what to do without a search button to click).

As a last note, I don't feel that this will take up more toolbar real-estate, in
fact it may well increase the area available to the location bar, while allowing
longer search to fit entirely on-screen.

Please consider this request for enhancement. I feel it would be a great
addition to Firefox 1.0
