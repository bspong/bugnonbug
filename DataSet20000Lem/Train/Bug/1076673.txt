Steps to reproduce:

Start Firefox. (Version 32.0.3) Open 7 sites. Open Facebook. Monitor memory use over an hour during casual use. Split off FB into MSIE and only use Firefox for other sites.


Actual results:

Firefox went from 166,532K of ram to 737,460K in 45 minutes. I had been monitoring memory use for a couple of month because Firefox would get to memory consumption a high a 1,800,000K which grind my computer to a halt. After running these test and seeing that after 2 month and some update it wasn't fixed, I thought it must be FB. I tried closing the browser tab for FB, and for other sites. Memory might fluctuate, but it isn't let go. So, I started using FB in MSIE. MSIE doe not do this. So, I thought it wa bad programming in FB. But after using MSIE exclusively for FB, and Firefox for almost everything else, Firefox creep up in memory use for other site a well. I've been monitoring it and when it get to 750,000K or more, I just kill it using Task Manager. That wa 4 or 5 time today.


Expected results:

Pretty obvious. Firefox should not act like it ha memory leak. Facebook is doing something pretty active, I'm sure of that. But apparently MSIE doesn't have a problem.
