After installing Firefox 3 I'm unable to scroll via the mouse wheel on my Apple Mighty Mouse. I'm also unable to scroll using the up and down buttons. The two finger scrolling with the track pad is also disabled a well a up and down arrow key on the keyboard. Only dragging the scroll bar via the mouse works.

The problem is isolated to web page in FF3, i.e. I can scroll in the about:config window and other non-web window within FF3.

FF 2 and all other program work perfectly so it clearly can't be a problem with the mouse.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF3 from a previous version (2.0.0.9 in my case)
2. Attempt to scroll web page with the mouse wheel on an Apple Mighty Mouse
3. Attempt to scroll web page with two finger on the trackpad a well a using arrow key or up and down button on the scrollbar

2.
3.
Actual Results:
Scroll bar is unresponsive. No scrolling

Expected Results:
Scrolling

I'm using the latest Beta version with the web developer plugin, but the problem occurred exactly the same when using the 3.0.1 version.
