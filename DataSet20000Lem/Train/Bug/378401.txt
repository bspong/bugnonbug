I use firefox on a daily basis and recently noticed with the v2.0.0.3 that the amount of memory used increase abnormally. This happens on both of my computer and is noticable after firefox ha been running for over an hour. I use multiple tab during browsing of which some of them I login to secure websites. After about an hour or so, the browser start slowing down in every aspect, such a open new tab, load page, etc. I open the task manager to see that firefox is using well over 300 MB of ram. Screenshot available upon request. This happens under normal browsing usage and I am unable to determine why the amount of memory increase like so. When I terminate the browser, it take about 15 second for firefox.exe to be removed from task manager, unless I force it. When I restart the browser, the memory usage is back to normal but again after extended use, the memory usage jump way up again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Browser random site for an hour with multiple tab and without closing the browser completely.
3. Open task manager to see it current memory usage.
Actual Results:
Memory usage jumped to over 300 MB of RAM. Browser performance dramatically decreases. The only remedy so far is to terminate the browser, wait until it is cleared from task manager and reopen.

Expected Results:
Not demand so much memory and slow down dramatically.

After searching current bugs, the only thing close to this report is other report of memory leaks, but in unrelated matters. I wa unable to match this report with any known issues. The browser doe not crash, but it slows down to the point where it almost freezes, but is barely responsive.
