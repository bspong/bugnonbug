The map generated on the canada411.com webpage from the Maptuit service appears
in the print preview window but doe not print to paper. The page print fine
with IE.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open URL:
http://canada411.yellowpages.ca/searchCustomer.do?type=MAP&srchtype=business&directoryId=095451&provinceId=QC&what=lockheed&showMsgBox=1&listingId=42574360&sType=productSearch&step=more&pcid=0&pst=simpleSearch&city=Montreal+Island+-+West
2. CTRL + P to print

Actual Results:
The web page printed fine butthe map image wa missing.

Expected Results:
The web page print find WITH the map image.

The web page us some kind of HTML trickery since when you right-click on the
map image to check the properties, you get a link to
"http://ice.service.maptuit.com/am2/im/blank.gif" that is basically a blank
image, which is what I think Firefox print to paper instead of the map image
itself. For some reason though the map image appears fine the the print preview
window.
