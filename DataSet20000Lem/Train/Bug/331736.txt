Normally when visiting a page like this from MSN, whether it be in Windows XP, Ubuntu, or Fedora, the text of the article is not wrapped around the link box and ad that are on the page. Mozilla browser doe the same thing. I don't want to use IE, but it works. Konquerer work a well, but I prefer Firefox. This ha done this with any version of Firefox I've used.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Click a news story on MSN.com home page
3. When the page opens, the text of the article is hidden under the ad and boxes.

Actual Results:
What wa described above - the text is under the box instead of wrapped around them

Expected Results:
Text wrapped around the boxes, formatted, a other browser do.

This happens about 99.9% of the time - I very seldom get the page to display correctly. I haven't changed any themes, still using the default on install.
