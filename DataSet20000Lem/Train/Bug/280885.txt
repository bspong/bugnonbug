For some reason when I open my yahoo mail account and at the top is listed the
compose button, I cannot click the button. well I can click it but when I do
nothing happens. I have tried uninstalling firefox and reinstalling it and even
went so far a one time (just now actually) I went a far a to go to document
and setting and delete folder left behind under application data and seartched
through the registry and remove all trace of firefox. I then restarted and
downloaded firefox again and still have the same problem. This ha happed to me
on other computer on which I have installed firefox but doe not happen on all
computers. When I think about it all only the xp system have problem I believe
but am not sure. But when I click the Compose button on yahoo mail it just sits
there a if I have done nothing. All other web site work fine it's just the
yahoo mail compose button and it happens everytime.
