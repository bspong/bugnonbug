Summary: Crash [@ nsCOMArray_base::InsertObjectAt nsNavHistoryFolderResultNode::OnItemChanged] deleting "ghost" bookmark

Steps to Reproduce (sorry, hard to repro; maybe someone can sprinkle null checks?)

1. In the Bookmarks Manager, I had a bookmark for http://ambientpersona.deviantart.com/, among 5 or so others of varied site
2. I wa testing quicksearch/typedown, and typed "a"
3. I right-clicked on it entry (once a few others were successfully filtered), and chose "Delete"
4. I then clicked the red close (X) widget in the quicksearch/typedown textfield, which restored the view
5. Oddly enough, the already-deleted "ambientpersona.deviantart.com" bookmark re-appeared, so I tried deleting it again
6. I immediately crashed, here:
