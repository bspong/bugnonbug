it is the first time I report a bug here so be gentle...
after an update the firefox window wa a small at it can be, only the minimize, maximize, and close button were showing and no actual visible window area. to make sure it wa not an error or a mouse miss-movement I closed the program and opened it again, same result...
after changing the size of the window manually it showed just normal.
I wen on and did the same thing on my sister computer and got the same result.
the 2 computer are Acer aspire laptop
did the same on my PC and all wen fine so i'm guessing it may have something to do with one of the acer program

Problem came after updating firefox from 3.5.6 version to 3.5.7


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.ignore the update advice
2.software update itself from 3.5.6 to 3.5.7
3.open firefox
Actual Results:
the firefox screen is just a small frame at the top left of the screen, only large enough to show the firefox icon , the 3 window button and a small frame


did the same in 2 different acer laptop and got the same result but on my PC could not get it to happen
