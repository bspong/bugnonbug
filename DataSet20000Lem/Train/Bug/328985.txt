In IE, when I access my company mail in web outlook, I get that day's calendar event that I have put in earlier in a popup. These are recurring event that I have setup. When I open the company mail in Firefox, this doe not happen! I can setup recurring event even in Firefox. I have't set them up in Firefox yet but I looked in the new calendar event section of web outlook express using Firefox and saw that recurring option are available. Only, I don't get reminder of thing that I have to do.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Access email via web outlook.
2.Setup recurring calendar events.
3.They do not show up a they are supposed to.

Actual Results:
You will need access to email via web outlook.

Expected Results:
No calendar event come up even when it is scheduled to show up!

A popup should come with the calendar event scheduled. And yes, I have that page unblocked so that popups are not blocked.
