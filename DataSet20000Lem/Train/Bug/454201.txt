If you call stopPropagation() member during the 'contextmenu' event flow, an additional event with name 'contextmenu' get dispatched.

This is a change (presumably wrong) happened since FF3

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
<script type="text/javascript">
(function() {
var oOutput = document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("div")),
oEvent;
document.addEventListener('contextmenu', function(event){
// Stop Propagation
event.stopPropagation();
// Register event occurance
oOutput.appendChild(document.createElement("div"));
oOutput.lastChild.textContent = event.type + ': ' + (oEvent && (event == oEvent) ? "same event" : "new event");
// Cache event for later comparision
oEvent = event;
}, false);
})();
</script>
Actual Results:
contextmenu: new event
contextmenu: new event

Expected Results:
contextmenu: new event

The test case provided also demonstrates the fact that the second call to the handler is done with a different event object (so it is not duplicate call to the handler but an additional event dispatch)
