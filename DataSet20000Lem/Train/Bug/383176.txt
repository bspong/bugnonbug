drag and drop URL to file system creates url file whose content is suffed with a few extra characters. Occurs with 90% URL. I assume that the url string being written ha a size at least 2 byte greater than the correct length.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any URL - tested with http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/2.0.0.4/firstrun/
2. drag URL to any window folder
(Alternatively - creating URL file in file system using drag and drop from a bookmark entry produce the same result described below)


Actual Results:
edit file with a tool that show hex data will show extra data following end of line <CR><LF> (hex x'0D0A') attached sample show hex x'2046'. File size is 88 byte NOT 86 bytes.

Expected Results:
Correctly formed ".url" file with no extra bytes. Verify by edit file with a tool that show hex data and file end at end of line <CR><LF> (hex x'0D0A'). File size would be 86 bytes.

A hex capable edit/view tool is needed a this extra byte may be x'00' in some cases.

Tested using a fresh profile built with "Firefox -ProfileManager" command

This behavior wa present in the previous release of firefox v2.0.0.3. It is really annoying if you use 3rd party tool to process ".url" files. Currently ever ".url" file ha to be opened and the garbage character removed.
Sometime the ".url" file is correct but I think this depends on whatever memory content is adjacent to the ".url"

Problem doe NOT occur when tested on Win 2000 + firefox v2.0.0.3
Problem doe occur when tested on Win 98SE + firefox v2.0.0.3 or v2.0.0.4
