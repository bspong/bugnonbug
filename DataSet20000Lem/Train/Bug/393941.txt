Firefox print set-up look like it is going to function, but it doe not create any response in the printer. Also, I cannot input fax/scan information from my printer/scanner/fax machine into my computer. That function will not work. When using Windows XP Pro, there wa never a problem. The new computer is a HP a6030n. The new fax/printer/scanner is an HP Photosmart C7180. Help!
