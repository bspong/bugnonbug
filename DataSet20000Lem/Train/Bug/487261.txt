2 error 1 appaers to have a osurce of Mrxmb and the other come up a an informational popup

to preface this I know it ha been reported, but I have no found a solution once after searching for over an hour unfortunately. I thought I found one where it told me to save the cache locally but the procedure to do so told me to change non-existing options.... so it wa a dead end. This seems to occur because of enabled history. whats causing the problem is folder redirection to the server specifically the person profile is on the server and not on the local computer.

if anyone ha a real test and tried solution please let me know asap
