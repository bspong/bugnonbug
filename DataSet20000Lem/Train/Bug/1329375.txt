The last 3-4 day that site/page ha been gone I figured my computer ha been restarting cause maybe of update because I have a new computer,did it tonight on the 6th with my brother in law and he said the box said it crashed.. I have the lastest update for Firefox and I have Windows 10 PLEASE fix this I LOVE you're Firefox I don't want to have to LEAVE it PLEASE I'm really asking you to FIX this CRAP once and for all PLEASE!!!!!


Actual results:

I didn't get to see the box rather if it said Firefox crashed or not wa not using the computer brother in law said that's what it said,last 3-4 after I gotten up Firefox browser ha been gone by it self after I had left it up from the night before..


Expected results:

I have left the browser on this site that I have on for YEAR'S with no problem at all and it not caused any problem shouldn't had done anything at all should had left the browser alone but the last 3-4 day at LEAST that the page/site ha been gone for some reason I don't know why....
