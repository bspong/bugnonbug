scroll wheel work in all application a normal.
scroll wheel in firefox only work on all display except those to the 'left' of display '1' a shown in the window 'Display Properties' Settings tab.

On a four head system (two video card with two video port each: dvi and vga):
display order set to 1:3:2:4 allows firefox to work on all display heads.
display order set to 3:2:1:4 only allows firefox to scrollwheel on display 1:4
display order set to 3:1:2:4 only allows firefox to scrollwheel on display 1:2:4

again, all other application (notepad,rxvt,aura browser,etc) use the wheel fine.

workaround: mark the left-most display a the 'primary monitor'
(for window xp, check the box labeled 'Use this device a the primary monitor'



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. get a multi-head system, two display at least
2. move display '1' to the far right and select [apply]
3. test scrolling with any large web page (the above URL should suffice)
4. alternately, increase width of web page across all head
5. attempt scrollwheel action while mouse is on each display
Actual Results:
scrollwheel action only work on primary display and those display to the right.

Expected Results:
scrollwheel action should work on all display

workaround: mark the left-most display a the 'primary monitor'
(for window xp, check the box labeled 'Use this device a the primary monitor'
