I'd really like to have some way to disable the extra icon that appear in the Location field, the button for "Bookmark this page", "Subscribe to this page" and so on. These eat up valuable space that might otherwise be used for displaying the actual URL content, and having these getting in the way all the time when I don't need them is a too high price to pay for the convenience of getting slightly quicker access to the functionality when I do need it. After all, most of the time while browsing you will NOT be bookmarking the page you're at.

Similarly, I don't want the "Search" icon inside the search field, a I'm quite happy hitting "Enter" in order to activate the search functionality - and would prefer seeing some extra letter of the search string to having a "convenient" button in the field.

So, a option to hide these icon would be nice - although the functionality might really be removed completely for all I care.

Reproducible: Always
