Saved password won't migrate from Firefox 3.0.8

After installing Firefox 3.1 Beta 3, I wa happy to see that all of my bookmark had migrated properly. However, when trying to access one of my password-protected website I wa prompted to enter a password that I had previously saved in Firefox 3.0.8. In the Tools>Options>Security>Saved Passwords screen, no site are listed. I backed up my profile directory and then uninstalled both Firefox 3.1 Beta 3 and Firefox 3.0.8. After making sure all file were erased (both from /Program Files and in my Windows profile /Application Data,) I re-installed Firefox 3.1 Beta 3. I then copied my backed-up key3.db and signons.sqlite to the fresh profile. Looking at my Saved Passwords list still showed up blank. I then went to one of my password-protected website and entered the password. Firefox prompted me to "Remember this password," which I clicked on and then verified that this particular website now showed up in the Saved Passwords list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Attempt to access a password-protected website
Actual Results:
Prompted to enter password

Expected Results:
Password automatically entered from my Saved Passwords list.
