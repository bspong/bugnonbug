When I drag a URL link from a message viewed in Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 on drop it onto the main window of Firefox, or into the location bar of Firefox, the URL fails to load. Instead, Firefox behaves a if the URL only contained the letter "h", which just happens to be the first character of the URL.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a plain text message in Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 that contains a URL, such a http://www.beyonwiz.com.au/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=28048#28048
2. Drag the URL from Thunderbird into Firefox (either somewhere in the main window or into the location bar)
3. About 10-25% of the time this will result in Firefox behaving a if the URL wa "h", the rest of the time it work fine.
Actual Results:
URL http://h not found

Expected Results:
The page indicated by the full URL should be displayed.

To help determine whether the issue may have been with the source of the DnD, I tried dragging the URL onto a KDE Konsole window. This resulted in the full URL being correctly pasted in all (about 20) of my tests.
