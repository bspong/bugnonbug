browser_social_chatwindow.js is overly picky about it chat window size
While running test locally, I see:

TEST-INFO | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/social/browser_social_chatwindow.js | resizing window so chat area is 660 wide, currently it is 246.10000610351562. Screen avail is 1600, current outer width is 521
TEST-INFO | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/social/browser_social_chatwindow.js | skipping this a we can't resize chat area to 660 - got 659.0999755859375
TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/base/content/test/social/browser_social_chatwindow.js | can't do any test without this width

or:

Is that extra .9 of a pixel really necessary for the test to work properly?

The test setup I use is an Xvfb server:

$ Xvfb -screen :0 1600x1200x24 :99 &

running openbox:

$ DISPLAY=:99.0 openbox &

and then running the test like so:

$ DISPLAY=:99.0 TEST_PATH=browser/base/content/test/ make mochitest-browser-chrome
