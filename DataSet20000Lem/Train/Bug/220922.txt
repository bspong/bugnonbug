I have several version of Java installed on my PC already and am wondering if it
a near future release of Firebird, if *after* installation of Firebird (i.e. if
using a nightly build), Java support could be integrated into Firebird simply by
perhaps going into Tools -> Options and specifying the JDK directory. That
would seem to be the easiest way to integrate Java for those who already have it
installed on their system. For those who install Firebird via the installer, it
would be nice to search for the JDK's installed on the computer and ask the user
to select which one he/she would like to use. If a JDK is not found, then the
user can be asked if he/she would like to download and install the JDK. (Sorry
it's been a while since I did installed Firebird via the installer, so if this
functionality already exists, my apologies.) However, by far, the most critical
feature needed is to allow Java integration, post-Firebird installation, via the
Tools -> Options menu. I tried the importing the registry key, a noted on the
Firebird FAQ for integration Java, but it didn't work. Thank you.
