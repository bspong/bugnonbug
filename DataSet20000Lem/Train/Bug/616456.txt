Have multiple tab open, then save tab and quit Minefield. Update Minefield. When you reload Minefield and look at the Windows 7 Preview Pane (to the right of the Start Menu) only the very first tab ha the Window Preview shown, even though you have multiple tab open. I like to be able to click from one tab to another using the Windows Preview Pane. I have to Save and Quit again and reload Minefield after an update in order to see all the tabs' window previews.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs.
2. Save tab and quit.
3. Update Minefield to latest Nightly.
4. When you reload Minefield only the very first tab ha the window preview on the Minefield icon on the taskbar. I have to then Save and Quit AGAIN and reload Minefield to see all of the window previews.
Actual Results:
Only the first tab is shown a a window preview after an update to Minefield.

Expected Results:
All tab should have window preview shown on the taskbar, not just the first one.
