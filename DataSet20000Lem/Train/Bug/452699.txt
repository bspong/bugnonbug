This problem only occurs in Vista 64-bit and doe not occur in FF2. In Vista 64-bit, when a div element's width and height are modified, the space occupied by the element is updated immiedately, but the element doe not get fully rendered until after a delay.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the provided URL.
2. Click in the upper-left portion of the box and drag the mouse to the lower-right.

Actual Results:
A new box is drawn and moved a the mouse is dragged on the screen. In Windows 32-bit, the updating may not be smooth, but the box will always be drawn with a complete 4-sided border. In Windows 64-bit, the right and bottom edge of the box will disappear a the mouse is dragged downward and to the right.

Expected Results:
The rendering should be the same in both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems.

The JavaScript onmousemove handler in this example ha a dummy loop to eat processor time. If the function is too fast, the effect will not be noticeable.

I did some experimenting, and it appears that this is occurring because the space occupied by the div being updated is changed immediately, but in Vista x64, there is a delay in rendering the new region. Thus, the previous border are erased, but the new border cannot be seen until the new region is finally rendered.
