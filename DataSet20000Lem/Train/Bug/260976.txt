The page itself ha javascript protection to stop it being viewed on it own.
From www.runescape.com click on 'play game' then 'high detail' then any world.

On the game with the Java applet there is a navigation bar with link on. The
worldmap link ALWAYS work because the page it load contains no frameset. The
other link target new page which contain a frameset. The new page appears and
the source of that page is correct, but the inner frame content are not always
loaded, so the page appears blank.

5. select the 'manual' link from teh navigation bar

Actual Results:
The page that pop up (as a result of the href targetting an unknown frame)
appears blank because the frameset content have not loaded

Expected Results:
Frameset should have loaded the inner frame page and displayed their content
correctly.
