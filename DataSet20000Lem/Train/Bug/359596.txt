I changed from IE7 a this version of IE wa causing a lot of problems, I dissabeled IE7 & downloaded Mozilla Suite & Mozilla Firefox.
The problem is even though Big Fish Tool Bar downloaded O.K.It is not in "View Tool bars."
Yahoo Anti-Spy for Fire Fox downloads o.k. but when I go to use it it keep telling me I need to upgrade, I have uninstalled it & downloaded it so many times, it's driving me insane, yet on IE7 it worked o.k. ( It seems to be going round in a loop.)
