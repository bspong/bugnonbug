When trying to use the search toolbar I can type in the search box but cannot search. When trying to hit enter, or click the magnifier icon, nothing happens.

This problem occurs at our office, many user run in to this problem but not all. The problem started after upgrading to Firefox 3.xxx. Before there were no problems. As multiple user have this problem, I wa able to reproduce it mutiple time using different version of Firefox.

The problem occurs under Mac OS X 10.5.3 through 10.5.7 (if applicable).
Also tried this with Firefox 3.0.3 3.0.5 3.0.11 and Firefox 3.5 All have the same problem.

With the user that have this problem, it happens all the time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Hard to say. After upgrading to firefox 3.0 search box fails to work.

When tested no plugins, themes, or add-on are used. Other than standard that come with installing the browser.

Also there a few suggestion I already tested with varying results.

- removing or renaming the formhistory.sqlite
Works temporarily. Let's you use the search box apporximatly 1-3 times. Varies.

- removing or renaming the search.sqlite
Crashes the browser on first attempt to open. After that, same a above, work temporarily.

- creating a completely new profile
Works temporarily. Let's you use the search box a couple of time (varies, 3-10 times). But ultimately stop working.

- clearing private data (Firefox 3.0.xxx ONLY)
Also not a permanent work around. When letting firefox clear history on shutdown it work when restarting firefox (obviously). After that, when the browser is running, the user can only use the search box a couple of time (varies, 5 or so) before the search box becomes unresponsive again.
