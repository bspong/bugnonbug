nsIAnnotationService IDL is lying about EXPIRE_NEVER
from Jan Odvarko's comment in dev.platform...

To demonstrate the problem, I have created a simple extension, that
can be used to reproduce the problem.

Download here: http://www.janodvarko.cz/temp/testext.xpi

Here are step to reproduce:

1) When the extension is loaded it test two annotations. You should
see something like a follows the first time when it's loaded (in the
system console, using dump()):

Test; initialize
Test; annotation for: https://google.com/ -> false
Test; annotation for: https://getfirebug.com/ -> false

The false at the end is because the annotation don’t exist yet.

2) When you close Firefox window, you should see following in the
console:

Test; shutdown
Test; annotation for: https://google.com/ -> true
Test; annotation for: https://getfirebug.com/ -> true

Now there is true at the end, it’s because both annotation have been
created and tested when the extension is unloaded. Yes, now they
exist.

3) Restart your Firefox
Now I see following:

Test; initialize
Test; annotation for: https://google.com/ -> false
Test; annotation for: https://getfirebug.com/ -> true

The annotation for https://google.com/ is not there!
