When you place text inside a float:right div and render it in print preview all
is well. When you go and decrease it size with font-size:##px/pt the smaller
sized string will overflow the margin and disappear in a print:preview.

This doe not happen in Times New Roman, Times or Serif, other font family have
not been tested. Only happens with Georgia.
