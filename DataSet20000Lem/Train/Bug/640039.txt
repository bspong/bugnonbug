Crackling/popping noise from WAV file with Audio tag in Linux

I'm hearing crackling/popping noise from all .wav file using the audio tag in Firefox 3.6.15 in Ubuntu 10.10. The file I've tested all work fine in every other situation, including medium player and even Firefox plugins like Totem. I have complete control over the file and have tried modifying thing like sample size (8 bit vs. 16 bit), frame rate (44.1 kHz, etc.), and the actual note played, but nothing seems to get rid of the noises. Preloading vs. not preloading also seemed to have no affect.

I also tested in Firefox in Windows 7, and it sounded fine there. However, using the exact same .wav file with the audio tag in Chrome on my Linux system is also 100% fine, so I'm assuming the problem is not with my sound card (I have Alsa, by the way) and hence I'm reporting it here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox on a Linux machine (well, at least Ubuntu).
2. Go to a page with an audio tag with a .wav file a it source.
3. Play the audio tag.
Actual Results:
I hear horrible crack and pops.

Expected Results:
I expect to hear only the data in the .wav file (which doe not include crack and pops) and nothing more.

I'd be very happy with a workaround - if there's anything I can do to the .wav data or the audio tag to avoid this bug, that'd be great. Just let me know.

Also, I'm a developer, so don't be afraid to ask technical questions.

I will attach a sample .wav file and HTML page that demonstrate this bug after submitting.
