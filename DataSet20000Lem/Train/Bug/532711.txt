Immediately after the last update, began getting a message Looking up AFP titan ( a laptop that sometimes is on my network) Of course, that laptop is often not on the network, so it doesn't find it. If I click Cancel, Firefox freezes, and the message is still onscreen. I can get to most web sites, but sometimes this come up, usually after clicking a link. Maybe it's trying to synchronize links? In that case, maybe XMarks now need update? Also, various gadget on my Google home page are running like glue. All are slowed, but some of A. Bowman's animation are almost unusable. I guess those are Flash. I have the newest Flash. If I go to Bowman's page, the same gadget runs, but the Google gadget version doe not run normal speed.
