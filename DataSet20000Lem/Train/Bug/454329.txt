The FF3 print to file dialog on Linux doe not allow you to select and edit an existing filename (.pdf or .ps) before saving new document.

The FF3 print dialog is, for lack of better words, incredibly awkward. On many occasion I need to print a set of pdf file from the federal court sites. The needed pdf file name are similar. The new print dialog in FF3 make this so awkward I want to scream. The filename will be of the type:

In FF2, we were presented with a normal save dialog that easily allowed selecting the directory, selecting a filename to place it in the filename edit field, changing a character or two and saving normally.

Now in FF3, the effort is doubled. The new cryptic dialog requires first navigating the "Save in folder" directory listbox that ha no ability to add a 'shortcut' for frequently used directories, then after choosing "Other" you are presented with a somewhat normal file dialog to navigate to the desired directory only to find that there is no way to select a file. The after choosing "Open" to select the directory, you are returned to the print dialog to enter a new filename in a completely separate filename textbox. That's nuts.

Then you get to try and remember "was that filename?: "

or wa it:

This ha got to be fixed (and whoever developed the new dialog -- shot!). I usually never complain about changes, and when FF3 came out, I wrote it off a a 'temporary' dialog thinking it would be replaced later. No dice, at FF3.0.1 it is still there slowing thing down to a crawl.

Please, don't take this the wrong way. I understand this isn't a show stopper, but this ha got to be one of the most annoying "improvements" I have ever seen.

Is there any way you can put out a hack for about:config or a patch that would at least give the option of using normal FF2 file dialog with FF3?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.File -> Print or (ctrl+p)
2.choose "Print to File"
3.
Actual Results:
Inability to select prior file name an have it placed in the filename edit textbox

Expected Results:
Ability to select an existing filename placing it in the filename editbox then the ability to change a few character and save

None, that's it, either bring back the normal file dialog, or allow selection of an existing filename with the "Save in Folder" dialog and put the chosen filename in the "Name:" edit-box so that you can save similar filename without having to completely reinvent the wheel by retyping the entire name.
