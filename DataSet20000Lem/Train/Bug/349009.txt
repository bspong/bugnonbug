It first started when Filterset.G auto updated. What had happened wa Firefox restarted itself, and said that it had updated. By doing so, it reset my home page and personal preferences. I set them all back, and thought that thing were good. A couple day later, it reseted again. I uninstalled Filterset.G, and subsequently all other extension I never use. Now it still doe it every other day. I already re-installed Firefox, and it still continues. I don't think I have spyware/adware/viruses, I have already scanned numerous amount of time for that, it just auto update every other day and reset all of my settings.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close (if it doesn't autoclose) Firefox
2. Open Firefox
3.

Actual Results:
Nothing, a I said above, it happens once or twice every other day at it's own discretion.

Expected Results:
Not reset all of my settings.

It all started with the Filterset.G extension from your addon site. I think it screwed up something in the Registry Files for Firefox.
