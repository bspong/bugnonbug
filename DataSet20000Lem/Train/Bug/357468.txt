First I open some new page and visit some site with pop-up commands.
When I right-click on a tab and say "close other tabs" and the confirmation dialogue appears, the pop-up can open.
When I do not open the confirmation dialogue, the pop-up blocker work properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn the pop-up blocker on (if it is off)
2. Make a HTML-Page with a hyperlink to a page you know that us pop-up and open it
3. Now open new tab by holding the ctrl-key pressed and clicking on the link several time
4. While the page are loading, right-click on any tab and choose "close other tabs"
Actual Results:
After performing the 4 steps, the pop-up opened, even with my pop-up blocker turned on.

Expected Results:
The pop-up blocker should block the pop-ups, a it's name says. =)

Reproducing the bug also works, when you open new window for each page instead of new tabs, a long a you choose "close other tabs".
I don't know if it also work with other confirmation dialogues.
