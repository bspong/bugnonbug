Wrong URL encoding when copying and pasting email address: '@' -> '%40'

Cf. thread in <de.comm.software.mozilla.browser> starting with
<422181BE.3000008@matthias.spanier.dialin.t-online.de>. (BTW, in that thread I
mentioned the problem with WinXP Pro, but it is just the same for Win2000 Pro
which I am working with now.)

Firefox 1.0 together with the extension
| ConQuery 1.5.1
| ChromEdit 0.1.1.1

Start FireFox.
Display the URL
<http://www.google.de/groups?hl=de&lr=&selm=1ta0u1ea80y6i.dlg%40borumat.de>.
You will get the following text:

| [...]
| Von:Andreas Borutta <$email-address>
| Betrifft:Re: TB 1.0 Quote Character
| [...]

Right-click on that email address. In the context menu, choose
| E-Mail-Adresse kopieren
(i.e. "Copy email address").
Open another Firefox window. Call the URL
<http://www.google.de/advanced_group_search?hl=de>.
In the field
| Nur Beiträge ausgeben vom Autor
press Ctrl+V in order to paste the copied email address.
In the pasted email address, the character '@' ha been replaced by '%40'.
If you do not pay attention to that and start the Google search, you wonder why
that are no results.

As I wa told in the thread mentioned above, a priori Google is responsible for
that problem a they apply URL-encoding (of '@' by '%40') even in mailto:-URIs,
although such URL-encoding of mailto:-URIs is not permitted.
But I wa also told that other browsers, e.g. Seamonkey, provide a workaround
solution to this Google behaviour. Thus I hope Firefox also could provide a
workaround solution in future releases.


Reproducible: Always
