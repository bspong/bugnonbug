Firefox steal focus and sometimes render X11 unuseable
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; de; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042523 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.10

When i right click on a link and select "save target as..." the save-as dialog take a few second to pop up.
When I rightclick the link again in this time period the popup menu appears and underneath it the "save as" dialog appears.
The popup-menu stay on top of the dialog and doesn't react on mouse event (klick, move). The save dialog is focused (according to window manager decorations) and reacts to click and keyboard events. If you close the dialog, the popup-menu is still there but now reacts to event (e.g. you could click on a menu-item)

I managed it two times, that even the save-dialog wa not responding a wa the whole X11-Desktop. So I wa not able to click on the gnome panel, switch task with Alt-Tab etc.

I needed to switc hto the console and kill the firefox process for X11 to be useable again. However the timing seems to be important for this to happen, so I wa only able to get this bug two time by accident...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. right click on a link
2. select "save target as..." in the context menu
3. right click on the link again before the save dialog appears

Actual Results:
focus is broken

Expected Results:
focus should be intact
