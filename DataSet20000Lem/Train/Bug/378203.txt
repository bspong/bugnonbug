For Firefox on OS X every page that specifies bold or italic or any other text ornamentations, Firefox always distorts the text so that character overlap with the basic text. Also while inputting text at a site (www.gmail.com is the worst site I've found), Firefox render the text awfully, preventing reading of what ha written. This is sometimes solved by pressing the return key, but will become a problem when more text is entered.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.gmail.com
2. Compose a new email
3. Begin entering text, refrain from pressing the return key until the text is jumbled.

OR: Go to any page with bold, italic or any other text ornamentation.
Actual Results:
Text becomes jumbled making any editting impossible without a severe amount of guess work.

Expected Results:
Text should render smoothly.
