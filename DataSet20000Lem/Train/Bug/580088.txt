Hello,
I apologise upfront for the lack of decisive information.

Something is wrong with Firefox 3.6.6. I have four different computer running XP and Windows 7, both at work and home (therefore build are completely unrelated) and have noted the same faults. Friends and colleague have noted the same fault and searching the internet it seems lot of other people have too. Even at the Firefox forum.

Basically, it crashes. A lot.

Of all the time it crashes, it is due to Flash video about 70% of the time. I have tried upgrading Flash, tried modifying settings, updating adobe, etc. I have reverted to a 3.5 branch and it is fine.

The other issue are:
1. Other random crash not Flash linked
2. 'well this is embarrassing' message appearing when simply switching between tab
3. Ridiculously slow startup, even compared to the previous revision

I and my friends/colleagues have had to either roll back a version or move onto another browser.

Please address this or you'll find a lot more people leaving.


Reproducible: Always
