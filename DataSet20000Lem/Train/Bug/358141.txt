User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

If Firefox 2.0 is launched by double-clicking a local HTML file, the location bar show an URL of the type "file://localhost/Users/...", but if Firefox is already running and you open a local file, it URL show a "file:///Users/..."

This bug screw up local file that use cookies. In the first case, the cooky are stored under "localhost" in the "Show Cookies" window. In the second case, the cooky are stored under an empty string.

This bug did not exist with Firefox 1.5.0.7. The file were always opened a "file:///Users/..." and their cooky were stored under an empty string.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure Firefox 2.0 is already running
2. Open "cookietest.html" from the attached testcase
3. ==> note how the URL show a "file:///Users/..."
4. Click on the "Click Me" button a few times.
5. Reload several time the window
6. ==> note how the counter are increasing
7. Quit Firefox 2.0
8. Double-click "cookietest.html" to open Firefox 2.0
9. ==> note how the counter came back to 0
10. While Firefox is still running, double-click "cookietest.html" again
11. ==> note how the counter have the good value again

Actual Results:
If you launch Firefox by double-clicking a local file, the URL show a "file://localhost/Users/..." and the cooky are stored under "localhost".

Expected Results:
The URL should show a "file:///Users/..." and the cooky should be stored under <empty string>, which is what happens if the file is opened when Firefox is already running.
