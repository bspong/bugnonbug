Restore with Yahoo Mail Classic - Disconnected from chat window not in same place
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I took a screen shot. Would like to enclose.

When doing a session restore with many yahoo mail Classic mail message open, the "You have been disconnected from Chat..." dialog which require a dismissal are all over the place and it drive me nut trying to find all of the window belonging to the flashing orange Firefox notification on the taskbar.

In particular, there may be two identical "you have been..." dialog open in Firefox; One may be in the upper left corner and one in the middle of the screen.

Then you dismiss all the one in the middle and the one in the corner and low and behold, you have to minimize all of the Firefox window to find the hidden dialogs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Have multiple email message open ( I typically have otification email from AskMeHelpDesk.com open and don't know if it matters).

Cause Firefox to save tab and restart Firefox which will activate restore session.
Actual Results:
Need to attach screenshot somehow.

Expected Results:
At the very least, all of the dialog should be centered. Not some hidden and some in the upper left hand corner.

I'd love for them to be dismissed
