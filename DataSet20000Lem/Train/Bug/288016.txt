Consider the following scenario.

You have a single web page that load in a CSS page; that set an ETag to flag
when it should be cached etc. Refresh this page, and all work a it should.
Perfect.

Now, take that page, and include an IFRAME inside it, that load another file,
but that file reference the same CSS page (or another one). The Etag will
presented to the browser (as demostrated by viewing LiveHttpHeaders) is never
returned to the server. Access that page directly outside of the iframe and
Firefox doe a it should.

Tried on InternetExplorer; IE obeys all etag communication perfectly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create web page; include a reference to a resource that ha an ETAG
2. Place an IFRAME inside that page
3. IFRAME reference another resource that ha a ETAG setup

Actual Results:
the inner page do not cache at all.

Expected Results:
the inner page should obey the HTTP header
