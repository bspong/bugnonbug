when using a shortcut key to start firefox, a new window won't open if one is already open
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.8

I put a shortcut to mozilla firefox on my "quickstart" menu, and I modified the
shortcut to have a "shortcut key", so that whenever I hit ctrl+shift+e, a new
browser pop open. Very convenient.
However, much of the time, if a firefox browser window is already open, hitting
th shortcut key fails to open a new browser. I have yet to figure out exactly
what the pattern is to make it fail to work.
I have noticed, however, then when it fails, the Alt+Tab menu will show a blank
(generic) icon with no name which doe nothing if you select it. This icon
stay in the alt+tab menu until a firefox window is selected.

It is rather inconvenient to always have to move the mouse an extra few inch
to hit the firefox button! I like the shortcut key better....



Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a shortcut to firefox and enable a shortcut key to it
2. open firefox with the shortcut key
3. try to open another firefox with the shortcut key


Actual Results:
sometimes a new window opens, most of the time doesn't. The pattern which make
it fail is at this point still unclear to me.

Expected Results:
a new window should always open
