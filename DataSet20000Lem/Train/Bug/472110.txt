I use Craigslist.org frequently. Up until about 3 day ago, I never had a problem like this: When I click on an item for sale with an accompanying photo, the photo doe not show-up. I tried several category and item (furniture, household, etc.). HOWEVER, if I open Craigslist.org in INTERNET EXPLORER, it run fine and photo show-up. Just to see if this wa a Nashville site problem, I tried other states/cities and the lack of photo occurs across the board in Firefox - not in Explorer. Thanks for any help with this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log onto http://nashville.craigslist.org/ - or, any craigslist.org city
2.Click on "furniture" (for example), on an item that is for sale and ha a photo (has "pic" indicated), click on that item
3.Item description with photo should appear - but, description ha been appearing without the photo. Try several - no photo ever load.
Actual Results:
See above - no photo show. Even when I try other craigslist.org city and categories.


Prior to approx. 3 day ago, photo always appeared when item description wa clicked on (if a photo wa included in the description). No problem if I use Internet Explorer.
