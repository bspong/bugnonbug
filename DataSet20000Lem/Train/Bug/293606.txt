In the nightly build of Firefox 1.1 downloaded on may 10th, 2005 - I turned on
the fast browsing feature by adding in about:config the integer named
'browser.sessionhistory.max_viewers' with the value set to 5. It worked like a
charm - but when I reopened Firefox, the toolbar and context menu's Back,
Forward, Refresh and Stop feature all became disabled. Their shortcut still work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a new and single instance of the nightly without the fast feature turned on
2.Go to about:config, on the context menu select new > integer
3.Enter browser.sessionhistory.max_viewers and click OK
4.Enter 5 and click OK
5.Fast browsing is supposed to work now (for example go to
http://feedhouse.mozillazine.org and thence to http://www.slashdot.org and then
go back)
6.Close the window
7.Open new window

Actual Results:
Now, the toolbars button and the context menu option are supposed to be disabled

Expected Results:
Not be disabled!
