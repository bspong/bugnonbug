Page with embedded pdf doe not load in Firefox, work in Chrome
Created attachment 669138
firefox_sos.png As you can see, the bottom of the screen is blank, though a slider appears greyed out, indicating that Firefox think it is displaying something embedded.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0.1
Build ID: 20120905151427

Steps to reproduce:

I navigated to the web page http://sos.nh.gov/Elections/Election_Information/2012_Elections/General_Election/Sample_Ballots_-_2012_General_Election.aspx

then selected the link for the town of Greenville, which took me to:

http://sos.nh.gov/Elections/Election_Information/2012_Elections/General_Election/Sample_Ballots_-_2012_General_Election.aspx?id=27013




Actual results:

In firefox, the embedded pdf at the bottom of the screen doe not appear (or is blank). In Chrome, it appears. I am running Firefox 15.0.1 on window XP sp3.


Expected results:

The pdf file should have appeared a it doe in Chrome. This is an urgent issue, because voter need to be able to find and download their sample ballot for November. Apparently this form only allows me to attach one file, but I have a png that show the pdf displaying correctly in Chrome, which I will try to attach later to a comment.
