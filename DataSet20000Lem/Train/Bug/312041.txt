"Auto-detect proxy settings" and the autodetected proxy becomes unavailable
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux ppc; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051002 Firefox/1.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux ppc; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051002 Firefox/1.0.7

Setting the automatic detection of Firefox, the browser try to resolve
wpad.domain.tld until it find a record pointing to a webserver hosting a
wpad.dat autoconfiguration script. This works.

The problem is with laptop users, who often change location, and then internet
access (e.g. from a WiFi net to another), sometimes not closing Firefox, just
suspending the machine.

When the laptop is woken and get access to another network, Firefox still hold
the parameter for the old network, and trying to access any website will result
in the "The proxy server you have configured cannot be found" message box.

When this happens _and_ in auto-detect proxy setting mode, Firefox should try
and re-detect the proxy setting (keeping in mind that this might not be the
same network, so the domain.tld might have changed) and, failing that, fallback
to the no-proxy configuration

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox in a network (say domain1.tld) with
http://wpad.domain1.tld/wpad.dat. Firefox then set it proxy setting according
to this script.
2. Suspend the machine without exiting Firefox
3. Plug the machine to another network (say domain2.tld)
Actual Results:
Trying and access any website with Firefox will result in "The proxy server you
have configured cannot be found"

Expected Results:
Firefox go through detection of the proxy parameter again:
1. resolve wpad.domain2.tld and, if it exists, get http://wpad.domain2.tld/wpad.dat
2. fall back to direct connection to the internet
3. display an error message _only_ if all of the above ha failed
