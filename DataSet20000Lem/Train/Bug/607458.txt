First time firefox open hang the navigation for a couple of minute after 1 or 2 minute of navigation
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; es-ES; rv:1.9.2.11) Gecko/20101012 Firefox/3.6.11 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The first time I open mozilla firefox after starting or rebooting the computer, it let me surf the net for a minute or two, but suddenly it freeze for several minute and you can't do anything. After that time it seems to be ok again, and you can surf the net normally. But it is not working properly. For instance, if you try watching a video (i.e. in youtube) it is a horrible experience. The image of the video freeze and jump every 3 or 4 seconds... But it you close mozilla firefox and open it again, everything work alright.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Reboot the computer
2.Open mozilla firefox first of all
3.Start navigating (for example open www.marca.com in one tab, connect your gmail account with gmail manager and open one of them in another tab...)
4.Mozilla firefox crashes.
5.Wait patiently for 5 minute or until it let you do anything.
6.Keep on navigating and try to watch a video (in www.marca.com you can find some or go to youtube.com)
7.See that it doesn't run continously.
8.Close mozilla firefox
9.Open it again and everything will be ok.


Actual Results:
It happened the thing I say in the step

Expected Results:
It shouldn't crash and freeze, and the video should be reproduced well

If I open mozilla and close it before "the freeze", "the freeze" will happen the second time.
I suspect that this is related with a) the antivirus or b) the graphic card.
a) When window starts, the antivirus (antivirus banda ancha of movistar, that i suspect that it is mcafee camouflated) always updates. So, the "only" software I know that is running is the antivirus and mozilla. Besides, if you wait for example 15 minute after starting windows, mozilla firefox doesn't usually crash. If you do it just when starting windows, this problem always happens.
b) I think this problem started more or le at the time I changed my graphic card. Now I use ATI Radeon 5670 (the driver are updated).
