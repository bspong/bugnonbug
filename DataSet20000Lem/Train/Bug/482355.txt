I subscribe to the "Coast to Coast AM" radio show web site streamlink service which allows me to download recorded previous broadcasts.

They have a link to a 'trouble shooting' page to assist those who are having difficulty downloading the mp3 file or stream link they(me) are entitled to a a result of my subscription....

...and one of the suggestion is to right click on the mp3 file listed that I want to download and choose the "Save target as..." option.

ie allows me to do this, firefox doe not. firefox is my browser of choice but every time I want to download a show, I have to use ie for this task.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.auto login to my account.
2.go to the archive page and choose the specific show that I'm interested in.
3.choose the 1st of 4 mp3 file downloads that is one fourth of the recorded broadcast by right clicking on it and choosing, "Save target as..."

Actual Results:
4.the closest thing that firefox ha to that is "Save link as..." and when you do, it present an html file to save whereas ie present an mp3 file to save.

Expected Results:
it supposed to present me with an mp3 file to save.

this 'problem' may not technically be a "bug"....but anything that force me to use ie bugz the hell out of me!
