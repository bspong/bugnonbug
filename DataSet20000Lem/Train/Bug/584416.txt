Firefox add dash to start and end of filename,e.g. when downloading a PDF file
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.20) Gecko/20081217 Firefox/2.0.0.20 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When you try to download or open an Acrobat file with a PDF extension from many websites, Firefox add a "-" character to the start and end of the filename. This result in a file extension suffix of "*.pdf_" which of course mean the file won't open unless you rename the file after downloading it.

(This bg occurs in FF3.5, and there's a similar problem in FF4 Beta which add underscore rather than dashes. I suspect this FF bug may be triggered by certain MIME types. This doe not occur in any other web browser.)

P.S. This Bugzilla website is very slow and page frequently time-out. I notice it us CGI. Please upgrade your bug reporting web app! I strongly reccomend ASP.NET MVC.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to an affected web page, e.g. any SkyDrive page where you can download a PDF file.
2. Click on the link to the PDF file.
3. Observe that Firefox add dash to the start and end of the filename, preventing the file from opening normally.
Actual Results:
Downloaded PDF file ha "-" at the start and end of the filename, and cannot be opened.

Expected Results:
Downloaded PDF file should have the correct file name!

This problem only occurs in Firefox. The problem doe not occur in any other browser I've tested, including the latest version of IE, Chrome, and Opera.
