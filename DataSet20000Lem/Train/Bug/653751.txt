Suggestion / Request for enhancement: about:l10n

In previous version of Firefox (up to branch 3.6) it wa possible to see the name of localizers (translators) by going to "Help" > "About Firefox" and click on the "Credits" button. After the long list of name of programmer and main staff, you could see the name of localizers (in all locale but en-US, obviously).

Since Firefox 4.0 the name of localizers (and programmer and main staff) have been removed. That's not only really weird, but kinda insulting, since localizing a product like Firefox requires A LOT of effort and time. By removing these persons' name is like Mozilla saying "we don't care about who the hell localized Firefox, so we removed these names. That's it".

So, my suggestion is a request for add an about: page. I wa thinking something a about:l10n or about:locale, where all the name be displayed.

Gee, Firefox is actually available in almost SEVENTY LANGUAGES, for Gecko's sake!! You can't remove around SEVEN HUNDRED NAMES all around the world just like that!!

Hope non-en-US Firefox user here at Bugzilla understand my request and support this, a I'm talking on behalf of every single localizer and every single QA leader.

IMHO, this is a very important issue and it can't (it shouldn't) be ignored any more.

Best regards,

Reproducible: Always
