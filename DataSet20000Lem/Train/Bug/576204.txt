using Firefox 3.6.6 on XP SP3 viewing email @ yahoo certain message have no content in the body, such a something from monster.com
this occurs with 99% of monster email (and some others) when opening the email in a new tab via the middle click.
But sometimes using the left click (opening in the same tab) sometimes work but then fails.
Clearing all history and cooky sometimes solves the problem, but when it doe it seems to be temporary.

Using IE all email viewing work properly.
This ha been occurring for a few month now.
Does anyone have similar result and possible solutions.
Thanx for participating,
rob
