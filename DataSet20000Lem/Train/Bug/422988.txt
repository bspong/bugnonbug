Strangeness related to session restore and new window

I think I ran across this problem just now using Firefox 3 Beta 4. I had to
install some software, requiring an OS restart, but hadn't got round to reading
all the tab I'd opened. So I changed my prefs to 'windows and tab from last
time', exited and restarted Windows.

When I started Firefox back up none of my tab reappeared. I didn't worry
about it overly at the time and just carried on working. A couple of hour
later I tried to open up the Computer Weekly digital edition from this page:

http://redigitaleditions.com/activemagazine/welcome/cwe/cwe080311.asp

Normal behaviour (in Firefox 2) is that this link spawn a new browser window
with a single tab. This time it spawned a new browser window with all my
window and tab from last time that hadn't appeared when starting the browser,
and then loaded the CW page on top of one of the existing tab in this new
window. I assume this is related to the window name in the window.open JS call
on the page above, but have no way of checking.

Similarly, I installed a new extension and selected restart. Firefox claimed it wa going to try and restore my window and tabs, it didn't. But I went to my delicious bookmark (the web page), opened one in a new window through right click to see if those tab would magically appear. They didn't, but I did get two tab in the new window, one of which wa a popup window which I'd been looking at about 5 hour earlier on online.sainsburysbank.co.uk ('contact u help' popup).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close the browser with 'remember my window and tab from last time' enabled or restart because of add-on installation.
2. Restart browser and observe that window and tab are not restored.
3. Open a new window by right click or by clicking on a javascript:window.open link, find tab you had open in your last session randomly appearing in the new windows.
