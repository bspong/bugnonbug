I received a notification from my Norton Anti-virus it had caught a Trojan and it wa deleted and to complete it I needed to restart windows. I did that and a new box ha appeared right below the bookmark toolbar. It look there is some sort of small symbol in the box and it appears the cursor can click on it however when you do nothing happens. I put the cursor over the unknown symbol and it showed me this at the bottom of the browser, chrome:11m3ffstbr/content/toolbarembed.html#
I have uninstalled every program that wa Mozilla, Windows Update 2 scan for any virus of anything and reinstalled from scratch. When I reinstall the browser is fine until the CPU is restarted and the Unknown box reappears under the toolbar. I do not know how to fix this. Is this something you are aware of and know how to get rid of it?
