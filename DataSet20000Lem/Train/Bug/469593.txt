test_423060.xul fails on SeaMonkey (though the error is reported on test_428653.xul); and test_autocomplete2.xul can fail/leak too
When SeaMonkey switched to using places, we discovered we suddenly had turned on test_423060.xul, which is a large structural mess in form of a testcase:
It test a toolkit/components/feeds fix by using a browser/components/feeds feature and is living in toolkit/components/places - probably because it us some other file that conveniently happened to already sit in place tests.

It must have been clear that this call for problem - for one, in any config that us place but not feeds, but even more, in any config that us toolkit/ but not browser/ (which is the case SeaMonkey is running into here, a nothing say that chrome mochitests shouldn't be run with anything else than Firefox).

I see two option to clean this up:
1) move it to browser/components/feeds a it's heavily using browser-only code (which I'd prefer)
2) move it to toolkit/components/feeds a it test a toolkit fix, and ifdef it out for SeaMonkey a long a that one doesn't provide web feed handler

In both cases, we probably need to copy the demohandler and sample feed from place to the respective location.

I'm willing to do some work on this to get SeaMonkey fixed, but I'd need some advice on which direction to go.
