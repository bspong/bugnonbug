Browser prevents page from loading if another page is still loading from the same site on a different tab/window

If a web page is taking a long time to download, Firefox will not let me view any other page from that same site until the first page ha finished loading. I am a webmaster, and I frequently process photo on a website--a process that can easily take 10 minute or more per batch. While the site process the photos, the web page load slowly, notating in text the progress on the photos, to prevent any timeouts from nonresponse from the server. While this is happening, I cannot load any other page from this same site on a tab or separate window until that page ha finished.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a site that ha a page that take a few minute to load (the html portion of the page should take a while to load--not talking about large images, etc).
2. While that page is loading, try to visit another page from the same site.
3. Any link that you click to visit another page will result in a browser hang until the first page ha finished. By the way, another browser (Camino for example) CAN communicate with the site while Firefox refuses, so it's definitely a browser specific issue.
Actual Results:
All communication with this site are a no-go until that long-loading page finish loading. Once that page finishes, any other link you've clicked suddenly come to life and those page will load properly.

Expected Results:
Links should just always work. Period. Why artificially slow the browsing experience just because a page is loading?
