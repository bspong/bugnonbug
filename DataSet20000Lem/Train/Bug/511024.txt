since the update, mozilla is doing strange things.

at time it is told, that there were open browser windows. which are not, or not visible for me, not even for task manager.

the next problem was, that i wanted to fill my bank account informations, which were allowed to popup all the time, but dunno open since the update. i wa not able to get to my account. i allowed pop up window in general. i also changed that new link should open in tabs, i cancelled this.

i can open one window of mozilla ... then only new tab

i dont know what else to do

would be grateful for help

p.s.

Actual Results:

i made a systemwiederherstellung for one week earlier, but the problem still is there.

Expected Results:
i want to use my mozilla like i did before. with several window and within them several tabs.

working the normal way like before

when double clicking on mozilla opening a new browser window.

or when pressing file ... then opening a new window ... that there will be a new browser window
