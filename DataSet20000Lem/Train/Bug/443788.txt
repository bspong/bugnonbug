On a Russian email-service site some source code of the page is seen in the created email, after the text ha been pasted from MS Word and the mail ha been sent or saved
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

I could spot this bug only with a page, which us Windows-1251 charset. The site is www.rambler.ru.

After sending or saving an email with Russian text, pasted from MS Word, and then opening it saved version, I get this at the beginning of the letter:

<!-- /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal {mso-style-parent:""; margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:"Times New Roman"; mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";} @page Section1 {size:612.0pt 792.0pt; margin:2.0cm 42.5pt 2.0cm 3.0cm; mso-header-margin:36.0pt; mso-footer-margin:36.0pt; mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 {page:Section1;} -->

After looking at the page's source, I noticed that symbol '<' and '>' are replaced with their code '&lt;' and '&gt;' there, so that the above fragment of code cease to be an HTML comment.

P.S. The same very page work fine in Opera and Seamonkey.
