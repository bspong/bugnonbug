In FF 2.0 there wa a visual hint when a new tab wa opened in the background - a flash on the 'right arrow' on the list of tabs. This wa very helpful in showing that indeed a new tab wa opened even if there were so many tab already open that the tab itself wasn't visible. Yet this is missing in FF 3.0.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open enough tab so that the list of tab is full.
2. Using middleclick, open a new tab in the background.
Actual Results:
There is no visual hint that in fact a new tab wa opened.

You may have missed and middleclicked only close to the link, and you wouldn't know it.

Expected Results:
A visual hint of some sort that a new tab wa opened. For example like FF 2.0 does, it 'blinks' the right arrow on the list of tab darker for a second.

My theory: Perhaps something to do with the change to using native GTK+ widgets?

If so, and if the FF 2.0 hinting is not feasible using GTK, then any other type of visual hint would be welcome. It doesn't matter what, so long a the user ha an idea that his/her click wa indeed registered.
