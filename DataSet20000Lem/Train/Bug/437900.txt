Build Identifier: Mac OS x 10.5.3 Leopard

Computer: Macbook Black OS X 10.5.3 running leopard.
First used 2nd June 2008. First used Mozilla Firefox 2nd June 2008 on this computer.

Problem started occuring on the 5th June 2008. When the computer lid is shut and it go into sleep, reopening the lid wake it up. The keyboard would stop working.
only the number and actual letter (1-0 & a-z) wouldnt work. space, return, command, cap all still worked.
The keyboard only froze in mozilla, not in adium, word, or safari.
uninstalled firefox and havent had a problem since.
I thought this wa a mac issue, and had searched the mac forum for an answer, but the upgrade for the keyboard are not the answer. As i said, having deleted firefox, I dont get the problem anymore.
I can recreate the issue by putting the computer to sleep and reopening the lid. it happens 2 out of 3 times, and started happening with more frequency until i delete firefox.

I should also note. the mouse STILL works.. which is wierd, because you can be browsing window for a while before you notice that the keyboard ha frozen. holding down different keys, doesnt help. the only way to get the keyboard back is to restart the computer.

the only other program i am acitvely running at the moment are adium, mac office, and itunes.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox
2. put mac to sleep by closing lid. wait a bit
3. open lid
4. try to type in mozilla

wa using the default mozilla theme. every thing on my computer is brand new, I havent really had a chance to customise it much.
