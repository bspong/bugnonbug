Background position for the error title in network error page (about:neterror) is wrong for RTL locale
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; Win64; x64; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0
Build ID: 20160407053945

Steps to reproduce:

Install Firefox 46.0b9 (ar) (Windows 64 version).
Start Firefox (arabic).
Open a new tab.
In the location bar, enter about:neterror followed by pressing <enter>.


Actual results:

The background image, a thick 'i' inside a thick circle, show to at the end (to the left) of the error title.


Expected results:

The background should appear at the margin before (to the right) of the title.

This is due to a change from Firefox 40 to Firefox 41. (I have not tested but probably all version have been affected since that!) The change wa in chrome://browser/skin/aboutNetError.css. The background image, then aboutNetError_info.svg*, wa moved from #errorTitleText to #errorTitle. However the rule that corrected it position wa left with the selector:
#errorTitleText:-moz-dir(rtl)
instead of changing it to:
#errorTitle:-moz-dir(rtl)
That is the needed correction.

This doe not affect about:certerror, but it may affect certificate error page in Firefox 48 because they no longer us a separate style sheet. I have not tested such case.

*The image is now chrome://global/skin/icons/info.svg
