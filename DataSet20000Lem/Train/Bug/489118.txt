When I try to print a document from my banking url, most of the print in the body fails to appear. Only the header & footer graphic show. This did not occur when using ie . Also, when I try to view video through MLS.net, I get a blank video feed screen.

Sinice I switched to Firefox, I cannot get the print page function to work on my banking web site. It leaf out all of the body text in the document.

Also, in my MLS.net web site, I cannot get video feed. I get a window firefox screen which is blank (black). At the bottom of the screen the word "done" appears.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I open the web page
2.I select a print page option (in banking web page)
3.I select "video highlights" in MLS.net
Actual Results:
I get no print on the banking page, except header and footer.
I get no video feed from the MLS.net page.

Expected Results:
I should have gotten a full page printout of my banking activity in my banking web page. I should get s video feed of game highlight in my MLS.net web page.

I tried looking in the tool menu, option sub category, under applications, but found nothing in there that ring a bell. I have not changed any option since I installed firefox.
