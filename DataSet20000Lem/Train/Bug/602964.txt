return to using non deterministic throbbers (remove progress line / bar implementation)

throbber sketch (excuse the bad artwork)

The UX team met to discus the progress line added in bug 544818 to all tab a part of the new theme. We agreed that while the design ha potential and fit the theme well, the problem that we're experiencing in the implementation have outweighed the potential benefits.

The main problem were:
- (design) different location for background and foreground tab
- (design) hard to notice / too small
- (design) removed important feedback about connection state
- (implementation) no way to truthfully relay overall progress
- (implementation) lack of immediate feedback
- (implementation) wrong color
- (implementation) 30% CPU performance hit

While we may choose to revisit the design in the future, we need a replacement design which meet the following goals, a decided by the UX team:

* need to have some feedback immediately after click
* need to always be animated (OSX/Win7 style, brightness change and pattern change)
* need to illustrate at least the difference between "seeking connection" and "loading" state

Some difference of opinion exists about whether or not a third state (establishing connection, which can take some time) should be represented.

Attached is a sketch of a throbber design that doe that. This bug is to track the removal of the progress line indicator code and replace it with the throbbers.
