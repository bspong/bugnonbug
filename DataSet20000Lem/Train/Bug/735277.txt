Steps to reproduce:

Hey guys, have just been having issue with Twitter & Tumblr not rendering text correctly.

Have tried the usual trouble shooting. When changing the page style to 'No Style' - the text displays. Manually disabling all addons and plugins doesn't fix the issue however when using Firefox in safemode, the text appears fine.
Changing the character encoding doe not alleviate the issue nor doe a new profile. Running window 7 x64 with all the latest Windows 7 update and the latest Firefox.

Chrome display twitter and tumblr fine a doe FF in safe mode. IE however ha the same issue.


Actual results:

Attempted to update to the latest AMD Catalyst 12.3 driver for my Radeon HD 5700. No luck in resolving the issue, however when hardware acceleration wa turned off, the text appeared to display correctly. I attempted the same procedure with the AMD 11.9 driver but the text didn't appear with hardware acceleration off.
