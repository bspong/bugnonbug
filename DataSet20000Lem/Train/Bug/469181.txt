I am running window xp on a dell 8250 with 512 mb ram. Have recently changed theme to astro and added fox clock and other available add-ons. This appears to have precipitated the current freeze-up then crash issue and appears incurable. Screen take 2 to 3 minute to clear of Firefox. Have re-installed and updated to latest version. Same problem. Upon attempting to change Fox Clocks options, immediate freeze-up and crash

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install new program on platform a described above, with that amount of ram
2. install all available add-on
3. attempting to change fox clock or use existing book mark creates freeze-up/crash every time ... sometimes immediately, but mostly with in 30 second of program start
Actual Results:
no solution discovered, due almost immediate freeze-up/crash

Expected Results:
same thing

haven't a clue, but want the issue solved a I really like Firefox
