Private data is cleared upon exit even though the "Always clear my private data when I close Firefox check-box is unchecked in tools, options, privacy, private data menu box. The item cleared are the one checked in the setting box. I have to uncheck the item in the setting box even though the "Always clear..." box is unchecked. Seems to me that it should ignore the setting box item when the "Always clear..." box is unchecked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use the default setting when installed or uncheck the "Always clear..." box and check some of the box in settings.
2. Browse craigslist and hit a few links.
3. Close firefox. reopen firefox and find that none of the previously visited link show red.
4. Uncheck the all the checkboxes in settings.
5. Browse craigslist and hit a few links. Close firefox.
6. Reopen firefox, visit craigslist and find the item that were visited are red.



It happened on the pre-version 3 beta too.
