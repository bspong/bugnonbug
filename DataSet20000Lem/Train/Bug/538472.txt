Browser window size persistence when restoring tab behaves badly with tiling window manager

When Firefox restores it tab state, either through re-opening the browser when the "restore my previous tabs" feature is enabled, or when disabling private browsing mode, Firefox attempt to restore the window to it original size.

Tiling window manager typically control window size, and will not allow the browser to resize itself in this manner. However, Firefox belief that it ha resized it window successfully and so behaves incorrectly.

For the record, on Debian's Firefox (Iceweasel) this is reproducible on both restoring tab using the "restore my previous tabs" feature, or by restoring tab on private mode. I can reproduce this for the mozilla.org 3.5.7 Firefox binary download only when restoring tab returning from private mode, but I believe this is the same bug.

This bug only seemed to appear in the 3.5 series Firefox. I don't believe I saw it before then.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
At least on the ratpoison or xmonad window managers.

1. Tile window in such a manner that Firefox take 1/4 of the screen area.
2. Switch to private browsing.
3. Tile window such that Firefox is fullscreen.
4. End private browsing.
Actual Results:
Firefox window remains fullscreen, but only the top-left 1/4 of the firefox window is actually functional.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have recognised that it window is still fullscreen and behaved appropriately.
