Implement FHR measure & feedback for developer tool usage
Telemetry is not going to provide u with an accurate picture of developer tool usage because it is off by default in release channel. Instead I'm proposing to introduce a minimal set of measure into FHR for developer tool usage to give u a more accurate picture of absolute user number and usage frequency.

Roughly what I want is the equivalent of our existing probe for the major tools, but collected by FHR:

DEVTOOLS_TOOLBOX_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS

DEVTOOLS_INSPECTOR_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_INSPECTOR_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS
DEVTOOLS_INSPECTOR_OPENED_BOOLEAN

DEVTOOLS_NETMONITOR_OPENED_BOOLEAN
DEVTOOLS_NETMONITOR_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_NETMONITOR_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS

DEVTOOLS_RESPONSIVE_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_RESPONSIVE_OPENED_BOOLEAN
DEVTOOLS_RESPONSIVE_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS

DEVTOOLS_STYLEEDITOR_OPENED_BOOLEAN
DEVTOOLS_STYLEEDITOR_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_STYLEEDITOR_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS

DEVTOOLS_JSDEBUGGER_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS
DEVTOOLS_JSDEBUGGER_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_JSDEBUGGER_OPENED_BOOLEAN

DEVTOOLS_WEBCONSOLE_OPENED_PER_USER_FLAG
DEVTOOLS_WEBCONSOLE_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS
DEVTOOLS_WEBCONSOLE_OPENED_BOOLEAN

We should probably only report the existence of this data. For the about:healthreport side of this, what seems to fit is this:

* if the toolbox or responsive design view ha never been opened, nothing should be shown to the user.
* if we do have data for the toolbox or responsive design view, we should show the user something similar to the 'This Month' section on the side with a 'Time open' number for total time open ( based on DEVTOOLS_TOOLBOX_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS ) a well a a 'Favourite Tool' item showing which tool the user ha spent the most time in ( the leader for the *_TIME_ACTIVE_SECONDS measure ).

Aside: I think it would be interesting to create an add-on that implemented about:webdevlopement or similar that provided the user with more in-depth detail on their usage a well a link to MDN resources.
