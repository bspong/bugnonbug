The 'Bookmarks Manager' would be better if there wa an extra panel at the
bottom which had editable field displaying the description of the bookmark.
This would be similar to Thunderbird - where you select the folder on the left
panel, the email on the right, and the email text is displayed at the bottom.
Instead you would select the bookmark folder on the left, the bookmark on the
right and the *editable* (for easy access) description would be displayed at the
bottom.
There could of course be an option for this in the 'View' menu to disable or
enable this extra bottom panel.

I am also adding three other feature request relevant to this one:
* When adding a bookmark an editable description field is displayed under the
name field, so the user can enter description data when adding a bookmark
* A bookmark description panel is shown at the bottom in the Bookmarks sidebar
* Bookmark description are searchable (at the moment the description is not
referenced by bookmark searches)

Reproducible: Always




Descriptions are not implemented well into any web browsers' bookmark system -
including Firefox. They are more of an extra thing tacked on that can be acessed
through menu that arent immediately apparent. In Firefox you have to click a
bookmark then edit it property to edit or even >>see<< the description.
As bookmark collection become larger description become more important to
finding relevant bookmarks. This functionality is sorely lacking at present.
I think the commercial bookmark manager "Compass"
(http://www.softgauge.com/compass/) is a good prototype to strive for a an
integrated bookmark manager. The Bookmark Manager already built into Firefox
would only have to be modified slightly to gain all of the main feature of
"Compass".
Firefox already ha several advantage over IE. I think that with a more
advanced bookmark system it would extend it lead even further.
