There's a problem in how Firefox 3 handle visited link on forum using the german PXMBoard software. After approximately three days, Firefox "forgets" all previously visited thread and reply and color them a unread. Only threads/replies visited within the last approx. 72 hour stay colored a visited. This didn't happen in FF2 and ha been reported by lot of user browsing those forum using FF3. As far a I'm aware, this only seems to happen on board using that specific forum software. No guarantee on that, though.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Browse any of these site

They're all using the same software.

1. Visit any thread(s) and reply/ies, they will instantly be colored a visited.
2. Wait for approx. three days.
3. Visited link will be colored a not visited.
Actual Results:
Visited color forgotten after approx. three days.

Expected Results:
Read link should still be colored a visited.
