Steps to reproduce:

i did not reproduce it, but here are my steps.
at the end of november, i had everything up to date when this starts: upgrade window 7 to window 10.
already have firefox and fraps before the upgrade.
after upgrade, have firefox and fraps open.
go to options>privacy>History>click on Clear Recent History, find that the black frame with yellow numeral is bound to the top right corner of the tiny clear history window.
press hotkey to record and find that it change the font red.


Actual results:

the Fraps fps overlay that ha been missing elsewhere a i've been trying to use it this week, ha mysteriously shown up inside a strange frame in firefox.


Expected results:

the fps overlay should be bound to anchor of fullscreen game or the desktop.

I'm new to bug and reporting. i see the intersection of program where they shouldn't be a suspicious though. like firefox and fraps having a fistula through the middle of their programs, i consider to be a malicious threat.
I'll repost this bug in a couple day without the security flag, unless otherwise advised
