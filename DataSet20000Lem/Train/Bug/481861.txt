By using a control at the top of the print preview page you are no longer able to use the pgup/pgdn/up/dn/home/end keyboard key to pan through the previewed document.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any page, click print | preview. NOTE: You can use the pgup/pgdn/up/dn/home/end arrow key to pan through the document.

2. Adjust a parameter to the top such a page number or percentage scale.


Actual Results:
While you can use the mouse to scroll the document, you can no longer use the arrow key the way you did a moment ago.

Expected Results:
The control at the top of the screen (speaking a a win32 developer) should not get focus after using it. The main form should maintain the focus continously. Except of course when you key in a page number, but then after hitting <enter> it should lose focus.

I see that if I tab, tab, tab my way through the controls, I eventually get control on the main form. But this is kinda inconvenient.

So maybe we should not have tab stop on those control a well (speaking a a win32 developer).

Thanks guy - and good job.
