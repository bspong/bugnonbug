Email link don't work. I use yahoo email and when I click a link on a website, it give me an error rather than opening a yahoo email window. I tried searching and tried what wa suggested in the forums, nothing ha worked.

Also certain video give me a window medium plugin error. Does not occur when I use IE. WMP is up to date. All plugins up to date.

Both work with IE but not with Mozilla on 3 different computer I have tried it on (at different address and ISP's).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click any HTML email link
2. Try to view any CNN.com video.
3.
Actual Results:
1) Error message saying "Error loading C:\PROGRA~1`\Yahoo!\Common\YMMAPI~1.DLL. The specific module could not be found."

2) Error message : "Plugin Warning. The CNN.com video experience is optimized for Windows Media Player 9 and above. No Windows Media PLayer detected."

Expected Results:
1) New HTML window should open with my Yahoo email login. Does work with IE.

2) Video should load and run. Works with IE. Video error also occurs on MTV.com, a well a other site where WMP need to launch.

Bug occurs with all theme including default theme. I only have Mozilla Firefox installed.
