.ini's need to be divorced

Searched and surprised that I couldn't find a bug on this:

If using 2 or more version of FF (say 2 & 3) each with it's own profile, whichever version is started it will use the previously used profile unless StartWithLastProfile=1 is changed to =0.

If last used, say, FF3, and .ini is left at "1", and then open FF2 profile from FF2 profile mgr on the Start Menu it will do so -- run FF2 with FF2 profile.

However, if close FF2 and attempt to open FF3 it will open, but with FF2 profile. If open FF2 with FF3 profile, then close it, then open FF3 it will open with it's profile.

The alternative is to 1st change the .ini from 1 to 0, open 3, then change the .ini back to 1.

Either method is confusing and laborious. Hope I am sufficiently clear with this summary.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. As stated above.

Actual Results:
As stated above.

Expected Results:
Expect to open FF2 with it's own profile and FF3 with it's own profile -- either running at the same time or not.

If there could be 2 or more .ini's, one for each profile, this should not be encountered. As it is it certainly precludes me from testing nightlies or betas.
