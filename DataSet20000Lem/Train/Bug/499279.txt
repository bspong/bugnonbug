I'm creating a system under .NET Framework last version but the problem is old. I have a simple form with some field and table but have a large viewstate information. In each postback like save form operation, I display the status of the operation using alert method of the window. After some postbacks the page stop of rendering the content in a random way. If I comment the alert line the problem doe not happen any more.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using ASP.NET, create a webform that generate a large viewstate data. In my case the file ha 350kb and 90% is viewstate data.
2. After the postback use the window.alert method to display any thing after the body tag.
3. After some postbacks the problem happen.
Actual Results:
The page is not rendered. It stop after the body tag.


Viewstate is information stored in a hidden field that is used by framework to persist the previous state of the page.
