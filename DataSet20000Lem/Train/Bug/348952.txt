Since the most recent win32 official build (1.5.0.6) some link appear in the "visited" colour when I haven't actually visited them yet, I've been encountering this for a week or so and I wanted to make sure I wasn't mistaken before I submitted it. Now I'm sure - a I just visited reddit.com and link submitted within the last few minute are marked a visited despite the fact I've been out for 4 hours.

I've downloaded the most recent nightly and the same thing occurs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit a site with a lot of links, e.g. reddit.com, preferably one that you have clicked a few link on first (this seems to matter tho I haven't convinced myself yet)
2. look at the text colour of the link

Actual Results:
some of the link you haven't yet visited (e.g. on reddit, post within the last few minutes) are displayed in the "visited link" colour. these page don't appear in the browser history or in the cache.

Expected Results:
only the link i actually have visited are marked a visited.

this seems to be very recently introduced, most probably with 1.5.0.6.
