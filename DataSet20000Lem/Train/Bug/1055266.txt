Console log toggle are incomprehensible without label

When the devtools are narrow, the console log toggle (Net, CSS, JS, Security, Logging) switch to a more compact design: from “small color dot + label + dropdown triangle” to “big color dot + dropdown triangle”. This design ha many issues:

- It’s arcane information. Users will have to have remembered the order of button or the color of the dot to know what they’re clicking on. From a usability perspective (ease and *speed* of use), that’s very costly and error-prone.
- It’s not accessible. Information coded with color only may be lost to user with color blindness. (I’m not colorblind myself, but I tried Color Oracle’s simulation for Deuteranopia and Protanopia, the most common form of color blindness, and they’re not encouraging.)
- Less importantly, when button are not differentiated by different background colors, the triangle that trigger the dropdowns are shown squarely between two dot and it’s hard to tell to which “dot” it belongs.

I suggest a different design:

1. Use short labels. Most label are short already but there would need to be a 2-to-4 letter short label for each button in addition to the normal label.
2. Drop the color dots. Optionally, use a different reminder of the color code, such a an underline.
3. On hover, use different style when hovering the left part (label) or the right part (dropdown) of the button.

I’m attaching a mock-up showing that.

I suspect the main challenge here would be internationalization for #1.
