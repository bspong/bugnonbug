Similar to Bug ID #317195, this bug block entry field from accepting any keyboard input. Also any quick keys/short cut (e.g. command T, command N) will more than likely not work.

If a new window (sometime a new tab, never a page refresh) is selected from the file menu it will then allow keyboard input in entry field and quick keys/shortcuts are again operable.

Reproducible: This only happens when I leave the site open, go work in another application, then come back to the site after a few minutes. It first started to happen after updating to Fx 1.5.0.2. Currently happening under Fx 1.5.0.3 a well.

Most of this happens when accessing my email via Yahoo but it happens to all site with entry form fields.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a site (e.g. mail.yahoo.com) that ha entry fields. Enter info.
2. Leave site open and go work in another application for a while.
3. Return to the website open in Fx and try to enter text in entry fields.

Actual Results:
Entry field will not accept keyboard input or quick keys/short cuts.

Expected Results:
Should be able to enter text in entry fields.
