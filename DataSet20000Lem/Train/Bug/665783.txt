With Ff 4.0.1 I could not get any message out though some site said 'thank for your comments' thus can not be sure when problem arose, but soon after download Ff4. Upon recognizing problem I tried all suggested troubleshooting, empty cache, disable add-on plug ins, etc. eventually slowly removed same hoping to find the culprit. Safari worked fine, so contacted community with no results. Went back in Time Machine to bringforth Ff 3.6.17 which ha resolved my problem, but not yours. Sorry I can not suggest how to reproduce problem, only that there wa no outgoing to any web site, though some did know of contact and replied with 'Thanks'. Hope Ff 5. is trouble free though don't believe I will will again risk loss of history, cache, plug ins, add-on again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try by opening tvguide.com and selecting a new time zone listing.
2. Enter name and password to get into any site.
3. Send question/comments to any site offering such.

Actual Results:
When clicking 'enter' or 'send' my screen would behave a if message wa sent, sometimes with 'thanks', or some with a new screen which did not reflect the change requested

Responded to the action requested.

The trouble wa manifested in all tries. Cause elusive. Problem confined to Firefox 4.0
