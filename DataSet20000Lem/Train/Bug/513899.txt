I have printer presets on my Mac. When I select them all the setting appear to change just fine except the Quality & Media setting (fast, normal, best). The particular control is a slider on the Mac and when I click the slider it look like it is activated, but I cannot actually slide it. The value of the setting is always right in the middle, 50%, normal print quality I think.

So the controller doesn't work AND that control is not initialized with the proper setting for each preset. It's just this one slider, other slider in the print dialog work fine. This ha also been a problem for a while, with previous version of Firefox, but I cannot be sure how long this ha been going on.

The same print dialog work fine in Safari.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. print a page from firefox
2. load a preset (or just use the default one)
3. try to adjust the quality setting (under detailed setting for this particular driver)
Actual Results:
The preset doe not load the quality setting properly and it's not possible to adjust it either.



I have no idea if this is specific to my printer driver (Canon MP600R) or what. It's just the one control/setting in this print dialog. I don't have any other printer installed on my machine that I can test this theory with.

The one thing I realized about this setting is, The slider to adjust the quality doe not display unless you first click on another check box which basically enables "detailed settings". So the slider appears after you click 'detailed settings' and the value of the slider/setting is always right in the middle.

I don't know who else to ask which is why I am filing a bug. As I said, The same dialog work fine in Safari and all my other apps.

This problem also existed on Leopard. I just upgraded to Snow Leopard and am experiencing exactly the same issue.
