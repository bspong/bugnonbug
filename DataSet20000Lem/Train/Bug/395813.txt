Weird behavior with add bookmark dialog (long dialog with extra fields/delete and done button don't work/title not filled out)
Sorry about the title but too much going on to sum it up in a summary.

Happened to me a few time today with different builds, oldest 090704 and newest 09110? build. Steps that I did:

1) Clicked once on the white star and the add bookmark dialog came up (first sign of this whole bug report)
2) There wa no title filled out and the location and description field were shown which usually aren't (bug 394104)
3) I hit delete to not save the bookmark
4) nadda happens, i click on the page to make that dialog lose focus and close
5) I look in the error console and have the below error
6) click the yellow star and delete the "bookmark"
7) try to reproduce my step after restarting firefox and I can't reproduce

(the dialog opening)
Error: gEditItemOverlay is not defined
Source File: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 5070

(clicking delete)
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE) [nsINavBookmarksService.getItemTitle]" nsresult: "0x80070057 (NS_ERROR_ILLEGAL_VALUE)" location: "JS frame :: chrome://browser/content/places/editBookmarkOverlay.js :: EIO__getItemStaticTitle :: line 246" data: no]

(I guess making the dialog lose focus)
Error: this._folderTree ha no property
Source File: chrome://browser/content/places/editBookmarkOverlay.js
Line: 345

I have reproduced this a few time today but it happened at random time and seems to only happen once per build or at least once per session
