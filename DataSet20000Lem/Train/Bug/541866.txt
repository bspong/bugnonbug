Most (but not all) image do not display in Facebook. Why some but not others?

I have seen some posting of image not working in Facebook but not the problem I have had for several months. When I access Facebook, most image do not appear but some do and the arbitrariness of it is baffling. For example, 3 of my 13 profile photo appear on the thumbnail page. A slightly higher number will display in their full form if I select one and then scroll through the photo (but still not ALL of them - very odd). The same thing happens with my photo albums. Also, if I embed a photo into a message to a Facebook friend it uploads but won't display on my screen. For these reason I have had to use Opera to use Facebook now for months, although FF remains my default browser.

I did not report this for a long time because I haven't found anyone else with the problem.
