Steps to reproduce:

I'm trying to add class to element with jquery with clicking the button.
Clicking the button should add class to first div without class.


Actual results:

First click on my button do nothing in inspector (should show added class to first div)
Second click show added class to first and second div (what is ok)

So it look like inpector "reaction" is not live.
Of course when I reopen inspector all class are ok immediately.

Now I only report this problem with adding class. Other DOM manipulation are shown in inspector immediately.

So my example code is
$('someButton').on('click', function(){
$('div:not(.myClass):first').addClass('myClass');
}

structure of divs is
<div id="wrapper">
<div>lorem</div>
<div>ipsum</div>
<div>dolor</div>
</div>

after first click in inspector structure look like
<div id="wrapper">
<div>lorem</div>
<div>ipsum</div>
<div>dolor</div>
</div>

after second click
<div id="wrapper">
<div class="myClass">lorem</div>
<div class="myClass">ipsum</div>
<div>dolor</div>
</div>
