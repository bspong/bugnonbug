If i plug the laptop into my lcd tv via VGA, using the tv remote will cause a new firefox window to open,not immediately though. Firefox will then open a new window randomly even if the remote is not being used & the laptop is unplugged from the tv. My laptop doe not have an infrared port. I have reinstalled firefox and the problem persists.

It happened once before and plagued me for week a I tried everything to stop it, I didn't realise how it started. It then randomly stopped happening. I plugged my laptop into my tv to watch a program and it ha started all over again....and no I haven't been onto some dodgy websites. I ran anti spyware, malware program to no avail.
