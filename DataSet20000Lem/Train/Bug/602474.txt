URLs selected in a content management pop-up editor window are not returned to the main editor window
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.8) Gecko/20100722 Firefox/3.6.8 GTB7.1 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0C)

Since the update to 3.6.9 any URLs selected in a Joomla 1.0.15 content management system pop-up editor window are no longer returned to the main editor window, instead the URL returned is BLANK.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. using Joomla 1.0.15 - edit any content article
2. click on the editor button to either the Insert/Edit Image or Insert/Edit File
3. a pop-window is displayed allowing the selection of existing images/files stored on the server
4. select a file and the pop-up is closed and a link to the selected URL (file or image) should be created within the editor
Actual Results:
since the update to 3.6.9 the link is created with a BLANK URL. This problem also exists in 4.0b6

Expected Results:
The link should be created to the selected URL, which wa the case in 3.6.8 and all earlier release of Firefox (and work fine in Google Chrome, Safari, Opera and IE8)

To allow me to use my preferred browser (FF) I have been forced to reinstall 3.6.8
