First of all I didn't have this problem in FireFox 3.0.

It happens everytime I open a dropdown menu in a form on a page, I mean the <SELECT> html element, before I open the menu everything's fine, I scroll up and down and CPU Usage is normal, after I open a drop down menu no matter if I change it, keep it open or I close it instantly FireFox will have a hard time scrolling up and down in that page. It almost max out my CPU Usage when I scroll up or down. There's no extreme CPU usage if I don't scroll up and down and everything will be back to normal if I reload the page, but the story repeat itself again if I open a dropdown menu.

P.S: I've upgraded to FireFox 3.5.1 today and the problem still remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.View a page that ha one or more dropdown menu (SELECT HTML ELEMENT)
2.Open one of drop down menu no matter if I change, close or keep it open
3.FireFox will have a hard time scrolling up and down in that page.
Actual Results:
Scrolling up and down in the page that I have opened a drop down menu on it max out my CPU usage.

Expected Results:
I expected no performance drop after I open a Dropdown (SELECT HTML ELEMENT) on a page of course!

I am using FireFox 3.5.1 (same problem wa in FireFox 3.5), I am using the Default theme, I have "Web Developer", "FireBug" and "FirePHP" add-on installed. And I am using firefox on primary display on a Dual-Display mac machine (I donno if it can be important).
