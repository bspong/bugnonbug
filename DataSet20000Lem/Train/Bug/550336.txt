Throwing out a hung script in one FF window loses all others.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
I have an infinite loop or similar in some javascript which I need to debug. If I try and do it in FF, when the script hang and the CPU max out, I can't close the tab, so instead I have to throw out FF with Task Manager, thus losing all the other tab I wa using.

Perhaps that is only to be expected, but ...

If I put the script in a second FF window all on it own, and I can't close it, when I throw it out with Task Manager, I also lose the original window with all my work.

Different FF window should not share codespace or other memory. They should be entirely seperate processes.

Actual Results:
All FF window are lost

Expected Results:
Only the errant window should be lost (preferably only the errant tab).

I can't debug this Opera or IE, because the problem is related to asynchronous script loading, and they behave differently (and work).
