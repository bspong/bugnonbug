When you are already at root directory and you press on link "parent directory":

- the first time FF sendscommand "CWD /../", the server sends "501 Command failed. Current directory is a root".

- the second time it sends nothing to the server, but it change the url bar to /../

- the third time it sends "CWD /../../" , the server sends "501 Command failed. Current directory is a root".

- the third time it sends nothing to the server, but it change url to /../../

And so on ...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Connect to a server that answer "501 Command failed. Current directory is a root" when the client sends CWD /../ when already at root.

2. click various time on "parent directory"




A dirreferent, but still wrong, result is obtained with server ftp.edisontel.it.
By cliking on "parent dir" there are not error messages, but "/../" is added to the url bar each time you press on "parent directory".
