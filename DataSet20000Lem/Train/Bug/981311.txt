GIGAPICA problem on geenstijl.nl with ABP enabled.jpg

Steps to reproduce:

Install Adblock Plus and enable it. I use EasyList Dutch + Easylist filters. Open http://www.geenstijl.nl/ (Warning: (lightly) NSFW content might be present on this site). Scroll down to the section where it say GIGAPICA.


Actual results:

The set of picture displayed horizontally is displayed on top of the text GIGAPICA instead of below it, and cover the text of the article above it. Below the text GIGAPICA there is empty space, this is where the set of picture should be displayed.


Expected results:

The set of picture displayed horizontally should be displayed below the text GIGAPICA.

The site is rendered fine with Adblock Plus disabled. I have reported this issue to ABP (https://reports.adblockplus.org/5d9a7deb-e0cb-4fbd-8ad5-a8e6ced7e7d2#tab=requests) but they say that the issue is not due to ABP.

The exact same problem is present in Google Chrome 33 with ABP enabled. In Google Chrome the problem also disappears when ABP is disabled.

I have attached a picture (SFW) which highlight the problem.
