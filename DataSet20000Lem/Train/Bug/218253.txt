I have a fairly extensive "Imported IE Favorites" with 30+ group with multiple
group being 3-4 level deep.

When I select Add Bookmarks ..., (ctrl-D), Right-Click->Bookmark This Page, the
application stop responding long enough for me to think that it's hung (I've
restarted Firebird a couple of time before I decided to wait it out and see if
it ever came back).

Eventually, it come back (approx 60 seconds) and let me select the boookmark
group - apparently it wa filling the drop down box. Even with my imported
favorite list, it seems like an awful long time to sort through a hundred or so
entries.

That's problem number 1.

Problem number 2 is if I do it again immediately, it again hang for 60 seconds.
Seems like this is a prime candidate for caching the drop down list.

1. Just press ctrl-D
2.
3.

Actual Results:
