I cannot get the AUTO UPGRADE to stop downloading the next version of Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100701 Firefox/3.5.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.11) Gecko/20100701 Firefox/3.5.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I do not want the Firefox 3.5.13 to download because it is not compatible with another app tool I need access to. This morning the Firefox browser downloaded and installed 3.5.13, so I had to uninstall and reinstall 3.5.11.

Now, I have logged back into Firefox, and under the Help, I see it is trying to download Firefox 3.5.13 AGAIN! So I learned about Tools > Options > Advanced and I changed the setting to never look for auto update (still did not stop). I have rebooted my PC, and I still cannot get this browser to stop trying to connect to the Firefox download...I am now behind in my project because this download will not cease!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Do not block the Firefox auto update
2.Use Firefox
3.Download is stuck because I tried to deinstall 3.5.13
Actual Results:
Read above

Expected Results:
Read above

Since I changed the Options to not allow downloads and rebooted my PC, I would expect the browser to stop automatically trying to connect to your server to download the tool!!!
