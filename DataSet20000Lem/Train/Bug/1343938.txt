Firefox doesn't prompt to become default browser (for first profile created after installing)
Latest 54.0a1 to 51.0b1, likely also before. Windows 8.1 64-bit

The first profile created after installing Firefox doesn't prompt for setting it a the default browser.

Steps to reproduce (Nightly and Developer Edition will prompt on second launch, browser on first, release likely similar, but I haven't tested):
1. Installed Nightly into the old custom install directory (but any custom install directory should work).
2. Launched it from the console with firefox.exe -no-remote -P
3. Create a new profile.
4. Launch the profile.
5. Close the profile.
6. Launch the profile.
7. Close the profile.
Actual result: Not prompted to set it a default browser.
8. Launched it from the console with firefox.exe -no-remote -P
9. Create a new profile.
10. Launch the profile.
6. Launch the profile.
7. Close the profile.
Actual & Expected result: Prompted to set it a default browser.

The first profile which won't show the prompt ha browser.shell.checkDefaultBrowser automatically set to the custom value false.

This get set at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e91de6fb2b3dce9c932428265b0fdb630ea470d7/browser/components/shell/ShellService.jsm#52-74 because DefaultBrowserOptOut in the registry is True and get deleted, so it won't get set for profile created later.

The code for setting the registry key is at https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/e91de6fb2b3dce9c932428265b0fdb630ea470d7/browser/installer/windows/nsis/installer.nsi#1025
