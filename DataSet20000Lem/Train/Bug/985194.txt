With IDM CC extension installed, Firefox consumes excessive RAM while watching streaming video and doe not release it on video completion
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

Windows 7 Sp1, 32 bit

When you are watching any online video, either through Amazon Prime using Silverlight or through Youtube using Adobe Flash, and have the video streaming for a long time, 1hr 30min or more, you will find that Firefox ha taken a huge chunk of your RAM and Firefox doe not release it on the completion of the video. You have to exit Firefox to recover this RAM.

This problem can be seen in real time, if you have the video playing in Firefox in the background and you are monitoring Firefox RAM consumption in the task manager, you will see the RAM consumption going up by about 2 mb per second.

You can speed up this process by using the skip back and skip forward button to skip the playing video stream forward or backwards. You can use your mouse to seek forward and backward on a video stream too to replicate this effect. So, for example, on Amazon Prime, while the video is streaming, you let it stream for 1 minute and then hit skip forward, then let it stream for 1 minute and hit skip forward, and so on. Once in a while after letting it stream for a minute hit skip backward. If you do this over 10-15 time and the video ha been streaming for about 1 hr, you then look at the RAM Firefox is consuming, it will be around 1.2 GB i.e 1200 mb or more.

You can see this effect in real time a well, have the minimized window of task manager running while you follow the above defined procedure of streaming and skipping forward, you can see FireFox's memory consumption jumping by about 40-50 mb per skip.




Actual results:

On my system, I have only 3 GB of RAM, and when Firefox touch 1 GB of RAM, my whole system slows down and when it touch 1.5 GB and above, Firefox then crash and you have to restart it again. Very inconvenient when you are in the middle of a movie.

When the streaming video is over, Firefox doe not release the RAM back, even if you close the tab that wa streaming the video. The only way to get the RAM back is to restart the browser.

This bug ha nothing to do with addons and extensions, I have checked with all of them disabled.

This bug ha nothing to do with the plugins Silverlight or Flash, a the RAM is being consumed by Firefox process, not the plugin container. The plugin container RAM consumption only go up by about a 100-150 mb on average during the entire procedure described above.

This bug ha nothing to do with the number of tab open at the time, whether it is one or two or more tab the result is the same.

I have been observing this bug in Firefox for more than a year now, I do not remember which version Firefox wa on when I first noticed it.

Streaming HD content or SD content ha nothing to do with this bug. It happens with both

I have not changed any advanced option in Firefox, my Firefox is running on default options.



Expected results:

What should have happened is that a soon a the streaming video wa done i.e finished, Firefox should have released the extra RAM it had consumed during the streaming process, so that if the user want to watch another streaming video back-to-back, their browser will not crash due to excessive RAM usage.

I have confirmed this proper behavior using Internet Explorer 11, when a video stream on IE is done, the browser immediately release the RAM it had consumed during the process and during the time when the video is streaming, IE RAM consumption doe go up, but not by the same amount a Firefox, so after streaming 1 hr of video on IE using skip button multiple times, the browser only go a high ha 500-600 mb, not more. This RAM is released a soon a the video streaming is done, even with the tab that wa playing the stream still open.

Since Online streaming is such a big deal nowadays, it would be better for Firefox to handle this streaming properly otherwise it will lag the competition.
