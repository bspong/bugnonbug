I have used minefield for a couple of months.
It hang often but I understood that such version can.
Because of some reason I needed more stable version. And here is the problem.
I have minefield, GranParadiso and Firefox 3 beta3 on one PC.
1. As I mentioned above I have recently used minefield - it hang every 5 minute while I tried to follow a link on the page.(open in new tab)
2. I have uninstalled minefield and start using GranParadiso - same effect
3. I have uninstalled GranParadiso and start using Firefox 3 beta 3 - same effect

Conclusion it hang on random site every a few minute independently on the version I am using.

How it crash: Open a page (google and follow some link) and then try to follow another link. it crash about every 10-20 jumps. Program restarts and then ask if I want to start with previous pages. Answer is always Yes. Then I try to follow this problematic link again and again open the pave in a new tab. Program crash again! I can repeat it a few times. Sometime it help If I do not watch the tab with the problem (jump and quickly switch to another one), after loading part of the page I can view the page without problems.

If you need any help or additional description doe not hesitate ask. brainiax@wp.pl
