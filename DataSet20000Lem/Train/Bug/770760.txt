MiddleClick on an <a Onclick="Alert(... ></a> creates true http request instead of alerting on new tab

Steps to reproduce:

I middle-clicked on a URL whose underlying code wa this:

<a onclick="alert('Attn: --text here')" href="javascript:void(0)">
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> --more text here-- </font>
</a>




Actual results:

[I have middle click set to push the link to a new tab]

I get a website server error:
Error 404--Not Found
From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1:
10.4.5 404 Not Found

The server ha not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent.

If the server doe not wish to make this information available to the client, the status code 403 (Forbidden) can be used instead. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and ha no forwarding address.

From which I assume some context of the URL is sent the domain serving the original web page [in this case, FedEx.Com]


Expected results:

I suppose the alert should have shown up within the construct of the new-tab
