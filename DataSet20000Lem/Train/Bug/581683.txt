After update, firefox 3.6.x will start exactly one more time and then quit working

I am currently using Mozilla Firefox 3.5.11
I made several attempt to update to the "latest and greatest" Firefox 3.6.x, (the first time, I think, with 3.6.1, latest attempt with 3.6.8), all with the same result: The update work without any visible problem, after the update, Firefox 3.6 start for the first time and seems to work fine. Unfortunately, this is just a 1-session-stand, after exiting the program, any further attempt to start it again will silently fail.

I made some attempts, but could not figure out, what actually go wrong but couldn't find anything; I get a warning about libglide.so having the wrong ELF class (which every 32-bit GTK application on my system triggers; at least it shows, that Firefox is "starting to start" ;), then Firefox seemingly just exit again (no further warnings, error messages, no segfault, no runway process ..)

When I revert to the previous version, Firefox will start a usual. (funnily, after running Firefox 3.5, I can again start Firefox 3.6 for exactly 1 time).

Updates to a newer version of Firefox 3.5 always worked without any problem.

When I remove the profile and start with just the default setup, Firefox 3.6 also will start.



Reproducible: Always




The system is Debian 5.0 64-bit.
