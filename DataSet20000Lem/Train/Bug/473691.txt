What should be displayed a a web page menu with displayed drop-down menu (upon mouse pointing the title) is overlayed over the web page content which is then unaccessible [link clicking or text copy/paste are un-accessible].

Actual Results:
Since yesterday (and not before) the menu "Front Page > Tools & Research > Market Overview >" is not displayed on the top of the page a it should but look undecoded properly and vertically overlayed on the page content which link are then un-accessible i.e. impossible to click on Show Screening Criteria from web page 1 above. Or I cannot copy / paste the data displayed on either web page ...

Expected Results:
I use also Google Chrome & Internet Explorer 7 which all continue to display properly these 2 pages.

The Menu should have been decoded properly with only the title displayed "Front Page > Tools & Research > Market Overview >" when pointing the mouse over these word a drop down menu should be displayed for each of these 3 entries.
Mozilla FireFox browser wa the fastest to display these data page ... However this bug is hampering proper data retrieval since yesterday.
