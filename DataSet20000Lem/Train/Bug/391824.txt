Problems with anchor element and image element if the class name of anchor is the same name a id name of the image element
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; sl; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

When I try to use the same class name on the anchor element a the name of the id
on the image element the anchor try to jump on that image element even though
that image is not nested in that anchor element.
I don't know if that is normal behavior or not because I tried to reproduce that
problem on IE explorer and the bug didn't occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Apply an anchor element on the page and assign the class name on the anchor element.
2.Nest some image element under that anchor.
3.Now apply another image element on the document, but do not nest it under that
anchor or any other anchor, and give it the same id name a the class name of that anchor element.

Actual Results:
You will probably see a small link line on the document which mean that the anchor element is trying to jump on that image element, or you will even see
the anchor element applied to that image element a well a on the nested image.

Expected Results:
I expected that the anchor element would only apply on the nested image of the anchor , and not trying to jump on another image which isn't nested in the anchor
element, even though it ha the same id name a the class name of the anchor
element.

I like the firefox browser because it ha the best support for w3c standards,
but i don't know if this is w3c standard behavior.
Thank you !
