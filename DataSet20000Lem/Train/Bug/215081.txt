Bookmarks, personal bookmark toolbar, and preference disappear after installing
the Flash plugin on Firebird. The theme appears to revert to one without a
"search" box in the upper-right corner, and typing address into the address
bar no longer works. When attempting to click link from other programs, a new
Mozilla window is spawned if one wa not open and focus change to the open
Mozilla window if there wa one open (as expected) but nothing appears in the
address bar and no page is loaded. When starting Firebird from a shortcut it
doe not bring up the homepage; the preference for the homepage is stored
though, and this page can be accessed by using the home button.
