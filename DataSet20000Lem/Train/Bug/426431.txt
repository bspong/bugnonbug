Pages with a table that ha a background image do not display properly if the background image span behind multiple row / columns. It will not display the image behind the table using CSS. However, Internet Explorer show this by setting the row and column to "Background: Transparent", allowing the actual table's background to be displayed. I am working on a website that ha not yet been uploaded, if that may somehow effect that. I will update this later with the URL a soon a the page is uploaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.In a webpage editor, create a table that ha many columns/rows with a picture a a background coded using CSS.
2.Type some text in those columns/rows.
3.Using CSS, set the value of the columns/rows to "Background: Transparent".
4.Open in Firefox and Internet Explorer and compare the two.
Actual Results:
Firefox fails to reproduce the desired result that Internet Explorer 7 doe (for once).

Expected Results:
The background image should appear behind the text.
