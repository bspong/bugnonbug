Firefox seemingly randomly requires multiple input for common commands, such a click on website buttons, forward and back command and bookmark launches.

It act similarly to a lost internet connection, but there is no indication on the status bar that Firefox is performing an action. Sometimes several repeated input are required (as many a 7 in my experience) before an action is performed.

It isn't limited to any particular set of commands, or even to Firefox commands. Links on webpage can also trigger this bug.

It's occurred with both Firefix 2.0 and 3.0 beta. I've spoken to friend that use Firefox and they've confirmed the bug, a well a it's randomness.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
It can't be reproduced by any method I've discovered. However, once the effect appears, it affect ALL webpage-related function in Firefox until it's flushed out by repeating command multiple times. In that way, it's self-repeating.
