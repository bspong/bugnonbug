Bookmarks display in sidebar empty, but bookmark show when clicking bookmark button

(Hopefully this is not a duplicate of an existing bug. A search didn't reveal obvious candidates.)

I normally use the Sidebar to display the bookmark list. This broke upgrading from FF 4.0 Beta13Pre nightly to FF 4.0 RC1. Instead of my expected bookmark display, I see three entry with (no title) a the description. I *do* see my expected bookmark list when clicking the bookmark button on the toolbar.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF 4.0 RC1
2. Open FF 4.0 RC1 using existing profile
3. Open Sidebar to view bookmark
Actual Results:
Bookmarks list contains 3 entry with (no title) a the description

Expected Results:
A normal display of my bookmark in the Sidebar panel

This behavior persisted even after an FF 4.0 restart with extension disabled, so it's not an add-on conflict.

To make matter thoroughly confusing, clicking on the Bookmarks button in the toolbar *shows* my expected bookmark list.

Looking in the profile directory, I see that my former places.sqlite is gone, replaced by places.sqlite.CORRUPT, and a default places.sqlite file ha been created.

So my question are:

1) Why is FF deciding my places.sqlite file is corrupt and replacing it with an empty default copy? I saw this behavior when trying to use a places.sqlite file from my 3.6 installation in 4.0 beta, gave up, and imported a backup, assuming some incompatibility between 3.6 and 4.0 bookmark handling. It wa an unpleasant surprise to see it happen going from FF 4 Beta to FF 4 RC1.

2) Since it *shows* my expected bookmark file when clicking on the Bookmarks button, where is it *getting* that list? It's certainly not getting it from the places.sqlite file.

Any guidance that will help me understand what is happening will be welcomed. So will any suggestion about further info I can provide to track down what is occurring.
