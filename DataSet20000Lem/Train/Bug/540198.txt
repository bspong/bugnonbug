Sometimes on some computer compiz-fusion may crash. The main effect are that opened window have no decoration anymore and that you cannot focus on them anymore. However, all window are still there, and if you happen to find access to a terminal or have a launcher on the desktop you just have to launch metacity or compiz-fusion again (if your system is nicely configured, it may even fall back automatically to metacity after the crash of compiz-fusion).

Unfortunately, there is one and only one program that will disappear at the very time compiz-fusion will crash : Firefox. It used to happen back when I wa using Arch Linux with Firefox 3.5, and it still happens now that I'm using Debian Lenny with Firefox/Iceweasel 3.0.6.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox within a compiz-fusion gnome session.
2. Make compiz crash.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes.

Expected Results:
Firefox should just loose it decorations, just a every other window.

Happens with Fx 3.0.6 a well a with 3.5 and on different and (mostly) unrelated distros.
