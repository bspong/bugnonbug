I am using Firefox's keyword functionality to simplify a login.

Normally, when submitting form by pressing the Enter key, Firefox behaves a if you've clicked the first submit button on that form. If that submit button ha a name attribute, any value it hold is sent along with the form request. However if you add a keyword search for a form it doe not capture the submit button's value. Thus it ha inconsistent behaviour and ha the ability to break keyword searches.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to example URL (https://members.adam.com.au/login.php)
2. enter any text in the username field
3. right-click on the password field and do 'Add a Keyword for this Search'

there is no need to actually use the resulting keyword bookmark to test the problem
4. go to Tools > Page Info > Forms and view the Login form's details, note that each control ha a name attribute so should be 'successful' by html spec.
5. open your firefox profile's bookmarks.html in a text editor and find Username%3D including the quote to view the bookmark's POST_DATA attribute

Actual Results:
the POST_DATA doe not contain the field 'Login' from the form's submit button.

Expected Results:
it should contain the login field resulting in a value like Username%3Dtest&amp;Password%3D%25s&amp;Login%3DLog%20in

it can be worked around by manually editing the bookmark.html file
