1. Set firefox a default browser.
2. Clicking on any link inside MS Outlook, firefox should open and go to the specified link.
3. What is happening is that, firefox is opening, but not going to the link. In the same firefox window which opened a a result of clicking from outlook, if you create a new tab and try to manually enter some url, it doesn't connect.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set firefox a default browser.
2. Clicking on any link inside MS Outlook, firefox should open and go to the specified link.
3. What is happening is that, firefox is opening, but not going to the link. In the same firefox window which opened a a result of clicking from outlook, if you create a new tab and try to manually enter some url, it doesn't connect.

Actual Results:
Firefox doesn't connect to the specified link, even though it open a new window

Expected Results:
Firefox open a new window and go to the specified link.

I think, some connectivity module of firefox is not enabled properly when clicking from a third party app, like MS outlook.
