Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:

sometimes it will result in a "firefox is already running" when you want to start firefox but no firefox is running yet

Actual Results:
.parentlock seems to cause the problem, simply removing .parentlock is not an option because the bookmark are then gone when firefox is started

Expected Results:
rename the firefox directorie in something else in the home directory of the user, start firefox en close it, then copy all file from the old firefox directory back in the newly created firefox directory except the ./parenlock file, the bookmark are a the should be but all addons have to be installed again, also login information for some site is gone and ha to be filled in again.

In my current setup I have multiple workstation and multiple users, on some workstation multiple user are logged in at the same time and all have firefox running. some user "forget" to log out so when a workstation is shut down firefox is not properly closed which can later result in a "firefox is allready running" but no firefox is running.It can also happen if one of the kid ha restriced computer time that the workstation shuts down automaticly shut down at a certain time with a cron job, firefox is than also not properly closed which can result in the mentioned problem.
