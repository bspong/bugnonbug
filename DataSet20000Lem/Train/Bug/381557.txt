If user with Firfox try to login to the mentioned web page, it works, but a soon a they use any link, they are considered to be logged out again. A second login make it work till the computer is shut down.
This is only with Firefox; with IE and Konqueror it works. The bug indeed seems to happen reproducably the first time a login is done on that machine. Further login seems to work till the machine is shut down.
I created an account with username baku and password test if somebody want to try.
The site is using tomcat 5.5.20 and the application is based on turbine. Login is based on sessions, so I think it is a session problem.
I know this is not too easy to see, but it seems to be a firefox problem. I would really appreciate if this could be solved (a university department us the application and their default browser is firefox.
