Firefox freeze the whole system on several (randomly) Websites
User-Agent: Opera/9.24 (X11; Linux i686; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071105 Fedora/2.0.0.9-1.fc7 Firefox/2.0.0.9

When I browse the web, thats what I normally do with firefox, without any addons or themes, Firefox freeze the whole system while loading a new website.
Everything stops, I can only move the mouse, keyboard, medium player or anything else did not work anymore.
This happens randomly, unpredictable and force me to switch off the power of my PC.
I am not amused about it, but I will not blame Firefox, may be it a bug in Fedora 7, may be it`s an unfortunate cooperation of two or more programs.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.removed firefox, /usr/lib/firefox and ~/.mozilla
2.reinstalled Firefox, but it crashed again
3.opened it with firefox --jsconsole
