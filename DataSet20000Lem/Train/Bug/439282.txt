I have now confirmed that Firefox is the only application which break the volume change notification alert/sound/beep when you want to use the F11 or F12 key to modify the sound.

I uninstalled Firefox for the past week without any issues, and yesterday, after reinstalling, it ha happened again.

I'm not exactly sure how this happens, but I know it does, and I have replicated it at least 8 time now by using Firefox, and there is no event from what I can see which trigger this (rightfully so, I don't change the volume on my computer but every so often).

However, I can say that when this event doe happen, the system start becoming unstable, and application have a tendency to crash.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox on the latest version of Mac OS X.
2. With time, the volume-change notification will stop functioning.
Actual Results:
On occasion, the volume-change notification will stop working, but it is ONLY with the volume-change hotkeys. If I go to the sound settings, and manually move the sound bar, the notification work correctly.

Expected Results:
The volume-change key should function a normal.

The only way of solving this issue is to simply log out and log back in. After that, the volume-change notification work correctly.

I have reinstalled the operating system and before reinstalling, I tried multiple users.

I can't really share any other information than that, a I don't know how to explain it, but it ha been an issue all throughout the Firefox 3 beta process.

Perhaps it is an issue with the Apple operating system a well, but Firefox ha been the only application to cause this.

Also, I am using Firefox 3 Release Candidate 3.
