Several tab on the Page Info window contain text field drawn on the window in
two columns, with heading on the left and value on the right. An example is
the General tab that ha "Address:" and "http://www.mozilla.org" near the top.
The value on the right are not properly lined up with the label on the left.
The value are several pixel too low. The baseline on both side should be the
same but aren't. It look messy and make it hard to read.

Note that this doesn't happen with the text that appears in table on the Page
Info window, just the other area where the text field is placed directly on the
window.

Actual Results:
The baseline of the text field on the right are several pixel below the
corresponding labes on the right.

Expected Results:
The baseline of the label and value text field should be aligned vertically.
