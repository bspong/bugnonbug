The blue toolbar [pic, name - O X] disappears after exiting F11 mode("ultra"
fullscreen). Happens only when Ultra FS is activated from a non-fullscreen
window. Problem is restored when another window is activated, and return to the
problem window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup- Have the toolbar autohide
2. Set the window to non-fullscreen mode (with "- O X")
3. Stretch window Maximum size. (done at 1024x768)
4. Close window to set default size.
5. Open new window with the new large default size
6. Hit F11. Super Fullscreen will be activated
7. Hit F11 to go to normal mode, or hit the [*o] un-fullscreen screen button.
Actual Results:
The entire window blue border disappeared, with the blue toolbar. The Firebird
window wa pushed to the upper left corner of the screen, leaving space on the
right and bottom because the border and toolbar disappeared. Clicking on the
empty space will not bring up other windows.

Expected Results:
Restored the window to a non-fullscreen window with the toolbar and borders.

Workaround fix: focus on another window and return to the mozilla window. the
toolbar and border will be restored. Dragging window over Firebird to redraw
may be necessary.
