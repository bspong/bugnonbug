Give user choice over search engine coming from OS level search input
User choice is paramount in Firefox and choice of search engine ha been an option in Firefox since the beginning of integrated search.

As operating system move to having web search input integrated into their interface user are in danger of losing the choice they made for search engine within Firefox. This a breakdown bug is to investigate a feature that ensures Firefox user continue to have control over their preferred web search engine, no matter where they started searching from.

Example Flow:

User focus the Windows start menu search input titled "Search the web"
User enters search query: "Seahawks Superbowl Blunders"
Firefox open a new tab for the query using the Search engine DuckDuckGo (which is the user chosen search engine)
Firefox show an indicator, possibly in the search input, that the search term were used with the user default engine.

Acceptance Criteria:

* Continue respecting URLs opened from other application
( in system where there is no easy user choice for search engine )
* Apply query from OS search input to the user preferred search engine
* Indicate to user that their preferred search engine wa used
* Allow user to easily get back to the original URL in case it wa desired
* Give user the option of disabling this feature, possibly in preference
