Text inside of popup is a follows:

Could not initialize the application's security component. The most likely cause is problem with file in your application's profile directory.

I will note that earlier yesterday (10-05-08) that everything wa working fine. But after a restart of my computer, I found that this error would now occur and seems to not go away.
