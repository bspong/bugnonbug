Typically I access Hotmail from www.msn.com, after signing in usually my inbox show correctly but when I start reading and replying to emails, it seems to happen most frequently with a reply, Firefox lock up and "(not responding)" is
displayed in the upper title bar....the mouse indicator show a busy and it just sits there, back doe nothing, if I "X" out to close it I get the popup dialog box asking (I think from window 7) if I want to close the program or continue to wait, the only that work is to close, if I re-launch Firefox is doe it again...

this never used to happen on this computer before some of the recent Firefox updates, not sure exactly when it started, if I go to my window 2000 computer the Hotmail account work fine, if I use Internet Explorer on the Windows 7 computer (where I see the issue) it work fine too....seems like a bug introduced by recent update to Firefox when running on window 7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to Hotmail
2.open an email from inbox
3.click REPLY
Actual Results:
the reply screen is displayed and if I click in the reply text area to write a reply, it immediately go to "not responding" and the mouse show "busy"

Expected Results:
Firefox should allow me to write a reply, send it and continue using the browser.

Once this occurs, nothing else can be done in Firefox....until it is closed and re-launched

if I avoid this situation I have not had these symptom occur with
other websites....it used to work just fine on this computer running
Windows 7 until sometime recently but not sure exactly when it began
since I do not always use this computer to access my email and the first few
time it occurred I assumed it wa an internet or hotmail server issue
