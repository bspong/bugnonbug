New "encrypted" symbol make confusion and the few detail from baloon text is not helpful

This is not exactly a bug, but is an annonying feature in Firefox 14.

I saw the same problem in Opera 11.x before, with the difference that in Opera at least if the certificate fails or load partially in a web page (resulting in non-encrypted or partially encrypted connection, a security issue) it advice you. Firefox doe not have something like this.

However, in previous version certified/encrypted site that doesn't support TLS wa marked a a blue tag in the address bar (green for "all ok" sites). And if happens the related issue about encryption/certificate, Firefox doe not show it, being this a warning sign.

In Firefox 14, encryption symbol look grey, making confusion about certificate or encryption status if the related issue happens. It's good to remember that a vulnerability wa discovered time ago with TLS and these site (like Facebook or Yahoo! login page, for example) turned off the TLS support for security reasons.

An alert in the baloon text (like Opera) and a distinctive color instead of grey lock for encrypted site (like blue, used by older version of Firefox) would be well appreciated.
