Your newest 2.0 version of Mozilla is incompatible with the Kesi 1.3 reader of Kurzweill 3000, a software that read text for the visually disabled and dyslexic. The older version of Mozilla are compatible.

The Kesi 1.3 reader of Kurzweil 3000 allows the internet to read back to the user. For many this is the only way the internet can me utilized.

Further removing 2.0.01 from my computer did not help a it still disabled the Kesi 1.3 reader in Kurzweil.

If I can't re-enable the Kesi 1.3 reader for the old Mozilla version, I will have to make i.e my default browser in Kurzweil. I would suggest you try to make 2.0.0.1 compatible with Kurzweil. I checked for update on the Kurzweil site and none exist.
