Halfway during yesterday, a right-click on a highlighted phrase took 5-10 second to produce the drop-down menu, and it wa a very long menu which didn't contain the web-search option (open in new tab). Usually there are only 5 item in the list. When I turned on my computer today, it wa working normally and wa OK most of the day. I closed all browser and returned a while later, and the same problem had recurred. Restarting (warm or cold) had no effect. Also lost bookmarks, password and browsing history when I turned it on this AM.

Reproducible: Always

3.
Actual Results:
A "promotional message" seems to appear when I start machine in the AM. That wa never there before. I think it wa also there yesterday.

Expected Results:
Right-click mouse menu on a highlighted phrase usually appears immediately and only had 5 lines, one of which wa the Search web for " ". Cannon get it to appear no matter what I try.
