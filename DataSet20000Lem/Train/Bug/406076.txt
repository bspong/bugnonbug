Hi,

Ever since upgrading to this version I will have a number of tab open which result in an erro message stating "firefox ha stopped working properly and will now shut down." It automatically shuts down and then when I click restore session and start using the same page doe the exact same shut-down. I have started new session but this doe not seem to curb the problem.

Please help, I have upgraded many time and am a bit baffled by this.

Thanks

Carly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a number of tab open - over 3
2. Attempt to click on link within one of those tab or open new tab

Actual Results:
Error message state "Firefox ha stopped working properly and is being shut down."

Expected Results:
After firefox ha shut down, I click on the firefox shortcut and choose the restore session rather than start a new session.

The page restores but if I refresh or click a new link or tab the same error occurs.

I have also done the start a new session, but it is very hit and miss and ha resulted in the same error message.

Not done this on a daily basis - it appears to be a bug.

At least have sorted the problem after it shut down and I restored or started a new session.
