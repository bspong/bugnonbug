Offer UI pref to toggle titlebar back on
Firefox's previous visual design displayed the page title in the title bar, and again in the selected tab in the tab bar. The latter is truncated by more open tabs; the former is not.

Open more than a handful of tabs, and you see this:

_______________________________________________________________
° ° ° Amazon.com: Novelty Horse Head Mask Prop: Toys & Games
Amazo… Welcom… Twitte… … +


Australis say "screw that, everyone ha three tab open on a widescreen display", and show you this:

_____________________________________________________
° ° ° + v <|Amazo… Welcom… Twitte… … |>


Your current tab ha no more text space than any other open tab, perhaps isn't even visible in the tab chooser, and almost certainly doesn't have enough space to show the page title.

Regressing aspect of this:

* The ability to contextualize the current page/tab is removed. Rapidly shifting between tab with a keyboard shortcut never reveals the page title, which -- believe it or not -- is actually sometimes useful, and is certainly much quicker than having to read the page to find out what's going on.

* The ability to contextualize the current *window* is removed. There's now no title for a Firefox window! Instead I have a stream of bug number and fragment of letter near where a title normally is. My ability to Cmd-~ between windows, scanning the title -- "oh, that's an l10n bug, this is my l10n bug window" -- ha been totally removed.


In short: at the risk of sounding all ZOMG CHANGE, this seems like a useful affordance ha been removed to save vertical space.

Can we allow this to be customized, so that I can save my vertical space with Vertical Tabs and buy myself a page title again?
