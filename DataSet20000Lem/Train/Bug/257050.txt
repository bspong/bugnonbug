firefox wrapper script doesn't set LD_LIBRARY_PATH soon enough for mozilla-xremote-client, patch included
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040816 Firefox/0.9.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040816 Firefox/0.9.3

When running the firefox script (from the bin directory) to launch firefox, I
get a "Killed" message when the script call mozilla-xremote-client whether
firefox is currently already running or not. It seems to be because the script
doesn't set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH until after it doe the check that call
mozilla-xremote-client and so that app fails because it can't find the firefox
libs. The following patch show what I changed in the script to set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH prior to calling mozilla-xremote-client. This result in firefox
launching without any seemingly extraneous (and somewhat disconcerting for end
users) message.

Though the browser worked regardless, we were hesitant to release it to our user
community with an odd "Killed" message that we'd just have to tell people to
ignore. This seems like a cleaner solution. It probably wouldn't occur for
people installing firefox in a default location, but I'm sure there are a lot of
organization installing it somewhere non-standard like we do for larger
enviroments where it is mounted on several other systems.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run firefox from the command line: for u I use
/usr/usc/firefox/0.9.3/bin/firefox &
2.
3.

Actual Results:
A message "Killed" appears before the browser launches, regardless of whether an
instance of firefox is already running or not. Otherwise the browser function
normally.

Expected Results:
Not returned what seems like an error message when nothing seems to be wrong.

This is a fairly standard build of firefox 0.9.3 on solaris 8 with gcc 3.3.2
using gtk2. It is installed in /usr/usc/firefox/0.9.3
