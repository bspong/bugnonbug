Taking a screenshot of Firefox display an old title from a page viewed long ago during a private browsing session
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I just took a screenshot (using GIMP) of some page that I wa viewing. When I looked at the screenshot, everything wa normal, except that the window's title bar didn't display the title of the page I wa looking at. Instead, it displayed part of that, but it wa mostly overwritten with the title of a page that I viewed quite some time ago.

To make matter worse, that page that I viewed quite some time ago, I viewed in private browsing mode. And, to be clear, I had long since exited private browsing mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter private browsing mode.
2. Go to a page with some horribly embarrassing title.
3. Do what you will.
4. Exit private browsing mode.
5. Go to some nice friendly page with picture of fluffy bunny on it.
6. Start up GIMP.
7. "File / Create / Screen Shot / Grab a single window".
8. Drag the crosshairs to the Firefox window.
9. Save the resulting screenshot.
10. Don't notice that the title bar in the screenshot say something very, very different than "Fluffy Bunny Page".
11. Send the screenshot in an email to Grandma.
Actual Results:
Grandma now know that you're a disgusting pervert.

Expected Results:
Grandma love the fluffy bunny picture that you sent her.
