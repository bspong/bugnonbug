Mozilla Firefox crash when we do a Google search
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.4) Gecko/20091016 Firefox/3.5.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When Mozilla upgraded to version 3, Firefox started crashing EVERY TIME we do a Google search -- either with Google on the top bar OR even going to the Google website. Both avenue will crash Mozilla. Even when Mozilla re-upgraded this version (a few minute ago), it still happens. It's not a problem with Google because Google search work fine on the same computer with other browsers. It's only on Mozilla and after version 3 wa installed. If I select "I'm Feeling Lucky" from the Google website, it doe not crash Mozilla but that option doe not give a list of results; it take directly to one website, so it's not an effective tool.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type anything on google search bar (either on the top bar OR at the Google website)
2.Press ENTER
3.Mozilla crash every time
Actual Results:
Mozilla Firefox crashes. A Mozilla window open requesting more information. I select to send a report to Mozilla. I try it again, it crash again, a Mozilla window open apologizing for still not being able to open the site.

Expected Results:
It should have brought up a list of possible website a a result of the internet search.

There is nothing special or unusual. The only variable is that Mozilla upgraded to version 3 and it started crashing every time since then, since the upgrade before the last one (today Oct. 29, 2009). Will this problem be addressed by Mozilla and fixed on the next upgrade? Or is there a solution that we need to implement? Thank you for your help.
