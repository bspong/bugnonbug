I cannot find the list of existing tag (labels) in neither bookmark sidebar nor in Places organizer. I can see the list of folders, but not the list of label I used. They only appear a additional property of some bookmarks.

In my opinion this predates the whole idea of labels. They should provide a flat category system to navigate the bookmarks. The tag-oriented user want to see which label are there, and which item are marked with them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add some tag to bookmark
2. Try to find which tag are there and which bookmark `belong' to which tag.
Actual Results:
Tags (labels) are viewed now a an additional property of the bookmark. It is impossible to view all the available tag or navigate the collection of bookmark using only tags.

Expected Results:
I would expect tag (labels) to be visible in bookmark sidebar and Places organizer a
* either special type of folder (they are parent for bookmarks)
* or a an element of tag cloud (web-style)

In fact I would expect tag (labels) and folder to be identical from the user point of view.

I would like to point to Epiphany web browser, where tagging system is used in bookmark for years. They are called topic there and are identical to (virtual) folders. In fact, it also simplifies the process of adding a bookmark. It is sufficient to think which topic it relates to, and check them, no need to deal with a hierarchic folder tree each time one add a bookmark.
