Please provide a predefined profile which user can choose like public profile kind of thing. So that if by chance the session closed via save and quit by one user should not be accessed by other guy who will isit the cafe. I own a internet cafe where often new guy come and occupy the system. In case the last user session got crashed or something like that then the next user will be given with session restore this is breach of security in public places.


Many time I have experienced this and I tried to inform that user by sending self mail using his mail application.

Please allow the admin to choose what kind of profile he want when he is about to install,. whether it is for personal use or public use.

I am a java developer so I can understand why you have given that facility but there is a high chance of it being misused.


Thanks and regard

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open two tab an a mail like gmail.com and login
2.now close the browser without logging out the email client.
3.and save and quit. browser session
a user is not keen on what he is clicking on while he is about to move.
he will click the first button which is save and quit. this is a common behavior of a man .. common psychology...
Actual Results:
session restore will be presented next time when the browser is opened.
This is really pathetic if i have some really personal mail.

Expected Results:
I need an option where I can only admin can control the setting of the browser.Say I need to input a password if i need to change the setting of the browser

Should not prompt(pop-up) the session restore message. Only if I have choose it to do so.
