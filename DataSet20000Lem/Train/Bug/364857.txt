I wanted to create a new profile since I'd not done one in year and had added/removed bunch of extensions, thus a clean fresh start for the latest nightlies.
Here's what happened initially and what I've tried since:

Created a new profile via Profile Mgr.
Closed Minefield.
Manually moved old bookmark from old profile to new (via window explorer)
Started.
Clicked on "Options" and Minefield crashed.
Went back, manually removed bookmarks.
Restarted.
Clicked on "Tools> Options" and Minefield promptly crashed/closed (Options window did not even open: ref bug 328513?).

Removed new profile via Profile Mgr.
Deleted that profile folder via Windows Explorer.
Created another new profile (different name).
Imported old bookmark via Bookmarks> Organize> Import.
Verified import.
Clicked on "Options" and Minefield crashed/closed.

Started with original/old profile where bookmark were copied/imported from.
Clicked on "Options" and Minefield crashed.

Verified via ProcessExplorer/Task Manager that no Minefields were running in the background.
Started Mindfield again.
Deleted new profile.
Selected old profile and started.
Clicked on "Options" and Minefield crashed.

Started again under original profile.
Checked random bookmarks; they loaded fine.
Checked "Organize Bookmarks"; it opened/closed.
"Tools> Clear Private Data" and "Tools> Add-ons" work.
I have the TabMix Plus add-on installed; clicked "Tools> TabMix Options"; worked fine.
Closed Minefield without clicking "Options".
Started again; created another new profile.
Clicked Tools> Options, no crash.
Closed.
Restarted with new profile.
Clicked on "Options", everything normal.
Imported original bookmark in this profile.
Checked & loaded a couple of them.
Clicked on "Options" and again everything normal.
Closed.
Started.
Clicked on "Options" and Minefield crashed.

Created new profile
Started with new profile, clicked Tools>Options; normal
Opened bookmarks/closed.
Started, clicked Tools>Options; normal
Closed Minefield
Started again
Clicked on Tools>Options; normal
Opened web page; added it to Bookmarks
Clicked Tools>Options = crash

Deleted new profile
Created another new profile
Clicked Tools> Options; normal
Changed for test, to "Show a blank page" under Main menu
Opened/closed Tools>Dom Insp and
*Did nothing with bookmarks*
Closed
Started with newest profile
Clicked Tools> Options; crashed


Status: Can not use "Tools> Options" under original profile any longer, nor new profile more than once after minor change are made using tools; individual bookmark work fine a seems most other function (I used my original profile/bookmark to post this bug report).

Summary: appears that something in tool usage/changes is permanently corrupting profile relative to Tools>Options rendering Options unusable?

Note again: Prior to creating the new profile bookmark & Options had been working fine in the original profile. Sample individual bookmark that I checked loaded fine in both new and original profiles.
Again, I only created a new profile in hope of getting a fresh start from bunch of extension adds/removes.

This sounded similar to Bug 357770 but with my original profile TalkBack is disabled. TalkBack did work with new profile (and I sent four of them; apology tho, a I failed to catch the numbers; they do have my email address in them, a is logged here on the board).


Add-ons/Extensions:
New Profiles = none
