Copy and paste into a property of a bookmarklet freezeze the requester, requiring it to be reopened for editing.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060308 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060308 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.11

When I paste in the url to add it into the bookmarklet, property will not accept any input from the keyboard, I have to click "save changes", and reopen to continue editing the bookmarklet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Edit a bookmarklet
2.Paste url into bookmarklet

Actual Results:
Properties will not respond.

Expected Results:
To be able to continue editing the bookmarklet without having to close and reopen the property window.

Last bookmarklet I tried this with is the linkify bookmarklet from here
https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/loganalysis.html

I like to replace the search string with a regex like [A-Z][a-z]+[ ][A-Z][a-z]+ to match names, then around the "A.href = M.data", I will pop in a google search url, this will make any name on a page appear a google search links, by clicking the bookmarklet. Because of firefox's behaviour while editing these url's (or bookmarklets), it make editing them a pain in the rear.
