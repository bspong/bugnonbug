Release an "objdir SDK".

At the moment, the official method for compiling extension which provide native
component is the following :
1a. write one or more Makefile.in for compilation, with little documentation
2a. write one or more jar.mn for creation of jar archive
3a. write one or more Makefile.in for creation of an xpi, with little
documentation, using relatively obscure perl script which do not seem to work
with relative directory
4a. compile your whole Mozilla/Firefox tree (a few hour if you have the correct
setup, a few additional hour if you have something close, absolutely impossible
if you don't -- see mozillazine's forums)
5a. fix bug of step 1a.
6a. return to step 4a. (repeat until step 1a seems to work)
7a. make distclean to be certain that the correction are sufficient and do not
rely on unexpected dependency (ten minute ?)
8a. return to step 4a. (repeat until you are certain that it works)
9a. run your installer
10a. fix bug of step 2a.
11a. run the build system again to make sure that your correction to
Makefile.in are propagated to the Makefile (a few minutes)
12a. return to step 9a. (repeat until you are certain that it works)
13a. make distclean
14a. return to step 4a. (repeat until you are satisfied that it work with all
combination of --enable-static, --disable-static, --enable-shared,
--disable-shared, objdir, ...)
15a. move to a different platform
16a. return to step 4a.

This process is quite tedious, in particular the compilation of Firefox itself
and the fact that debugging Makefiles requires long waits.

A non-standard-but-easier method for compiling an extension is the following :
1b. write a custom Makefile (possibly including autotools), which take
advantage of the compiled $(MOZ_OBJDIR) and mozilla-config/firefox-config to
find the necessary headers/interfaces/libraries, compiles the extension and
delivers a finished .xpi
2b. compile Mozilla/Firefox a in the previous step 4.
3b. execute makefile (a few seconds, perhaps a few minutes).
4b. fix bug of step 1b.
5b. return to 3b. (repeat until it works)
6b. move to a different platform
7b. return to 2b.

Note that mozilla-config and/or firefox-config may not work if the
Firefox/Mozilla ha not been fully installed. However, even when emulating the
work of *-config, this process is easier than the default method.

A third method is possible under most Linux distributions, a well a Mac OS X +
Fink.

1c. install the mozilla-dev or mozilla-devel or firefox-dev or firefox-devel package
2c-7c. a 2b-7b

These package guarantee that mozilla-config or firefox-config will work and
save the hassle of compiling a whole mozilla distribution on each platform for
every single possible configuration.

I believe that these package actually contain the $(MOZ_OBJDIR)/dist/include
and $(MOZ_OBJDIR)/dist/bin directory of a distribution of mozilla/firefox
built with standard options.

From personal experience :
* all extension developer who tried method a. gave up (that's a dozen)
* all extension developer who tried method c. found it a breeze and continued
working without even realizing that there wa anything complex involved (that's
half a dozen).


My suggestion : make this mozilla-dev package "standard", i.e. whenever a new
distribution of Mozilla/Firefox is uploaded to the official ftps, also upload a
tarball containing the objdir, plus a small installer to set up mozilla-config.


Note : the actual list of file of a developer SDK is available at
http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=mozilla-dev&version=unstable&arch=i386

Other note: this bug is a follow-up of a previous RFE (
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=281386 ). I submit this new report
with the benefit of several additional month working with Mozilla, building a
cross-platform native extension, and trying to get up to speed a number of C++
developer interested by XPCom extension development.

Reproducible: Always
