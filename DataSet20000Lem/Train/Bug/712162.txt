Windows error starting Firefox via html launch when Firefox update ready to install
Firefox cause a window error when (a) Firefox is not running, but ha downloaded an update and (b) Firefox is indirectly started by "running" an .html file.

Steps to reproduce:
1. run Firefox, wait until "about" show that an update ha been downloaded and is ready to be applied.
2. terminate Firefox and make sure there is no longer an active process
3. double-click an .html file on a local disk.

The result of doing so is that Windows display an error dialog box containing "There wa a problem sending the command to the program". Some second after this is displayed, Firefox display the selected .html file.

In addition to the result of double-clicking an .html file, it ha been observed that a vb.net program initiating an .html file via System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("somefile.html") will receive the following exception before Firefox display the file:
System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception wa unhandled
ErrorCode=-2147467259
Message=An error occurred in sending the command to the application
NativeErrorCode=1156
Source=System

This occurs on both the x86 and x86_64 hardware platforms. It ha been observed on multiple version of Nightly, including the update to 11.0a1 (2011-12-19)
