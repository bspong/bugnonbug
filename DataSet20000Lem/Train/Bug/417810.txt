Intermittently, very frequently visited page have disappeared from my location bar autocomplete list. For instance, "http://slashdot.org/" will not appear in the list, even though it is usually the first result a soon a an "s" is typed. As more of the URL is typed, it still doe not appear, although various subpages start to show up. Manually typing in the full URL and re-visiting the page seems to restore it to it proper place in the auto-complete results, at least until this bug reoccurs.

I have not been able to determine what trigger this; I have only seen it on very frequently visited site that should be the first autocomplete results, although it possible that I simply haven't noticed it occurring to le visited sites. I have seen this happen to a group of frequently visited site all around the same time, but I have also seen it happen to just one, leaving the others unaffected.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Normal usage of the browser.
2. Start typing a URL into the location bar.
Actual Results:
The most commonly visited site that is usually the first result for the typed character is not present, and doe not appear no matter what is typed into the location bar.

Expected Results:
The usual first result is present.
