Developer Edition theme in Nightly ha more padding on standard button than on aurora/devedition; want developer edition button to be just a tall a search/url field
The Developer Edition Theme in Nightly is a bit inconsistent with the Developer Edition Theme in the actual Developer Edition browser. By inconsistent, I mean to say that the standard action button next to the URL bar have more padding on them when compared to the Developer Edition browser. Example button are the bookmark button, sync button, home page button, etc. This cause Nightly to take up more vertical space than the Developer Edition version.

Here are two photo to illustrate the differences.

Notice how the Nightly version's button have more padding, which result in more vertical space being taken up by the browser. I suspect this wa just not noticed, a the URL bar take up the same space in both browsers, but the button next to it were overlooked.

The button in the Nightly version of the Developer Edition Theme should take up the same vertical space a the URL bar, otherwise the UI look inconsistent.
