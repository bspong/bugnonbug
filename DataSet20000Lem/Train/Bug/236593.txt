bookmark file owned by different user deleted without warning

This is a bit long - bear with me. I'm new to firefox - running it on linux -
and wanted to try some of the additional mycroft plugins. unfortunately, they
want to install directly into the browser installation hierarchy (owned by root)
and have no option to be isntalled only in the current user profile (daft, that).

So I ran firefox a root via sudo. While it wa running (out of my profile) I
decided to see what (if any) file had become owned by root. As you might
expect, there were a few cache entries, but I wa mildly surprised to see that
on exit, my bookmarks.html file wa owned by root.

Restarting the browser a me resulted in the bookmark menu being empty
(guessing the file wa unreadable) and exiting firefox deleted the file -
replacing it with an empty one.

Fortunately, I still have my bookmark in galeon and can re-export them - but
had this been my only copy of my bookmarks, I'd be a bit put-out.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. sudo firefox
2. exit the browser - notice the owner/permissions on bookmarks.html
3. firefox
4. exit the browser - notice that the bookmark file is a bit shorter than it
wa a moment ago.

Actual Results:
bookmark lost

Expected Results:
at least warned the user when it wa unable to read the bookmark file - and
refused to write out a new one in that state.

I'm marking this a normal since it's not exactly a normal use case (rather than
critical which would correspond to the loss of data it actually causes).
