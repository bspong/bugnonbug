The page is a demonstration of a JavaScript that open a window containing an
image, then resizes it based on the size of the image, then center the new window.

The example on the page work in Firebird 0.6 - Firefox 0.8 (maybe earlier), a
well a Mozilla build back to 0.94. The April 28th build of Firefox ignored
the JavaScript window, and simply changed the main window to the image. The May
8th build of Firefox change the main window to the image, but also open a new
default window, and produce a JavaScript error.

When trying this exact same page in Mozilla 1.7 build of the same dates, the
example work a expected.

I made sure to uninstall my nightly build of Firefox before installing the
newer nightly builds, a to avoid potential problems, although I have not
deleted my profile at all.

Reproducible: Always

1. Visit the webpage mentioned above.
