Cross-OS theme development nearly impossible for Mac OS X
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.12) Gecko/20080201 Firefox/2.0.0.12
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.0b4

Developing Firefox 3.0 theme based the default Windows theme that also work on Mac Firefox is nearly impossible even though the same theme can be made to work on Windows and Linux quite easily. In particular there appear to be some legacy Firefox 2.0 object in Mac Firefox that are not in Windows or Linux Firefox. For instance the most noticeable issue are legacy back & forward button drop button that appear beneath their respective back/forward button. There are also issue with Mac Firefox overriding "-moz-appearance: none;" instruction for button and menulists and using Mac system object instead.

Most of u who develop/maintain Firefox theme do not have multiple OSes that we can use to make our theme fully cross OS compatible. Those that do have a Mac and Windows box very few are going to have an inclination to build their theme twice just to make them compatible with Windows/Linux and Mac. Mac Firefox XULs and chrome in general need to be harmonized with Windows and Linux version of Firefox so that one can start with any OS theme and build a custom theme that is cross OS compatible without going to extreme measures.
