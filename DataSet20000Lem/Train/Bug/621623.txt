Following a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in Internet Explorer, Microsoft issued two workarounds in Security Advisory 2488013. One of these (the more practical one for home user who can't completely ditch IE) is to crank up IE's security settings.

Unfortunately, because the browser.download.manager.skipWinSecurityPolicyChecks setting ha been removed from Firefox 3.6, following Microsoft's security advice now mean that downloads in Firefox stop working.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open IE option and go to the Security tab. (Start > Settings > Control Panel > Internet Options > Security tab)
2. Follow Workaround #2 in Microsoft Security Advisory 2488013 and set Internet and Local Intranet Security Zone setting to "high".
3. Open Firefox.
4. Download any EXE file.

Actual Results:
The download manager show "Cancelled" and a zero byte file is created.

Expected Results:
The file would be downloaded.


The alternative for such home user are to futz around with the registry or the Custom Security Level dialog in IE or use another browser like Chrome or Opera.

Please consider reinstating the skipWinSecurityPolicyChecks setting. See comment like https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=445158#c58 for how a lot of user feel about this.
