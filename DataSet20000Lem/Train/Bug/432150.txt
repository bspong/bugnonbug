When I am using Firefox for relatively short periods, I experience a "Ghosting" of sorts, where the image of whatever wa before the current view is still existing on top of the current page. For example, If i were viewing the Firefox Home Page (provided by Google) and committed a search, I would still see the Home Page until I scrolled away from it (down) and "wiped" the old image off the screen. This also happens with tool bar and windows. the Download Manager doe not exhibit this problem. This problem occurs no matter what size the window is on my screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.View Web Pages
2.Change Web site viewing, Window Size (larger), or Alt-Tab into Firefox.
(I alt-Tabbed into Firefox viewing three tab (Bugzilla, Gmail, and Firefox Home Page, Bugzilla wa selected)
Actual Results:
Ghosting of image on the Firefox UI and Web Page

Expected Results:
View new page or Firefox instead of Remnants of Microsoft Word 2003

Using a Firefox 2 Theme, Same problem occurs with Default.
