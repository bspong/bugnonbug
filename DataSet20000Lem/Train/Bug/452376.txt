then a keyup event with keyCode == 13 is fired on the text element.

document.getElementById( "text1" ).onkeyup = function( event ) {
alert( event.keyCode );
};
2. Type anything into the text element, e.g. the digit "1".
3. An alert box will open saying "49".
4. Try to close the alert box by pressing the RETURN key.
