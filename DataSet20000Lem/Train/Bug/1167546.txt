Popup blocker fails after several day
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 Iceweasel/31.6.0
Build ID: 20150331233809

Steps to reproduce:

Login to http://www.syrnia.com/ several time a day, several day in a row.
(This is because I never shut down my computer, and the game automatically log you out after a short perioud of inactivity. Thus I have to re-login every few hours.)
Then their site try to open a popup (with the actual game in it), instead of opening the game in the current tab (current = the one where you logged in).


Actual results:

The first few days, the popup is blocked, and a small warning bar is produced at the top.
After a few day (always reproducible on the sixth day), the popup is not blocked anymore. It look to me like the popup-blocker doesn't activate on very old tabs.


Expected results:

The popup should be block not only in the first few days, but *always*.

I'm using "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 Iceweasel/31.6.0" (an old version modified by Debian's own brand 'Iceweasel') with a lot of extension and haven't tried using a different profile a this bug take a lot of time to reproduce.

I'm now testing with a new profile and without any extensions, but can only report the result in a week.
