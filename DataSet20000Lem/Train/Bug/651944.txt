I really hate this bug. I experience it since a long time. I'm using firefox on linux. Suddenly I experience that I can't move my tab anymore. Often, but not always, it occurs together with an frozen arrow which point to an place between to tabs. I have really no idea how to reproduce this bug, but it's really annoying. When it occurs, I always have to restart the browser.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Actual Results:
Tabs are not moveable.

Expected Results:
Tabs should always be moveable.

I found this in the error console. I don't know if it helps.
