When I go first to the http://www.universalmusic.fi/tiktak/YaBB/YaBB.pl website
(it's a web forum) and click on the "Kirjaudu" (login) link, which point to the
URL http://www.universalmusic.fi/tiktak/YaBB/YaBB.pl?action=login , Firefox
crashes. The UI stop responding and there is no window refresh. The only way is
to kill the process (with ctrl-C or kill). This happens to me every time.

For what it's worth, using Mozilla 1.7 thing work just fine with the site.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.universalmusic.fi/tiktak/YaBB/YaBB.pl
2. Click on the "Kirjaudu" link

Actual Results:
The UI freezes.

Expected Results:
To be able to see the login page.

I am using Debian unstable, the currently installed package is mozilla-firefox
0.9.3-6. However this problem ha been persistent for a several month during
which there have been several update with new Firefox packages, the behaviour
ha remained the same always.

I do have two cooky set by the site, with the web board's username and
password stored there. I don't know if these affect the problem.
