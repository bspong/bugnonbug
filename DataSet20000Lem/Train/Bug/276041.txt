Using Windows XP SP2. Saving image files, from a http page, to a local location
using 'drag and drop' will sometimes result in malformed image files.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. EITHER goto the page
"https://www.fnmoc.navy.mil/CGI/ww3_all.cgi?color=b&type=prod&area=natl&prod=sig_wav_ht"
OR do a google _image_ search for https:+[subject] (for more general examples)
2. Drag and drop image into a local folder.
3. View folder a thumbnail or view image using software of choice.

Actual Results:
Some of local image files, usually the first copy, are malformed ( 0 bytes) files.
It only work sometimes. In particular larger image file seem to be more
susceptible to corruption.

Expected Results:
EITHER:
1. Drag and drop should not be possible from secure pages.
2. Image file should not be corrupted.

I assume this is because image file loaded over http are not disk cached. This
subject is being discussed in bug#
