After the first right click the right-click menu no-longer display in a timely fashion and sometimes not at all.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open up two Firefox window and try the following for both
2.Right click on the blank part of the page (or anywhere, over image etc)
3.Next, left click somewhere on the blank part of the page to hide the menu
4.Right click on the blank part of the page (or anywhere, over image etc)
5.If you don't see the problem left click and try again once or twice to be sure there isn't a problem
Actual Results:
1.One window work the other doesn't
2.The first right click on the page pull up the right-click-menu a expected (for me)
3.The left click hide the menu a expected
4.After the right click there is a significant pause before the menu display (about one to two second sometimes more, sometimes the menu never displays)

Expected Results:
the menu showing up consistently when right clicking.

I am using the default Firefox theme, but I am using the classic windows-xp theme. I have seen this problem sporadically while using Firefox 3 and will try to keep better track of it because I would really like this fixed before the stable release.
