Firefox - very slow page loading

Mozilla Firefox - slow loading.mp4

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
Build ID: 20160623154057

Steps to reproduce:

Webpages loading in Firefox is very slow. It take several second to connect to the website and when the website start to appear, it take several second to display all content. It behaves like I would be on very slow connection.

But when I open different browser (e.g. Edge, Internet Explorer etc.), all website open immediately. I write URL, press ENTER and all content is loaded instantly. E.g. I see that Firefox take long time to connect to website, I open different browser to load the same website and this browser load the website immediately - even before Firefox!

I use Firefox on several computer (at work and at home) and this problem happens on all computers! Although I like the Firefox feature very much, I'm thinking about changing the browser, because it limit browsing experience a lot. I have 100 Mbps connection and the Firefox work like I had 1 kbps.

Please, do not point me to clean/restore my profile. I did it milliontimes, maybe it help but for several minute only. Then Firefox start to be slow a hell again.

I'm attaching example video to demonstrate the wrong behaviour.



Expected results:

Firefox should display the requested content immediately. Like other browser do.
