More detail from Youtube investigation -
The extension "Download Flash and Video" or alternately "Flash and Video Download" (not be confused with "Flash Video Downloader") ha several point in it's code where it look for the video id, but determines it's the video id with var.indexOf("video_id") != -1, so if "video_id" is anywhere in the string it assumes it's the id. Notably, annotation and related playlist both contain "video_id". The code then take the id, appends it to "watch?v=" and request it every 4 second until it's successful.


Expected results:

No spam requests.
