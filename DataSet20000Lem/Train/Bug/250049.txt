Hangs when trying to access any of the video on the page.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040626 Firefox/0.9.1

Each time I visit this site and try to access a video, the popup browser window
hang before loading the video. This site us the .wm file extension for
videos. I checked to make sure popups were allowed, cooky were allowed and
that the extension existed in the plug-in setting and all are set to function
with this file extension. I did notice however that the .wm file extension wa
not in the main window of the option -> download window but that it wa
included in the plug-in window behind the plug-in button. Don't know if this
matters, but there wa no way to enter an action for the .wm file extension in
the main window of the option -> download window.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Access the website
3. Click or double-click on one of the videos.

Actual Results:
The popup browser window appears and the indication from the window state that
the video is loading but it basically just sits there without loading.

Expected Results:
The popup browser window should appear, load the video and list additional
video in the left-hand pane and list additional link in the right-hand pane.

Would really like to discontinue using IE altogether and rely totally on
Firefox, but I need this site to access new content for presentations. This may
also be a Cisco Web Site problem. They have a list of browser that are
supported, but Firefox is not listed - Netscape is.
