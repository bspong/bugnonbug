In a restricted account (non administrator) I cannot use the checkbox in the print
window to save a file a a .prn file. This work just fine when logged on a an administrator. It will also work if I'm using IE in the non admin account. I honestly don't know if this is a firefox or a window problem, but because of my last statement, I suspect there is a minor problem with FF. This is a consistant problem and happens every time I try (because I forget which account I'm using). I must add that Firefox otherwise is the best browser I've ever used, bar none.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Be logged onto XP a non administrator
2. Be on any web page you want to print
3. CTRL P to open print window, check the "print to file" box and click print button.

Actual Results:
Get a "print failed" error message and no .prn file is created

Expected Results:
A .prn file should be created and is, if I'm using IE or am logged in admin.

None. Straight forward. Happens every time. Perhaps I'm missing something though I don't know what.
