A bit confusing: window opened with window.open() open new tab in another (parent) window (FF3RC2)

This code open a new window:

<a id="lnkIcon1Header" href="javascript:window.open('http://www.trilogica.it/','990x670','toolbar=yes,location=yes,status=yes,menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=990,height=670');void(0);"><br/>TriLogica</a>



The new window look exactly like a new firefox browser.
No indication that it is a popup or anything le than a normal FF browser window.
More confusing is that any link in the popup window, that ha target="_blank" doe not open in that window, but in another (parent or any other if parent wa closed). If the popup window is maximized, it seems that the link do not work at all, event that they are opened, but in another window.
And the window that ha opened the tab doe not give any feedback about it (flashing or other things)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.ikea.it (example)
2. Click on the icon ESHOP Lombardia
3. A new window open
4. Maximize the new window
5. Go to http://www.google.it or www.live.com
6. Make sure that the preference of the search engine are to open link in a new window (Open search result in a new browser window)
7. Search something
8. Click on the result links.. it seems that nothing happens
9. Switch to the parent window.. the link are there

Actual Results:
I'd expect some visual hint that something ha happened.
The best for me would be to open the tab on the current (popup) window, but at least the window that open the tab should flash or do something to indicate that the system is working.

Expected Results:
Anything that tell me that the tab are getting opened.
