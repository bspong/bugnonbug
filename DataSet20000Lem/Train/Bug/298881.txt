Instruction to repeate the problem is included in the demo.htm page. if you
select for example checkbox 3, after submit and press the back button you would
find checkbox 2 getting selected instead.

Tests I have done suggest

1) the problem would happen only of the <form> is wrapped between <table> and
it first <tr>, if the <form> is put outside of the table or inside a <td>
block the problem would not happen.

2) a checkbox before the original selected elemement would be selected instead
and the displacement is equal to the number of hidden variable exists in the form.

3) relocating all the hidden element after the checkbox field would hide the
problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open the url I have provided
2.select checkbox 3 and hit submit
3.press the back button


Actual Results:
instead of checkbox 3 you should find checkbox 2 getting selected

Expected Results:
The original checkbox should be selected, in this case checkbox 3
