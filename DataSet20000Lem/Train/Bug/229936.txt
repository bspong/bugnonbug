Sometimes when browsing, instead of parsing the html code, I see the code in browser
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

Not too often doe this happen, but enough for me to be bugged(excuse the pun)
by it.
I will browse to a site, and click a link. After connecting to the server,
instead of displaying the page, I see the source in the browser window. An
example can be seen here at www.empx.net/bugs/mozillabug.jpg

On this site, the reproducibility is fairly high, but due to it being a
restricted site, thats not too possible , on others (ive had this happen on some
gamecopyworld mirror a well) a refresh will fix it right up, other time not.
Depends on firebird's "mood" I guess.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.gamecopyworld.com
2.click one of the mirrors, i think #2 did this for me
3.see result

1. go to one.drexel.edu
2. enter a login
3. go to student service tab and enter bannerweb
4. click on student registration and information

Actual Results:
Shows source in browser window

Expected Results:
Render the page

Default theme, no crash, just didnt render the page.
