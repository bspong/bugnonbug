A flash object that is displayed over a div using the overflow-y: hidden; property doe not respond to any mouse events, including hover and click events. This event happens regardless of the position of the object tag in reference to the div (they can come before or after the div). Note: this is also caused by tag that were created dynamically by javascript using document.write("<object ...") )

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a flash object that dynamically change size/position and register click events.
2.Create a div with overflow-y: hidden; property
3.Cause flash object to move over div (note the object doe not necessarily have to be inside of the offending div)
Actual Results:
The portion of the flash object over the div doe not respond to any events.

Expected Results:
The flash object should still receive event when the object overlap on top of the div.

The bug doe not occur with overflow: hidden, just the direction specific overflows.
