1. Create a series of square box with background image (position center, size cover) floated at 25% wide to a flexible container.
2. stretch the document window or hover the cursor over the box with the background images.

If these value are set to pixel and not %, the problem go away. Also, if the window is stretched to a width optimal to the %, the rendering look fine (see attached image).

Hovering is particularly troublesome since it cause the image to change the subpixel rendering in odd ways. See second attachment.

Actual results:

Interpolation value at the edge of the box produce unwanted sub-pixel borders. These sometimes look like dotted lines, and sometimes just appear a straight thin lines.


Expected results:

The background image should bleed to the edge of the square, without any subpixel/interpolation bugs.
