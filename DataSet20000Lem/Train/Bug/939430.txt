Firefox hanging and eventually crashing several time a day, crash report say it's in js::jit::DoCompareFallback
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131112160018

Steps to reproduce:

Nothing, a far a I can tell. My browsing/extensions/etc ha not changed since I moved from a mid-2010 MacBook Pro running 10.8 (FF beta channel) to a 2013 Retina MacBook Pro running 10.9 (FF production channel).

But the hang and crash have been going on ever since I installed FF on this new machine.


Actual results:

Several time a day, Firefox will lock up and become extremely unresponsive, and I am forced to kill it. If I am away from my computer, it appears that it will crash on it own, a I get a couple of crash report per day (all submitted).

I wish I had more detail but I really am not sure where to begin, and the crash report doesn't mean anything to me a I'm not familiar with Firefox's code. Does a crash in js::jit::DoCompareFallback give any clue for way I can narrow down the cause of the crash? I have been unable to find other bug mentioning this, and the number of crash report (aside from me) is limited.


Expected results:

No hanging/stalling/crashing.
