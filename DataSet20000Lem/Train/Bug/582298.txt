If you are at an HTTP addressed page, and that page ha a hyperlink that point to an HTTP address, and if you click on it, and the web server responds with an HTTP 302 redirect to an HTTPS address, the browser redirects just fine. The address read "https://...". However, the favicon/SSL address bar prefix doe not reflect the SSL certificate information. As well, the lock in the status bar render a lock with an "!" on it. The "Verified by" in the certificate information is "Not specified" even though the rest of the certificate information is present. Hitting refresh properly load the SSL certificate "Verified by" information and the favicon and security lock appropriately look secure.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.razoo.com/
2. Click the Login link in the upper-left corner
3. See that the favicon look like the site is insecure and yet the URL is http
4. See that the security lock in the status bar ha an exclamation point on it
5. Click Refresh and see that the favicon and security lock are properly displayed
Actual Results:
The favicon area render a if the site is insecure and yet the URL is https. The security lock in the status bar ha an exclamation point on it and "Verified by" is "Not specified".

Expected Results:
The favicon should have a blue background; the text "razoo.com" should appear next to the favicon. The security lock should not have an exclamation point and the "Verified by" should read "Verisign."

Proper SSL information is displayed in IE, Chrome, and Safari, but not Firefox.
