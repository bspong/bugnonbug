Homepage keep resetting every time I open Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060215 Firefox/3.0.11 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I open firefox I get the following tabs: "Thanks for downloading firefox" "Thanks for downloading Personas" and the Firefox Google homepage.

I do NOT want this! I keep changing the homepage to Gaiaonline.com and the homepage change will work when I hit the home button until I close firefox.

When I open Firefox again, I get the two "thanks for downloading" page and the Firefox Google page all over again!

This error ONLY happens in user accounts, the administrator seems to eb doing fine. There is nothing that would restrict the user from changing the homepage on this computer network.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download the latest version of Firefox over an exisintg copy of firefox
2. Go into a user account
3. Try to change the homepage
4. Close firefox
5. Reopen firefox to see the change didn't take effect.
Actual Results:
I wa greeted by the two "thanks for downloading" page and the default Firefox Google page instead of the custom homepage I set previously.

Expected Results:
I should have seen my chosen homepage instead of the two "thanks for downloading" page and the default Firefox Google page.

I currently am not using a theme, though I have the Groovy Blue persona on. Turning all add-on off did not help. Deleting all Ad-ons did not help.

Add ons: Movie Media PLayer 7, Firefox Personas, Microsfot .Net framework assistant, Java Quick Starter, Foxfilter, Adblock PLus, Adblock Plus Element Hiding Helper.

We are also running Norton Firewall/Antivirus (this error occurs even on Adult settings) and Spybot- Search and Destroy.
