When I browse to a page using a custom protocol handler, the navigation bar display the absolute file path to the chrome url which handle the protocol handler, rather than the proper URI. Refreshing corrects the url in the nav bar, but browsing forward and back brings back the jar:file:/// path.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a protocol handler where the channel redirects to a chrome url
2. browse to protocolname:foo
3. hit back and then forward.

Actual Results:
the address bar show jar:file:///path/to/plugin/uuid/path/to/chromefile

Expected Results:
the address bar will show protocolname:foo

I'm not sure that the way I implemented newChannel is proper, but I'm fairly sure that showing file path to chrome file is not a good idea, and that if refreshing fix the problem that it's a bug!

It's an issue on at least linux and windows, and several version of firefox.

happy to hand my procol handler off, and to help track down the bug.
