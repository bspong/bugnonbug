I scrolled through this URL: https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:nPvWr0Lm-iQJ:www.redhat.com/promo/summit/2008/downloads/pdf/Wednesday_1015am_John_Shakshober_and_Larry_Woodman_Decoding_the_Code.pdf+&hl=de&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgSJ8YIme93hrZGWt5caUKaCqJTFkcKkM1yy4CfyVyABTP-MkYy4Bpjvae4neIJEYyvy6qkLA9yG0F3uTpPI7h7YduOAq3WQI9qde1BtQjMuyxxb4Tre2-L_nFiusjMX7x5--I1&sig=AHIEtbTbm9JLlWrnWEFGkt85kkCSyc3pXQ&pli=1



Actual results:

"Shmem" in /proc/meminfo went through the roof (70 -> 570 MB) and "Cached" too. About:memory doe not reflect this.

Before (in MB):
Cached: 769
Active(file): 205
Inactive(file): 554
SwapFree: 486
Shmem: 77

After (in MB)
Cached: 1278
Active(file): 206
Inactive(file): 560
SwapFree: 486
Shmem: 579

Command for displaying: cat /proc/meminfo|egrep 'SwapFree|Active\(file\)|Inactive\(file\)|Shmem|^Cached|MemFree' | awk '{printf \"%-15s %4d\n\",$1,$2/1024}'



Expected results:

Shmem should stay low especially since it account towards the "Cached" type of memory under Linux. People expect that "Cached" eventually get evicted when memory pressure is high but this is not the case here. Actually this mean just 500 MB more memory consumed by Firefox.
