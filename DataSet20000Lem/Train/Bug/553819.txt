using the following cs the layout doe not display properly in FireFox 3.6 on PowerPC Mac 10.4.11 (no screen shot), and in FireFox on x86 Mac 10.5. (Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; de; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6) (screen shot provided) The problem doe not exist on FireFox 3.6 in Windows7 (screen shot provided), Vista (no screen shot), or XP (screen shot provided), or in Safari (screen shot provided), or Opera (no screen shot) on Mac OS X

CSS:
body {
font: 100% Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
background:#FFFFFF;
margin: 0; /* it's good practice to zero the margin and padding of the body element to account for differing browser default */
padding: 0;
text-align: center; /* this center the container in IE 5* browsers. The text is then set to the left aligned default in the #container selector */
color: #000000;
}

.twoColElsLtHdr #container {
width: 60em; /* this width will create a container that will fit in an 960px browser window if text is left at browser default font size */
background: #FFFFFF;
margin: 0 auto; /* the auto margin (in conjunction with a width) center the page */
border: 1px solid #000000;
text-align: left; /* this override the text-align: center on the body element. */
}

END CSS: this cs is a standard output in Adobe Dreamweaver 9.0 using two column elastic left sidebar, with header and footer. I changed the width from an 800px to a 960px (60em). I have also tried using 960px a the width, which is what I am leaving this a for now (until I hear back from my testers). I have not yet heard back a to whether this "work around" fix the issue, but in any case it is not my desired solution. Once I hear back I will change it back to em so that it may be viewed for the purpose of squashing this bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox in Mac OS X (Tiger or Leopard)
2. Goto http://kclhome.com
Actual Results:
Container Size of page is not reaching the size defined causing the top navigation menu to not properly appear.

Expected Results:
The page should be a seen in FireFox on Windows.

This may be bumped to "Minor" when I hear back if the 960px work around fix the problem.
