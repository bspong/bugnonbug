I have cooky disabled. You need cooky to log in to myspace. When I make an exception to allow myspace.com and nb.myspace.com to set cooky it still doesn't log me in. Well, actually I think it does, but it won't let me click on "home", it just keep taking me back to the main page. If I enabled cooky it work fine. When I view the saved cooky I can't see any other myspace related cooky that I should make exception for. Therefore I reckon it's a bug.

p.s. the advanced tab in preference - the nested tab (general, network, update...) look strange in linux (ubuntu)

thanks!
