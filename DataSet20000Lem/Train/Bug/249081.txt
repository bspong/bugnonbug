Uninstall of Firefox deleted my bookmark (and profile too!)

I just updated to Firefox 0.9.1 today and decided that for once I'd actually
follow the exact instruction for updating. I dutifully closed Firefox and
uninstalled the old Firefox. I imagined this would delete the software, not my
user data but I wa wrong. All of the data from my profile wa removed a well.

The release note specifically state that you should remove the old version of
firefox, amend that to say that you should back up your profile maybe.

Reproducible: Didn't try
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install a version Firefox earlier than 0.9.1, I think I used 0.9
2. create a bookmark, locate the bookmark file it should be in your profile
c:\Documents and Settings\<username>\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\default.<salt>\bookmarks.html
3. uninstall Firefox when it tell you that you have some file left in the
directory do you want to delete them say no (all that wa left were some chrome
files)
4. look for your profile directory and it remove the profile directory.

Actual Results:
I installed Firefox 0.9.1 and got mad when I couldn't find my bookmarks,
configuration data, passwords, etc...

Expected Results:
I would have expected firefox to leave my profile in place and upgrade it a needed.

I'd call this a major bug because there is a lot of state that is lost when you
lose your profile. Maybe my computer just wigged out on me. My coworker smugly
informed me that he never bother to remove the old version of firefox, so he
doesn't have these problems. Heh, thats what I get for actually reading the
release notes!

If 0.9.1's uninstaller doe the right thing then just make sure this doesn't
regress in future releases.
