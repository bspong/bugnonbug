User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:18.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/18.0
Build ID: 20130116073211

Steps to reproduce:

i am doing normal activity when for the last 2 month i get this very annoying interruption:




Actual results:

My 18.0.1 Firefox get me this page http://127.0.0.1:10029/public/dapster_regexs.js every 5-10 minute without any warning ..nothing, just this can happen any time .... sometimes it happens consecutively 2-3 time ...and normally every 5- 10 minutes.
and because the system try to automatically find this webpage using the default search engine it take me to yahoo search engine while it say that it couldnt load the http://127.0.0.1:10029/public/dapster_regexs.js page. Then apart the fact that usually i have lost what i wa doing, i have to press the back button to go back to what i wa doing hopefully!

i have several add-on and plug in installed, i tried the safe mode of firefox and i didnt had any issue so probably the problem lie somewhere there? I dont know how to make a list of the extension and plug in that are installed in my browser!!


Expected results:

this is an interruption so it shouldnt happen
