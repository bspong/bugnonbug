I've marked this major because the "I'm feeling lucky" auto-search is IMHO, a major feature and the current behavior departs from previous version of FF.

See step to reproduce, which should be self-explanatory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pick two word (or more) and type them into the location bar, noting the page you come up with - should be a google search result page or a website;
2. Assign the first word to point to a page *other than* the one you end up at in step 1;
3. Type the two (or more) word into the location bar again.
Actual Results:
You are directed to the bookmarked page.

Expected Results:
In earlier FF version you will still go to the google search result. This is expected because you haven't just typed the keyword, you have typed in something else that just happens to contain the keyword.

The expected result can be gotten by swapping the order of words.
