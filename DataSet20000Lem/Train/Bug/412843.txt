I have a sub-list of bookmark separated by separator that is longer than the window shown in "place organizer". If I want to drag a bookmark up or down I can only do so within the limit of the visible portion of the window in the place organizer. i.e. to move a bookmark from 60th place to 1st place I have to do this in incremental step of 10 (it could be more or le than 10 a the window is vertically scalable)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click Bookmarks
2. select show all bookmark
3. select a folder containing more bookmark than the window hold
4. try dragging one bookmark beyond top or bottom of window
Actual Results:
bookmark will not be dragged higher or lower than those bookmark in the visible portion of the window

Expected Results:
ideally I can drag the bookmark to the place in the list where I want it to be

minor problem but annoying;
Workaround: Drag bookmark a high (or low) a possible. Then scroll window up or down, repeat until bookmark is in desired place.
