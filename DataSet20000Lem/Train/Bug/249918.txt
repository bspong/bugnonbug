If you time it right, when you click a link and then press stop before the new
page loads, the address bar will update to the URL of the new page rather than
reverting to the original URL of the page that is still being displayed and the
verticual scroll bar no longer work for scrolling the original page.

However, the vertical scrollbar doe retain the correct size of it knob (oo-err
misus) from the original page.



Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open an HTML page that is taller than the browser window so it ha a vertical
scrollbar and contains at least one hyperlink.

2. Click on a link in the page.

3. Before the new page loads, press stop so the original page is still visible.


Actual Results:
If timed correctly the URL in the address bar will have changed to that of the
new page whose loading wa aborted by the stop button and the favicon for the
new site displayed before it.

Also although the original page is still displayed the vertical scroll bar
cannot be moved with the mouse - it will not accept focus. Hyperlinks in the
original page do still work.

Expected Results:
1. Either reverted to the original URL in the address bar when stop wa pressed
or displayed a blank page rather than the original content.

2. If the original content wa still displayed, the scrollbar should still work.
