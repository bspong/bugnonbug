I just upgraded from FF2.0x to FF3rc1 on WinXPsp2, and I am now unable to log into my Singapore-based banking websites.

Bank 1: United Overseas Bank
(http://www.uobgroup.com/pages/personalinternetbanking.html)
(https://uniservices3.uobgroup.com/CLO/Pub_ControllerServlet?cmd=customerlogin&action=clologin)

Bank 2: Citibank Singapore
(https://www.citibank.com.sg/SGGCB/JSO/signon/DisplayCinSignon.do)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Access one of the two URLs.
http://www.uobgroup.com/pages/personalinternetbanking.html
https://www.citibank.com.sg/SGGCB/JSO/signon/DisplayCinSignon.do

2. For the Citibank site, test with any random 16-digits and PIN number, then click Login.
Actual Results:
1. For the UOB site, the password field is now greyed out and I am unable to key in my password.

2. For the Citibank site:
- A popup appears when site is accessed with FF3rc1: "An applet is required to access Citibank Online service did not load correctly in your browser. Click the OK button to find out how to set your browser setting to access Citibank Online."
- On clicking OK, page redirects to: https://www.citibank.com.sg/SGGCB/JSO/signon/AppletError.do. This page state that:
A java applet required to Login wa not loaded in your browser. Any of the following might be the problem:
1. You are using an unsupported or old browser version
2. Your java setting have been disabled on your browser
3. A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is not installed on your computer
4. Login via a corporate network or LAN:

Expected Results:
I should be able to login to both sites. FF2.0x ha no problem with either site.

I suspect that it is a Java-related problem from the description given by Citibank. However, Java and Javascript are both enabled on my broswer.

Testing my Java installation at http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml show me that I have a working installation of Sun's Java 6 Update 5.
