Among all the way that Firefox freezes, and they are many, I've discovered it
also hang when you are attempting to post on a message board, such a the one
noted above. All I wa doing wa reading a post, then tried to move to another
and Firefox froze. Most of my experience with Firefox freezing ha to do with
either Flashgot downloads, or when the Mac sleeps, or if there is no activity
for a period of time, but now I'm seeing a freeze under a more active scenario.
Also, Firefox froze yesterday after only about 10 minute of idle time, which
is much quicker than usual.

I've seen the huge number of post of Firefox freezes, PC a well a Mac, and
this really ha to get fixed, a it is absolutely ruining the user experience of
this otherwise lovely browser. Firefox ha frozen under some condition since
version 1.0, my first experience with it, but it is getting worse, not better.

1.Read post on Message Board
