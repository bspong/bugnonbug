When keychain password is requested, new tab and copy/paste don't work (grayed out) until switching apps

Barely related to bug 425852. When a window come up asking for a keychain password (which is an OS based window, not a Firefox based window, like UAC is for Vista), I can't do a new tab either by keyboard shortcut or the File menu. I also can't copy paste (same thing). It's grayed out in the menus.

Switching to any other app, and back to Firefox, fix this. Not sure why, wild guess: firefox doesn't know it ha focus back? Note: I can visit websites, type, etc just fine. I just can't open a new tab (I can switch tabs, but this doe not do the same thing a switching apps and doesn't reset the new tab option) or copy paste.

This ha been going on in trunk for a couple days, but I haven't used it that long and only started noticing it after following the instruction to fix the (non-mozilla) problem in bug 425852.

(this also happens after I run the update and Minefield need permission to access the keychain a Minefield ha changed, so it's not directly a 1passwd issue)

Setting UNCO, suggested method to repro:
1) Install 1passwd (unless you know of a better way to get a password dialog to popup for the keychain)
2) Let it import all your firefox password into the keychain (don't worry, it won't delete them!)
3) Turn off autofill of password
4) Use the 1passwd icon in your toolbar to 'restore form' on a site that requires login, e.g. bugzilla
5) Type in your keychain password (separate password for the 1passwd keychain)
6) Hit OK, and try to open a new tab
7) Notice a grayed out option to make a new tab
