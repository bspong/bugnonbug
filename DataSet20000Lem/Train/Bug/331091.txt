I just untarred the firefox 2 alpha 1, and after starting it up with my old profile (from 1.5), it hang for a while, before giving a "script is running slow" message.

The script triggering this is apparently trying to find the searchengines availaible in my profile, but finding none.

Trying the searchbox in the top give me the same results, (since there are no search engine installed)

Shouldn't we either show the user a "install your favorite search engine" option, or remove the search box from the top all together if there are no engine installed? (this will allow sys-admins to just clean out the search-engine folder without crashing the fox on their client pc's.

Or we could just search on the local page, if there are no search engine installed. like with crtl-F

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.untar firefox 2.0 aplha 1
2.start
3.notice severe slowdown, and slow script message
4.notice that there are no searchengines available
5.try a search
6.notice severe slowdown, and slow script message
7.notice there's no message allowing u to install a searchengine.
Actual Results:
firefox slows down, and afther allowing me to cancel the search script, it obviously doesn't search (anywere)

Expected Results:
search the local page,
or let me know there are no engine installed, and let me pick from a list to install.
Or remove the box from the top altogether disabling me to even try a search.
