the content of the div element inside the mini tab inside the page is rendered at the end of the width of all the tabs.
tried to spider the page and host it on localhost, it is rendered fine a expected.
tried to open using firefox3 on windows, rendered a expected, the text is rendered inside the tab.
tried to open using safari and opera, work fine a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. using ff3 on macosx, go to https://invest.etrade.com.au/AboutUs/Default.aspx
2. you will see that the text is rendered way too much to the right.
3. compare with safari, opera, or ff3 on windows, or safe the page and display it from a file or localhost.
Actual Results:
the text content beginning with "Invest with convenience and control." is displayed at the end right of the screen, aligned to the last tab that say "important information"

Expected Results:
the text should be displayed inside the div box aligned to the tab "Why Us".
like how it is rendered using ff3 on windows, safari, or opera

the cs element of that tab is .miniTab, I have tried to spider the page and host it locally at localhost, but it wa displayed normally.
this only happens if it is viewed directly from the etrade server.
i could not pinpoint exactly where is the problem causing this, since firefox3 on window displayed the page properly
