Firefox credit dialog get wrong encoding for West European letters, when Russian language is default for WinXP
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.8

Instead of Latin small letter e with acute (Unicode 00E9h, a in "Andre
Dahlqvist" in "Special Thanks" section of Help --> About Mozilla Firefox -->
Credits), my just downloaded copy of Firefox (see build ID above) always show
Cyrillic small letter Short I (Unicode 0439h).

System is WinXP, with Russian langpack installed.

I guess the problem ha something to do with the fact that both letter share the
same single-byte space (Latin small letter e with acute ha some single-byte
code in Western ISO-8859-1 codepage, and that code is equal to Cyrillic small
letter Short I's single-byte code in Windows-1251 codepage).

The problem is reproducible even when View --> Character Encoding is set to
Western (ISO-8859-1).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a copy of WinXP SP1, install Russian langpack on it, make Cyrillic the
default alphabet.
2. Install a fresh copy of Firefox 0.9.2.
3. Open Help menu.
4. Choose About Mozilla Firefox menuitem.
5. Click on Credits button.
6. Wait for "Andre Dahlqvist" and (or) "Sebastian Delahaye"
Actual Results:
Cyrillic small letter "short I" is where Latin small letter "e with acute"
should be.

Expected Results:
Mozilla Firefox should have displayed a correct Western glyph.

This is a misspelled word --> setting Severity to Trivial.
