In the page attt http://www.truetension.com, firefox cannot load the embedded
jpg image and concomitant to this problem, the hard disk churn for a very long
time. Eventually, the web page finish loading, but then whenever one press
a key, firefox recommences attempting to load the jpg image again. Problem is
iterative, thus, Firefoxe application is no longer usable and must be shut down.

Problem doe not appear in Win2000 or WinXP. Failure occurs in two different
machine running Win98se.

Perhaps there is a problem in the interface between firefox and Win98's jpg
rendering API.???

Note, the offensive web page is using a very large jpg file (346 kb) and the
browser/OS is to resize this image down to fit the appropriate desktop resolution.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load Firefox 1.04 onto Win98se
2.go to www.truetension.com
3.cannot load image and firefox cannot be used

Actual Results:
image fails to load (render) and firefox is henceforth unusable, hung, she no
workie ne more.

Expected Results:
rendered the jpg to the scale appropriate for the resolution of the desketop gui
environment.
