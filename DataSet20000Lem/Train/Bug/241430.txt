seporate config and other file :: profile preference folder ha mixed personal, and configuration data
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux; X11; i686; en_US) (KHTML, like Gecko)
Build Identifier: any firefox, and I guess mozilla might have similar profile management

I just want to have a directory that contains world readable config
information about my browser, and one that is private

~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/shareableconfig
and
~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/confidentail
~/firefox/profiles/Default/ao;fsdkasg/conditionallyshared/bookmarks.htm

or something like that... I want to just be able to copy a user "layout"
directory and have it be the default one for the system.
I don't want to have to try every file combination to find the minimal set
that contains the browser/toolbar layout, the extentions I want, a default set
of bookmarks... all without having an accidental copying of my password
database.


I spent about a week trying to figure out how to apply my firefox setting to
everyone on my computer.

It wasn't that hard, except for not knowing what preference file to copy, and
what one contain, say my cooky or some sort of cache..

I wanted to have my exact layout copied for all of my users. I went through a
lot of ~/.firefox directory and Application Data/Firefox directories,
because I had to copy systematically my config file in different combination
to the defaults/profile/US folder, then start a browser, and have it not work,
then try again by deleting the firefoxconfig directory, copying another config
file over to the default folder, (oh there wa an su in there too, or a switch
to a different xterm) and then trying again.
