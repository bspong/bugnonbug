At this website I play game and can chat at the same time... I used it on my
sister's mac (with Firefox) and it worked splendedly... but then I used it on my
lappie with XP Pro and I am not able to chat. I am able to at first, but then I
try and click back to the chat and I am not able to enter text. I get a warning
beep isntead... site I have tried most is the Word game Flip Words.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.grab.com
2. game -> word -> flip word -> play now -> play now
3. create a word choosing the bubbles, repeat once or twice
4. Try to chat...

Actual Results:
For starter the arrow should change to the little word-typing cursor thing with
the line and the two line around it looking like an I. Mainly, though, I can't
type. It just "dun"s at me.

Expected Results:
I should be able to chat.

It's not real major, but since I love that site it ha caused me to have to keep
exlorer around... I had to remake a shortcut and I'm thinking about just using
it instead of Firefox since a lot of other Flash progams don't work well with this.
