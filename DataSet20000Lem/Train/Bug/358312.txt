Fresh install of firefox 2.0 on Mac OS 10.4.8.
3 time now, within the first 3 hour of having firefox 2.0 installed, I have been unable to click in the address bar and type in a new URL.
All 3 instance have occurred when the webpage I wa on wa google search results. Also, these seem to have occurred when returning focus to Firefox after using another application (typically an IM client like Yahoo).

The only way I have found to regain keyboard functionality is to close the current firefox 2.0 window (not the application completely), and open a new window. At that point I can enter url's in the address bar again.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox to browse websites...multiple tab open
2. Start using other application
3. Switch back to firefox
4. Attempt to enter a new URL in address bar...and hope it works.

Actual Results:
Most times, I can enter a new URL over the old one just fine. So far, 3 time now, I've been unable to type in a new url, and cannot erase the old one with the delete key either.

Expected Results:
Should be able to click in address bar and type in new URL.

This seems to be represented in a different bug listing for minefield 3.0a1, for the macintosh. The reason I've opened a bug listing here is because Firefox 2.0 is a final release, and a different product than minefield, though they're both browsers.
