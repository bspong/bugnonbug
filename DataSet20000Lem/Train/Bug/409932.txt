There are many problem with the current permission window. Many of them are listed on the following page.

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=334363

To summarize a few of the issues:
1. It is not currently possible to click on an item in the permission tree and then click a button to change it's capability. At the moment user have to manually type the domain name in the url box and then click the Allow/Session/Block button to change it.
2. The url box need to be changed to accept only domain names. Perhaps changing the description and url box label would help by indicating to the user that they should enter only the domain name and not the full url. The code used to parse the url for a domain name need to be changed a well since it doe not always retrieve a valid host name.
3. The rawHost property need to be scrapped and the host need to be displayed exactly a they appear in the permissions.sqlite file.
4. There is currently no observer for 'cleared' notification
5. There is currently no observer for 'deleted' notification which can cause problem for user who are using an extension UI to manage the permissions.
6. There is currently no way to add a cookie permission for a file:/// url from the permissions.xul window. Although since the scheme:file feature ha been removed from the latest trunk this probably need to be filed a a separate bug.
