The site http://kgs.gosquares.net/ doe not work correctly in Firefox. When viewed in Firefox, the site is unusable and I must load it in Internet Explorer. The easiest way to see what I mean would be to load the following URL in Firefox, and then open Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, or just about any other web browser, and load the same page:

http://kgs.gosquares.net/index.rhtml.en?id=KneeJerk&id2=&ty=2009&tm=3

In Firefox, the calendar will be empty with no mention of Wins or Losses (W#:L#). In other browsers, all day on which a game wa played will be annotated in the calendar. Below the calendar a list of recent game should be displayed. Clicking on the name of an opponent should list all game played against that person along with the result of those games. None of this happens in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Point Firefox to http://kgs.gosquares.net/index.rhtml.en?id=KneeJerk&id2=&ty=2009&tm=3
2. Point Internet Explorer to the same URL.
3. Note the differences. IE is handling this web page correctly while Firefox doe not.
Actual Results:
See "Details".

Expected Results:
See "Details".

Whatever is responsible for this problem also seems to affect a lot of other web sites. I believe that solving this problem with this site will likely fix similar problem across a broad spectrum of web sites.
