When FireFox asks to update Add-Ons on startup, it loses "session" information (i.e., "Restore Windows and Tabs From Last Time"). This appears to occur even if you do not choose to install the update when asked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open FireFox when there is an extension update, and you have a previously saved session.
2. Either install or cancel the update.
3. Your previous session will be lost.




As a note - I am marking this a Critical, because (as a heavy user of the former SessionSaver extension) I tend to keep my "top of mind" tab always open in a few windows. Losing these tab is very disruptive, since they can be very difficult to reproduce (it's hard to find them in the browser history, since they could be several day old, or older).

(As a note - one thing that Session Saver had that wa *exceptionally* useful wa an ability to restore the last couple of session even if SessionSaver itself didn't restore it on startup. It would be great if that wa eventually made available - either a an extension of the built-in functionality, or a an add-on.)
