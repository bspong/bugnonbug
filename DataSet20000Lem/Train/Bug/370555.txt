This is a minor issue, but the behavior exhibited by FF is counterintuitive and may help phishers, so I thought it's worth addressing.

It is possible for a script placed on a webpage to open "about:blank" window. This will open a new window with an empty URL bar. The script can then modify the displayed document, and certain method for doing this will automatically set the URL bar to the address of the page that created the window (for example, wnd.document.write() will do just that). This is fairly intuitive and informs the user about the origin of the displayed code.

Should we choose to modify the default layout of "about:blank" through the use of createElement / createTextNode / appendChild on wnd.document.body, the URL bar remains blank, however.

As a result, it is possible for the attacker to replace the current window with a fully-functional HTML document displayed in a window with blank URL bar, that is otherwise impossible to identify (no useful data in 'properties' dialog, disabled 'reload' button).

When used for phishing, this would quite certainly improve the odds against a casual user, and can be used to spoof various browser message and prompt without exposing a suspiciously-looking site address (or data: URL scheme).

I haven't tested it, but I guess it also make the life of a phishing detection functionality a bit harder.
