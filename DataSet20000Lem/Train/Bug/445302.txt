If the visited and unvisited bookmark frecency score preference are set to zero after visiting a bookmarked URL and history is cleared, the frecency score for those bookmark visited are not set to zero and thus still appear in the location bar dropdown completion list. Effectively the change in preference for bookmark frecency scoring should place the value at zero and effectively remove all location bar dropdown completion history.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit one or more bookmarks.
2.Set the value of places.frecency.bookmarkVisitBonus and places.frecency.unvisitedBookmarkBonus to zero via about:config.
3.Clear history.
4.Type any character that occurs in the URL or page title of the previously visited bookmark. Alternatively or additionally, open places.sqlite and observe the value of the bookmark frecency score.
Actual Results:
Entries for bookmark visited appear in location bar dropdown completion list. Frecency score in places.sqlite for previously visited bookmark is not reset to zero.

Expected Results:
No entry appear in location bar dropdown completion list. Frecency score in places.sqlite for previously visited bookmark is reset to zero.

All other item from history previously expected to be cleared based on Firefox 3 behavior are so when history is cleared in Firefox 3. The item act a if the URLs were typed in, instead of visited via any other means. I used the bookmark menu to reproduce this, so that I did not enter any information into the location bar to invoke bookmark result with the frecency scoring for bookmark enabled. Despite the value of places.frecency.linkVisitBonus not being zero, item in places.sqlite created via the respective mean were cleared when history wa cleared. This add to the apparent inconsistency of behavior. This effectively mean that 'Clear Private Data' is not respected, and thus the expectation of the named action's result is not completed.
