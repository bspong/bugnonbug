Recent update have introduced a major slow down to viewing such a page.

Admittedly there are a lot of radio button on this page.
However, prior to recent update this type of page rendered very fast.
Safari, IE8, and Chrome continue to render this page fast.

However, firefox now ha major fit and starts, burp and belch when viewing this page. This demonstrated by clicking on one of the options.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View the page -- there will be a new and unusual slow down at this point.
2. Click on a different radio button -- there will be a new and unusual slow down
3. Try to use scroll thumb. This will demonstrate the slow down.
Actual Results:
I think the result is most easily reproduced by making a form with a bunch of radio buttons.

Expected Results:
The page ha rendered quite fast with previous version of firefox.

The bug is devastating to me and my users.
However, I don't know how many folk in the world use this many radio buttons.
So maybe not a major bug.
But, it could be that this page ha uncovered a previously unseen memory leak or weirdness in handling the group entity.
