Mouse 3 (middle mouse) randomly stoped working. No longer open bookmark in new tab.

I know it worked before because I use mouse 3 all the time to open bookmark in a new tab. I opened my bookmark manager and move a few thing around, and added a separator. After I closed the bookmark manager, I then went to the bookmark list and tried to open a bookmark with mouse3, and nothing happened. The mouse just kept hovering over the bookmark. The other hotkey still work (ctrl+ leftclick) but I haven't been able to fix this mouse3 problem.

I tried closing and restarting firefox but nothing seemed to fix it.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try using mouse3 to open bookmark in new tab.
2. Use the bookmark manager to edit bookmarks. Move some thing around or add/remove separator
3. Try using mouse3 in a bookmark immediately afterwards.


Expected Results:
Well normally I should be able to use mouse3 and open any bookmark in a new tab.

Don't know if this will help, but I recently installed the Stumble-Upon Add-on. I am using the BlackX Theme.
