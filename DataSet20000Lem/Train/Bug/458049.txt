Adding a scripted builder.refresh() to the listbox in the example at the attached URL cause an exception to be thrown. This is the simplest example I could prepare that produce this bug, but it is affected a more complex, nested tree that I am trying to create via XML template too. The tree creates fine, and populates from the remote XML datasource fine also... but only when initially loaded. Attempting to refresh the data with builder.refresh() result in the exception.

Using RDF instead of XML template happily work with builder.refresh().

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
var el = document.getElementById("people_listbox");
el.builder.refresh();
Actual Results:
Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIXULTemplateBuilder.refresh]" nsresult: "0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE)" location: "JS frame :: http://localhost:8000/static/people.xul :: refreshSrc :: line 12" data: no]

Expected Results:
That a request to the server wa made, and the listbox wa refreshed.
