The basic idea of tab grouping ha been invented and re-invented a hundred times. Examples include:

* Tabgroups-Plus (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9187)
* TabGroups Manager (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10254)
* Tab Groups (http://paranoid-androids.com/tabgroups/index.htm)
* ... and various other theoretical idea during the recent Mozilla Labs Design Challenge (http://design-challenge.mozilla.com/summer09/index.html)

Due to the complexity of the feature, existing extension lack stability and completeness. Since many user could benefit from such functionality, I thought that it may be best to build this into Firefox itself (hence the RFE).

The idea is to keep it a simple and out-of-the-way a possible.

The term "workspaces" is used by the OmniWeb browser (http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb/), and it use would allow the "group" term to be reserved for use in grouping tab by domain, origin, etc. within a workspace.

The following is a list of some of the behaviour and UI feature that could/should be supported. (See the attached mockups first.)

- The Workspaces Bar should be hidden by default to avoid UI clutter and user confusion (can be shown using the "Show Workspaces Bar" option in the Workspaces Menu, by using the View -> Toolbars menu, or by using a keyboard shortcut).

- The Workspaces Bar is used for the management of workspaces, but may often be closed to increase the user's screen real estate. The Workspaces Menu would then be used due to it compactness.

- Workspaces can be re-ordered in the Workspaces Bar using drag & drop (the same way tab are re-ordered).

- Tabs (as well a links) can be dragged & dropped onto existing workspace buttons.

- Workspaces should be persisted across session (session restore, etc.).

- It should be possible to prioritize the loading of the current workspace when restoring a session/starting Firefox. Other workspace could load slowly in the background and get priority when selected (or not load until the workspace is opened [pref.]). Individual tab should be loaded using strategy similar to the one described in bug #496458.

- Right clicking a workspace button should show a menu with the following options: New Workspace, Reload All Tabs in Workspace, Bookmark All Tabs in Workspace, Rename Workspace, Save Workspace, Close Workspace.

- "Move To -> {list of workspaces} + New Workspace" should be added to the right-click menu of tabs.

- "Open Link in Workspace -> {list of workspaces} + New Workspace" should be added to the right-click menu of links.

- Preference should dictate in which workspace to load external link (currently selected or default workspace).

- "List all tabs" drop down menu on the right of the tab bar should show all tab in the currently selected workspace. (Tooltip could be changed to "List all tab in workspace")

- Preference should dictate if a tab overview page or the currently selected tab in a workspace should be displayed when a workspace is opened.

- Prefs to show number of tab in workspace next to the workspace name (one pref. for bar, one for menu). Number of tab will show in the tooltip regardless.

- Pref. to keep workspace open when it contains no tabs.

While this may be similar to bug #453984, I feel that this ha a larger scope and includes a lot more detail.

The detail above are somewhat unstructured, however if this bug receives attention, I will organise thing on request.

Reproducible: Always
