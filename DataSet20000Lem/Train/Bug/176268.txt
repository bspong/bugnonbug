When you go to customize toolbars and have your bookmark toolbar filled with
item overflowing (showing the overflow arrows), and you click done on the
customization screen, you loose the overflow arrow and wind up with one of your
bookmark half off the screen. After, if you minimize the screen and then
Maximize it the overflow arrow come back and the bookmark toolbar is fine
(takes a second or two), or you can also add another bookmark to get them to
come back.

Actual Results:

minimize/mazimize screen or add another toolbar to get them back.
