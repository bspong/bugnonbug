Hi, I have a ruby on rail app that generates a link with an anchor(http://localhost:3000/photos?thumb_page=3#thumbanchor) in FF when the user click on the up or down arrow which generates the above link the page is refreshed and the user is sent to the top of the page instead of the anchor location. In IE 6 it work a expected and actually if I go into the address bar in FF of the url generated and press enter it will bring me to the correct anchored location. For some reason it doe not do it when first generated. This ha been a frustrated issue and any guidance would be appreciated.
