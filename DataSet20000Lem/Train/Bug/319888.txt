List of result a normal search provide.

Turned network monitoring on and see no increase in activity, only a breif spike when submitting search. Other special searches, intitle:, allintitle, do not return error page.

This is a feature I would guess is not widely used, but I believe it is worth fixing in case other problem are related.
