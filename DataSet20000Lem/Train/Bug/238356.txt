(maybe this relates only to web page with flash)

I have some bookmark menu on the 'Personal Toolbar' that are folder with many
bookmark in them.

If I view the above URL, then click on one of the bookmark folders, I notice
that a sound is played a I move the pointer up and down the bookmarks. This
only happens when the pointer is over part of the web page that would make this
noise, ie when it is over the small 'window' just below the login 'window' on
the top left hand side of the web page.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.make a bookmark folder on your personal toolbar that ha a large number of
bookmark in it, such that, when you open the folder, the selection menu drop
down over a large portion of the web page.
2.view the above web page in the browser
3.notice that, a you move the pointer over the text "profile", "Pucca's Room",
and "News", a "Pucca Icon" appears, and a sound plays.
4.if you now open the bookmark folder that you have carefully positioned to drop
down over that window, the same thing happen a if there wa no bookmark menu
wa there.

Actual Results:
thing happen on the web page depending on the position of the pointer, when the
bookmark menu is selected
