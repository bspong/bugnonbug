Toolbar customization reverts to default when closing window in Firefox 4.0b1 and 4.0b2pre, when Firefox Sync 1.4.1 and/or Aza Raskin's TabCandy installed and enabled.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; fr; rv:2.0b2pre) Gecko/20100719 Minefield/4.0b2pre
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; fr; rv:2.0b2pre) Gecko/20100719 Minefield/4.0b2pre

Everytime I close a window, toolbar customization is 'lost' (i.e resetted to default customization).
My customization consists in removing the search bar and adding the activity indicator at the right of the awesome/address bar.

I have to do this for all newly opened window because this customization is resetted to default *EACH TIME* I close a window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right-click somewhere in between address bar and search bar, and choose "Customize..." in the pop-up menu.
2. Perform some customizations by dragging-and-dropping element to add them to or remove them from the existing toolbars.
3. Close the window in which customization wa performed.
4. Open a new window.
Actual Results:
When the new window opens, toolbar customization is reset to defaults.

Expected Results:
Toolbar customization persists.

If you restart Firefox, with no surprise (because a restart close the current window and open a new one), this bug happens too.


This happens in every nightly build I used since the first release of Firefox 4.0b2pre and ALSO happens in the "official" Firefox 4.0b1 release, both on my iMac and on my MacBook, both running the same operating system (Mac OS X 10.6.4).


Though disabling or even uninstalling all add-on doe not solve the problem, which let me think that this bug is not related to any add-on I use, I give you below the list of add-on I have installed :

(add-ons marked with *** are disabled because not compatible with my current version of Firefox, but left installed in my current config)
