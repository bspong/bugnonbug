I've had this problem in Firefox 3.0, but the problem is still there in 3.1 beta 1.

When Firefox is used for an extended period of time, (usually more than 10 minutes) Firefox will start to display page in correctly, showing just text, and omitting all formatting and picture files.

Refresh doe not clear up the problem.

Attempting to go to another website is unsuccessful, Firefox simply stop responding to command and will not connect to another website.

Firefox will then not shut down and Force Quit must be used.

When Firefox restarts, it operates a normal, but once again, if it is being used for more than ten minutes, the same problem reoccurs in the same way.

The duration from start up to issue varies, but 10 minute (an extended period) is a good estimate.
