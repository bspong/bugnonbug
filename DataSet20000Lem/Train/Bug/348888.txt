I tried this using all type of image (gif, jpeg, bmp). Say you have an image in a window, and the image can be scaled (larger than window). If you expand it, (ie the - magnifying mouse cursor is showing), then maximize the window, so the entire image show (ie can no longer be scaled). The mouse cursor will remain the - magnifying glass until the page is either refreshed, or you go to another page

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open an image that can be scaled, but when window is maximized, cannot be scaled
2. make the image full size while the window is still small
3. maximize the window

Actual Results:
4. the - magnifying glass cursor remains, even though you can no longer scale the image

Expected Results:
Gone to a normal mouse cursor

I know this is minor, but a bug nonetheless. This wa found using firefox with no extensions, or theme modification
