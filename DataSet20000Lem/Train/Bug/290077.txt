mailto entered in location bar is handled incorrectly
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

To clarify:
Open new window or tab (ctrl-n). Enter location bar (ctrl-l). Type this:

mailto:some.user@gmail.com

(press enter)

A yes/no dialog will appear:
-----
Confirm
[i] You are about to log into the site "gmail.com" with the username "mailto,"
but the web site doe not require authentication. This may be an attempt to
trick you.

Is "gmail.com" the site you want to visit?
[Yes] [No]
-----

This behavior is wrong of course. What I would expect is this protocol to be
handled by launching whatever is assigned for mailto:.

Another fun variation of this behavior is entering something that Firefox
doesn't parse a a login/password like:

mailto:another-user-at-the-localhost

This won't present a dialog at all, it will instead translate this into
"keyword:mailto:another-user-at-the-localhost" and handle it a a keyword:.

I don't know if this will make a difference: I have the gmail notifier set a my
mailto: handler. MSIE will handle the same process by launching Firefox (via
gmail notifier) and then loading the following url in a new Firefox tab:

http://gmail.google.com/gmail?view=cm&fs=1&tearoff=1&to=someaddress@somehost.com&fs=1



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press control-N
2. Press control-L
3. type, "mailto:someone@somehost.com". Press enter.

Actual Results:
Dialog described above appears.

Expected Results:
mailto: handler should be launched with the remainder of the URI parsed or
passed to that handler. In the case of gmail notifier, a new tab should open
with the url
http://gmail.google.com/gmail?view=cm&fs=1&tearoff=1&to=someone@somehost.com&fs=1
loaded.

I marked this 'major' because the behavior is completely wrong for something
that is the core purpose of a browser, i.e., to properly handle URIs, regardless
of whether they are typed in the location bar, or activated from a web page.
