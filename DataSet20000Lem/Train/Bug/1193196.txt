Setting Firefox a default on Windows 10 can sometimes open a window dialog instead of the default app.
In Bug 1175293 we added the ability to set Firefox a the default browser via UITour. We then built a welcome page for Win10 user in Bug 1186485, which make it easier for the user to set Firefox a their default browser.

When clicking the "Let's do it" CTA button on the welcome page, one of two thing happens:

a.) Firefox is set a the default browser in a single click, if possible.
b.) Firefox open the Win10 default setting app, where the user can set Firefox a the default browser themselves.

During QA we noted that a third scenario can also sometimes occur:

Clicking the "Let's do it" button brings up a Windows message "To change your default apps, go to Settings > System > Default apps [OK]", instead of going to the system file. [1]

I'm not clear on when this scenario happens or it's already a known issue, however I felt we should still open a bug for this. Given the copy on the page I think this can add to some confusion for users.

Both myself and rbillings have seen this message occur. It definitely occurs sometimes for a), not sure about b).
