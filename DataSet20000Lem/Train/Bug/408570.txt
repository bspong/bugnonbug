My work email can be accessed at home using Microsoft Outlook Web Access. When done reading email do NOT click on the "Log Off" button in Microsoft Outlook Web Access. Restarting Firefox (a new session)will crash Firefox independent of any user input, URL or activity. It take some time for the new session of Firefox to crash but it consistently crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a site using Microsoft Outlook Web Access
2. Exit using the "Log Off" button in Outlook Web Access
3. Firefox will close.
4. Reopen Firefox
5. After browsing awhile, Firefox will crash.
Actual Results:
Firefox crash unexpectedly independent of URL, user input or any activity at all. Both the Mozilla bug report window pop up and the Microsoft error reporting window.

Expected Results:
Crash is undesired.

The crash can be avoided simply by not using the "Log Off" button. Closing the browser window is safe. Firefox will not crash in the next session if the previous session is simply closed.
