In previous version of Firefox, clicking a link in a Mail (OSX) message opened a new tab in the front-most window, and brought focus to the new tab. Command-clicking on the link opened a new tab, while keeping focus in the Mail application. In 3.5, either event cause the front-most tab to be over-written with the new page, though the change in focus remains consistent with previous versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From OSX Mail (I've not tested with any other mail app), click a link
2. In previous version of Firefox, a new tab will open with the new page
3. In Firefox 3.5, the front-most tab will be over-written with the new page
Actual Results:
See above

Expected Results:

This isn't a major bug, but is very annoying. When an email message contains several links, I now have to open a tab, click a link, open apother tab, click a link, &c. I consider it a significant loss of functionality.
