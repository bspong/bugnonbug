This is a feature request.

I would very much like something like restorable session added to firefox. I've been using the private browsing feature when visiting my banking website and such and the thought occurred to me it would be nice if I could break my use of the browser up into session based on what I'm doing.

Currently if I wanted to I could kind of emulate this manually by dropping all open tab into bookmark folder and then reopening the folder full of bookmark later. That doesn't quite do it for me though.

Basically what I would like to be able to do is say have one session for work stuff where I have all my tab and window open. Then at the end of the day I close that session and open up my news reading session where I read all the news for the day. After that I could close that session and open up a session for use while gaming and such. What would really be great is if it could just remember window state and open tabs.

I could easily use something like this on a daily basis for all the thing I do regularly and for special side projects. My nightmare is coming back to a crashed computer where I had 50 tab open in three window working on a project. The history is nice, but you'll never get it back to how it was.

Reproducible: Always
