When I launch Firefox 3 the back button is greyed out no matter how many page I visit, the bookmark menu is empty, I can't create new bookmarks, and I can't import bookmarks.

I get the following error in the error console on launch:

Error: [Exception...

I also see a 'places.sqlite-*.corrupt' file created (or maybe more than one) for every page I visit. It keep on creating these file every time I browse to a new page.

I have multiple account on my Mac and other account do not have this problem. I have used sqlite for some development project so I wondered if that could be the problem. I tried unsetting all shell environment variable but the problem persisted. I tried changing shell back to the OSX default bash (rather than tcsh which I usually use), but the problem wa still there. One of the account that is ok us tcsh anyway so this doesn't seem to be the cause.

I also tried removing the Firefox profile completely (I deleted ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox) and restarting. It asked me if wanted to import from Safari etc, I said no, and it started up with a tiny window in the top left of the screen - and the problem with history and bookmark persisted.

I tried copying the Firefox profile from another working account on the Mac, but the problem still persisted!

I also have a laptop with OSX and my account on there ha the exact same problem. i.e. this problem affect multiple machines.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox 3
2. History and bookmark do not work/are greyed out
3. Browse to any page, new file called places.sqlite-1.corrupt created every time


Expected Results:
Bookmarks and history should work
