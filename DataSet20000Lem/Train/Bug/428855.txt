When using the Firefox app and choosing to hide it, the window(s) disappear. If I then move the cursor or click on another window on the screen, the Firefox window(s) reappear but a if in the background. The menu do not change to Firefox menus, but remain a with the app that wa next in line to be brought to the foreground. If I then click on the Firefox window and choose again to hide, it will hide properly and not reappear. Although most likely unrelated, immediately after the upgrade to 3.0b5 (as done automatically by the Firefox app), first the forward/back button reproduced four extra copy with all five forward/back button working and in any order. Then, on occasion the menu would be lost with only the Firefox menu available (ie, no File, Edit, etc), but these would come back eventually. These latter two problem no longer exist. I am guessing that I really need to completely re-install Firefox, but if this is a bug it is worth mentioning.
