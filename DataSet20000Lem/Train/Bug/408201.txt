I exit firefox to do other request and try to restart and get the message that firefox is still running after a cancellion request... I cannot restart unless I go to the task manager and cancel firefox a second time after the first cancel request!!! Now sometimes this requires a reboot of this system ( 3 gig cpu, full memory and current xp update and software and latest firefox.. won't use the latest becasue of other problems) I use dual boot xp or vista and have turn off the vista hd to find problem..
Not this system - your system is not existing memory properly after disconnect
