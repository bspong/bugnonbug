When multiple tab are open in FF3.5RC2 (so that left and right navigation button are visible on the tab bar), closing some tab in the middle *sometimes* result in an incorrect alignment of the last tab. It ha happened twice today, and I haven't been able to pin down the exact STR. I will post another comment If I do. Please see attached screen shot for what I mean.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open multiple tabs, so that left and right nav tab navigation button are visible
2. Close some tab (those in the middle), such that both left and right nav button are presently active, meaning you're exactly in the middle of the opened tabs. (Not sure if this is required, but this is how I came across it)
3. The last tab should be aligned with the right navigation button but is instead next to an empty space
Actual Results:
An empty space (equal to a tab) is seen with the right navigation button, followed by the last tab

Expected Results:
There should be no empty space and the last tab should be aligned with the navigation button
