Linux version of firefox [and mozilla] render page incorrectly work a it should with window build of Firefox.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1

When I go to any of the article like this one
http://ps2.ign.com/articles/562/562512p1.html on IGN the add towards the mid
left of the screen doe not render properly. It end up covering up part of the
text of the article in the shape of what the add look like when it expands, and
when I hover the mouse over it the add expands a it should but doe not retract
afterwards a it should. This same behavior is also exhibited in Mozilla 1.7.3.
The page render perfectly when I use firefox on window [I would assume mozilla
would also render the ad properly on window a well; but I haven't installed
Mozilla on window so I am unsure of it's behavior.] the version of Firefox I
use under both window and Linux are the same (rc1) so I am pretty sure it isn't
an OS or site issue.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to ign.com
2. Go to [apparently] any article which contains this ad at the left.
3.

Actual Results:

mouse hover, ad will then not retract

Displayer the text that is covered on load of page until such time a I initiate
ad expansion by hovering my mouse over the ad.
