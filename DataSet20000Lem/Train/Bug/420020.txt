Element Opacity Rendering Bug

Elements with opacity < 1 cause FF to render entire page with different font-smoothing setting than the system-wide setting.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set Mac OS X > System Prefs > Appearance > Font smoothing = Automatic (this is usually the default setting on new Macs)
2. Launch Firefox
3. Go to a page with the following:

<style>
a:hover {
opacity: 0.5;
}
</style>
<a href="#">Test Mouseover</a>

<p>More text here to see the effect More text here to see the effect More text here to see the effect More text here to see the effect More text here to see the effect More text here to see the effect More text here to see the effect More text here to see the effects</p>

Actual Results:
Page will be rendered in Automatic/LCD font smoothing, until you mouseover the link. Then the page will render in Standard/CRT setting. This happens because element with opacity < 1 force FF to use the CRT font smoothing.

Expected Results:
The font smoothing should be consistent, following the system-wide setting, regardless if element on the page or their styles.

Changing image opacity is a common technique to manipulate mouseover button to avoid flicker problem in IE. But the rendering side effect in FF are actually worse than IE's flicker problem.
