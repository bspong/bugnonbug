In AOL email handling: clicking on REPLY and some other field - no response at all. This doe not happen under IE8
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; GTB6.4)
Build Identifier: Firefox/3.6.3

I open my mail (in AOL) and start to look at at individual items. When I am reading one that I want to respond to, I click on 'REPLY' or 'ACTION' above the message, but absolutely nothing happens, like any other dead spot on the screen. If I repeat the exact same sequence of action using IE8, it performs a expected (e.g. setting up for a REPLY msg). A few day ago (maybe a week?), it seemed this wa erratic, but now it is consistent, so that I must use IE when I want to use AOL. This just started in the last month or so and I think we did update Firefox during that time. If I understood exactly what to install and build to try out, I would do it, but I'm not clear on that issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.in AOL, open msg
2.click on 'REPLY' box
3.does anything happen?
Actual Results:
absolutely nothing happens

Expected Results:
Open window for REPLY action (enter text, send), with cursor in spot to enter text

responded to the click with the expected result above...when nothing happens, I can still perform any other action on the screen that it will support, a if I had done nothing at all. Also interesting is that some function are apparently "dead" but others are live and work a expected.
