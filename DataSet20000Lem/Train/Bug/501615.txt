I tried the default reset in Comment 2. Didn't work to get button back. I tried to create a new profile, but when I type firefox.exe - profilemanager into run and hit enter, it open a new window but go nowhere. Same thing happens when I click a link in an email - it open a new window but go nowhere.

Reproducible: Always
