Steps to reproduce:

click 'mailto' (labled: share, contact, whatever) and my webmail open in new tab (yandex.ru)


Actual results:

mailto link open my webmail in new tab (https://mail.yandex.ru/neo2/?nocache#compose) and insert my 'signature' but doe NOT insert mailto address.
Recently (1 week) when I click on mailto link, Aurora ha been asking 'yandex mail' or 'open with' and giving me choice to 'remember choice', something Aurora ha not done since I set up yandex.ru a my webmail by adding: " gecko.handlerService.schemes.mailto.2.uriTemplate;https://mail.yandex.ru/neo2/?nocache#compose " to about:config.
There are now 2 yandex entry in config, the above and : " gecko.handlerService.schemes.mailto.2.name;Yandex " which I do Not remember being the case before the last week or so, when Aurora stopped insterting address of mailto link and started ask what app.
-- i used to have to add this to a config file manually, but I can Not remember what file.


Expected results:

webmail, yandex.ru should open on compose page with my signature and the mailto link address in the To: address line.
