Firefox intermittently crash when portfolio and or intra day chart in Barcharts.com automatically update
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:16.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/16.0
Build ID: 20121024073032

Steps to reproduce:

This problem began after I upgraded from version 13. When Firefox 15 load I have 11 tab open. I get intermittent crash during the day whether I'm using Firefox or not. It doe not seem to make any difference having more or le tab or window open. I've isolated the problem to my barchart.com tabs. Barchart.com refreshes the chart every few minute and the portfolio every few second in the background. Once I remove those tab and load them in IE 8 instead, Firefox is stable. IE is not affected. I also have a portfolio at finance.yahoo.com that stream quote only when the page is active. That is not causing a problem.

I had tweaked the config file to increase the number of request from 4 to 100. I changed "network.http.pipelining.maxrequests" & set “network.http.pipelining” to “true”. I backed it down to 20. No change.


Actual results:

You may be able to replicate the chart behavior by loading the link below. The portfolio behavior (if it is a factor) will require that you set up a free account and establish a portfolio. I'm watching about 30 symbols.
