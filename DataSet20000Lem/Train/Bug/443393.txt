As seen in the screenshot, I docked my Windows Vista taskbar to the left of my screen instead of at the bottom. When I right click anywhere at all, the left-click menu appears to the left of where I clicked. The offset distance seems to be equal to the size of my taskbar.

The problem doe not occur if I press F11 to be in fullscreen mode, or if I set my taskbar to auto-hide.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move your window taskbar to the left of your screen a seen in the screenshot
2. Make sure it is not auto-hiding
3. Open Firefox either maximized or a a small window, but NOT in Full screen (F11) mode
4. Right click in the middle of your webpage
Actual Results:

Expected Results:
Right click menu should appear right where you clicked.

Windows Vista aero theme. However, this problem seems to have existed in 2004 with the aforementionned related bug.
