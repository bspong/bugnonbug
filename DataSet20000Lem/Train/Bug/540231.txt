I generally try to avoid having any text in my bookmark name so that all I see is the bookmark's symbol (e.g., the "F" symbol for Facebook). Right now I only have 4 bookmarks, none of which have text in their names. The first is a link to <http://www.facebook.com>, the second to <https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox>, the third to <http://www.pandora.com>, and the fourth to <http://public.online.ksu.edu>. It seems a if the click boundary for each link were drawn incorrectly. For instance, the boundary for the public.online.ksu.edu bookmark is so large it cover the almost the entire pandora.com bookmark. It doesn't seem to matter whether or not the window is maximized.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make sure all bookmark have no text in their names.
2.Move your cursor over the bookmarks.
3.Observe clickable boundary sizes.
Actual Results:
Pandora bookmark almost unclickable. I imagine the problem would be more widespread if there were more bookmark involved.

Expected Results:
There should have been appropriately-sized click boundary for each bookmark, but apparently this Firefox build ha a bug that cause that to not happen.

I have the 1-Click YouTube Video Downloader ver. 1.1, Adblock Plus 1.1.3, and YouTube to MP3 1.0.5 Add-ons installed a well a the Smoky White Persona. I don't know if those have anything to do with the problem, though.
