Firefox will hang after start with Nortel VPN client with auto connect enabled. I have to kill the the firefox process through task manager in order to continue. Firefox will work fine if I kill the autoexec process which is the process that activated the Nortel auto connect feauture.
All system that are experiencing this problem had a 2.x version of Firefox installed and did not experience this issue with the Nortel Adapter. I have experienced this issue with all version of 3.x firefox. All system that have a Nortel VPN client installed with the auto connect feauture enabled on the VPN are experiencing this problem. I hope this can be resolved very soon. I have tried this on several version of XP SP2, Sp3.
