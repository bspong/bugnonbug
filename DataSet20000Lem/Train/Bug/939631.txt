User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0; Touch; .NET4.0E; .NET4.0C; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Tablet PC 2.0; InfoPath.3; MALNJS; rv:11.0) like Gecko

Steps to reproduce:

I checked on support.microsoft.com/gp/lifecycle for end of support on Windows XP. They said that Microsoft will cut off support for Windows XP effective April 2014 and want to find out if Mozilla will cut off support for Windows XP on Firefox.


Actual results:

Mozilla want to become a browser that keep Windows XP support for long term according to neowin.net which is "Mozilla to support Firefox on Windows XP after Microsoft end support for the OS".


Expected results:

Sooner or later before April 2014, Mozilla Firefox should not work on Windows XP because it is a risk to use legacy computer to browse the internet. If a browser maker support window XP, they are encouraging security issues. The only way to stay secure on the internet is to use modern version of Windows... keeping browser up to date is not enough which is why Mozilla is not supposed to keep supporting Windows XP.. Web browser are the role model to cybersecurity. It is a major security risk to keep Firefox supported on Windows XP.. Please stop XP support asap...
