Sorry for the lack of a good summary but I really can't explain it better.

I am reading Slashdot a lot and I've customized the default layout a bit by moving the little box on the left (the one that show the number of comments) to the center of the page on top of the comment (you can do that by clicking once on the "/" button, some Javascript move the box and make it wider.
I'm using 1024x768 right now so when i scroll down, the box move up with the comment but is designed to stick to the top of the page, a you can see in the images. When I go up, the box automatically move in the correct position again.

The problem is that when this box is stuck to the top, the line immediately below it is rendered incorrectly. It's noticeable instantly if you use the scroll wheel, le often when using the directional keys.
The text in that line (or a part of the line) is italic, but on the other direction (or something like that). See images.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move the Comments box to the center of a Slashdot article page, one that ha lot of comment (so that you have to use the scroll on 1024x768 resolution)
2. Scroll down until the comment box is stuck to the top of the browser
3. Scroll down until you see the text rendered incorectly
Actual Results:
One line of text directly below the Comments box is not drawn correctly

Expected Results:
The line of text should be drawn correctly

See image to see what i mean.
