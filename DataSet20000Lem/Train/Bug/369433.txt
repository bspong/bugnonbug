Hi. If you view the source for the URL I gave with this report, you will see that an <object> is defined and used in the web page. FF2 doe not recognize or load/build this object and there is no error evident from FF2. FF2 Help doe not have an "iframe" topic to show me what setting need to be tweeked to make this work in FF2. In IE6 this object creates a 240x230 pixel video window that in-turn connects to and show what may be a window medium player A/V stream (see the MMS://xxxxx links).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hit www.srilaprabhupad.info/webcast.htm with FF2.
2. Hit www.srilaprabhupad.info/webcast.htm with IE6 or 7.
3. Compare the displayed differences.
4. View source for FF2.
Actual Results:
FF2 fails to display the 240x230 video window. However, I can launch Win Media Player application in it's own window from 2 of the other clearly-displayed button on the page.

Expected Results:
The video window should display on the targeted page using FF2

I think I'm using the default theme.
