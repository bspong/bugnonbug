if the document body is specified with a fixed width and margin:auto, the offsetLeft property for the body is 0, even though it is centered on the page. I can find no way of computing the proper position of the body element relative to the browser window for positioning other element that are child of the body.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create page with body element
2. Set the following styles: position:relative, margin:auto, width:974px
3. Attempt to write a javascript method that will compute the position of the upper left corner of the body relative to the document window.
Actual Results:
I could find no property of the body that indicated how far it wa offset from the left edge of the document window (margin).

Expected Results:
You should be able to compute the position of the body with respect to the document window for element positioning purposes.
