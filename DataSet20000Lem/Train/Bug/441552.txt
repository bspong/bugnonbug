Problem setting Firefox a default web browser
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; pt-BR; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; pt-BR; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

Every Firefox start up pop up the message "Firefox is not you default web browser ..."
It doesn't matter how many time or how many way I try to set Firefox a my default web browser the message still appears. And, if I go in "Tools > Options > Advanced" and check if Firefox is the default, it tell me that is not.
I'm using Windows XP 64Bit. Firefox icon appers in my startup menu and when I double click in a html file it open in Firefox. But even OS preference nor Firefox seems to know what is the default web browser.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Starts up Firefox
2. "Tools > Options > Advanced" , set Firefox a your defaut web browser and be shure to set "On startup, verify if Firefox is the default web browser"
3. Starts up Firefox again
Actual Results:
Firefox still showing the message "Firefox is not your defaut web browser" every startup.

Expected Results:
Should not appear the described message on start up nor when checking through "Tools > Options > Advanced".
