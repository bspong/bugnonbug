I'm using window XP Service pack 1 and am logged in a an administrator. The
XP theme service is turned on. Firebird is set to be my default browser and is
using the default theme. I am also able to reproduce this bug on a friend's
computer with window 2000. The error doe not occur in mozilla 1.5 or in a
linux build of firebird. When I navigate to the given url or refresh the window
an Internet Explorer window open with a document containing some fragment of
vbscript code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to URL

Actual Results:
An internet explorer window open with the following content: <HTML><SCRIPT
LANGUAGE=vbscript>var __w=[code];if(__w!=null)document.write(__w);</SCRIPT></HTML>



Since this bug open internet explorer which is le likely to be kept up to
date by a firebird user it might be possible to use this to open an internet
explorer window and exploit unpatched vulnerability there.
