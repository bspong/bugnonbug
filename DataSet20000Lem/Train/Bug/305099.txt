I downloaded and ran a nightly (hourly) "Pacifica?" installer .exe build of
Firefox. I went to a bug to test whether it wa still crashing for me. It
crashed, but Talkback didn't come up. Talkback wa checked off on the "custom
install" I ran. Talkback doe not show up under my extensions. I have been
running on branch build since the latest split. Talkback also doe not show
under extension manager window. I cannot locate a talkback.xpi file to install
it on this system.

The note at http://kb.mozillazine.org/Talkback are not up to date.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open extension manager, observe no Talkback.
2. Go to a web page or site that crash Firefox.
3. Try to find a Talkback installer.

Actual Results:
1. No Talkback observed.
2. Firefox crashes, but Talkback doesn't start.
3. Talkback installer nowhere to be found.

Expected Results:
1. Talkback should have been there.
2. Talkback should have started up.
3. There should be an easy way to find a Talkback installer. The extension page
should have it listed at the VERY TOP.

No additional information at this time.
