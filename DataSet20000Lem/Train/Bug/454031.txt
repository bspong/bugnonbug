I posted a sample page on my website. It contains lower case fractura symbol &hfr; and &efr; enclosed by an <h2> tag. If I remove the <h2> markups, the character display just fine - however I need to open a new instance of the browser: Once a browser instance get a page like this it will refuse to display these unicode character anywhere on any subsequent page you try to open. I have not noticed this problem however when I wa adjusting the size using CSS. So, for example, <span style="font-size:120%;">&hfr;</span> display just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create an xhtml page containing a fractura unicode character. (e.g. &efr;)
2.Make sure that the character render correctly on your system (i.e. the font are there and the DTD definition is found - you can reproduce the problem without the DTD using explicit numeric value such a &#120109;)
3.Enclose the unicode character by <h2> tag and reload the page

Actual Results:
You will see a place-holder square in place of the unicode character. This will persist even after you remove the <h2> tag and reload the page.

Expected Results:
Render the symbol correctly
