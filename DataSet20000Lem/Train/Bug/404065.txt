a copy of firefox is already open. Only one copy of firefox can be open at a time.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

After closing firefox, I tried to re-open it and got a message telling me that a copy of firefox wa already open. I tried to force quit but it did not do anything. I have to restart my computer every time this happens. It's the only way I can re-open firefox. This started to happen recently (yesterday)but I have already found many identical report by entering the message on Google search. The fix that are being offered are too vague for me to want to try. Please help.

Expected Results:
1)Opened Activity Monitor in Utilities folder and tried to find a process related to Firefox that might still be open. Did not find any. Had to restart the computer.

2) Searched for a file called .Parentlock in the Profile folder but did not find it.
