Excuse me when I'm not cmpleet, do not hesitate to mail me, but this is my first bug report at Mozilla.

I'm a new user of Firefox 1.5 RC1.
Did create my personalized homepage at www.Google.com/ig
Now there is also a french site (I'm located in France) : www.google.fr/ig

But since I've set my default homepage in FireFox 1.5 RC1, a www.google.fr/ig
it loop between www.google.fr/ig and www.google.com/ig.
So fast that it even doe not show the content of the page.
I only can see the changement between the two page in my addressbar every 0.1 sec.
IE 6.0 work fine when I set my homepage to www.google.fr/ig.
By the way, maybe important information, I've set to "remeber my password" aswell for www.google.com/ig a www.google.fr/ig

Do I do something wrong or is this a bug ?

Windows XP SP2.
