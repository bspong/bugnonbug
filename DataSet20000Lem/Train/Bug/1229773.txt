The cs selector search part of the inspector search tool is really buggy
The inspector search tool can be used to do 2 things: search for text in the page, and search for element that match a given selector.
The latter is quite buggy. For simple case it work well, but when selector become complex, it doesn't always work well.
A few problem I see with the code:

- _showPopup in inspector-search.js us regexp all over the places, this isn't a bug in itself but is error-prone and make the code harder to read
- this code doesn't handle attribute selector at all div[a], div[a*=b], ... (this is partly fixed with bug 1225514)
- part of this code assumes id/class attribute have only letters, while they can contain numbers, underscore and hyphens, and can even start with underscore or hyphen
- getSuggestionsForQuery in inspector.js (on the server) doe not seem to handle attribute selector at all either

Here are use case that fail currently:

- go to data:text/html,<a class="test" id="id1">
and enter #id1.tes
suggestion popup is broken and pressing enter replaces the value with just .test

- go to data:text/html,<a class="class1" id="id1">
and enter .class1#id
same

There might be other
