opened FF via a web link in email. Opened a new tab, clicked "home", FF opened a new window with an old recovered set of tabs.

I opened Firefox by clicking a link in an email in Thunderbird. It did not recover a previous session, it only opened the link I clicked on. I did open more tab in that FF session. I opened a 4th tab, and clicked "home" to go to google search.

Firefox did two odd thing the second I clicked "home".

1) it opened a whole new window with tab recovered from some previous crashed session, a session that crashed in January.
2) It did open a tab at "home" in the window I clicked on, but not the tab I'd just created for "home" - it opened a new tab on that firefox window.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have Firefox save a crashed session
2. open Firefox via an email link
3. open a couple more tab
4. select an empty tab
5. click on "home"
Actual Results:
variable - this doesn't reproduce the problem every time.

Expected Results:
I would expect the "home url" to be opened in the tab selected, I would not expect Firefox to open a whole new window with some ancient recovered crashed session in it.

Default theme is in use.
