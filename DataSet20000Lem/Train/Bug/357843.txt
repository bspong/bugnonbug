I am running latest Firefox on WinXP SP2. Every time I start up I have to go to Options>Privacy>Cookies and reset "Allow site to set cookies" so I can get into site that store my identity in cookies. Without doing this I cannot get into my.yahoo.com even by signing in, because the attempt to get into the next page fails with no cookie.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check "Allow site to set cookies"
2. Close Firefox
3. Go to my.yahoo.com

Actual Results:
1. Instead of getting to my home page, it go to generic page with a "sign in" link.
2. I sign in
3. It tell me Yahoo unable to set or retieve cooky and I must change mu settings.
4. I change setting a above, and Yahoo work perfectly.
5. I close Firefox
6. I reopen firefox and go to my.yahoo.com
7. Repeats a above


Expected Results:
Since I have stored an identity cookie, which Firefox recognizes after I check "Allow site to set cookies", Yahoo open my personal home page.

This ha not happened before. It just started happening about 5 day ago. I'm assuming Firefox updated itself with one or more patch at that time, and one of them created this problem.
Since this ha not been reported before, It may be because of interaction with one of my installed extension (I have many of them).
