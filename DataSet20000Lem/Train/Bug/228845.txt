When right-clicking on an image you get the option to block all image from that
server. But if it's an animated image it would be more useful to block only
animated image from from that server. (They might have to be downloaded, but
not shown to the user.)

You could have two separate right-click menu items, block animated image and
block all images, but I think it would make most sense to have only the 'block
animated images' menu item appear when right-clicking on such an image. If
after blocking animated image from a site you continue to be annoyed by still
image from the same site, you could right-click on one of those to block them too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit a site with an animated GIF. Right-click on the image.
Actual Results:
Menu appears with option 'Block image from foo.com'.

Expected Results:
Menu item read instead 'Block animated image from foo.com' and behaves
accordingly.

But right-clicking on a still image would show the 'Block images' menu item a
before.
