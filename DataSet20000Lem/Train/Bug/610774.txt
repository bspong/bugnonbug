In the link, type an eMail address and a password.
Logs in successfully
Try to go to Inbox, it asks you to Confirm Password
Type in password; it asks you every time you push enter to Confirm Password
This seems to continue endlessly

Has been occurring since Monday (was not able to try beforehand).
This computer is on a Belkin Network System in a small high school; another computer that wa Windows XP COULD access eMail on Yahoo! successfully, and this computer is in the same school. (It is possible that the Networks are different kinds, but they are connected; proof being same site are blocked on each Network)
On this computer: Login is successful on Internet Explorer and other browsers; I have not tried to see if other eMail system won't let the user access

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In the link, type an eMail address and a password. It Logs in successfully.
2. Try to go to Inbox. It asks you to Confirm Password
3. Type in password; a it redirects to Inbox, it asks you (every time) you push enter to Confirm Password
4. Continues endlessly

If you were already Logged in, it asks you nonstop for your confirmations, and redirects you to Confirm again.
Actual Results:
You cannot access email on Yahoo! Mail.

Expected Results:
Gone straight to Inbox or eMail Home after password confirmation.

Can seem to sometimes send email if it wa your first login.
