Does not honor xorg keysyms
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070304 Firefox/2.0.0.2

Firefox doe not respond to input from the following standard mapped keysyms:
XF86Reload
XF86Stop
XF86Forward
XF86Back
XF86HomePage

In other Gecko/Mozilla based browsers, such a GNOME's Epiphany, the listed keysyms work appropriately; so on my DELL USB multimedia keyboard I hit the special Web Back key and it keycode is mapped to XF86Back, so Epiphany in turn go back to the previous Webpage in the current tab if there is one.

Note: For nonstandard keyboard the keycode can be associated with an X keysym using xmodmap.

I am using xorg-server-1.1.1 and xorg-x11-7.1 a my Window System.

I also have epiphany-2.16.2 installed which reacts appropriately to the web keys.

My keyboard is a DELL USB Multimedia sk-8135 an is configured appropriately through X. The keycodes have been mapped to the apropriate XF86* keysyms using xmodmap (and a .Xmodmap user file).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a keyboard setup with special multimedia/web keys.
2. Make sure that you keyboard's keycodes are mapped to the appropriate keysyms.
To do this:
a) Use xev to find out which keycodes are sent by your web keys.
b) Execute `xmodmap -pk` to list the keycode-keysym mappings.
c) If the keycodes for your Web Keys do not have the special X keysyms mapped, assign them using a .Xmodmap file for in your user account's home directory. Login again after making a .Xmodmap file for your user.
3. Launch epiphany web browser and go to a few websites. Press the special web key (back/forward/stop/reload/home) on your keyboard and notice that the browser responds the same way it would if you clicked on the back/forward/stop/reload/home buttons.
4. Repeat step 3 using Firefox.

Actual Results:
Epiphany reacts to the mapped Web Keys.
Firefox ignores the mapped Web Keys.

Expected Results:
Epiphany reacts to the mapped Web Keys.
Firefox reacts to the mapped Web Keys.

As mentioned in Linux/Xorg keycodes may need to be mapped to X keysyms using the xmodmap tool.

It would be excellent if Firefox would respond to the special key in Linux the same way Epiphany does.

On Windows based system this function already work appropriately.
