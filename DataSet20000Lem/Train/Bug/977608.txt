Disconnecting the device while an app is installing will disable Update / Debug button
Reproduced on:
Firefox 28 beta 6 (20140224220227)
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0
latest Aurora (20140227004002)
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0
latest Nightly (20140227030203)
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open App Manager and connect the device
2. Add a larger packaged app (eg download from https://github.com/loqui/im)
3. Select the Update button to install it on device
4. Disconnect the device while the app is installing
5. Reconnect the device and check the Update button
6. Select the Debug button
7. Disconnect the device before the app is installed
8. Verify the UI of Update / Debug button

Actual results:
5.8. The Update / Debug button are grayed out - disabled. Switching to another app from list and returning will display the button correctly.

Expected results:
The button state should be updated after reconnecting the device.

Notes:
1. The issue reproduces back to Firefox 26 where App Manager wa introduced, so it's not a regression.
2. It reproduces also on Win 7, 64-bit.
