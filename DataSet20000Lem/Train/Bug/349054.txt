Visual Focus when tabbing out of Web Forgery popup
Test environment:
Windows XP, Firefox 2 (Bon Echo) build 20060815

Description:

On the "Suspected Web Forgery" popup, if you tab out of the warning pop-up window, visual focus is completely lost. This happens when tabbing through the link on the grayed-out web page behind the security warning popup.


Steps to recreate:

1. Make sure the Google anti-phishing security option is set in the Firefox
security options.
a. Open Firefox Tools, Options, and open Security page.
b. Select "Tell me if the site I'm using is a suspected forgery" checkbox
c. Select "Check by asking [Google] about each site I visit" radio button.
2. Open this web page URL in Firefox browser:
http://www.google.com/tools/firefox/safebrowsing/phish-o-rama.html

- This result in the display of the "Suspected Web Forgery" pop-up.

3. Keep pressing the Tab key several times. Focus move to
- the "Get me out of here!" button
- then the "Ignore this warning" button
- then the "Send report" button
- then the Firefox Navigation toolbar Location field
- then the Firefox Navigation toolbar Search field
- then... where? (no obvious visual focus showing anywhere)
- ... keep pressing Tab and eventually program focus return to the "Suspected
Web Forgery" popup window links.

- It appears the program focus is tabbing through the link on the grayed-out
web page displayed behind the "Suspected Web Forgery" popup window. None of
those focus change can be seen visually.

Expected results:

1. The visual focus should be clear at all times. even when tabbing through the "grayed-out" page behind the security warning.

Often, item that are grayed out are not accessible through the keyboard. In this case, the user should not be allowed to tab to item in the "grayed-out" page before a selection is made on the anti-phishing warning popup.
