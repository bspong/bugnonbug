bottom button on Web page is horizontally misaligned with other button in page
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.7.9) Gecko/20050711 Firefox/1.0.5 SUSE/1.0.5-3

I believe that the problem is with Gecko, and not Firefox itself, a the exact
same effect wa also observed from within several version of the Mozilla Suite.

The problem is a follows:

I produced a simple HTML page to be used a the menu page within an HTML
frameset. This page consists of my cartoon caricature logo together with several
PNG button aligned horizontally using the <DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV> tag.

Whenever I display this page either by itself or within an HTML frameset using
any Mozilla browser, I notice the bottom button is rendered slightly to the
right of the button directly above it. This problem persists even when I delete
the bottom button from the HTML code; although there would be one le button,
the bottom button would still be out of alignment with the others by the exact
same amount.

I also removed the javascript code within this page to convert the rollover
button into simple static buttons, but the problem still persisted.

However I found that this page wa rendered with it button in perfect
alignment within Konqueror (Linux), Netscape (Windows 98), and IE even with the
rollover button enabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
View the page in any Mozilla browser.
Actual Results:
Same a above.

Expected Results:
The rendering engine (i.e., Gecko) should have horizontally centered all
graphical image on the page. See attachments.
