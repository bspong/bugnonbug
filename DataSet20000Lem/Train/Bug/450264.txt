Firefox and only be opened once. After a restart of the application the back and forward function do not work. The page load but the browser load animation on the tab never starts. The computer ha to be restarted to fix this problem but then it start again when firefox is closed then started again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox
2.close firefox
3.start firefox again
Actual Results:
Page load animation never stop and back and forward function do not work

Expected Results:
Allow back and forward from page to page

Theme doe not make a difference. A blank page always load on the restart and the home button or keyboard function doe not take me to my home page, only the the firefox search page.
I am listing this a a major severity since it render the program useless. I have been using safari until this is fixed because it make the program useless after one use unless I restart the computer.
