.tabs-alltabs-stack should be 24 pixel wide instead of 18. By widening .tabs-alltabs-stack, it both make it easier to click on and, more importantly, it will allow for at least 2 way at 1280 width for fixed width tab to perfectly fill the scrollbox with it still present.

Example:
18 is divisible by 2,3,6,9,18
24 is divisible by 2,3,4,6,8,12,24

Having 2 or 3 tab fixed width filling the scrollbox with no overflow are obviously useless. However, the bigger problem is that the rest of the component on the tab bar have width that are divisible by both 4 AND 6, making .tabs-alltabs-stack the odd one out. So, by then having .tabs-alltabs-stack width equal to 18, it take away all the possible multiple of 4. (for reference, .scrollbutton-up and .scrollbutton-down-stack add up to 36 pixels, the close button at the right is 24 pixel if enabled, I am assuming that .tabs-left ha been removed by editing userChrome.css for simplicity)

Here I will compare having 3,4,6,8,12,24 a the possible number of fixed width tab to perfectly fill the scrollspace without overflow to 3,6,9,18, each at 1280 width resolution.

As 1280 minus 18 or 1280 minus 24 are already not divisible by 3,6,9,12, 18, or 24, that immediately limit the first set to only 4 or 8 a possibilities, but even worse, it limites the second set to none (which is the bug).

By making .tabs-alltabs-stack 24 pixel wide it would open up these possibilities, and would also open up even more possibility at other resolutions, for example, at 1152 width.

Reproducible: Always
