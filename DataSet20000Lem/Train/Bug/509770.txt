The & is replaced by &amp; when copied from Firefox into Dreamweaver
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.13) Gecko/2009073022 Firefox/3.0.13 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I noticed this happened after the latest build of Firefox wa released during the week of August 3, 2009. The basic link of: http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&rid=2 would appear to be http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&amp;rid=2 if copied from the browser address bar to a basic HTML program like Dreamweaver. The only way this doe not convert the actual link is if it is pasted directly into the code itself.

This prof to be a problem because the link provided tell the database to find event id # 24587 in the region of 2 or id=24857&rid=2 instead it see id=24857&amp;rid=2. This generates a page error. This ha been tested on Mac OSX & Vista Business & XP Pro machines. Is there a setting on Firefox I should be sharing with my development team to work around this?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Copy the link: http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&rid=2
2.Type general text into an html document and paste the link using basic <a href></a> tags.
3.View the code source in Dreamweaver or any html editor and notice http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&amp;rid=2 instead of http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&rid=2.
4. Notice how it appears perfect within the browser. This cause problem for our web mailer which read the code a it is placed in Dreamweaver or any general html editor.
Actual Results:
http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&mp;rid=2 this a page appears. The error code reproduced read a follows:

Sorry, there wa an error proccessing your request for page: /new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&mp;rid=2
Element RID is undefined in URL.
The error occurred on line 140.

Which translates into the last portion of the link &rid=2 doe not appear because of the replacement of the & to the &amp;

Expected Results:
http://www.fusicology.com/new/index/events/detail.cfm?id=24587&rid=2 the page should appear instead of the error page.
