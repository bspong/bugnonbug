When checking my mail in my inbox on YouTube, I try to click my mail to see the message/drop down and it won't drop down. Is it because of a plug-in, add-on, or some problem? because on IE (Internet Explorer) It doesn't have this problem. Same go for any drop down from the inbox/comments/messages from mail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go On YouTube
2. Go To www.youtube.com/inbox (Make sure you log into your YouTube account if you have one)
3. If you have a message or an old message try to click it.
4. It suppose to go down but Firefox won't let it go down.
Actual Results:
The drop down of the message in my inbox on YouTube won't show up in that case I would use IE (Internet Explorer) just to check message but still use Firefox until they fix this bug/problem.

Expected Results:
It's supposed to drop down and show message and other stuff. If you try it on internet explorer it work but when you try it on Firefox it doesn't work.

It's a feature from YouTube that is new and Firefox should be able to do it but there need to be a new update. It should be fixed so It will work on Firefox. Its a major feature that YouTube updated (Their inbox system for YouTube users)[Firefox]
