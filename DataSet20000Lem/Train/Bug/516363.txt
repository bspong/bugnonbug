need ability to add folder and name it, and then add subfolder under that folder and name it, until I am done creating my heirarchy. then put my bookmark in the folder I select. I think this will require a tree view.
I would like to create a tree like this, without leaving Add Bookmark|Choose:
/OS
+---/patches
+---/osforsale
+---windows
+---linux
+---DOS
/hosting

As firefox currently stand now, when I press the New Folder button, nothing happens. it stay depressed and you can't rename your folder (at least not without external help from someone else) - and the folder just \magically appears somewhere in the heirarchy without it being selected so I can do New Folder again. there is no text box for the new folder name either, so it is not very user-friendly - just named "New Folder" - no choice in the matter. This should be intuitive. I am not asking for help. I am asking to make the UI more obvious. The New Folder button should never be grayed out - it should always be enabled for making a heirarchy until the user is finished.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox & browse to any webpage
2.add bookmark
3.folder|choose
4.new folder
Actual Results:
new folder button is grayed, preventing you from pressing it again.
new folder appears somewhere in the heirarchy, but it is not selected. or visible. no text box for naming the folder. no provision for renaming the folder immediately after creating the folder without leaving the dialog.

Expected Results:
expected text box for naming the folder (at a minimum), or some way to rename the folder after creating a selected, visible "New Folder".
