Adding a bookmark with a long title cause a hang

It is possible to open the "Add to Bookmark" dialog with JavaScript:
window.sidebar.addPanel(title, url, "");
but this function isn't safe at the moment.

If the inserted "title" is really long (look at my example, where a long title is generated), the browser will crash and add the url to your bookmark without showing the dialog and accepting it. This can be used to add a link which lead to an "modified" online banking Site / phishing site or any other bad site.

This can be probably used to insert malicious code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a Link (which ha a javascript function on it for bookmarking a site --> window.sidebar.addPanel(title, url, "");)
2.Title is a really long String
3.Click on the link with the javascript

Actual Results:
The Browser crashes, because he cant handle the long input and the site defined in "url" will be added to the bookmark (without accepting it)

Expected Results:
Check that the inserted title isnt that long and dont add the bookmark without accepting it.

Here is the Code for testing this:

<html>
<head>
<title>
Testpage
</title>
</head>
<body>
<script type="text/javascript">
function bookmark(){

var title = "BadDomain";
var url = "http://google.com";

var count = 23;
for(var i = 0; i < count; i++){
title = title + title;
}

//if Firefox
if (window.sidebar)
window.sidebar.addPanel(title, url, "");
}
</script>


<a href="javascript:bookmark()">Bookmark the Site described without accepting it!</a>

</body>
</html>
