site fails to recognise RealPlayer
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050720 Fedora/1.0.6-1.1.fc3 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050720 Fedora/1.0.6-1.1.fc3 Firefox/1.0.6

I have Firefox 1.06 installed in FC3 (x1), SimplyMepis 3.3 (x1), Ubuntu 5.04
(x2), W2K (x1) and XP (x1).

Until approximately a week ago, all wa fine watching video on www.smh.com.au.
Then the site stopped recognising RealPlayer, only WMP. This occured on ALL my
machine running Firefox.

Recently I built a P3 for my daughter, installed Ubuntu, updated to Firefox
1.06, installed RealPlayer - and the site recognised RealPlayer. I have just
checked it this minute and it no longer does. I am certain this is some problem
in recognising RealPlayer in Firefox - though it is likely the problem is at the
internet site, a RealPlayer work fine otherwise. I have contacted friend who
are experiencing the same problem and written to the medium site owner IT unit -
though will little assistance in reply.

I am writing this a a bug a I'm not sure where else to report this problem and
feel that a the site is for one of (if not THE) major broadsheet in Australia,
and the problem ha only recently occured, this problem will be experienced by
more people than just me.

4. click on 'video setting' upper right of browser window - only WMP is shown a
an option.
