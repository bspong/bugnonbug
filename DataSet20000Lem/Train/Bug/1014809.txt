Assertion spew when inspector is opened and window is resized
Locally, when I run mach run and open the inspector tab and resize the window I see a bunch of assertions. I have ac_add_options --enable-debug in my .mozconfig, which may or may not be relevant.

It seems to be caused primarily from the Inspector panel (if I open devtools directly to the debugger panel, for instance, I don't see it):
