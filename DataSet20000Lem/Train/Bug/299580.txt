I cannot seem to enter 8 or 9 into the "Days to keep history" box without
highlighting the entire number in the box and pushing Backspace. Pushing
backspace all the way automatically enters a 0 (zero) in the box. Entering
other number (1-7) when the zero is present yield the expected result
(replacing the zero with the number), however, when evering an 8 or 9, the field
act a if the number is going to be entered by displaying it for a split second
(such a "08" or "09"), but then era it, a if the Backspace key had been pushed.

**Note: this only happens when the caret is to the right of the 0 and entering a
number. Numbers such a "80" and "90" appear fine.**

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up DPa1
2. Go to Tools -> Options... -> Privacy -> History
3. Try and enter "08" or "09" in the box
4. See the wacky bug
Actual Results:
Went to Bugzilla and reported this bug

Expected Results:
"8" or "9" should have been entered into the box
