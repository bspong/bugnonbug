In the Cookie Manager (Tools->Options...->Privacy->Cookies->Stored Cookies...),
when selecting (with the Ctrl+Click key combo.) and deleting a non-contiguous
(not next to each other) series of cookies, the Cookie Manager leaf the
remaining cooky chosen with the Ctrl+click in the UI position they were in
before the deletion of the selected cookies. It is expected that the list of
cooky would be consolidated (i.e. filling the hole created by deleting
intervening cookies).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Assuming multiple cooky have been set in the browser.
1.Click on Tools->Options...->Privacy->Cookies->Stored Cookies...
2.Select two or more, non-contiguous cookies.
3.Click 'Remove Cookie'.

Actual Results:
The first cookie is deleted and the list of cooky is reformatted to close the
space created. The second (and subsequent) cooky chosen (by mean of the
Ctrl+click method) are also deleted (as far a I can tell), but the Cookie
Manager UI-listing of the space created by the deleted cookie are not closed
(i.e. follow-on cooky are not moved to fill the spaces).

Expected Results:
Cookies selected by mean of the Ctrl+click, non-contiguous selection method
should have their space occupied by the remaining cooky (if any) after the
user chooses 'Remove Cookie'.
