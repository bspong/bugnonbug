CSP block inline stylesheets in SVG (Firefox render SVG not correctly when fetched from certain server (maybe config issue?))
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0 Iceweasel/25.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130928100402

Steps to reproduce:

Load this file: http://new.list-gymnasium.de/assets/layout/img/svg/header-bg.svg


Actual results:

Instead of a blueish color gradient, the SVG is rendered completely black.


Expected results:

However, when the exactly same file (sha1 should be b5d4549...) is loaded

1. from Hard Disk/local storage
2. from another server (http://lbo.spheniscida.de/header-bg.svg)
3. using Chrome

it's displayed correctly. I checked the HTTP header for obvious mistakes, but the file is delivered a image/svg+xml from both servers. Maybe you detect something? The header accompanying the not-working file are here: http://paste.debian.net/49298/
The working-file header here: http://paste.debian.net/49299/

This problem first appeared with Firefox 24 on Debian GNU/Linux amd64, with many add-on installed. It still is there with Firefox 25 and a "vanilla" (i.e. without any add-ons, new profile) installation of Firefox 24 on Ubuntu Raring amd64 (virtualized).

The SVG file wa created using Inkscape and back then saved a "Plain SVG". Inkscape render the file correctly, and so doe the renderer used by the GTK file preview and eog (dunno what exactly it is - some GTK+ parts??)
