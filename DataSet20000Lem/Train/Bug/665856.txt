I had 14-15 window in April-May. I haven't used Firefox in a while except for the occasional e-mail checking. When I opened Firefox today, I noticed that only 1 window wa restored, the one with my e-mail tab along with other tab in this particular window. The rest of the window were not restored.

FYI, my preference have always been set to "Show my window and tab from last time".

When I checked the Firefox Profile folder, I found sessionstore-1.js to sessionstore-7.js. They date from 12 Oct 2007 to 29 Jan 2010. All with 0 KB.

sessionstore.js (360KB) and sessionstore.bak (516KB), on the other hand are both dated today.

I never received a prompt or window asking me if I wanted to restore all 15 windows. I didn't expect a prompt since FF usually automatically restores all window from my last session. This time it didn't.

Is there a way to recover all 15 window from my last session?
