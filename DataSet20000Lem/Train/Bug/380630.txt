After Upgrade from Etch-Testing to Etch-Stable Firefox is unable to resolve DNS
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; de; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070310 Iceweasel/2.0.0.3 (Debian-2.0.0.3-1)

Hello,

I have a problem with Firefox2.0.0.3 (Tarball) on a 64Bit-Archticture (AMD K8 A64 3800+) with Debian Linux "Etch/Stable".
In order to start the 32bit-Version of Firefox on the amd64-architecture I have to install some additional package and to make a small script for boot with firefox.
With the Version Etch/Testing Firefox2.0.0.3 work trouble-free.
But after a upgrade from testing to stable and after a reinstallation with Etch/Stable Firefox2.0.0.3 boot cerrectly, but it can not resolve the DNS of the URL's.
In the other case, when I use the IP-address instead of the URL Firefox show the website. I have deleted my profile directory ".mozilla" from my Home directory and have started Firefox newly, but the bug is the same.
If I want to resolve the page of "http://burgholzhof", which is on the same machine, Firefox can resolve that URL.
I have also checked my network configuration, but all is okay. Because my machine can resolve the URL's and Konqueror and lynx can do it also.
So I assume there is a problem between Firefox (32bit) and Debian Linux (Etch/Stable). On the other machine with the same Debian Etch/Stable (CPU i686) there are no problem with Firefox2.0.0.3

I hope your can tell me, what I have to do.

Thank you! Kind regards!

Andreas
