This page is dynamically generated using php and MySQL, and the product
thumbnail sometimes overlap on this (and all other product pages) horizontally.
It's like a deck of card that is being spread out on a table, and some card
are overlapping others. Of course I don't want this to happen. If it occurs
for you, you can see one thumbnail image ha been covered about 80% by another
sometimes, although the 20% that is still visible can be clicked. I've noticed
this with other site a well, and it seems to be a problem with database-driven
tables. It can occur both horizontally and vertically, and usually a simple
refresh make the page render correctly. In IE I don't seem to ever encounter
this problem.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just go to the page. It's intermittent and doesn't happen all the time.
Actual Results:
It sometimes ha overlapping images, sometimes doesn't. Maybe about 10% of the
time.
