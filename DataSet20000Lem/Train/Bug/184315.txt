When you choose to use a bookmark a your homepage, you get a listbox containing
all your bookmarks. To select a bookmark, you can double-click it instead of
selecting it and closing the dialog through [Ok].

However, if you double click the scrollbar (i.e. to scroll up/down two page
quickly), it will think you double-clicked a bookmark instead (except when the
mouse just happens to land on top of a separator and not a bookmark).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click 'Use bookmark' for choosing your homepage, in the preferences.
2. Double-click a distance below the scrollbar thumb so it quickly scroll down
two pages.
3. Make sure your mouse land to the right of an item, not a separator.

Actual Results:
The bookmark to the left of the cursor is chosen and the dialog is closed.

Expected Results:
Nothing. It should not interpret the double-clicking of the scrollbar a the
double-clicking of a bookmark.
