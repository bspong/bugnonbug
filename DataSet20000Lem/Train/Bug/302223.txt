Firefox freezes/crashes/doesn't start after update to latest (1.0.6)version
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: FireFox 1.0.6 + Hungarian language pack

Evening.

After updating Firefox to 1.0.6 and letting it install a I always do, I
clicked on the "yes", telling it to start it back up so I could resume my
work. Aside from the updater itself not detecting that there wa an update
(another bug), what Firefox basically did is given to you in the URL in the
form of a picture. It just refuse to start up, and instead, chooses to crash.

Please remedy this situation immediately, a I'm forced to use buggy old IE
where I don't story my favorite anymore.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Get any Firefox
2.Update to 1.0.6
3.Try to initialize the newest (1.0.6) build, getting it to crash by itself.

Actual Results:
Firefox crashed. Gave me a heavy error message, saying my work wa lost.I
tried uninstalling, reinstalling, uninstalling, rebooting and then
installing...but nothing.

Expected Results:
Started up like normal and worked?

Fullsoft.dll caused it to crash. Everything is on the URL field, provided in
the form of a picture however.
