This is happening in Firefox 3.0 Beta on Mac OS X. The automatic spellcheck is treating partial word a words. This is especially true in contractions. The spell check will underline the first few letter of a word only, even though the word is spelled correctly - it seems to be ignoring the last few letter of the word.

However, it is not a consistent bug. Sometimes didn't pass the test, sometimes it doesn't. But it's not just contractions. I wa typing the word "what" and it underlined the wha but not the t.



Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website with a text field
2. Start typing, especially using contraction
3. it may help to stop typing for a few second in the middle of a word - or mistype the word at the end and go back and fix it. (example: didn;t - didn't)
4. look for the bug
Actual Results:
It wa happening hit-and-miss on gmail - but not on this page I'm using now. (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox&format=guided)

Expected Results:
It should treat whole word a whole words. didn't isn't one 4 letter word and one 1 letter word - it's one word.
