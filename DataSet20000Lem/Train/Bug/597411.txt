I had Firefox update set to automatic, and yesterday, 9-16-10, I got the latest updated version of Firefox. The new version somehow keep me from accessing my yahoo email account. It asks me to sign in, which I do with my usual email address and password, but it keep sending me back to sign in again and again.
I've checked this function with IE8, Chrome, and Safari and have had no problem accessing my yahoo mail account. And I've uninstalled Firefox and downloaded and reinstalled it three time with no luck.
In short, I can not access my yahoo email account with version 3.6.10 of Firefox, but I can access it with any other browser, or earlier version of Firefox. All other function seem to work okay. So the email problem is with the new version of Firefox only. Hope it get fixed because Firefox is my all time favorite. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Problem occurred after automatic update from version 3.6.9 to 3.6.10.
2.I've reinstalled Firefox three time since the update. Reinstall doe not fix problem.
3.All other browser function seem to work okay except access to yahoo mail.
Actual Results:
Use Yahoo mail. Then update Firefox version 3.6.9 to 3.6.10. Uninstalled and downloaded and reinstalled Firefox three separate times.

Expected Results:
Same result happened after each uninstall and reinstall.

It should have taken me to my yahoo email account automatically when I clicked the Mail icon on my homepage. Instead it take me to a Yahoo sign-in screen which will not accept my password a a valid email client. I've been using the same password for two year with Yahoo mail, and it worked okay with previous version of Firefox, and still work with any other browser.
I think the update process corrupted some file in Firefox that Yahoo Mail check whenever I click the mail icon on the homepage. Usually, clicking the icon take me directly to my in-box. Now it take me to a sign-in screen that won't accept my email password.
