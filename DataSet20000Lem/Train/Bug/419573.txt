I am creating a web site in Microsoft Expression Web using a web site template.

Firefox is having a problem displaying the correct page alignment position when the site ha many table rows, or many body text lines, and or many paragraph lines, and go out of sync with the rest of the site position.

When you don't have many line on the page, Firefox display the correct page alignment position.

Viewing the site in Internet Explorer 7, the page alignment is fine with it all in sync. And viewing the site in Firefox, the page go out of sync.

Viewing the site with the Internet Explorer rendering mode for Firefox -- the page alignment is fine with it all in sync.

When you split the table up into parts, and body text into part with paragraph formatting between each section of the body text -- the page alignment is still out of sync on Firefox.

- body text formatting with the enters directly under the line of text with no space between the enters.
- paragraph formatting with the space between the enters.

I tried the site on both Windows XP and on Ubuntu 7.10, both Firefoxes had the same problem with the page alignment.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a table with 27 row and above, or lot and lot of body text formatting lines, and or lot and lot of paragraph formatting line using any web site template on Microsoft Expression Web.

2. create another page with a few table rows, or few body text lines, and or a few paragraph lines.

3. view the site in Firefox and in Internet Explorer or Internet Explorer rendering mode in Firefox, and see the page alignment position with the rest of the site from the template.
Actual Results:
The page alignment position in Firefox go out of sync with the rest of the site position.

Expected Results:
Firefox should keep the page alignment with many line in sync with the rest of the site.
