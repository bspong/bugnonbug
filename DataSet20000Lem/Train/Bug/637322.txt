Session variable are lost when using back button while using FireFox on Mac. Other Mac browser and window browser including FF are OK. To see this happen join the website using URL above. Intentionally leave one of the required field blank. On such an error, the website store the previously input data in session variable (PHP) so the user doe not have to renter them, however in FF this is not done. The code previously worked fine. I have checked and rechecked and it seems to be an issue with the browser. The session name is unchanged so it is not creating a new session each time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try joining Socially using the above URL.
2. Intentionally leave a required field blank.
3. On submit the site tell you to go back and enter the missing field(s).
4. On going back, the page should show any data previously entered.
Actual Results:
The session variable should populate the form field with any data previously entered but doesn't.

Expected Results:
The form field should be populated with the previously input data.

The code wa working fine and still doe on other Mac browser and on Windows version of Firefox a well. For some reason FF is dropping the session value although the session variable are still set.
