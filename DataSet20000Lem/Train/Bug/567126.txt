When surfing craiglist, ad produce and display text and picture but phone number are missing. several ad missing phone numbers. number are displayed using internet explorer. this make search function of this site unusable with this browser. i do not know if it occurs with other sites.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I uninstalled firefox, cleared recycle bin, and reinstalled (windows 7)(1st comp)
2. Internet explorer continued to display numbers, firefox did not.
3. used another computer (2nd) in house, prior version of firefox, window vista sp1
4. tried running on 1st computer again (windows 7) using compatibility a a vista sp1 and a administrator.
5. tried a 3rd computer which is a laptop operating on vista but also an older version of firefox
Actual Results:
1. same result, no display of phone numbers.
2. no phone number displayed in firefox
3. firefox display phone number correctly.
4. firefox still did not display number (this made me believe it wa a firefox version issue rather than operating system.
5. firefox version display number correctly


I originally thought it might be a window 7 compatibility issue but clearly the prior version of firefox work correctly on 2 other computer using vista. internet explorer work correctly on all 3 but i prefer firefox and always have.
If memory serves, previous firefox version have worked on this window 7 computer which make me think that the issue is the newer version of firefox.

i hope this info helps. I know site such a craiglist are not the most emergent site but it is probably used by many customer and business that look for phone number there. Many business and people will not respond to email.

Thanks,

David
