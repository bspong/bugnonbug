User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0
Build ID: 20130409194949

Steps to reproduce:

I downloaded a couple of files.


Actual results:

The built-in download manager of Firefox didn't open, so I couldn't click on the downloaded file to start the files. Now I had to go to Downloads manually through Tools -> Downloads to open the file and clear the list of downloaded files. I researched it on Google and tried the opposite of what most people ask for on Google (most people hate the popping up of the Downloadmanager, and were advised to disable it in about:config). So I went to about:config searched for browser.download.manager and saw that .showWhenStarting wa set to True (see attached screenshot). So somehow Firefox ignores this setting, a the Download Manager doesn't show when starting the download.


Expected results:

The built-in download manager should've opened, so I have easy access to the just downloaded file and opening them. After that I should've been able to clear the list of recently downloaded files.
