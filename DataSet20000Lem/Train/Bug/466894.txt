recent browser/locales/Makefile.in change have broken mar generation for l10n
bug 458014 made some significant change to l10n repack code. During 3.1b2 I discovered that this ha completely broken MAR generation for l10n builds.

We generate MARs a follows:
make -C tools/update-packaging full-update DIST=`pwd`/dist/l10n-stage AB_CD=whatever MOZ_PKG_PRETTYNAMES=1

This will still generate a valid MAR but it will be missing a bunch of files, a our update_verify test found out:
calling QuitProgressUI

Only in target/Firefox/chrome: be.manifest
Only in target/Firefox/defaults/pref: firefox-l10n.js

This is blocking Firefox 3.1b2.
