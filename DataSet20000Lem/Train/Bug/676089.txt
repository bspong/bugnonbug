Cannot delete bookmarks/bookmark folder in Windows XP

Steps to reproduce:

THIS REPORT MAY BE SIMILAR TO BUG REPORT 265482, WHICH IS SHOWN AS "RESOLVED EXPIRED."

1. There are several redundant duplicate group of bookmark in the Bookmarks Menu which were automatically (and without my explicit permission) imported from Internet Explorer "Favorites."
2. Those at the top of the Bookmarks Menu, including a folder of Mozilla Firefox links, have erroneous URLs. Those in the duplicate group below may also have such erroneous URLs.
3. Attempted to delete the entire group by "Show All Bookmarks" and within that window to "organize" and under Organize to "Delete" the selected items.


Actual results:

4. When #3 above showed no bookmark (see a previous bug report I filed today), I attempted to delete the item bookmark or bookmark folder with erroneous URLs individually from the Bookmarks Menu using the Select --> Context Menu --> Delete method. Most of these were deleted. However, one folder and it associated subfolders and link could not be deleted. The top level folder is labelled "From Internet Explorer."
5. I did not attempt to delete (yet) the Mozilla Firefox folder and the link with erroneous URLs that it contains.


Expected results:

6. The folder "From Internet Explorer" should have been deleted when I clicked "Delete" on the Context Menu.
