Using DUN, FF always try to dial out, regardless of IE setting 'never dial a connection'
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

Should be consistent with IE setting: IE Tools/Internet Options/Connections. If
'Never dial a connection' is checked, FF should not attempt to dial out.
Currently, the only way to stop a dial out is by checking one of the dial-up
prompt settings, which mean that the dial-up user always ha to connect using
the password box for instance.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use dial-up ccn. Open IE and make setting 'never dial a connection'
2. Connect using DUN, then open url in IE. Close DUN.
3. Refresh page in IE - it doe not auto dial out like FF does, which can cause
user to have to pay for DUN connect if for example page auto-refresh and user
away from PC.

Actual Results:
NA

Expected Results:
Follow example of IE - for once it ha a superior operation ;-)

Suggest that FF ha this option included in it own Connection Settings perhaps
using the same registry entry that IE uses??
