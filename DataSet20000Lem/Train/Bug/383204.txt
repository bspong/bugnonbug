The sidebar label always open to history data, but doe not update the label to reflect this. So, you get the history item in the sidebar window, but the label still say "Bookmarks".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the browser, open bookmark in the sidebar
2. kill -9 the browswer
3. Start the browser, choose "Start a New Session"
4. Note that the sidebar's label doe not match it data.


Actual Results:
Label == Bookmarks while the Data == History.

Expected Results:
The label and the data will agree, AND whichever window wa opened before the crash will be restored after the crash. For example, if the Bookmarks sidebar wa opened, then the Bookmarks sidebar should be opened on restart.

This doe not happen if you choose "Restore Session". Also, this cannot be tested on window or linux because the browser doe NOT reopen the sidebar on window and linux when "starting a new session" from a crash (which is a different bug).
