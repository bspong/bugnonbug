Hi There -

Telebond is a software for professional video consultations. We give our user clean and straightforward way to share the screen and always show which stream (camera or screen) they are broadcasting to the other party. Users can turn on and off screen sharing without any obfuscation or indirect behaviour.

Please find the privacy notice on our term of use page: https://telebond.com/terms/#

I'd like to ask how the process actually works, if we are qualified to be whitelisted in Firefox browser doe it happen with the next release?

How much time doe it take usually to be whitelisted in the browser? We would like to inform our user and roll out the feature accordingly if it's possible to give a time frame for that.

Also we are open to any request you might think is required to conform with Firefox user experience.

Thanks,
Adam
