Find Updates for Add-ons ignores compatibility update if the add-on version number is not changed.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6

AMO allows developer to upgrade an add-on's compatibility without uploading a new version of the add-on. However, Firefox will not automatically update the add-on if the version number is the same. This force user to manually find and install the add-on. This can cause artificial add-on incompatibility for user upgrading to a new version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. You have an add-on compatible with say 3.0.
2. The developer up's the version limit on AMO to 3.6.
3. You upgrade to Firefox 3.6 and check Find Updates.
4. The add-on will be disabled and not update.
Actual Results:
When checking Find Updates, add-on with the same version but different compatibility are ignored.

Expected Results:
In the case that the user ha an add-on that is locally compatible with an OLDER version than their current version of Firefox, and the add-on exists on AMO with a higher compatibility but the same version number, the add-on should be updated. This should prevent artificial incompatibility and disabling of compatible add-on when upgrading Firefox.

In the case that the user ha an add-on that is locally compatible with their current Firefox, and the add-on exists on AMO with a higher compatibility but the same version number, the update should be ignored. This will prevent useless update downloads.
