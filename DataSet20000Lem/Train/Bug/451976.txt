The most recent occurrence of this wa when I opened the referenced URL. Quicktime came up with a dialog asking whether to upgrade (or something along those lines) and when I chose cancel, Firefox crashed. (I did send a crash report, if anyone want to try find it)

The problem itself is that after the reporting, when I chose to restore my session, the only tab a such that wa obviously opened wa the other one I had open. After a while however, I music started playing out of nowhere, and upon closing another, new, tab the content being rendered wa the site that caused the original problem, even though it wa not amongst my tabs.

Further experimentation showed that I could not close this "tab" either with shortcut key or from the menu. Also, despite not being on the main tab bar, it wa listed in the dropdown on the right. Selecting that did not provide a real tab. I can change to other tabs, and then the only way to return to this hidden one is to close some of the others so that the problem one receives focus at whatever point.

This ha happened at least once before, with a different site and if memory serf a different plugin causing the initial crash. Unfortunately I cannot recall the exact circumstance of previous occurrences.
