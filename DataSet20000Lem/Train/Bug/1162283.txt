Add support for limited hard-coded localization to Pocket
The in-product Pocket code is currently shipping hard-coded en-US strings, outside of the usual localizable places. We'd like to extend this to include Russian, Japanese, Spanish, and German. Also outside of the normal L10N flow, since this is an exceptional/special situation with a short timeframe.

Specifically, we currently have:

browser/base/content/browser-pocket.dtd
browser/base/content/browser-pocket.properties
browser/components/pocket/panels/js/dictionary.js

(Note that these are not under the usual /browser/locales/en-US/... tree.)

The short-tem fix here, a I understand it, will be to do the following:

1) Add browser-pocket-$LOCALE.properties file for ru/jp/es/de.

2) Add run-time detection (similar to the browser.pocket.useLocaleList check in CustomizableWidgets.jsm) to pick the correct .properties file to use.

3) Figure out a solution for doing effectively the same thing for the .dtd strings. I suspect it will be easiest to move these string to the .properties files, and do runtime DOM manipulation to jam them into the right place (menuitem label in the context menu / bookmark menu).

4) The dictionary.js file come from Pocket, but we probably need to suggest how to use the solution in #2 here so they can do the same.

The actual string for ru/jp/es/de are being localized in dependent bugs. We'll need to take care of landing the localized string into the right files.
