Email is created (in my office) and sent with IE (via att.net) with option "send
email to sent mail folder" checked yes. At home on XP laptop in the "sent mail"
folder in FIREFOX (yea) the email header is all OK but there is NO message in
the message area. Instead an attachment show up at the bottom saying
"multipart/alternatives (not readable)". I have to switch to IE (yuck) to read
the email text.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a XP PC with only IE - compose simple email (no attachments) Send off and
also store it in "sent mail" folder. ISP =att.net
2. On an XP laptop using FIREFOX read the "sent folder" email
3.See the email entry with OK header info BUT message area in empty
4. Looking at attachment and find one reading "multipart/alternatives (not
readable)
5. Cant see message so switch to IE and read the email OK in the message frams

Actual Results:
Explained above
Cant read email with FOREFOX can read it with IE when it wa composed in IE

Expected Results:
Opened the message and displayed it in the message frame a usual.

No craches FIREFOX is great except for this oddity
Will you give me info on what to do about this ?? I did read the reported bug
and used the keyword search but found nothing.
