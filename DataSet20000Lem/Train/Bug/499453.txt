If user is using different tab and site in 2 different browser windows, ONLY then this issue comes. Otherwise session Restore option is provided always if all the browsing is done in a single window with an "n" number of tab

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 2 Firefox window
2. Open different site in both of them and tab in both of them
3. Now the system should be restarted not properly but a it happens if electricity fluctuates or it restarts automatically, so to do this simply power off and power on from the Electricity Switch board button instantly, to create that scenario so that system restarts within the milisecond delay between voltage
Actual Results:
When the system restarts after scan disk when user log in and run FireFox it doe not ask for the Session Restore option but in fact simply load the homepage set.


Expected Results:
It should always ask for Session Restore and session history should always be maintained irrespective of number of window opened of browser. And also irrespective of different electricity fluctuation scenario's or abnormal restarts. It should always be the same in every case

My observation is that it happens a most of the temp file are cleaned and removed by the Scandisk that run during OS initialization
