browser_880164_customization_context_menus.js hand when running on a docker container in task cluster
the new taskcluster environment is pretty rad, except when trying to get an image up and running with all test passing.

We get closer every week to green tests, but we still have issues, here is an issue in browser-chrome: browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_880164_customization_context_menus.js. We actually get stuck at yield shownPromise here:
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_880164_customization_context_menus.js#209

you can see the log here:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=1d8d18bab88b&group_state=expanded&selectedJob=14958953&filter-searchStr=bc3

and you can reproduce this fairly easily by following instruction in the inspect task (there is a shell script that will reproduce on linux if you add in some magic v4l2loopback modprobe hack and --device args to docker run).

Anyway, I looked at this for a while and found that line 209 is where we hang. I run this locally on my linux64 desktop and it work fine, but inside the docker container (and possibly the different gnome-shell window manager or other settings) yield an internal timeout from the browser-chrome harness.

ideally this is something we can figure out and there is a root cause to solve the dozen or so test case timeouts we see. Worse case scenario we can figure this out and fix this one case.
