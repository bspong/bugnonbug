redesign of how we expose bookmark group / launching multiple tab from bookmark
Blake and I had a design meeting today and I'm capturing our note here for
discussion with the rest of the Phoenix team and implementation if pch and hyatt
agree.

Problems with bookmark groups:
1. no obvious and clearly discoverable way to create and use groups.
2. unclear how to represent them consistently in different location (prefs, bm
manager, bm menu, bm toolbar).

solution: get rid of bookmark groups. simplify the metaphor. go back to
something most user understand - folders.

implementations: for the bookmark menu, folder on the bookmark toolbar and
the new preference (start page) bookmark menu, we add a "open all in tabs" or
similarly named item at the bottom of each folder menu (probably put a separator
below the last bookmark).

This give u a simpler, more discoverable mechanism for loading multiple page
into tabs. It also eliminates the need to implement much more complicated and
le discoverable feature like "make this folder a bookmark group" and "open
one of the bookmark in this group".

downside:
this add an extra click to launching a group of tabs. this is a negative for
the handful of people that already understand how bmgroups work but we believe
this is a reasonable trade-off to expose the feature to the masses.
