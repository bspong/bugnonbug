After firefox ha been running for a long period of time (more than a day, it seems), clicking on a <select> input that ha a scroll bar will cause the window to lose focus. the selected option will take effect (sometimes accompanied by a javascript action), but the the window loses focus.

Quite tricky to track down because it depends on the length of time the application ha been running.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Let the application run for a day or more
2. Navigate to a site with a <select> input with a scrollbar
3. Click on the <select> menu and scroll downward and select an item


Actual Results:
Item is selected, but window loses focus--not sure what actually gain focus, if anything.

Expected Results:
item selected and window should retain focus.

a mentioned above, this depends on the length of time for which the application ha been running, so it's difficult to track down in that regard.
I'm running OSX 10.3.9
