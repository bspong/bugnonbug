sometimes, firefox report 'no document exists', sometimes, I can see the source
file through view source menu but firefox is waiting for something and doesn't
render the page. I save the source a local file and try to open it with
firefox. The result is same. I try to delete some line about stylesheet
reference and the page is rendered quickly. But with IE no problem at same
time. Only at this site I found the problem. Very seldom I can visit the site
with FF normally.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. type http://www.netbeans.org in the address bar.
2. click Enter.
3.

Actual Results:
The status bar show 'waiting for netbeans.org....', and sometimes a dialog
popup and say 'no document at this site', sometimes not any response, sometimes
after a long time , the page or part of it can be shown (very few) .

Expected Results:
render the page normally just like what IE can do at same time.
