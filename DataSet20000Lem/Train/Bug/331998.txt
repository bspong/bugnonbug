I am very sorry. I am a first time user of this web site and I could not follow or complete all the step above to prpperly fill out a Bug report.
So here is my report and hopefully it eill be registered.

I have a Mac G4 using OS 10.2.8
350 MHz Processor
320 MB Memory


I am using Firefox for my Web browser. I recently went from version 1.0.6 to version 1.5.0.1. After using it for a few day I noticed a couple problems.

1. When I used the bookmark pull down part of it content were not visible and I could see the page behind it. This happened once.

2. When I started to type in the Google Search space and the saved information box appeared, Firefox just hung there and I had to reboot my computer. This happened at least twice at the Google home page. It also happened at a web site, when the saved information box appeared when I started to type information on it page.(Ref.Bug report No. 330459)


I have uninstalled Firefox version 1.5.0.1 and reinstalled version 1.0.6 and the problem ha gone away.



Thanks,

Cesidio
