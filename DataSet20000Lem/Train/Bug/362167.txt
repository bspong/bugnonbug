I cannot edit text or create new thread in the program called "blackboard" on the page www.govhs.org when I click on "reply" or "edit" or "create new thread" it quits, taking all my other tab with it. This also happens when I try to play the online game on www.popcap.com It doesn't have any other problem downloading things, I can surf the web and download file just fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.govhs.org and log in (I don't know if you guy can do this without a username)
2.go to the "discussions" link and click to get into one of the thread
3.click the "Reply" button under the message shown (it doesn't matter which discussion thread you go into nor which message you try to respond to) and the page will start to load.
Actual Results:
You get half of an outline of the text editing box, but it stay that way for about a second and promptly quits, exiting out of all of my Firefox tab


Expected Results:
The page should have kept loading, and the page would have a box for typing text in, and about fifteen button for editing- text color, font, check spelling, etc. After you finish with your text, there should be button at the bottom for saving, exiting, and posting your comment.

I didn't touch anything with the controls, the window still look the same a it did when I first installed it. No matter where I am, what internet server I am using, the problem still happens. I have tried re-downloading Firefox and it still quits. If I use Safari, the page load just fine.
