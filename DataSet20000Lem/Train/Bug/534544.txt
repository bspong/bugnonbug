Whenever firefox is moved from the center of the screen, the drop-down menu get misaligned, sometimes putting it above the Firefox Window. Other time it stay within the Firefox window but is shifted over a few cm, making it misaligned.

Doesn't happen in Windows, but happens in FireFox 3.5.5 and 3.6 Beta 4

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Move the browser window down a few inch
3. Try using the awesome bar
4. If it look normal try moving it to the left or right more, then repeat
5. If it still look normal, try it in various corners, a sometimes it can look normal if only moved a few cm.
Actual Results:
The auto-complete/awesome bar became misaligned, making it hard to use it.

Expected Results:
The awesomebar should have dropped down directly under the URL bar

This happens using FireFox 3.5.5 with theme and without themes. Its definitely not plugins because I tried it with a clean install of 3.6.2 on a Macbook.
