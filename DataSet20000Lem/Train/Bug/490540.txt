In the latest Firefox update (Mac) the "Mouse Outside" event in Flash appears to fire and the Flash object loses focus, unless you actually click on the Flash component where it gain focus.

In the example, mousing over the Flash object should change the text to "Mouse Inside Flash" (with a counter) and moving off it to "Mouse Outside Flash".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the url provided and mouse over the Flash box

Actual Results:
No change to the Flash object to indicate it ha gained focus

Expected Results:
The text should change to 'Mouse Inside Flash: [counter]'

Flash Code:

var go:int = 0;
var come:int = 0;

box.mouseChildren = false;

stage.addEventListener(Event.MOUSE_LEAVE, going);
box.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_OVER, coming);

function going(e:Event):void {go++; box.txtBox.text = 'MOUSE OUTSIDE FLASH: ' + go;}

function coming(e:MouseEvent):void {come++; box.txtBox.text = 'MOUSE INSIDE FLASH: ' + come;}
