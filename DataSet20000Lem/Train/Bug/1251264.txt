Steps to reproduce:

Typed in the Search-Bar/Search-Interface.




Actual results:

Typing in the search-bar cause automatic opening of a dropdown-window filled with search engine icons.


Expected results:

A setting should exist to prevent a dropdown-window from automatically opening when someone type into the search-bar.

I often need to type bit and piece of information from the webpage I'm viewing into the search-bar. The dropdown often cover up webpage information that I am trying to input into the search-bar, and it is also distracting to have this dropdown-window opening every time I start typing. The end result is that I am constantly having to keep hitting the Esc key to make the search-bar hide itself and/or readjust the position of the webpage (if possible) to aid my copying activity.

I understand the rationale of the dropdown window for novice users, but it really is useless for user who make use of keywords. Further, one of the great thing about the search-bar is that it aid note taking, information transcription, and can serve a a static reference for holding onto information across page a one browses. The redesign of the search-bar that ha resulted in automatic opening of a dropdown window ha destroyed some of the efficiency and usefulness of the search-bar.

I kindly ask that a setting be added that will prevent the dropdown window from automatically opening when a user type into the search-bar.
