When I type things, the word always end up backwords. Like hi would turn out ih and computer would turn out retupmoc. What happens is when I type a letter, the typing cursor that show where you are typing go in front of the letter, not after it like it should. This only happens on FireFox. No other program have this problem (IE7, MS Word, etc)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close FireFox
2. Open FireFox again
3. Wait a while
Actual Results:
It happens again.

Expected Results:
The typing cursor should be behind the typed letter, in front of before. Like if I start typing hi, I type the h, and the typing cursor should be after the h so I can't type i and it'll be spelled correctly.

I use the default them. My Addons are AbBlock Plus, Download Status Bar, DownloadHelper, Undo Closed Tab, Colorful Tabs, and Faviconize Tab. I have used them all before on other computers, this computer, etc and they work fine.
This happened before but ha started happening everyday every time I open FireFox.

And down there I saw Severity, I said Major because it is very very annoying and I have tried to click after the letter, press end, or press the right arrow key, but it only work very little of the time.
