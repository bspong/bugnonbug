At the given url, there's flash plugin displayed at the top of the page (with
green background). When you move your mouse pointer over this plug-in it expands
and when you move your pointer out of it, it shrinks. Up to this everthing is
fine. The problem is when the plugin is in small (shrinked) mode, it doesn't let
the user to access the HTML element underneath the full mode area.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Try to click on the link below the flash plugin that is on top of the page.
(green background).
2.
3.

Actual Results:
You won't be able to access any HTML element just below the plugin, because
Firefox render them under the flash plugin. You can right click this region,
where you should see normal firefox menu but instead you will see macromedia
flash menu.

Expected Results:
When viewed with IE, this bug is not present and you can access these link
without problem.

The url provided is just an example. I have observed this in many other pages. I
have not tested it in Linux.
