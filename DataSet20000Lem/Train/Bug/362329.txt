Web Apps 1 ha clarified the definition of rel="alternate stylesheet" and the use of rel="alternate" for feed autodiscovery. It states:

| if it doe also contains the keyword stylesheet, the alternate keyword instead
| modifies the meaning of the stylesheet keyword in the way described for that
| keyword, and the rest of this subsection doesn't apply.

That mean the definition for autodiscovery which is specified later in that subsection doe not apply and a link like this should not be discovered.

<link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="application/atom+xml" href="/feed1" title="alternate stylesheet">
