Unsorted Bookmarks Missing After Firefox 3.0 Installed Over Firefox 2.0.0.2
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

After I installed Firefox 3.0 (with Firefox 2.0.0.2 in place), the Bookmarks > Organize Bookmarks menu function doe not display any "unsorted" bookmarks. For me, a a result, about 500 bookmark are missing!! Only the bookmark that I had previously stored in a folder are displayed. I have yet to discover whether the unsorted bookmark are still present in the profile data file, a I don't know which software other than Firefox 3.0 (or 2.x) will display it. This is YOUR product and I don't have the skill or resource to investigate it (and I don't have the time to make the effort) any further.

Are you aware that there is a report STILL PRESENT in your database that bookmark were lost while installing Firefox 1.0?? Apparently people are still posting "comments" to that bug report without realizing that the version is severely outdated, but it is clear from the long chain of comment that the problem ha NEVER been addressed for ANY VERSION of Firefox.
