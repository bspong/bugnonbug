On a valid and working (locally hosted) website: when a user enters the url "http://localhost" there is no corresponding request for "http://localhost/favicon.ico"; However if "http://127.0.0.1" or "http://{local machine name}" is requested then favicon.ico *is* requested, returned and displayed (location & tool bar). I can verify this by watching my apache access log and monitoring the GET requests. In *ALL* case the html content is requested, sent and displayed properly. Curiously, in the access log, apache show a requesting client IP (IPv6) address of ::1 when "localhost" is used; but IPv4 "127.0.0.1" or the IPv4 address of the resolved local machine (example: 172.16.0.2) when "http://127.0.0.1" or "http://{local machine name}" are used respectively.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Actual Results:

Expected Results:
made a GET /favicon.ico request
