After closing Firefox, when I click to reenter Firefox, a window come up saying Firefox is still running. I have to use Windows Task Manager to find Firefox.exe to close it before I can run Firefox again. This ha happened only since the newest version of Firefox wa installed.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Random occurrence - cannot reproduce. Step 1. Close Firefox.
2. Sometime later, click to open Firefox. Occasionally, window appears saying Firefox is already running. Firefox window won't open.
3. Close Firefox.exe via Task Manager.
Actual Results:
Once Firefox.exe is closed via tTask Manager, there is no problem in opening Firefox and everything function normally for a while until it randomly happens again.

Expected Results:
Every time Firefox is closed, it should no longer be running. Click to open the browser would then open, a it always did in the previous versions.

I haven't been able to detect any pattern. I suspected that it happened after using multiple tabs, but I could not reproduce the bug consistently to confirm it. Computer configuration is standard.
