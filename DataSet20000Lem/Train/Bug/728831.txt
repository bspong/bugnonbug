Don't expose the Firefox patch level (13.X.Y) in the UA string, only show the major version (13.X)
+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #572659 +++

Steps to reproduce:
1) Load http://www.delorie.com:81/some/url.txt

Actual results:
The User-Agent header expose the security patch level a either a minor version number or a an alpha/beta/pre indicator. This data is exposed twice: in the Gecko version and in the application version.

While it is of value to expose this data to e.g. AMO, exposing it to all site make the browser more fingerprintable (see https://panopticlick.eff.org/ ) and doesn't serve a purpose more important than user privacy. Point release don't change functionality beyond security and stability fixes, so site shouldn't be sniffing the patch level anyway.

Making trunk, alpha and beta build look like release build for sniffing purpose reduces sniffing-related failure that waste time when treated a functionality-related regression by mistake.

Expected results:
Expected the version number to show the major version of the most recent Firefox beta that Mozilla ha shipped and not to show the security patch level or an alpha/beta/pre indicator.

Additional information:
Internet Explorer doesn't expose the security patch level in it UA string.
