Images with height/width set by CSS loading unreliably.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040608 Firefox/0.8.0+

On the following page, the image load unreliably. For example, when the page
is viewed the various image (with height/width set in CSS) may load, or may not
load, but it is not a case of them either all loading or all not loading. On
each reload the pattern changes, some loading that didn’t load before, others
that loaded before not loading.

I have seen this problem in earlier Firefox builds, but I do not recall how long
it ha been around (I think it is relatively new). I tested in Mozilla 1.7a and
1.7rc3 and wa not able to duplicate the problem. The problem doe not occur in
Safari or Internet Explorer 5.x for Macintosh.

Images CSS is set in header:

<style type="text/css" media="screen">
<!--
.disp img { width: 100px; height: 79px; }
.tblt { margin-bottom: 0; }
.tblb { margin-top: 0; }
-->
</style>

Sample image from mentioned page:

<p><a href="javascript:;"
onclick="javascript:new_window('zhaoyun.jpg','',540,483);"><img
src="/dw4/i/portraits/zhaoyuns.jpg" alt="Zhao Yun" border="1" /></a><br />
Zhao Yun</p>

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

2. View page, reload to review.

Actual Results:
Images may or may not load, but the behavior is inconsistent. Furthermore, it
is not simply a matter of all image loading, or not loading.

Expected Results:
All image load.
