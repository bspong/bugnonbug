Firebug theme: fix CSS for rule view property
This is a follow up for bug 1274760

One more thing!
The rule that follows at the end of the change:

.theme-firebug .ruleview-enableproperty:not([checked]) ~ .ruleview-computedlist * {
color: #CCCCCC;
}

seems wrong. The reason for that is that .ruleview-enableproperty and .ruleview-computedlist are not sibling since Firefox 40 (they were sibling in Firefox 39). The rule is intended to make gray the listed (sub) property from a shorthand property when that shorthand property is disabled. Given these are not sibling any longer it is hard to fix this with just css. The best I am able to do is to replace the rule with:

.theme-firebug .ruleview-overridden > * > .ruleview-computed:not(.ruleview-overridden),
.theme-firebug .ruleview-overridden > * > .ruleview-computed:not(.ruleview-overridden) > .ruleview-propertyname,
.theme-firebug .ruleview-overridden > * > .ruleview-computed:not(.ruleview-overridden) > .ruleview-propertyvalue {
color: #CCCCCC;
}

This work for me but ha a problem when disabling a property overridden in another rule. In such case, it will not apply until inspecting another node.
