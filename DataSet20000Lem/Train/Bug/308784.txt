A white area with the dimension of 150 px in height by 482 pixel in width appears in all browser window after system sleeps.

Usually I will have multiple page open for later reference. I will leave my
laptop on playing a playlist in Audion. Everything is hidden except the desktop.

After a while, the system will sleep, either because it's out of power, or
because an hour ha passed. When I wake up later and reactivate the laptop, all
open page have this white area in them (top left-hand corner of the screen).

Tried refreshing the pages, but the blank area would not go away.

Also, there were no application open at the time that had any window open in
that area of the screen.

To get rid of the problem, I restarted the browser; next time, I'll simply try
closing all tab and see if that doe anything.

This ha happened twice now since I installed the new build.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open several tabbed web page in Firefox (perhaps add another window with
it's own tab a well)
2. Create a playlist in Audion and play it (I wa using old Coast to Coast AM
shows)
3. Allow system to sleep
4. Revive system after an hour or so

Actual Results:
I have not used these step per se, but that is what I did when the problem
initially arose (twice now).

Expected Results:
Firefox 1.06 simply display the page without that white area.

The build I'm using doe not have any theme installed.

System information: 14" Macintosh G4 iBook with 768MB of RAM, running MacOSX
10.3.9.

Tomorrow I plan to upgrade the RAM to 1GB; should the problem still occur, I
will add a comment (after closing all window before restarting the browser,
that is).
