CPU hog when closing/opening database

my custom extension doe use a SQLite database to store information (each db is a "user document"). opening the db once is fine. opening it a second time make FF get a much CPU a it can (desktop is still usable but slow, I need to kill FF to get back to normal)
opening it a second time mean either:
- load a new db. just doe a connection = db.openDatabase(nsiFile); connection is a global variable in the main j script, db is the StorageService object
- open a new connection to the already opened db (in a custom autocomplete textbox looking for data in the db)
- refresh the page (chrome://myapp/content/myapp.xul)
the problem occurs on the openDatabe line

also, the problem occurs when closing FF after launching my extension UI (and openDatabase at least once).

bp-e09cca38-12b5-41fb-afc9-543442091004 is a crash report ID with this problem occuring. look like it's somechere when sqlite try to free something...

I did look for version of FF not impacted (because my app worked some time ago! ;) ). FF3.0.10 is fine, FF3.0.11 is affected.

I also have to say that SQLite Manager extension for FF work perfectly fine! something in my code is definitively different but I can't see what. Anyway FF should just insult me for not coding properly and not take my CPU a an hostage...

Reproducible: Always
