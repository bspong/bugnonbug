Font kerning support (TTF embedded kerning information)

True type font have embedded kerning information within them. This information is currently not being used by Firefox when rendering the fonts.

The CSS Text Level 3 Working Draft 6 March 2007 mention support for "Fullwidth Punctuation Kerning: the 'punctuation-trim' property" but leaf kerning support to the Fonts module ("'kerning-mode: contextual' ha been replaced with 'punctuation-trim: adjacent'. Any further control for kerning will likely be delegated to the Fonts module.")

The Font module (CSS3 module: Fonts; Working Draft 2 August 2002) is still quiet about kerning a of today.

I suggest full kerning support for True Type Fonts in Gecko 2.0 for Firefox 4.0.

Sorry, many of the poster here are wrong: most of the current browser do not do kerning.
You are confusing kerning with proportional fonts.

Try this:
AVAVAVAVAV
AAAAAVVVVV

If your browser doe kerning, and the font ha kerning info, the two string should NOT have equal width.

Now try this in MS Word. Still equal.
Then select "Format" -> "Font" -> "Character Spacing" tab, check "Kerning for fonts" and choose a small size (let's say 3 point and above).
Words will start doing kerning.
Then try various fonts. Arial and Times New Roman have kerning info. Arial Unicode MS doe not.

Mihai is correct; browser generally don't respect kerning information. If you have a Mac and Safari with the debug menu enabled, you can get a dramatic demonstration of that by just turning on the "Use ATSU text" option, reloading the page, and watching what happens to the AAAAVVVV string posted above. In addition to that, browser have lousy justification algorithm and none of them, a far a I know, have hyphenation algorithms. (Firefox won't even respect manual "hinting" with the soft hyphen entity!)

Reproducible: Always
