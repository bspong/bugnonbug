I often receive the message that a specified website cannot be found even though it is a valid address
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.8

Often when following a hyperlink on a web page or clicking an address in my
bookmarks, I receive a popup message that the specified page cannot be found
even though I know it is a valid page. For example, I oftern get this message
with www.globeandmail.com even though this is a major website and is definately
not down. The problem is not consistant and often the browser will follow the
link and display the page after clicking two or three times. I don't believe
this problem is related to my internet access a it happens both at work and at
home over two seperate providers. I have never noticed a similar problem with IE
displaying the same pages.
