I have the newest version of Firefox and I'm very annoyed with it. When I try to open up Firefox, it take 1 - 2 minute just trying to open up on my laptop. Also, when i am on any site, it take forever to load up, especially if there is a java or adobe reader that also need to load on the page. I know it is not the actual website and it is not my connection because I've re-downloaded the new Firefox and have run Internet Explore which run better than Firefox. Why is it running slow and what can i do to fix it?
