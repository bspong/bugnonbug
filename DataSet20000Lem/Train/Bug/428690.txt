When you visit page or bookmark whose URL redirects to another page, two entry are added to the "History" menu. One entry display the title of the page that is eventually loaded (as expected), but the other entry show the path or filename of the URL that wa originally called.

This also occurs when clicking item from the "Latest Headlines" live bookmark (http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/default.stm) or RSS feed served by FeedBurner (e.g. http://feeds.feedburner.com/BurnThisRSS2). In both cases, the feed item are URL redirects.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click the "Getting Started" bookmark on the bookmark toolbar (or visit http://www.mozilla.com/products/firefox/central.html)
2. Wait for the page to finish loading
Actual Results:
Note two new item atop the "History" menu
central.html
Firefox Central | Mozilla

Expected Results:
Only one new item should be in the "History" menu
Firefox Central | Mozilla

This also occurs in Firefox 2 when manually typing in address that redirect. However, if you click a link or bookmark in Firefox 2 that redirects, only one entry is added to the "History" menu, which is the expected behavior.
