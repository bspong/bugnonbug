Clean up firefox branding in the build system
The organization of the branding stuff irks me every time I touch it... The Firefox (release) bit are in /other-licenses/branding/firefox, and the generic (pre-release) branding is in /browser/branding/unofficial, but the nightly (Minefield) branding is scattered all over. This lead to a number of special case in the build for nightly v release/prerelease. And I'm always scared that make some change that work for nightly build but will explode in release builds.

So, I've reorganized thing to make this simpler. There should be no difference in the bit user get; this is all just build-side changes.

* All the scattered nightly bit move into /browser/branding/nightly (which is currently empty sans 1 file). This tree now becomes identical (in layout) to /other-licenses/branding/firefox and /browser/branding/unofficial.

* MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY is now always set. It default to /browser/branding/nightly. This also remove the need for the OFFICIAL_BRANDING and MOZ_USE_GENERIC_BRANDING hacks.

* Simplify $MOZ_BRANDING_DIRECTORY/Makefile.in. All it really doe is copy file into $dist/branding/. There were a few case of file being renamed a they're copied, I've moved that into browser/app/Makefile.in (so it's done in one place instead of each branding flavor).

* Fixed a few file permission that didn't need to be executable (their different color in my shell's l output wa irritating me).
