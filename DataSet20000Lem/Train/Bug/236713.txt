This problem can happen anywhere in the Ars Technica forums. But occurs rarely
due to the situation required to cause the crash.

When logged into the forum, there is an option to "edit" your existing posts.
The button/link launch a popup window using Javascript. The first popup
window work fine. But if you attempt to click the same button/link or click a
similar "edit" link, Firefox attempt to spawn another popup window, but
crash the application instead.

Here is an example of the HTML that cause the problem:
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="javascript:sizePopup
('reply','http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?
a=em&s=50009562&f=67909965&m=844003222631&x_popup=Y','open');">

The code for the sizePopup() function can be found in this script:

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
To try this on the Ars Technica forum, you will have to have a user account and
be logged in. ( http://episteme.arstechnica.com )
1. Create a post/reply in any forum.
2. Try to edit the post after you create it.
3. With the "edit" box still open, click the edit post link again.

Actual Results:
Browser crash

Expected Results:
I am not sure what *should* happen, but IE6 just spawn a new window in place
of the old one. Whether Firefox should do the same or spawn an entirely new
window is debateable.

Not sure how to classify this. It doe cause the browser to crash, but I don't
run into the problem all that often. At some level this is a normal to minor
problem, but the fact that it crash the browser while I am in the middle of a
forum post (losing my whole post) make it kind of major to me.
