When using the Webcomic Reader userscript with the Scriptish addon to read a comic for a long period of time (Hundreds of pages), Firefox crashes. This is probably because Webcomic Reader preloads the next X page of the comic for easy reading, but never unloads any pages, and eventually some kind of internal limit is breached. This crash is very reproducable, and only occours on a "page turn" by clicking the "next page" button created by the Webcomic Reader userscript. Easy to reporduce, but very slow. I will attempt to pin down exactly how many page are in memory when FFx crashes, but if it is a memory issue this will likely not help much, a individual page on mangafox.com vary in size greatly. Crash may be triggered by attempting to display the next preloaded page, or perhaps by attempting to preload one more page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Scriptish or Greasemonkey and the Webcomic Reader userscript from http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/59842
2.Open a long manga on mangafox.com, such a http://www.mangafox.com/manga/hajime_no_ippo/v01/c001/1.html
3.Read for an hour or so
Actual Results:
CrashyMcCrashCrash on "Next Page"

Expected Results:
Displayed the next page.

Although this is a userscript crash, I reported it here because I don't really think it should be possible to crash FFx with JS, under ideal conditions. Here's to ideal conditions!

Not sure if this is Normal or Critical, a it's a crash, but it will occour to very few people, unless the bug is triggered by other scripts/activities.
