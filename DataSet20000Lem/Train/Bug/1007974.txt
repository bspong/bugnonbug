[new tab page] Create & test privacy solution for Tiles for user with DNT enabled
We know that Firefox user - a many a 18% - have enabled Do Not Track (DNT) in Firefox. Our goal in New Tab's Directory Tiles (DT) is that:

a. DNT user feel their choice and privacy is being respected at all time with DT
b. DNT user feel in control of their data with DT
c. DNT users' wish are respected with regard to DT
d. DNT user aren't negatively surprised by DT

It's arguable that what DT doe by directing user to site with a referral link doesn't fall under DNT, but not all user will feel this way. Indeed, the exact expectation of behavior blocked by DNT will likely vary by user, making it important to know DNT users' expectation and sentiment around Tiles and making sure we're being consistent in our policy and messaging.

We're proposing creating an A-B study in which we try a few variation of DT behavior for DNT user on beta with telemetry enabled. The goal will be to obtain data both in user response to the alternatives, and also user sentiment on the alternatives.

The possible alternative are:

1. Turning DT off for all DNT user
2. Leaving DT on for all DNT user and saying nothing (not an option we'd consider)
3. Defaulting DT on for DNT users, but asking if they'd like to turn it off
4. Defaulting DT off for DNT users, but asking if they'd like to turn it on

The kind of data at stake in DT are:

i. Impression data: The number of time user simply see DT. This data is sent once a day, so potentially if a user see DT and then opts out, nothing would be sent.
ii. Click-through data via code. For now not tile-specific, will be in the future.

As a first step, I'll be sketching a few alternative for #3 and #4 above, and after gaining feedback, we'll be developing a few to A-B & user sentiment test.
