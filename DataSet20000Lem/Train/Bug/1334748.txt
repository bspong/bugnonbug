Steps to reproduce:

In Ubuntu, software updater update once a week. I ran a standard update, and noticed it contained a Firefox update. My homepage is Google, and it opened a black and white with no text (see image). I restarted with add on disabled (safe mode), and still no text. When I type in the Google search field, nothing show up.

I tried some other websites, and still nothing. The only one that work ha no text, www.purple.com.

Another weird thing is that when you open a tab, like troubleshooting info, then switch back to the Google tab, the Google tab now show the troubleshooting page.

Something is really wrong. I hate having to try a reset because it screw everything up, if it even will fix this, and I don't think user should have to reset because of a new version.


Actual results:

Broken, see above.


Expected results:

It should have opened like the normal Google search page, with a white background and text. When I type in the Google search field, it should show the text I am typing.
