Logfiles from Maintenance Service

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:21.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/21.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130511120803

Steps to reproduce:

I tried to update from Firefox Version 21 to Version 22 using the menu item Help-> About Firefox.

I tried to resolve the problem which ha some parallel to Bug 716915 and 715910, so here are the answer to the trivial questions:
- Before applying the update update.status contains "pending"
- Updates get applied when I click Yes on the UAC prompt
- "Use a background service to install updates" is checked.
- I'm running a an admin.
- about:config the calue app.update.service.errors is no existent
- in opposite to Bug 715910 a command prompt executing "net start MozillaMaintenance" I can see that the permission are set fine:

> The Mozilla Maintenance Service service is starting.
> The Mozilla Maintenance Service service could not be started.
> The service did not report an error.
> More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3534.

- maintennaceservice.exe is not missing (Bug 716915)




Actual results:

The update is downloaded and I'm asked to restart Firefox in order to appy the update. When restarting the UAC of Windows 7 asked me if I want to allow firefox.exe to apply the update.

If I update Thunderbird the behaviour is the same. The Mozilla Maintenance Service is simply not used.


Expected results:

The UAC schould not appear, because the maintenanceservice is installed and activated.
