This is major. Accidentally closing the browser during customization of the toolbar could lead to loss of everything on the toolbars, including any previous customizations. (That's how I found this bug...)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a single browser window.
2. Right-click on the toolbar, and click Customize.
3. In the customization dialog, make a change (I removed the home button, but the actual change is not important. This happens with any sort of change here).
4. Without dismissing the Customize Toolbar dialog, close the main browser window (which should be the only browser window). Firefox exits.
5. Restart the browser. Note that all toolbars are emptied, except from the menu bar. This includes the throbber, location bar, search bar, toolbar buttons, and bookmark toolbar items, if visible.
6. Invoke the Customize Toolbar again. The removed item are there: start adding them again to make your browser more useful.
Actual Results:
*All* toolbar item are removed.

Expected Results:
The closing of browser window should be dealt with gratefully, and the change made in step 3 should get saved, which is the same a the behavior of the case where the Customize Toolbar dialog is closed without clicking Done.
