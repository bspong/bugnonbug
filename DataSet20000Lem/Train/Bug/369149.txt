Hi;

I've noticed two problem with the combination of Ubuntu 6.10 and Firefox 2.0.0.1

Both seem to happen or be the most visible on the digg.com web site.

1. When a submit a story on digg.com, a special yellow box come up. Typing text in that box is extremely slow. Sometimes I can count to 1, slowly, or 2 from the time I type until the time I see text appear.

2. If I am listening to music on totem while reading digg, the music will be temporarily cut off if I click on a link in digg.

I downloaded Opera 9.10 through synaptic. I tested it in the same situation and had neither problem. While I could not use totem on my window xp box at work, I did not have similar problem to #1 or #2 with Fire Fox 2.0.0.1 on my window box.

I have a high speed cable connection at home.

I am not sure if this issue is an Firefox issue, an Ubuntu issue, or something resulting from the combination of both
