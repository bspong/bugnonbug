when dragging an img element of a web page (simulating drag'n'drop of html element using onmouse event and position:relative) with Firefox 1.5 (and Firefox 1.6a1) you can drag the image only for a very limited distance from the original position, after this distance the mouse cursor change from the classic arrow to the 'stop' cursor, and drag fails.
If you release the left mouse button at this time the image you're dragging reappears attached to the mouse cursor and remains stick to it.
It happen only with image elements, not happens with other element (buttons, inputbox, divs, spans, table etc...)
It not happen in Mozilla Browser 1.7.12 Mozilla
Mozilla 1.7.12

Work perfectly (tested) on Mozilla 1.7.12, FireFox 1.0.4, Firefox 1.0.7, Internet Explorer 6.1 sp1


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.opens the test.html page attached to this bug
2.try to "drag" the little icon in the left table (press and hold left mouse button over the icon, and drag it over the web page)
3.after you move far from the starting point the mouse cursor change and you are not enable to drag the item anymore (if you release the button the icon reappers attached to the mouse cursor causing a mess)

Actual Results:
after you move far from the starting point the mouse cursor change and you are not enable to drag the item anymore (if you release the button the icon reappers attached to the mouse cursor causing a mess)

Expected Results:
I expect this method work like the classical drag'n'drop window system.
You can see the right behaviour by watching the page with Internet Explorer 6.1, or Mozilla 1.7.12 or Firefox 1.0.4 or later (works since 1.0.7)
