I think this started happening after I updated to beta 5. When I open a large menu (such a bookmark menu), the selector (blue highlight) lag behind the mouse cursor significantly. While it is only a matter of millisecond when it catch up, it still give an application a laggy feel, like it's struggling to complete such simple operation a selecting a menu item. This happens in any menu (including right click pop-up menus), but particularly noticeable in large menus, such a bookmark menu with lot of bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a lot of bookmark to bookmark top-level menu.
2. Click to open the bookmark top-level menu.
3. Move the mouse quickly up and down the menu and observe the menu selector trying to follow the mouse.
Actual Results:
The selector lag behind the mouse. Lots of CPU power is consumed (up to 50% on my 2 core CPU).

Expected Results:
The selector always stay at the mouse cursor. No significant CPU resource are consumed.
