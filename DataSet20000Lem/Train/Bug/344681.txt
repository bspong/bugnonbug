Greetings,

While researching vulnerability in popular RSS & Atom Web Clients, SPI Labs ha discovered multiple
issue within your product 'Firefox 1.5.0.4'. The Atom renderer allows an attacker to inject and execute
JavaScript in the 'DIV' tag. This allows for 'Remote' zone/context execution.

Example:

<div class="info" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<script>alert('Feed Div Class Tag')</script>
</div>



When a feed containing this script is presented to the user it will execute. Extensive
testing of each tag wa not performed and other field may also be affected.



Remote Zone Risks
When a reader is vulnerable in the remote zone you are substantially limited in what you can do,
however there are still many thing that can be done such as:


Cross-site request forgery
An attacker can utilize cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) attack in various way to
make your machine send request to a website in order to possibly execute commands. For example:

<img src="http://www.mystocktradersite.com/transaction.asp?sell=google&buy=Microsoft&numshares=1000">


Potential to Launch Attacks
Since attacker can send request to other sites, they could potentially trick your browser into carrying out
Web-based attack on their behalf. These attack could cause Denial of Service Conditions in the remote site,
or if the site is vulnerable, execute command on it. Here an attacker's advantage is that client IP will be logged
and any resulting investigation by the victim may lead to them instead of to the attacker.


Common approach to dealing with this issue are a follows

* Disabling script execution during the web feed presentation phase
* Stripping out < and > characters, or not converting &lt; and &gt; for presentation

We tried emailing the security email address and received no response so we're posting this here. Please let u know if you have any additional questions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an Atom feed
2. Insert the following into your div element

3. View the feed with Firefox, or a Mozilla based browser

Actual Results:
JavaScript is executed. You strip it in some place but not all.

Expected Results:
Common approach to dealing with this issue are a follows
* Disabling script execution during the web feed presentation phase
* Stripping out < and > characters, or not converting &lt; and &gt; for presentation
