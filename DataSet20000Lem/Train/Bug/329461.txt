This is the “Bug”
When I open up multiple webpage on my desktop in their own windows, I find that, "If I am in the middle of downloading a file with Firefox at that time, it result in a movable however non-settling webpage, once you let go of the mouse button. When I let go of the mouse button once I have the webpage where I want it. Instead of stopping and anchoring itself, the webpage will snap back directly and then align itself 100% Perfectly above and totally covering the secondary webpage beneath it. All effort after this to drag the page and make it stay somewhere off of the secondary page below it to allow reading and viewing of the page result in just the topmost webpage snapping right back to cover the page below it completely. Repeating this notion over and over to different part of the desktop did not result in any improvement. And I have a 24" Screen running at 1920*1440 dpi too. Lotsa desktop space.

I did however just started noticing today, that it seems to just be happening while or if an internet Download is in progress USING the browser. This did not happen before Firefox 1.5. only after the upgrade. I do notice that the upgrade ha made Firefox way more compatible with window a well a ,”THEIR,” version of Java than before, however when it come to cross-platform compatibility and problem arising from the use of Windows platforms. It is a moot point. However I also noticed a big decrease in compatibility with Adobe Golives' CS2 inline frames, However it did become much more compatible with Dreamweaver MXs' feature a well a functions. It did cause me to recode 2 complete website into the new DreamweaverMX Platform. However I must admit that this did result in much cleaner coded, faster loading website, And total customer satisfaction of course. Thanks!
