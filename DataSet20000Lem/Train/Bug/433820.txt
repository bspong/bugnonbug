Bookmarks layout is NOT productive. Tags are buried and not immediately visible.

While adding bookmark I had to click a drop down arrow to select a tag for each bookmark. EVERY SINGLE TIME. I even looked for a hidden option to change this. I found NONE.

No matter how I tried to save bookmark (with tags, without tags, unsorted or in a folder) I could not access my tag without going 4 folder deep.

***This doe not seem to be a bug, But a very serious design flaw.***

At first I thought I could work around this, I tried to 'Organize Bookmarks'
I wa not able to move the tag or folder to the main list.

This seriously hinders the productivity of this internet browser!
I am sure I am not the only one. Now that I am heard... Please fix this or at least let u customize how Firefox operates with my bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.select bookmark from the menu
3.created tag are not displayed! They are buried under 4 menus.


Expected Results:
When I add a bookmark aka Ctrl-D I expect le than 2 clicks.
For example...
I wanna bookmark this page.
[Ctrl-D]
[type in name of tag]
[enter]
Done.

Or how about...
[Ctrl-D]
[click an existing tag]
[enter]
Done.

Ok, Now I want to review a page I have bookmarked previously...
[Click bookmarks] or [Ctrl-B]
[select my folder or tag]
[click the link] and page begin to load
Done.

Now if you can bring that back I will reload Firefox 3 and try again.
If this current clutsy bookmark interface make it into a release of Firefox 3 I will be very Pissed off.

I also do not like not being able to delete folder such a 'Smart Bookmarks'
If the user doesn't want let them delete it. When software is made to force user ie not let them customize it to fit them it usually forks.

What wa wrong with the old way of handling tag in Firefox 2 ???

'Bookmark Tags'
