I noticed a memory leak when viewing a HUGE forum thread (NSFW; that's why I put a random replacement one in the URL field).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
- View the thread linked above, or try with another random forum thread of your choice.
- You may have to switch to "print view" to reproduce the issue.
- Open Task Manager (Windows) and monitor the increasing RAM usage.
- Switch to another tab without closing the original tab and see what happens.
- Also notice the behavior if you ARE on the new tab and just left the other forum thread open.

Actual Results:
While scrolling around in the huge thread (1 single page), memory climb and climbs. (I noticed it today when I just accidentally left the thread open the other day and had 800 MB (!!) memory usage and Windows fired away an alarming "Out Of Resources".

Expected Results:
Mem usage must not increase that insanely when viewing a STATIC (!) page. Again, I affirm that the page is neither reloading nor continously loading more thread below.

- Switching to a nearby tab (normally) will cause the insane memory usage to drop down by a great extent (yet NOT stop the leaking of memory).

- If you switch to a nearby tab but you leave the forum thread open (but the tab inactive), this will not affect the behavior of the memory leak: memory use might likewise easily reach the 1 GB boundary after some time, although nothing wa reloaded or loaded additionally to the current content.

- Issue wa reproducible in either of 4.0 (last betas), 4.2a1pre and my current test build 6.0a1.
