My extension provides an XML document via an XPCOM interface provided through a global constructor. It load an XHTML application which then ha access to this XML document via a "helper" instance much like how feed subscription is handled. This all work just fine in Firefox 3.0 but doe not in 3.5. It directly relates to privilege issue a the error never happens for privileged extension code. What doesn't make sense is that it work for short random amount of time and then fails. You would think it would either (A) fail due to permission or (B) consistently work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load my extension (0.3) from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/13493
2. Use the Tools->"XML Application - Sample Document" to load a sample.
3. Hit the 'Hello' button several times. It should fail within le than a minute and most certainly after only a handful of button presses.
4. Look at the error console and you should see a "NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED" error.
Actual Results:
An NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED wa thrown from accessing _helper.document.documentElement.localName

Expected Results:
No error should be thrown.

Any access to certain DOM property will fail after awhile (e.g. firstChild, documentElement, etc.). The initially work and always work in 3.0.
