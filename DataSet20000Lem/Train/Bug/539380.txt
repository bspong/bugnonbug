When I log into site a myspace.com, or billboard.com, firefox will always show an error saying that it "expected declaration but found ' . ' . Skipped to the next declaration" and it will not show much on the page. Most of the page will appear blank.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

page like billboard.com will only show the top portion of their site and the rest will not appear at all and Firefox will say the page is done loading. When I try to access Myspace.com, some text and graphic dont show up and display right. The error console say that a "declaration wa either skipped or it wa dropped."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.type in myspace.com or billboard.com
3.when directed to those pages, Firefox will automatically not show the full page and it will not properly display some graphic
Actual Results:
Same thing happened, nothing changed and I'm up to date on the newest Firefox and add-on versions.

Expected Results:
The software should have loaded those page properly like before. I'm stuck using the lame "Internet Explorer" right now because that properly display everything.

I really like Firefox and I'm hoping someone can help me so that I can continue to use Firefox. It worked properly before, it just started acting like this 3 day ago and I've tried everything, even uninstalling it and re-installing it and nothing worked. Please Help, and Thank you in advance.
