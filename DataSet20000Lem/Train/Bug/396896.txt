When you code a website in html, and give width and height, you can do two different option percentage or pixel width, this is not displayed correct.
Look at the website rabobank.nl and at the word inlogge which need to have an N at the end or klant worde, which also need an N at the end. The same applies for inline frame that are not displayed correct. I thougt bug would have been solved already, this is a common known issue, to me, when nobody else know this.

P.s. Currently I do not use firefox 2.03 because it only 64 bit but I can assume that the problem is still the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.firefox 2.0
2.http://www.rabobank.nl
3.read carefully the detail klantworde

Actual Results:
I can also sent an attachement with an inline frame which ha these problems.

Expected Results:
Better support for pixel width or percentage, better both supported.

Display the correct width
