If you leave the import bookmark dialogue box open it is imposable to auto scroll.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page that ha vertical scroll bar
2. Open the bookmark manager
3. Open the import bookmark dialogue but leave it open
4. Go back to the page with vertical scroll bar and middle click

Actual Results:
Middle clicking did nothing, however the scroll wheel still works.

Expected Results:
Either the browser should force me to finish importing bookmark before I go
back to browsing. Or I should be able to middle click to auto-scroll.

You can use any dialogue box that is generated by the bookmark manager.
password manager
searching for bookmark
download manager
creating a new bookmark
switching profile

Preforming the step to reproduce and middle clicking on a link preforms the
correct function loading the link in a new window or tab.

I wa able to produce this behavior in FireFox 0.8 and Mozilla 1.6.
