After typing a URL into the location bar and pressing Alt+Enter to open that URL
in a new tab, the tab that wa active when pressing Alt+Enter ha it location
bar URL incorrectly set to the typed value. Note that the new tab is opened
with the correct URL and it location bar behavior seems normal.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to some website (URL-a) in a given tab (Tab-a).
2. Type a new URL (URL-b) into the location bar and press Alt+Enter to open it
in a new tab.

Actual Results:
Tab-a ha had it URL-a replaced with URL-b in the location bar.
Tab-b correctly ha URL-b in the location bar.

Expected Results:
Tab-a should still have URL-a in the location bar.

Note that this behavior make sense if Tab-a is a new, empty tab. This is most
likely a regression due to the fix for bug 203102.

I realize that you can hit Esc within the location bar when Tab-a is active and
URL-a will be restored. It is incorrect, IMO, since I'm not changing the "URL"
that I want associated with that tab (e.g. for a bookmarklet or something), but
am creating a new tab entirely. If I wasn't opening a new tab, I would expect
Tab-a to have whatever I've typed in the location bar.
