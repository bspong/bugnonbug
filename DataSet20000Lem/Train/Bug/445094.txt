Return of Son of unix/packages-static Cleanup, Part Deux
Created attachment 329393
Fix v.1

This is mostly another try at the Linux half of bug 398855, which got bounced out of the tree for probably spurious reason (since the nightly and build log both show all these file a "possible missing or unnecessary" and thus don't have or package them, it's hard to imagine them needing them, and I'm pretty sure unit test machine don't ever do anything that would touch packages-static). To recap:

* I finally noticed that packages-static is preprocessed, so we don't have to
see the error from non-libxul file on libxul builds, or t'other way around

* progressDlg.xpt bit the dust in bug 391870, which sent it into exile in xpfe.

* bug 392845 set the precedent to get rid of packaging for extension that we
hate, by removing two of the three bit for xml-rpc, so I'm adding in the
missed nsDictionary.js from it, and websrvcs.xpt from bug 332174

* helperAppDlg.xpt is actually found in exthandler.xpt

* necko_jar.xpt wa removed by bug 248044, re-added by aviary-landing

* search.xpt is only build for MOZ_SUITE

* platform-forms.css wa removed by bug 272151

* pipnss.jar only contains a contents.rdf we don't build

* jsconsole.xpt went away in bug 243170, but it missed the unix/packages-static

* xremoteservice.xpt should have left Fx in bug 280725

* nsInterfaceInfoToIDL.js is apparently a part of websrvcs that wasn't ever
packaged on Windows, only *nix

* mozgnome.xpt moved into xpcom_system.xpt in bug 354075

New since the last time:

* even though we try to package it twice, libauth.so isn't going to come out of where LIBXUL_LIBRARY stick it

* DOMi isn't there for Linux any more than it is for Windows

That leaf the intractable existing-profile-defaults.js, oji.xpt that I'm getting rid of in bug 445039, and the Solaris thing that I'll get rid of in a separate bug, once I find someone who can tell me whether or not SOLARIS is really #ifdef there.
