When the client is behind a non-transparent proxy, FTP should still work. But it doe not on Firefox.

Firefox us the PASV command for FTP, the received response from the PASV command is an IP and port. Firefox ignores this IP and us the one in the address bar. This is normally fine 99% of the time, but if the user wa behind a non-transparent proxy, then it will fail since Firefox did not follow the FTP protocol. Firefox should have connected to the IP return from the PASV command.

Here's an example, a I don't have a non-transparent proxy to give you.

I have a custom software that forward request from port 12344 to a ftp server.

So, in Firefox to connect to the FTP, I use ftp://localhost:12344

Here's a snip of the FTP commands...

(blah blah blah, connect, send user, send password, blah blah blah)

Sent to FTP server via proxy:
PASV

Received:
227 Entering Passive Mode (204,152,189,167,235,131).

Firefox ignores that IP and try to connect to localhost:60291, what is should have is connect to 204.152.189.167:60291.

I know this is what Firefox does, since I used a real FTP client, and it had no issue connecting to the FTP via my proxy.

To be clear, what I mean by a non-transparent proxy is a server that accepts a connection on a port and forward it to another host.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Well, it going to hard for you to reproduce this bug. But here's the step anyway!

1. Use a non-transparent proxy to forward data from a port to an ftp server
2. Connect to the ftp server via the proxy

Actual Results:
nothing will be displayed

Expected Results:
content of ftp server to be displayed

Firefox need to use the IP in the result of the PASV command

There's no work-around for this, so there's bound to be people out there cursing at you guy for "not having ftp support"
