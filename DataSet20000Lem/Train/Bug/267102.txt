Keyboard and mouse buffer are not synchronous.

When working on heavily loaded or old (and slow, like my P-Pro 233) system
problem arise with the keyboard and mouse buffer not being sync'd.

For instance, on a webpage, you can click a user editable text box and press
CTRL-A. Then when the browser process them from the buffer it will process
them out of order (highlighting the entire page and then placing the mouse in
the text box).

Another demonstration would be to open about 20 tab of webpage then starting
with the first, click on the fisrt tab then tap CTRL-A, repeat on the second
tab, etc. until the last tab. You would expect each tab to have it's page
selected, but this is not the case.

This is not a problem if the user is willing to wait for the computer to
process each event before sending another one, but this workaround (user
patience) defeat the purpose of buffering keyboard and mouse events.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a realy slow computer
2. Bog the computer down
3. Start using mouse and keyboard shortcut

Actual Results:
The mouse and keyboard event were processed out of order.

Expected Results:
The mouse and keyboard event should be sync'd in their buffers.

Throwing a mouse event token into the keyboard buffer when a mouse event is
buffered and vice versa to allow for synchronous processing could fix this,
also combining the two buffer into one would also fix this.
