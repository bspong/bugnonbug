The problem involves Java, SE 6 Version 1.6.0 (build 1.6.0_01-b06).

The website could take indefinite time to load. As soon a URL is loaded, IE Tab and Tab Mix Plus crashes. However, Ctrl-Tab can be used to cycle through the tabs. In frequent severe cases, child window form and list boxes, the scroll bar and the arrow key scroll stop responding. Firefox crash on attempt to shut it down through X button or File->Exit, leaving stub in memory which need to be cleared manually before Firefox can be restarted. Otherwise, msg is displayed: "Firefox is already running but not responding".

The problem involves Java, SE 6 Version 1.6.0 (build 1.6.0_01-b06).

Attempts to close firefox cause crash with Java exception error:

According to my experience, any site with certain type of Java ticker can reproduce the error.
