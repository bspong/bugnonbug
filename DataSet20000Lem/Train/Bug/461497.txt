When I start Firefox, instead of using my home page (and I've tried setting several in tool including blank and gmail), it us my "www.mylastname.com" and my last name is McGinnis. Where did it get this and how did this happen? Is it trying to find my blog ..which I don't have. I have tried to get rid of this by changing the start with and home page setting to various things. I prefer a blank page start because I don't have one place I start necessarily.

Help.... I don't want to buy real estate from GMC McGinnis in Colorada and I don't even know who they are. Even if I did, I wouldn't want to see their webpage every time i start Firefox.

thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Firefox load
3. www.mcginnis.com appears

Doubt anyone can reproduce this because it's specific to my last name.
Actual Results:

Bad start page

Expected Results:

Blank start page (I've been using Firefox since it came out.. and Netscape since 1.0 .. so I'm fairly well-versed in the use of this software).
