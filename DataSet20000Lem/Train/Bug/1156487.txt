Steps to reproduce:

In a for-loop my php-program generates mutiple a4 page with fixed areas: header section, table-listing (bill) and footer section. Each page ist defindes by cs a ".page { position:relative; width:100%; height:280mm; margin:0; padding:0; }". The bottomline is defined by ".bottomline { font-size:10pt; font-family:Helvetica,Arial; color:#333333; text-align: center; position: absolute; bottom:0; left:0; width:100%; display:inline;}". For "@media print" the page break are forced by "div.break {display:block; page-break-before:always;}" at the end of every page (after closing </div> from div class page) except the last one.


Actual results:

At the second page Firefox 37 misplaces the bottomline in the top section instead of the bottom. This misplacement concern only the second page - all other page (first, third, forth...) are all correct. Firefox 36 and below did not have this problem. Since the page are produce in a for-loop, the section and dimension of all page are ident.


Expected results:

Like all other page second page should have bottomline at the bottom (instead of top). Please open the attached html file with firefox 37 in the print preview and look for the bottom line at the second page.
