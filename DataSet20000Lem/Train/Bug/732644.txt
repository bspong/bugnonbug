User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2
Build ID: 20120215223356

Steps to reproduce:

visited flat no-js page on my site (about 4K/10sec), also tried with 20 tab (makes it leak faster, about 88KB/sec). have not tried about:blank yet.


Actual results:

cause crash if I leave ff sitting for 3 hours, very likely due to memory leak.

if I do a control-alt-del, click on Image Name to sort by image name, click on firefox.exe to watch memory usage, with single flat page memory usage increase at 4kB/10sec rate. with 20 tab on various site that don't have moving ad memory usage increase at 88KB/sec rate, sometimes more in bursts.

I tried to eliminate yahoo mail from the equation, but it make no difference. about:memory also increases.
safe mode make no difference.
this bug cause out of memory error on my machine, relating to virtual memory. it show peak memory usage to be 408MB right now. that's kind of high. currently usage is at 295K and increasing.


Expected results:

memory usage should not go up continuously on static page. it should not use up all available memory and cause out of memory errors.
