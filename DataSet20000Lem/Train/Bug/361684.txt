There is a menu item for showing the history in the sidebar under the history menu, but no counterpart for this in the bookmark menu (as explained in bug 351829 No 'Show In Sidebar' menu item in Bookmarks menu). If this menu item were to be kept, I think it should read "show history in sidebar" a "show in sidebar" is ambiguous : being in the history menu doe not necessarily make this explicit, and this could pose problem to those using a screenreader for example. (this problem is described in bug 360236 Rename "Show in Sidebar" menu item to "View History in Sidebar")

I would argue against adding an entry to show bookmark on the sidebar to the bookmark entry, and to remove the current "show in sidebar" entry from the history menu, a it seems silly to duplicate the functionality in the menu. There is already at least a toolbar button that ha this functionality. Why not by the same logic add a "show history" entry to the tool menu and the edit menu while we are at it ?

As far a I can see, the entry from the "sidebar" submenu of the tool menu would be be better placed directly in the view menu. We would have for example "Show history in sidebar" and "Show bookmark in sidebar", rather than hiding them in a submenu. When people are looking for this functionality, they are probably scanning the menu for "history" or "bookmarks" rather than "sidebar.

Hope this is clear enough, and sorry for reprising those two bugs, but I think it wa important to consolidate the issues.

Love, Karderio.
