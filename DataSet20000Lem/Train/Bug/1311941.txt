Adding a new node using the + button in the inspector toolbar should keep the parent selected
STR:
- open any page
- open inspector
- select any node
- click on the + icon in the inspector toolbar
- click again a second time

Expected: I would like these 2 new element to be siblings, direct child of the element I selected in step 3

Actual: the new created element get selected, so the second element becomes it child.

UX discussion: this feature wa added in bug 1261781 and it wa decided that the newly created node would get selected because this way user can modify them further.
Because the node get selected immediately, you can delete it by pressing the DELETE key, you can press enter to edit the tagname, or tab to add an attribute.

If we decide here that it's better to *not* select the newly created node, then those thing won't work, you'll first need to navigate to the node to do this.

Having said this, I've used this feature quite a bit already, and every time I wanted the new node to be siblings, not child of each other.
And because that didn't work, I wa either reselecting the parent and then pressing + again, or just creating one element only and then using the "duplicate element" context menu item.

Gabriel ha also said that it would make more sense to keep the parent selected.
