Since I started using a Dual 1.8Ghz G5 Macintosh I have been getting frequent
crashes/hangs. Mozilla is ALWAYS one of the active application and the message
Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin: *** Warning: ATSUMeasureText ha been
deprecated. Use ATSUGetUnjustifiedBounds instead. *** is ALWAYS close to the
reboot message in System.log

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to any of many web site
2. Open a link in a new window
3. System Hangs

Actual Results:
This Hang/SystemCrash occurs about 3-5 time a week.

The primary monitor go black and the CPU fan
start to speed up until they whine.

Sometimes the Hang/Crash occurs when I click on a link to open a web site in a
new window and other time the Hang/Crash occurs when my system wake from deep
sleep with Mozilla Firebird running.
