Firefox hang when opening download window

3.6.9 for me hang consitently when opening the Download Window. Files donwload fine, but when clicking open the download window it hangs. (This only happens when a download is in progress).

And it's not just FF that hang in this case, when this happens, other thing ho awry too (e.g. opening window explorer, explorer is extremely slow/unresponsive until I kill FF.

This is on XP Professional SP2.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start a download
2. Click Tools -> Downloads or click on the download indicator in the bar at the bottom.
3. FF hangs, in addition there are other issue (see above).

I can't submit a crash, a it doesn't crash, just hang (have to kill it with task manager).

As a weird detail; in task manager, I appear to have two Donwload window open, while in reality, there's just one.

(I am a veteran IT admin, and wouldn't have filed this bug report if I thought there's something wrong with my system).

Keep up the good work! I love FF!
