XML feed that are defined in <link> tag and show up in the Firefox RSS button
menu in the bottom-right corner ("Subscribe to '..' ") keep adding up to produce
infinite duplicate when a page is set to refresh with <meta> tag AND the
meta-refreshing tab is not selected. When the tab is reloaded by hand OR
selected and refreshed by the meta-refresh, the list get cleared correctly.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox, open two tab
2. In other tab go to http://www.rakkis.net/firefox-rssbutton-metareload-bug.html
3. Select any other tab
4. Wait 20 seconds.
5. Select the tab in which the first link wa opened; you can now see that the
two RSS feed defined in the site appear multiple time when you click on the
small RSS button to bring up the "Subscribe to '..' " menu. When you refresh the
page by hand, or wait another 10 second when the page is selected, the menu
get cleared up correctly and only 2 feed show up.
Actual Results:
Multiple (duplicate) item of the two RSS feed defined in the page HTML appear
in the RSS button menu.

Expected Results:
The RSS button menu should clear every time the page is reloaded, so that only
two RSS feed (as defined by the HTML) appear always there.
