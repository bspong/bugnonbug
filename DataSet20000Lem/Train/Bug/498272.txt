A very quick Ctrl-Tab keystroke should alternate tab instantly, without popping up the tab-switching widget. Given the pretty large size of the widget and the time it take to render, the "blink" it make when you just want to swap tab is very noticeable.

In other words, the widget should wait for the Ctrl key being held for a couple millisecond before showing up.

This is similar to how Cmd-Tab on OS X (10.5) behaves.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Having numerous tab open, press Ctrl-Tab very quickly, releasing the Ctrl key very fast.
Actual Results:
There's a flicker of the tab-switching widget before switching tabs, which can be distracting (possibly even irritating) and delay the actual switch (the widget is quick, but still take some time to render when you have three page worth of tabs).

Expected Results:
Very fast tab swapping, with no interruption or distractions.
