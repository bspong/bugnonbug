All version of FF 3.6.x including 3.6.12 crash almost immediately after opening
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091202 Firefox/3.5.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; SunOS sun4u; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091202 Firefox/3.6.x

This only occurred occasionally on FF 3.5.x but with 3.6.x it is impossible to get FF to run on Sun Solaris 10 running on a single Sunblade workstation with a SPARC processor.
FF open normally then when ANY webpage is selected it may or may not display. Within 1 minute FF crash completely with the following error message:
/opt/firefox3612/run-mozilla.sh: line 131: 4489 Segmentation Fault (core dumped) "$prog" ${1+"$@"}

ONLY with FF 3.6.12 I also sometimes get this alternate error message:
GLib-ERROR **: gmem.c:136: failed to allocate 16 byte aborting...





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. added /opt/firefox3612 to path in .cshrc
2.logout and log in to clear everything
3.run firefox from cmd line in a terminal window

Actual Results:
see error message above. FF 3.5.x intermittently crashed with error message but not often enough to report.

/opt/firefox3612/run-mozilla.sh: line 131: 4489 Segmentation Fault (core dumped) "$prog" ${1+"$@"}

I have since tried FF 3.6.1, 3.6.3, and now 3.6.12 and it is impossible to use because FF crash every time within 1 minute of running it.




running true Sun Solaris 10 (not opensolaris) on a Sun Blade 150 with a SPARC processor. Running locally without any remote login. Crash occurs both logged in a User and also when logged in a Root. Makes no difference.
