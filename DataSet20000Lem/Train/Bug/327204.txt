User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/85.8.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.8.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.1

I have Firefox 1.5.0.1on my G-4 eMac. Presently, I have one major
problem with this update. When I access my email on Comcast.net,
which is hi-speed cable, I have no problem deleting message while
in the message.

But, if I list my inbox messages, and check the block to the left of
the message, five of the selection above, "REPLY", "REPLY ALL",
"FORWARD", "REPORT AS SPAM" and "DELETE", will not hilite.
So the only way I can delete my message is to actually open the
message and delete it after reading it.

This doe not happen with my former firefox browser, which wa
version 1.0.3.

NONE of my other browser have this problem, which include
Safari, Internet Explorer, Camino, Netscape, or Opera.
