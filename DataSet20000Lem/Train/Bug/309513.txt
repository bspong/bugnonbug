Middle-clicking or crtl-left-clicking to open a link in a new tab used to work
for me always until I downloaded Firefox 1.0.6. Starting with that version (and
continuing in my new version, 1.0.7) certain link will not open in a new
window. In fact nothing will happen at all.
It seems to depend on how the link is formatted. It seems that if there is any
formatting (like "<i>...</i>") in between the <a href""> and </a>, then this
problem occurs. If the formatting is prior to the <a href>, then it seems to
work okay.
This may be a little unclear, but is easy to see when you go to this page to see
what is happening:

Middle-click or ctrl-left-click the link to see if you get the same result a me.
By the way, in my about:config I have the following for "middleclick" feature
(in case you are interested):
middlemouse.contentLoadUrl = false
middlemouse.openNewWindow = true
middlemouse.paste = false

If you have any other question about specifics, don't hesitate to email me :).

Reproducible: Always

2.Middle-click or ctrl-left-click the link to see if you get the same result a me.

Actual Results:
The link that say "this link works" mean that I am able to middle click the
link open in a new window.
The link that say "this link doe not" mean that middle clicking on it did not
do anything (neither did ctrl-left-click). I had to right click, then select
"Open Link In New Tab".

Expected Results:
It should open the link in a new tab.
