CNN.com news video open in a new window and play the advert in bottom frame (showing that the feed is coming through) but it will not play the News. The news video played fine before I started using the tab feature (this is despite my having unblocked all pop-up from the CNN website) - they still play fine using Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.cnn.com
2. Go to "Best video"
3. Click on "Now in the News"

Actual Results:
The new window opened and the advert in the lower frame continued playing but the news clip did not. The screen bit seemed to disappear because the control button which are usually at the bottom of the new screen (immediately above the ad frame) moved rapidly to the top of the screen/window. The timer also read 00:00:00

Expected Results:
The news would have started rolling and the timer would have registered the length of the news clip and counted up to that time.
