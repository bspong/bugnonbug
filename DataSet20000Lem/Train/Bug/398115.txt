Every time I'll click on Firefox Browser, the display setting will revert to 8-bit color and graphic become grainy. I always have to click on personalization page and restore display setting back to 32-bit colors... IE doe not affect my display settings...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on Firefox Icon
2.Firefox will appear on screen, but graphic become grainy.
3. Click on "Personalization screen" and click on display setting and click on 8-bit color and set to 32-bit colors... EVERY TIME I CLICK ON FIREFOX....
Actual Results:
Clicking on Firefox caused my display setting to revert to 8-bit color and I have to click on display setting and click it back to 32-bit color setting....

Grainy graphic and pictures...

What else. Something about Firefox browser cause my display setting to revert to the lowest setting, resulting in lousy graphic and pictures, when I minimize Firefox, I'll be seeing Desktop Wallpaper a grainy and dull colored picture...
