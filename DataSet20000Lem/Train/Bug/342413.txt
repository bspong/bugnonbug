Keyboard navigation to bookmark sub-menus is disrupted by the mouse hovering over another bookmark sub-menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create two top-level bookmark sub-folders, `foo' and `bar'.
2. In foo, create a sub-folder, `stud'.
3. Open the bookmark menu and leave the mouse hovering over `bar'.
4. Press `Alt', to close the bookmark menu.
5. Press `Alt+B', to open the bookmark menu again. The mouse should still be hovering over `bar'. If it ha moved off `bar', put it back over `bar' and return to step 4.
6. Press `F', to select `foo'.
7. If `stud' receives the focus and keep it, then try step 4-6 again. The software sometimes behaves correctly first time.
Actual Results:
The `stud' sub-menu received the focus for just a moment and then disappeared.

Expected Results:
What should have happened is what happens when the mouse is not hovering over the bookmark menu (and what sometimes happens when step 4-6 above are run for the first time). The `stud' sub-menu should keep the focus.
