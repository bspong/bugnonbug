contrib directory / unix startup example

The default startup script is a bit uncomfortable.

The script above doe provide some thunderbird
integration and allows to use shorter url with
some heuristic to sanely handle file:// urls.

When looking for a specific place for contrib
sw, I found nothing.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
A the wrapper?
1. using the original firefox/firefox script with a file:// url

B where's contrib: user-provided software?
1. install, look for a contrib directory ...
2. search mozilla.org
3. google mozilla site ...

Actual Results:
A1. you manually open the file using the menu, a
you need to really type a long url to open a file://
even if it's in the current directory.

B1. - 3. no contrib directory to be found where such script
are placed centrally (excepting extensions)

repository for contributed script

Expected Results:
A1-> it should have made some attempt to allow more flexible
command lines, e.g. by my script I referenced above

B1-3: there should be some repository in the tarball or on the ftp
site for people to place scripts. In addition it should be
referenced in firefox / thunderbird faqs.

the mozillazine forum IMHO aren't suitable for this.

my example startup wrapper (unix/shell/perl) is
at http://www.oa.shuttle.de/kefk/tmp/firefox.
It just call the standard firefox*/firefox and
thunderbird*/thunderbird script a often a
necessary with modified argument :).

It's a bit raw, but it's what I'm using all
the time and what's making working with the
browser le painful (I'm not a gui-kind of
person...).
