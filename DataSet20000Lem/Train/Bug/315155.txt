BBC's website in urdu language (Which is 5th largest spoken language of the world. Source: http://www2.ignatius.edu/faculty/turner/languages.htm) can not be read using your browser.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the font by downloading from the link below:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/fontinstall/bbcurdu.exe

2. Reboot the computer

3.

Actual Results:
Just open the site in both firefox and MS-IE and you will see the difference yourself. (You don't even need to know the urdu language, you can watch the difference just by looking at it)



Expected Results:
Firefox need to display the font in the same way in which MS-IE display them on the screen.

The screen font I am talking about are also affected slightly by an option "Smooth edge of screen fonts" in Windows XP.

To access that option, you need to go to:

Control Panel --> System -> Advanced --> Performance --> setting --> Visual Effects --> Custom --> "Smooth edge of screen fonts"
