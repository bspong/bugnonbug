Each morning when I first unlock my computer to resume using it from the night
before, I notice that the FireFox process in the Windows task area is wildly
flickering, and that FireFox ha a proxy dialog box open -- pressing filling in
the information and pressing OK or just pressing Cancel seems to do nothing.
*This is a symptom and not the problem.* Either FireFox ha to be killed from
the task manager, or I have to click Cancel dozen of time before FireFox
return to normal operations. Sound familiar to bug 253632? That bug is a
symptom of this bug.

The environment which this surface is where I use a proxy and have the
ForecastFox 0.5.9 extension installed. Note, this is not an extension bug.

When I leave my machine at night, without shutting down FireFox nor logging out,
ForecastFox continues to request page to display the weather in the status bar.
However, after a certain amount of time, our corporate proxy server time out
my session and asks me to reauthenticate, only I'm not around to do it, and the
dialog box pop up.

More time passes, and ForecastFox request another web update, and again another
proxy dialog box pop up.

This happens all throughout the night, and when I return in the morning, unlock
the machine, I see what look like a proxy timeout dialog. What I'm really
seeing is a bunch of proxy dialog box stacked perfectly on top of one another.

As I respond to a dialog box, filling it out or pressing cancel, it clear that
dialog box, showing me the one under it, giving me the illusion nothing ha
happened.

As such, I either terminate FireFox prematurely in frustration, or repeatedly
click Cancel until I clear out the dialog pile, "mysteriously" returning FireFox
to normality.

How could FireFix prevent this problem? Two ways.

1) Each time the proxy dialog box is displayed, rather than centering it,
provide some slight random offset (10 or 20 pixels) off center. Visually, it
won't be noticable unless there are several dialog box stacked -- then user
would know what's going on, and the actual problem would have been reported
sooner and accurately.

2) The real solution, however, is to have FireFox keep track if it ha presented
the dialog box already. If it has, it should not present another one. This
way, despite being non-modal in nature, the user only ha one dialog box to ever
contend with.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use an authenticating proxy server
2. Install ForecastFox
3. Let the proxy server time out the authentication and a dialog box appears.
4. Let ForecastFox continue requesting pages, which make more dialog boxes.
Actual Results:
You get a stack of proxy authentication dialog box at the same coordinates,
giving the illusion of one dialog box. The resulting interface is confusing for
the user to resolve.

Expected Results:
FireFix should show one -and only one- proxy authentication dialog box at a
time, if it's already presented, bring it to the top and give it focus, do not
create additional ones.

The work around is to simply hit Cancel a zillion times, or
remove the ForecastFox extension (or any others that auto-load pages), or
stop using an authenticating proxy.
