I periodically go through my stored cooky looking for site I want to block.
When I find one, I copy the Host: field into another window for temporary
storage, and do this for each one.

Next, I go into the Cookie Exceptions panel, and copy and paste each host into
the "Address of website:" field, and then click block. The problem is that if
the text begin with a . (for instance .reference.com), it go into the list a
doubleclick.net and say blocked, but DOES NOT BLOCK.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Options->Privacy->Cookies->Exceptions...
2. Type .reference.com into the "Address of website:" field (any site name
beginning with '.' will do.
3. Click Block. Notice that reference.com show up on the list (not .reference.com)
4. Make sure to remove any reference.com cooky from the stored cooky list.
5. Go to www.dictionary.com. Notice that a new cookie from .reference.com is
accepted and show up in the stored cooky list.
Actual Results:
My Stored Cookies showed a .reference.com cookie. If I removed that cookie and
go back to www.dictionary.com, it reappears.

Expected Results:
It should either block the cookie, or give an error when an attempt is made to
add .reference.com to the exception list (stating that site name cannot begin
with '.'). For obvious reasons, blocking the cookie is preferable.
