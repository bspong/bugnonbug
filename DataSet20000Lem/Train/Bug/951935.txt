Allow the browser console dialog to be opened in specified windows/tabs/others
I'm trying to open the Browser Console in the sidebar in my add-on. However, even though the webconsole URI load fine there, I can't use it a a DebuggerClient to listen for messages, because most of the HUDService object is closed from the outside.

This mean that I can't edit it method or assign any of it _#### property myself. So I can't immediately ensure the console function and is destroyed properly. The only way to do this would be to write my own HUDService, which would be pretty much a copy-paste of firefox's HUDService, except for a very few line of code.

This seems to be a big overkill. So I would suggest instead changing the current HUDService, to allow passing a window reference a an argument into the toggleBrowserConsole method a HUDService.toggleBrowserConsole(aWindow). The method would use aWindow in it openWindow method instead of opening a new one (if null or nothing is passed, it will still open a new window, a is current behavior).

AFAICT, this would be a very simple change, which work great for opening, working with, and closing browser console in window other than the dialog opened by HUDService itself, making sure they are handled properly in all these case by the original HUDService.

Although admittedly, I'm not 100% sure if my suggestion can be implemented exactly like this, a I've read too much code today and I'm already at the stage of seeing many happily colored word when I blink... So I could be wrong, and in that case (or if I missed an incredibly obvious way to do what I want) I would greatly welcome any alternative for my situation, if it is at all possible. :)
