"New bookmark" popup disappears if I reopen it after creating bookmark - round 2
>>> My Info: Win7_64, Nightly 50, 32bit, ID 20160714030208 (2016-07-14)
STR_1:
1. Open http://example.org/ in a new tab
2. Move mouse pointer exactly where "Done" button is located when "New bookmark" popup is open
3. Press Ctrl+D
4. Press Enter or click "Done" (you can even move mouse within "Done" button, but not outside)
5. Press Ctrl+D
[you must perform Steps 3-5 in le than 4 seconds]
6.(bonus) Click in the field "Name"

AR: After Step 5 (or after Step 6, if you perform it) "new bookmark" popup disappears
ER: Widget should react according to the last interaction, i.e. bookmark panel shouldn't hide
[this cool expectation can be applied to the case in Note (1) and probably more]

Use case:
I decided to bookmark a page, then I realized that I want to edit bookmark (Step 5)

This bug is regression from bug 1219794. Regression range:

Notes:
1) Many widget in the Mozilla's browser work like described above. If user keep constantly moving
mouse pointer above fullscreen notification - it still hides. If user hovers "Push Notification"
in the beginning/end - the notification is hardly visible (bug 1184790).
