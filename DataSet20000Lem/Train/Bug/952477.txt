Upgrading Firefox from the installer should not add new icon to desktop/taskbar/program file
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

I installed Firefox via the new "upgrade" button on Windows 7. There wa a tiny option button in the lower left where I could have configured shortcut on the desktop/etc. I didn't notice it though, I just pressed update (which is a GREAT new addition).


Actual results:

Firefox added an icon to my desktop, a this is the default. It's fine to have that a a default on a new installation, but if I already have installed Firefox on my computer and have no desktop icon for Firefox, Firefox should not add one in an upgrade.


Expected results:

No desktop icon should have been created. If a desktop icon already exists, and the path ha changed to Firefox, a new icon could be added or the old one updated, so long a it is only a generic shortcut, not with command line parameter to open a specific profile, etc. Same thing for taskbar and program files. Whatever the user set on the old version of Firefox should be what happens when upgrading.

Thanks! Firefox is awesome.
