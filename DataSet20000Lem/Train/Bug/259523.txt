The problem can be quickly checked to be true this way:

enter into google search bar (next to address barr) word 'ignasvp'

then google page is opened with 'no result found'.
URL is:
http://www.google.com/search?q=ignasvp&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official

but if we remove '&client=firefox-a' from URL - we get at least 3 result !!!
this (client variable) should not affect results, or am I wrong?

I found this by searching in IE and then in Firefox! 3 result versus 0.. That
wa really confusing ! I guess it's google related probem, which could be
solved on your side too, at least until google fix it :)

good luck.
in case of any question or answers/reaction - please let me know by email. I am
really interested in this issue.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. enter into google search bar (next to address barr) word 'ignasvp'
2. no result found
3. look into generated URL - it's
http://www.google.com/search?q=ignasvp&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official
4. remove '&client=firefox-a' from generated URL (in address bar) and press enter
5. 3 or more result found
Actual Results:
3 result in IE versus 0 in firefox if using built-in google bar.. That wa
really confusing !

Expected Results:
show 3 result for ignasvp word.

i think it's really google problem, that the result depends on browser reported
to google. but it can be solved on your side. and also i guess you should report
this to google, if it's really their fault :)
