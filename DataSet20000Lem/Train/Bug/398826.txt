Flash plugin not showing some flash content

Flash in 2.0.0.7 behaves differently from other version of firefox and IE.

A gallery flash site I've created show thumbnail of images. When you press the "Lightbox" button it should start to count percentage of the loaded thumb and when a thumb hit "100%" it should display it. Percentages work ok, but the thumbnail never shows. It's there because it's clickable, a it should be, but not shown.

This problem is only with 2.0.0.7, I've tested with 2.0.0.6 and 2.0.0.4 and it work great. It work great in IE6 and 7 a well, it would be nice if someone could confirm that the plugins for IE and firefox are different. I've tested in both Windows Vista and Ubuntu Linux with the same result. Also I downloaded a nightly build and the error reproduces with that a well.

I don't know if this is a firefox bug, a firefox flash plugin bug och and Adobe bug. If it's posted here in error I apologize, and it would be great if someone then could point me in the right direction.

Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a firefox 2.0.0.7 browser
2. Go to www.bjarholm-olsson.se/synk/main.html
3. Click on "Lightbox" once or twice
4. Repeat with 2.0.0.6 or IE to see what it should look like
Actual Results:
Thumbnails don't show

Expected Results:
Shown thumbnail

This ha been confirmed in other forums(see link to thread below) and seems only to apply to 2.0.0.7 and nightlies.
