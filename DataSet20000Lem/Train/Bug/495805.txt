Firefox go to 90-100% CPU use, hangs, and lock up my computer every time I view a flash movie of browse Google Maps. FF (3.0.10 on Windows) switch itself to Above Normal thread priority, which is probably related to the computer lockup. I have had to cold reboot my computer 5 time today because of this. I have tried waiting 30 minutes, but it totally hose my computer, with lot of data loss. There of so many of these kind of hang-related bug reports, it's hard to know where/how to report them. I can't even get a trace or error log out of my computer, since it completely freeze up.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.load a few tab in FF
2.load google maps, and move/zoom the map for a few second
3. Computer freeze up
Actual Results:
First, FF switch it thread priority to Above Normal, while using 90-100% CPU. Then computer becomes intermittently unresponsive, then freezes. Uses 0.5 to 1 GB RAM in task mgr.

Expected Results:
It should have displayed the web page, kept thread priority at "Normal," or contain the problem on a single tab, or a a last resort, crash gracefully, without computer lockup.

Problem started with this new version of FF.
