Places' smart folder highlight incorrect day in calendar widget
This may need to be split out to a couple of bugs, but this might be able to be fixed in one patch.

1. Click Show Places.
2. Click "Viewed today."

Problem: The calendar highlight what should be "All page viewed". I expect only today to be highlighted.

Workaround: Click "Viewed last week" (which highlight last week correctly) and then click "Viewed today" again.

1. Click Show Places (yes, load the chrome again).
2. Click "Viewed past week."

Problem: The calendar highlight what should be "All page viewed". I expect today to one week ago to be to be highlighted.

Workaround: Click "Viewed today" (which highlight today correctly) and then click "Viewed past week" again.

When inside places, clicking "All page viewed" make the calendar "forget" the correct highlight. For example:

1. Select "All page viewed." (Get no highlight - BAD.)
2. Select "Viewed past week." (Get all past history highlight - BAD.)
3. Select "Viewed today." (Get today highlight - GOOD.)
4. Select "All page viewed." (Returns to step one's state - BAD.)
5. Select "Viewed today." (Get all past history highlight - BAD.)
6. Select "Viewed past week." (Get past week's history highlight - GOOD.)
7. Select "All page viewed." (Returns to step one's state - BAD.)
