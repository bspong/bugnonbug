My Online C Crash Course at
http://www.stellimare.com/~aragorn/scouting/mb/computers/c-cc.html display a
expected in the browser, but, when printing with background color on, the
background color of the <pre> element bleed over to the entire page. The first
page will print normally, but the others do not.

This problem exists on all platforms, Max OS X, Windows, and Linux. It can also
be seen in the print preview.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the page at http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,2043-1-3098-1,00.html
2. Go to page setup, check "Print Background (color & iamges)"
3. Either print, or view the page in print preview.

Actual Results:
First page print a expected. Following page with <pre> element have the
<pre> tag background color bled over the entire page, and not contained within
the boxed in section a on the first page, and a the browser normally display it.

And burn lot of toner...

Expected Results:
Printed the page just a it look in the browser (not in the print preview).
