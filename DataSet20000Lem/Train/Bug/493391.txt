While browsing some webpage in fullscreen mode, the program window flicker so one can the desktop for a fraction of a second and then see the program again, especially while scrolling down and up a page in fullscreen.

2.Try going to a page like Dr. McNinja, scroll down. Click Next page, and scroll down and back up.
3.Also; right click on any link on any wepbage.
Actual Results:
The window disappears for a fraction of a second, during which one can see his/her desktop background.

Expected Results:
Should not happen.

After closing Compiz, I wa not able to reproduce the results. However, I am not sure if the bug should be sent to Compiz or Mozilla, i.e who is more at fault. If you are sure this can only be an error with compiz, I will gladly send this bug to them.
