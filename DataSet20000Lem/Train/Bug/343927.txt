Exactly the same a bug #325155 (please read), except with a newer version of Firefox. Bug #325155 wa closed a "WORKSFORME".

It is doing this on every Linux 2.6.14 x86_64 workstation in our company (which is over score of machines). I'm not sure if the problem occurs on other build of Linux. We didn't have the problem with Firefox 1.0.7 on this same version of Linux (we just recently upgraded Firefox).

Please revisit this issue a it is definitely present in 1.5.0.4, at least in out environment.
