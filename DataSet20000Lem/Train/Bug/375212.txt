I cannot access ebay live's live bidding page through the latest build of Firefox.
even though I have signed up for the live bidding through ebay, I receive an error message that states:

"Sign in error: Although you are an eBay user, you must sign up for each live auction.
But, it is not to late, you can still register for this auction from the previous page."

This problem doe not exist with Internet Explorer, and I can access the bidding page of ebay live using the latest IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Sign up for an active online live auction through ebay.
2.Attempt to access the live auction using the Live auction page "Bid Now" or "Bid Live" button, and on the next screen, click "continue"
3. Receive above listed error.
Actual Results:
You will get the error, "Sign in error: Although you are an eBay user, you must sign up for each live auction.
But, it is not to late, you can still register for this auction from the previous page."

Expected Results:
I should go to the ebay live auction bidding page.
