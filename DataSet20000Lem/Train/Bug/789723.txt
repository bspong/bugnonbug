All Firefox menu disappear after a indeterminate period of time
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:15.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/15.0
Build ID: 20120825192214

Steps to reproduce:

After using Firefox for a period of time, which seems to be entirely random, the drop down menu's Search, Address Bar a well a the Firefox Menu and even right click become either invisible or appear and disappear very quickly, certainly too swiftly to click.


Actual results:

I have attached a video demonstrating this problem, although it is difficult to convey in a video how something doe not occur so I will try and explain. The video start off with my trying to select a search engine other than the one displayed, when this problem manifest itself this is impossible a can be seen in the video. I am left clicking constantly, but the drop down doe not appear. Next I try typing, again, no suggestion appear. In the address bar, clicking on the drop down doe nothing, the resulting menu is invisible and/or unclickable. Typing in the address bar a seen in the video, ha a similar effect.

Next I try right clicking in the various box on the video, and at no point doe the right click menu appear. Then I try clicking on the Firefox menu itself, which seems to flash but display nothing, the same thing happens when pressing F10 to attempt to display the menu bar.

Finally I try selecting a word and then right clicking on it, the menu appears to display but is invisible and/or unclickable.


Expected results:

Normal menu behaviour should have occurred, i.e. the drop down menu's appearing.

The only way to resolve this problem is to restart Firefox.

Things I have tried:

Disabling/Enabling Hardware Acceleration
Ticking/Not ticking disable or replace context menu
Starting in Safe Mode
Creating a new profile

None of these had any effect, the problem still occurred.
