When opening a PDF document link, the document is automatically loaded and displayed by Adobe Reader in a new tab in Mozilla Firefox - even though the action for the "Adobe Acrobat Document" content type (and all the other Adobe Acrobat content types) under Tools->Options->Applications is set to "Always Ask".


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have Adobe Acrobat 9.3.2 installed
1. Set action for adobe acrobat content type to "always ask" under Tools->Options->Applications
2. Click on a link for a PDF document (any PDF link will do - do a google search for "PDF" for example)
3. Document will open automatically in Firefox.
Actual Results:
PDF document open automatically in-browser.

Expected Results:
A dialog box appears asking user what to do with the document in question (e.g. open it, save it, or cancel).

Given recent security hole found in adobe acrobat documents, this bug in my opinion present a security risk, a attacker can automatically launch PDF document from a web page. If the user's Adobe Reader is not patched, or if there are other, still open, vulnerabilities, the user's system can be compromised.
