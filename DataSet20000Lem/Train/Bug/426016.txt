This is a cosmetic/GUI bug that affect usability to a certain extent. I'm not sure if it ha already been posted - I wasn't able to find it after a quick search.

Problem:
If the user open a new tab, visit a page and attempt to scroll down with the cursor, the scrollbar fails to move unless the cursor is moved approximately halfway down, in which case it scroll down the page in a blur. If the scrollbar ha already been moved, it will then move just fine. This unusual behavior is seemingly random -- it occurs on certain page and not others and occurs considerably more often than not.

It is possible I have an extension that is not working quite properly, but I honestly can't see how this could cause such a problem. Is anyone able to reproduce this? It is quite bothersome and tedious.


Thanks
