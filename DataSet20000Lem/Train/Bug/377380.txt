This bug is kind of hard to reproduce and maybe to esoteric, but if you stick exactly to step described below, then it occurs every time.

Extensions, which are automatically disabled by GranParadiso, effect the the rendering of a dhtml animation [see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229391]. Up to 2/3rds of the frame are dropped. As soon a you restart GranParadiso the rendering is fine. The skipping of frame doesn't seem to depend on a specific extension, but it seems you need at least two ore more add-on (maybe it depends on memory consumption?).

See comment on bug 229391, especially #48 to #53 for more information.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure you have a few extension installed in Firefox 2.x
2. Start GranParadiso
3. The window "Checking for compatibility" come up.
4. The dialog "Incompatible add-ons, e.g Adblock, Firebug, FireFTP, HtmlValidator" come up.
5. Press the "Don't Check"-Button
6. Go to http://www.speich.net/computer/moztesting/3d.htm
7. Click on the link "big cube" and move your mouse out of the window.
8. Some of the frame are dropped. Often up to more than 2/3rds are skipped.
9. Close GranParadiso and restart Paradiso
10. Go back to http://www.speich.net/computer/moztesting/3d.htm. Now the rendering is ok.
11. Start Firefox 2.x and re-enable the extensions.
12. Close Firefox 2.x
13. Repeat the step 1-12 and so forth
Actual Results:
Many frame in animation are just dropped.

Expected Results:
Rendering should be same, independent of disabled extension and restarting GranParadiso.
