Flash file containing audio designated a ‘event’ don’t play properly when multiple file a present on a single page.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0

Web page containing multiple swf file with audio designated a ‘event’ a
apposed to ‘streaming’ playback the audio in short burst or not all.
Flash ‘streaming’ audio file on the same site playback fine [
http://www.soundrangers.com ]. If you continually try to play the same sound
it will eventually work, playing a little more of the sound each time you try.
If you reload the page and attempt to play a sound while the page is still
loading (while the rest of the swf file are loading in) the sound will
generally play correctly. Pages with only a few swf event audio file
generally work better than page with many swf event audio files. Every page
on the site in question work great with all non-Mozilla based browsers. Seems
like some sort of Flash cache thing to me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to; http://www.soundrangers.com/category-results.cfm?
storeid=1&cat_id=0164
2. mouse-over any audio playback file (orange arrows, can't miss them)
3. Notice the inconsistent audio playback.
4. Then check any of the page in the Sound Effects category, most of these
contain Flash file with audio set to ‘event’. Compare the result to any of
the page in the Music category; these are mostly made using ‘streaming Flash
files. You will hear the difference. Thanks.
Actual Results:
Notice the inconsistent audio playback.

Expected Results:
The audio should playback smooth and consistent like it doe with all non-
Mozilla based browsers.

This problem ha been thoroughly test using multiple computers, with various
operating system and configuration on both Mac and Windows.
