Platform: released Windows v1.5, updated several time from earlier versions, with several extensions. Have found many report on bookmark sorting, but didn't see this one. On temporarily sorting bookmark by name, by left-clicking on "Name" in the header line in the right-hand pane, sorting is weird and incorrect. Tried (a) with the content of a folder, and (b) the result of a search, in the rh pane; clicking repeatedly on Name cycle between THREE different orders, none accurately alphabetical. In the folder contents, two seem to be alphabetical except for the first or last 2 entries; the third is more or le alphabetical at first, then totally random. In the search results, two are correct, the third incorrect, probably because the search result are fresh with no history.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1: type in a search term
2: left-click repeatedly on the "Name" column header.

and

1': open the content of a folder in the rh window
2: left-click repeatedly on the "Name" column header.

Actual Results:
Three different sort orders, one nearly or completely alphabetical, one nearly or competely reverse alphabetical, one with many (folder) or few (search results) error

Expected Results:
Sort toggling between alphabetical and reverse alphabetical, with no error

Sorted accurately with two, not three, result
