firefox freezes, stop working

When I try to go to this URL, the page display and Firefox stop working, freezes, so that I can't use the cursor or do anything.
Nothing moves. Eventually "not responding" may display in the header field.

I have to use the Windows Task Manager to kill firefox, use a different browser, to go to this URL and select things, then go to firefox for other things.

Can you fix this?

Thanks.

3.The page display at the URL: http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html
4. Firefox freezes.
Actual Results:
I had to kill Firefox, then restart it a a new session.

Expected Results:
I should have been able to scroll through the list at:
http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/archivepix.html

select and view linked pages.

This ha been going on for months--and I've hoped each new Firefox build would fix it, but it still crashes...
I am using Firefox 2.0.0.11
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

This always happens. Clicking on the "Discover the cosmos" link ALWAYS make firefox freeze.
