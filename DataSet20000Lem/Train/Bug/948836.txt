Back button only reloading current site on some website
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131112160018

Steps to reproduce:

Visit "http://www.google.com" or any other site (just to demonstrate that you cannot go back to it).
Visit "http://jobboerse.arbeitsagentur.de/".
Click "Erweiterte Suche", which brings you to the extended form "http://jobboerse.arbeitsagentur.de/vamJB/stellenangeboteFinden.html".
Leave the form blank and click "Stellenangebote suchen" at the bottom, showing you a list on the next page.
Click "Suche ändern" at the bottom which brings you to the extended form again.

Now the back button of Firefox doesn't work at that page.


Actual results:

When clicking the back button, the current site with the form is reloaded. It is not possible to go further back with a simple left click.
The bold line in the back button history list, indicating the current page, doesn't change.
If your back button history list, 15 last entry max, is filled up with with those "corrupted" entries, it is impossible to reach a previous site by right clicking the back button and selecting a previous corrupted entry, it just refreshes the current page.
If your back button history list is not filled and you can reach a previous site directly the forward button doesn't work, reloading the current page instead of going forward, once you reach a corrupted entry.


Expected results:

The back button should always work. So when clicking it, it go one page back, also in the back button history list, no matter what page you are visiting.
The back/forward button history list should have small arrow at top and bottom like the bookmark list has, if there are more entry which aren't shown, so the "corrupted" entry can be skipped and any previous page can be reached directly. It doesn't make much sense to limit it to 15 entry and having to reload 3 page just to reach the very first of the tab.
