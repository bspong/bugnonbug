JavaScript is supposedly enabled, and the box next to it is checked in the preference content menu, yet web site we've tried to use claim that Java Script is actually disabled.

After installing Firefox 1.5, my husband wa unable to check his email at jmail.umd.edu. The page had a warning that JavaScript wa disabled, so certain feature of the web page wouldn't work. Yet when we checked the content menu in Firefox Preferences, the box next to "JavaScript enabled" wa checked. I tried turning "JavaScript enabled" off and back on, then cancelling out of Firefox and checking the preference again. It made no difference. Then I tried to revert to Firefox 1.0.1, but couldn't. We're very frustrated! What do we do??

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to jmail.umd.edu
2. Hit "surge mail"
3. The page you see will contain the "JavaScript not enabled" warning. When you go on to input your name and password on that page to enter your email account, the page with the email message doesn't load. Instead, nothing happens and all you see is a blank screen.

Actual Results:
See above

Expected Results:
According to the "JavaScript enabled" setting in the preferences, the warning should not appear and we should be able to get to the page with our email.
