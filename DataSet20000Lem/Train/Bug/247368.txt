I am not able to insert address from the pop up address book in Yahoo web
based e-mail. Furthermore, selecting the "insert selected contacts" button
mess up the Yahoo mail session....

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Logon to Yahoo Web Based e-mail
2. Hit reply on an e-mail and click the "insert address" link.
A "Yahoo address book" pop up like normal.
3. Select any number of contacts(To check boxes).
4. Click "Insert checked contacts"

Actual Results:
The window forward to "Yourlogin session ha expired.".
The color on my yahoo mail theme return to default for only this link(and my
username is blank, presumably yahoo ha no idea how I got there). If I ignore
the window and go back to the message, any and all message I attempt to send
from then on send to the contact I had selected. If(alternatively) I click the
"re-login" it automatically make that popped window the e-mail message with the
people I checked and I can no longer navigate to messages. So at this point I
click off the new window and go back to my original window and it reverts to the
same unusable state. To go back to a usable state I must clear the cooky and
relogin. There are no other problem I have noticed with Yahoo mail and Firefox.

Expected Results:
I expect that the window will close and my contact will be added to the
underlying(originating) window.

It affect Firefox .8 a well a .9. This is on Windows XP, home edition
version 2002 service pack 1. Dell P4 2.5ghz, 256M Ram.
