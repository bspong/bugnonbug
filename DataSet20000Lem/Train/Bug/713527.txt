don't load tab until selected not working properly in Firefox 9.01
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1
Build ID: 20111220165912

Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded from Firefox 8.01 to 9.01


Actual results:

All pinned app tab a well a the selected tab that is loaded when Firefox starts, are loaded.


Expected results:

In Firefox 8.01 none of the tab would load until I selected it. This wa regardless whether the tab wa pinned a an app or not. This is what I expected, and still expect to happen.

By not loading tab until they are selected, Firefox start quicker when multiple tab are set a apps or simply left on the tab bar using faviconize tab.

If you want to give an option to load app tab that is fine. But make it an option that can be enabled or disabled by the user.

Having the many app tab that I do, it is preferable that tab not load until I select them for viewing. By loading all of the app tab when Firefox starts, you have eliminated the advantage to having "don't load tab until selected" checked.

Please default it back to the previous functionality and then add a check box that states: "Load app tab on start" for those who would like their app tab loaded when Firefox starts.
