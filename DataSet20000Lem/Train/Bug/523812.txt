From time to time, a local directory listing via "file:///path/to/diretory/" result in "file not found" error message. All file within the directory
(e.g. "file:///path/to/diretory/README.html") can always be properly opened.

If the problem occurs, it is reproducible for multiple time without any
deviation.

The problem occurs from time to time, only. I cannot identify any rule for predicting the problem.

The problem also occured in the past using Firefox 3.0.x.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
(I don't see any regularity; cf. above).

Enter "file:///path/to/directory/" into the address field.
Actual Results:
File not found

Firefox can't find the file at /path/to/directory/.

[...]

Expected Results:
An ordinary directory listing.


This problem occurs from time to time, only.

Currently, I receive the "error" for "file:///path/to/directory/", but in
different tabs, i see both
- the file "file:///path/to/directory/foo.txt" and
- the sibling directory listing for "file:///path/to/sibling/"
