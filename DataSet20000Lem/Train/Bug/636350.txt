On my Macbook Pro's touchpad I used to be able to scroll left and right over the tab bar, exposing overflowed tab on either side of the tab bar without actually switching tabs. This wa particularly helpful with Panorama (née TabCandy) and trying to find a particular tab in conjunction with BarTap or setting browser.sessionstore.max_concurrent_tabs to 0.

Now one must physically move the mouse cursor over to the arrow and scroll through them manually and all direction of scrolling (multi directional mouse scroll wheel or apple trackpad) do the exact same thing - they load the next or previous tab, using up extra memory they don't need to.

Basically a very nice, non-buggy, non-issue causing feature ha been extracted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Scroll left/right with multi-directional scroll wheel mouse or trackpad over the tab bar.
2. ???
3. Profit! (sorry, couldn't resist. I bet it's the least original bugzilla joke ever)
Actual Results:
Window change to next or previous tab, just like one were to use the scroll wheel up/down or track up/down on track pad.

Expected Results:
Tabs in overflow to the left or right of current tab should slide over, revealing the one beyond them in either direction. Minefield should have exposed the additional tab that are not visible because they span too far out to the left or right.

I searched bugzilla but wa unable to find a bug open on this. I did find:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=356675
and
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=355850

Two scroll wheel bug recently fixed, and which are possibly responsible for disabling the original feature.
