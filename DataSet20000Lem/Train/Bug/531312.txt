Slow typing and tab response

Typing very slow to appear when entered and sometimes mouse click and keystoke combination are missed - e.g. highlighting a block of text and using ctrl+v, ctrl+x, etc. This happens both in web form and in the address or search windows. Also response time of new tab opened from a link or a blank tab which then ha an address entered is slow to glacial.

Common factors: Seems to happen more the longer the box ha been up, or the more tab that are opened.

Important clue: I opened several blank tab sequentially accidentally and then closed them sequentially and the issue disappeared.

Example: This box wa up since 1:41 AM PST and I wa opening and closing tabs, typing into forms, etc. until about 4:30 AM when I went to bed. It got slower but wa liveable over that time. I left the computer running (no standby, no hibernation) with about 10 tab open. When I woke up @ 10:30 and started surfing again, the browser wa almost unusable. I closed a few tab I didn't need any more, and then opened the 6 to 10 blank tab and closed them sequentially and now the browser is working properly.

Reproducible: Sometimes
