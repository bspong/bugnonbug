major memory leak in firefox 3.0.10
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

during the course of a normal day, firefox memory usage steadily increase regardless of limit set in about:config. Disabling the memory cache slows it initially but result in frequent hangs. After a number of hour hours, memory usage pass 1GB and by the end of a normal day (~13 hours) memory usage is around 1.6GB and firefox is noticeably le responsive, action taking several second to occur (though not to the point of a hang). It happens regardless of how many tab I have open (generally around 10 though).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.use firefox normally for an extended period
2.
3.
Actual Results:
memory usage is currently 141MB with 4 tab and hasn't been running for more than half an hour

Expected Results:
memory usage to stay within a few hundred MB or at least le than 1GB

dual quad core Opteron with 8GB of RAM. 3.0.8 did not have this problem, can't remember about 3.0.9 but I don't think it did either; certainly not a bad if it did.
