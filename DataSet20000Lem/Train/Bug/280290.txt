common web-archiving format for opensource browser

it would be nice if a common format for archiving web-pages ( or "Save As Web
Page, Complete" ) could be used by all/most/many opensource browser ...

being a konqueror & mozilla/mozilla-firefox are (probably!?!) the biggest
opensource browser their developer could encourage this by agreeing to a
simple common standard that is easy to implement for themselves & other browser
based on the gecko or khtml engine (including safari & camino on macosx) &
other opensource browser in general ...

below follows a verbatim quotation of KDE bug/wish # 98043
(http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98043) which i lodged yesterday:

#### START QUOTATION ####

it would be nice if a common web-archiving format could be used by all/most/many
opensource browser ...

currently, the default linux install of firefox version 1.0 give the option of
Save As "Web Page, HTML Only" or Save As "Web Page, complete", the latter saving
the html a a single separate file & a directory of the same name with "_files"
appended to it, in the old microsoft window style ... this creates a
**terrible** mess of the logic of your directory structure ... so maybe firefox
need a web-archiving format ...

... and because it is so simple, maybe konqueror's *.war format is a good choice
... and would be eay for other browser to implement ...

... maybe kde/konqueror developer could work with mozilla.org on this ...

... at a minimum, it would be nice for konqueror & mozilla/firefox browser to
be able to use (ie. read/write) any format that the other implements, now & in
the future ... and i guess any microsoft format aswell ...

#### END QUOTATION ####

i hope this get some consideration because, like me, i'm sure a lot of people
would find this a great convenience ...

thanks,
Simon Reid
