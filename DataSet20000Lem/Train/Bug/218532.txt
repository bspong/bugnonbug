a misconfigured web server can redirect a browser somewhere completely
unexpected instead of delivering a directory index. Firebird cache this
weird redirection even after the server ha been reconfigured.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. configure a "boa" web server on a debian woody machine named "kewanee" with
default boa.conf
2. look at an existing directory in your web space, with no final slash, so you
get redirected to kewanee/yourdir/
3. Thanks to firebird keyword expansion, you are now looking at the web page for
Kewanee, Illinois, instead of a directory index
4. edit your boa.conf file so redirections take you to the directory like they
are supposed to. -HUP to reload configuration. Full kill and restart, too.
5. attempt to reload the directory which wa misdirected earlier

Actual Results:
i got the cached page even though the server wa no longer misconfigured

Expected Results:
requested the redirection again instead of believing the earlier
"permanent redirection" instruction (or whatever boa told it)

"Hog day" (from misdirected web page) look like a fun festival
