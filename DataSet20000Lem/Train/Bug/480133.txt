Getting sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial even after deleting offending certificate.

I work with an iLO device (probably the same case with any network device that doe self-signed certificates) for a while (talking month or years) and then need to change the IP address of the device. I change it and cannot regain access even after deleting the offending certificate from the firefox certificate store.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse to an HP iLO interface.
2.Recieve sec_error_ca_cert_invalid error and make permenant exception.
3.Login and change IP address.
4.Browse to new HP iLO IP address.
5.Recieve sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial error.
6.Goto Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Encryption -> View Certificates
7.Highlight old certificate and delete.
8.Browse to new HP iLO IP address.
Actual Results:
9.Recieve sec_error_reused_issuer_and_serial error with no options.

Expected Results:
9.Recieve sec_error_ca_cert_invalid error and make permenant exception.

I've seen other post that are similar to this. The bug is not the sec_error_ca_cert_invalid error but the fact that I cannot fully delete all trace of a certificate from firefox. I should be able to delete a certificate from the certificate store and then firefox believe that it'd never encountered it before rather than caching it's information elsewhere.
