Silverlight application lock up firefox. I tried astajulian.com on version 3 and version 4 (beta) running on my computer, both would lock up. Others trying to view this site have mixed problems, mostly consisting of a blank white screen with nothing displaying at all. I tested the site on my computer and others' computer running all of the other popular browser such a IE and chrome. Website run with no problems. Please have a look and let me know what you can find out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.astajulian.com
2.
3.
Actual Results:
lockup a soon a you try to transition to another screen from the main screen, although for some, the site lock up immediately.

Expected Results:
Of course, I would expect the site to work the same way it doe for all other browsers.

Silverlight is already compatible with all other major browsers. Failing to incorporate this technology on Mozilla will negatively affect it relevance in the internet community.
