The browser hang indefinitely when visiting page containing a particular form of window medium embedding (mac-only).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the attachment or mentioned site in the browser
Actual Results:
Browser hang indefinitely

Expected Results:
Browser doe not hang

This is also reproducible in Safari 4, so my initial response wa to assume the window medium plugin wa at fault. I verified that I wa running the latest version of "Windows Media Components" (version 2.2.3.7), reproduced it there, and then contacted telestream support (desktopsupport@telestream.net).

Telestream support booked this a case 1-61142.

Their support person responded to me that this wa not a plugin error, but instead wa a site design issue. So, because I don't think it's acceptable for the browser to hang for any reason, I am booking it here.

I have already contacted the site owner to correct their page, so the linked page might start working in the near future (for this reason I will attach a demo page).

This problem also occurs in safe mode.
