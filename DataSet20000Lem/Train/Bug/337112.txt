Wrong coordinate in absolute positioned server side imagemap

Wrong coordinate get sent to the server when clicking server side imagemap which is positioned with CSS absolute positioning. The coordinate should be relative to the top-left corner of the image, but Firefox us the top-left corner of the parent element. So if the image is positioned with CSS definition "position:absolute;left:140px;top:30px", and you click the image on the position (10,10) the coordinate which get sent to the server are (150,40) while they suppose to be (10,10).

This happens at least in the following Firefox versions:
- Firefox 1.5.0.1 for Windows
- Firefox 1.5.0.2 for Mac OS X
- Firefox 1.5.0.3 for Mac OS X


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Put these line to some html document:
---snip---
<a href="something.php">
<img src='someimage.png' style='position:absolute;left:150px;top:40px' ismap>
</a>
---snip---

2. Load the page to Firefox and place the cursor to the top-left corner of the image

3. Look at the browser status line

Actual Results:
The status line show the URL with the coordinate appended to it. The coordinate are relative to the container element of the image (to the background, if there's no other element in the file) , not the image itself.

Expected Results:
The coordinate should be relative to the image, which is the actual imagemap.
