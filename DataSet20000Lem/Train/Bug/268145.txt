Starting up with multiple tab make the autocomplete feature in tab other than
the first tab not recognize that 1) there are multiple usernames or 2) multiple
auto-complete entires.

This show up a a problem only in the second tab - the first tab work fine.

I don't know if Autocomplete and Password Manager are the same problem, but it
certainly is the same symptom:
1) Autocomplete doe not recognize that there are multiple entry other than in
the first tab. One ha to type a full string. Like bug 267703.
2) Multiple user name are not shown in tabbed window other than the first.
One ha to type the full username with no dropdown. Like bug 220734.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up the home page a http://www.google.com/|http://www.google.com
2. Do 2 google search such a test1 and test2
3. Create 2 usernames and password for a site - I've used both www.mail.com and
news.earthlink.net
4. Restart firefox
5. Go the second tab
6. Click in the google search string. No drop down is shown.
7. Still in the second window, go to news.earthlink.net
8. Click in the email address field. No drop down is shown.

Actual Results:
In both case no drop down of multiple string or account wa displayed, even
though there were multiple options.

Expected Results:
It should have shown multiple entires/accounts.

Running the step 6-8 in the first tab give correct result

If I run step 6 in the first tab rather than the second, I get a drop down in
the google bar showsing "test1" and "test2".

If I run step 7-8 in the frist tab rather than second, I get the drop down
showing both accounts.

I wa able to duplicate the problem in a virgin install with no extensions,
theme etc.
