If the user ha a fairly large amount of bookmark and they have never been cached the "Bookmark All Tabs" is very slow and cause the following dialog to pop up:
============
A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.

Script: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Mozilla%20Firefox%203.1%20Beta%203/components/nsPlacesDBFlush.js:241
============
Perhaps the timeout for javascript that is running the browser should be longer.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the browser
2. Open about 50 tab
3. Bookmarks->Bookmark All Tabs

Actual Results:
Wait and see the dialog described in "Details".

Expected Results:
Fast display of the bookmark all tab dialog. Perhaps if the reading and caching of the bookmark take too long just display a top level folder that is always available and then merge the result with the real bookmark when the bookmark are loaded.
