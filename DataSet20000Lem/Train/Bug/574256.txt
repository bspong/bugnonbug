So I posted a bug and got no hint a to whether you are taking it seriously.

I wa told the everyone is having no issue with plugin-container.exe and that it is just my computer.

I wa told that this bug doe not exist, although there thousand of complaints, a simple google of your nifty new addition prof that.

So, instead of playing Kim Jong Il with me, how about we inform the public that you are currently working on fixing the issue? Or are we going to just give me some more youtube and forum fodder?

I am about one dictator like response away from dropping Firefox all together.

I won't be the first person to switch to Chrome or Ie because of this nasty resource hog and system crasher you people call plugin-container.exe!!
