1 thing I think SHOULD BE Normal but Never happens is that the restore option SHOULD RESTORE automatically, but instead I ALWAYS get 'OOPS THIS IS EMBARRASSING but...' and wonder why you have that message when it ALWAYS come up and NEVER come automatically...EXCEPT This Once (Today) but that is a far a it got. AntiVir just then displayed a message saying it just updated. FF didn't move since then before manually taking it down using Task Manager.

It added a deleted tab,1 which always slows FF way down - 'iGoogle' w/the message about a script and do you want to abort it'
