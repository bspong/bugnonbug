Include an identity indicator in primary chrome
Created attachment 267182
Initial prototype addon

In all the conversation about EV certificates, the need ha become apparent for firefox to have some way of presenting website identity information to the user. While the padlock ha traditionally been co-opted to do identity signalling a well a encryption, it's become a confused metaphor that try to talk about security and identity simultaneously.

While bug 348677 speaks specifically about the Microsoft approach to EV certificates, the resulting UI should not be couched in term of EV exclusively. In principle (though I know of no other relevant identity technology at the moment) this indicator should not be tied to EV a a technology, but to strongly verified identity in general.

The current discussion around such thing point to a passport-inspector icon which, on click, present an identity summary including site owner information (extracted from the subject information of a cert, for example), verifier information (extracted from a cert's issuer information, for example) and an affordance to get more information (launching the security tab of Page Info).

This ha been implemented in the "Larry" extension, attached, and available during development from the supplied url.
