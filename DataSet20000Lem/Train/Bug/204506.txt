It is possible to circumvent the maxlength property of an input field by exploiting autocomplete.

I have a form that I am developing, with a MAXLENGTH="35" property. I also have
some test data stored in my autocomplete buffer that is 35 character long. I
can enter 36 character into the field with the following procedure. (See
procedure box)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select the input field with the maxlength parameter set.
2. Enter the first two character of your string.
3. Select an entry from the autocomplete box
4. Hit home to go to the beginning of the string.
5. Fill the field to length with data
6. Arrow to another entry
7. Press a key. That character will be entered into the field, taking it length
to maxlength + 1.

Also, I've noticed that by arrowing to an entry, pressing a key, arrowing to
another, another key, etc etc, I can sometimes make entry disappear from the
autocomplete box. However, this is so sporadic that I can't seem to formulate a
replication procedure.
Actual Results:
I can enter maxlength + 1 character into a input field.

Expected Results:
It should have limited the field to maxlength characters.

I'm using the April 29th nightly with the standard theme. No extension that
affect the autocompletion are installed.
