Time elapsed in console log doesn't always match time in net request inspector
When we log network request to the console, we append the time elapsed once the request is complete - that is sexy hot. In most cases, if I click on the hyperlinked entry and pop up the network request inspector, the time reported in the "Response Headers" section match the log entry, but in some case it doe not.

These STR are pretty consistent for me:

- Open console
- Load https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4/Triage
- Find the log entry for /images/header_tab.gif . The time elapsed for this image is typically 500-800ms for me.
- Click the log entry to open the net panel, and notice that the response header section report a time that is ~100ms shorter.

I'm willing to believe that these might be different timestamps - maybe the console log "time to complete request", but the response header entry in the inspector is "time until response started." If so, I'll own just misunderstanding it, but I think that those being the only two timestamps present, and having similar-but-not-identical meaning (as well a often being identical) will lead to confusion.

Or maybe they really are supposed to be the same measure, and we just have a bug.

Nominating for blocking particularly in case it's the second thing and we're just getting it wrong. If it's the first thing, I don't know what we can do to disambiguate. Maybe quoting the "time to response start" a a fraction of the total response time (e.g "700ms/856ms")?
