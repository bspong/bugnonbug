Very Annoying bug, i can't clear out the auto filled form like in phpbb3 ACP a soon I clear out the entry and click out it will re-fill again

this is shown using "Master Password" function so don't know if it happens if there is no master password and only way not to have it to not login through master password so the auto fill for username/password wouldn't fill in

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. login Master Password
2. go to some type of form with username and password form like in phpbb3 ACP
3. try to clear out the entry from the form
Actual Results:
username and password get refilled which is not needed in some form and actually hinders functionality like editing a profile

Expected Results:
once to clear out to stay cleared out like in FF 3.0.x

I'm assuming this is an added feature if it is so then please don't do it automatically instead the function should be reserved in a menu like right click on the page

This bug sits between minor to nomral, i didn't say minor because the workaround might be only available for user who us "Master Password"

thanks :) will be waiting for beta5
