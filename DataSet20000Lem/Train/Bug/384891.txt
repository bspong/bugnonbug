focus lost in URL and search input field make browser about unusable
User-Agent: Opera/9.21 (Windows NT 5.1; U; en)

For a few day now I encounter the following problem:
If I type text in the input field for the URL or the search bar (e.g. about 2 or char per second) the input field willsoon loose the focus (usually after about 3 to 10 characters) and thus make it impossible to edit any text.
Often enough you end up clicking 5 to 15 time in th field just to enter some more character before the focus is lost again.

I dont know yet what cause the problem. I have 4 window with severeal tab active. Some tab showing flash or other animations. Don't expect any relation though. I have automatic update enabled but don't remember if it ha updated within the last few day and thus cannot say if the update broke it or not.

But the problem is serious and I consider the browser unusable now.
I checked other application and browser and only FireFox show this kind of problem.


A variant of this is to click once in the URL filed and thus have all the text selected after a few second it loos the focus and selection.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. just type a single char about 2-3 time a second usually wihtin the next few second it happens.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Can not input/change any text in those field anymore.
Need to reactivae the control and place the cursor again.

Expected Results:
Fields should not loose the focus on their own.
