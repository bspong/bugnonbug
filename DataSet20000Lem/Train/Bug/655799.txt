I'm using a MacBook Pro w/ native resolution 1680x1050. I have an external monitor attached whose resolution is 1280x1024. The display setting are set to "mirrored" mode. I then close the MacBook such that the external display is the only one active.

When I click "Bookmarks" at the top task bar, then mouse down to my first bookmark folder (which contains lot of other folders) it content are automatically displayed to the right. However, when I mouse-over one of the contained sub-folders, the content of *that sub-folder* are not displayed.

This doe *NOT* happen when I'm using the OSX laptop in 1680x1050 mode without an external display, nor doe it happen when I run FireFox at 1280x1024 under Windows XP.

The work around is to click on the bookmark tab located at the far right hand side of the screen just to the right of the search engine input area. When accessed in this way all the folder content auto-display on mouse-over.

Reproducible: Always
