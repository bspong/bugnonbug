I got a Javascript error and the error is so long that it push the Javascript dialog down way past the bottom of the screen. There is no scrollbox in the error. I cannot move the dialog box to close it, and Firefox will not close gracefully (cannot even right click on Firefox in the dock to close it, have to command-option-esc and the force quit Firefox). Javascript error alert dialog (and all dialogs) created by Firefox should allow window resizing and normal OS-dependent window close behavior.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an HTML file that produce a javascript error that is so big that it go off the bottom of the screen.
2. Open it in Firefox.
Actual Results:
You are unable to use Firefox or close it and must force quit.

Expected Results:
You should have some way of closing a huge javascript error dialog in Firefox in OS X even if the dialog is huge.
