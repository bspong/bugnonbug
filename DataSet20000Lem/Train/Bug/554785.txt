About 30 to 50% of the time, clicking on almost anything in youtube result in raw HTML code dumped to the screen rather that be interpreted to display a meaningful page. In addition, comment a make under a video don't show up. The problem started March 21st. I never had the problem before. Turned out that wa when your new DOWNLOADHELPER 4.7.2 got installed !!! When I disable DownloadHelper, the problem go away. THIS IS WHY I DON'T LIKE UPGRADING. IT JUST LEADS TO NEW PROBLEMS. Older version of DownloadHelper worked fine.

Solution is to Fix DownloadHelper so it stop interfering with youtube.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.youtube.com while have DownloadHelper 4.7.2 installed.
2. Try one or more time to play a video until raw code is dumped to the screen.
3. Usually take several page reloads to get the page to load correctly
Actual Results:
I get a bunch of crap like the following excerpt below dumped to my screen:
