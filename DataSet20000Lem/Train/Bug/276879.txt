Firefox - CD/HDD relative addressing issue when using frame
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-GB; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041110 Firefox/1.0

On my c: drive, I've got a web page which us frames, and it work fine with
both FF and IE6. I have a second web page with a link pointing to the first
page; this link work OK with IE6, but not with FF - FF find the first web
page OK, but then fails to load the frames.

My two web page are in different folders, and the problem is that when FF try
to load the frames, *it look in the wrong folder*. Whereas IE6 recognises that
the address of the page it need are relative to the folder containing the
first web page, FF treat the address a being relative to the folder
containing the second page (i.e. the one with the hyperlink).

I don’t have much knowledge of HTML, but I figure that this may be a bug in FF.
(I apologise in advance if the problem is in my HTML.) The problem can be
easily reproduced a follows:

c:/test0/page1.htm
<HTML><FRAMESET rows=40,* >
<FRAME src="page1A.htm">
<FRAME src="page1B.htm">
</FRAMESET></HTML>

c:/test0/page1A.htm
<HTML>
<P>Top<P>
</HTML>

c:/test0/page1B.htm
<HTML>
<P>Bottom<P>
</HTML>

c:/test1/Test Link.htm
<HTML>
<P><A HREF="..\test0\pagel.htm"> Test Link<A><P>
</HTML>

When this link is executed, FF load c:/test0/page1.htm OK, but then it look
for the two frame in c:\test1\ rather than c:\test0\, and of course they are
not there.
