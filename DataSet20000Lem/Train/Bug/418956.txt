no way to verify the authenticity of FF

I keep hearing/reading about how Firefox is the most secure browser. While I am not disputing this assertion, I certainly have some reservation about FF. First, when I download FF, I can’t figure out where to validate the download via md5 or sha1. Are these hash value even available to help verify that I got an authentic version of FF? If they are available, why do you insist on “hiding” them. There should be a link to the secure hash value on the very same page a the link to download FF. I should not have to do a web search to find such info. The URL I went to to D/L FF is http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/
No where on this page is a link to a secure hash. Clicking the D/L lin take me to the following URL:
http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-2.0.0.11&os=linux&lang=en-US
No where on this page is a link to a secure hash.

I had an older version of FF and did Help->check for updates. I had a packet sniffer running while the update were being performed. Two IP address from which I received a ton of data from while doing the update were 203.200.188.111 and 205.188.226.54. Running whois tell me that 203.200.188.111 belongs to “Asian Pacific Network Information Center” and 205.188.226.54 belongs to AOL. Why would I be getting FF update from these two entities? How do I verify that I don’t have a rogue program that look & feel like FF?

In addition, the following URL display neither the MD5 sum of my download nor the name of the downloaded file (which is firefox-2.0.0.11.tar.gz)
