In a html

In a div with overflow: auto ...

If I have multiple child element (divs) with 100 percent width no horizontal scrollbar appears ... a it should be.

But If I dynamically add an absolutely positioned element to the container div and position it to have the same offsetTop and offsetLeft a one of the original child element ... a well a the same with and height (Firebug show all size/position attribute to be identical) for some reason the containing div display the horizontal scollbar and it's scrollwidth is increased to be larger than the clientWidth. ... Please note that the offsetLeft + OffsetWidth of the element added is equal to container.clientWidth.

I have a made a simple webpage demonstrating the problem.
It isn't online, and since I don't see anywhere to upload a file I will post the code in the Steps To reproduce box.

In this simple webpage the problem happens each and every time ... but where I first encountered the bug (in a larger application) the problem doe not happen on each page load ... but if it happens on a page load than it happens every time the dynamic addition is executed. ... The same hold true in the larger application too (element.offsetLeft + element.offsetWidth == contaier.clientWidth).

Also, after being forced to add this bug in the general category, may I suggest that you add a category for the Geko engine or Html rendering engine, or whatever name you wish to give the category.
