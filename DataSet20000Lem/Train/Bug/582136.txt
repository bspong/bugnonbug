Rendering issue & Strange 'blue line' when using Windows 7 'snap' feature in Firefox 4B1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:2.0b1) Gecko/20100630 Firefox/4.0b1

While attempting to view a web-page in Firefox in minimized form and also when 'snapped' to either side of the screen, the current web-page becomes somewhat distorted, with object within the page being thrown out of alignment. Most strikingly, a turquoise blue line stretching vertically down the page and Firefox window becomes apparent, almost like a graphical artifact. Additionally, the 'tabs' area of the Firefox window turn completely black.

However, this issue is rectified once the browser is placed back into full-screen mode.

While being of a cosmetic fashion, this issue is rather off-putting in a multitasking environment.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Load up any web-page.
2. Minimize Firefox, snap the window to either edge of the screen.
3.Issue will become apparent, self-rectifies when Firefox is enlarged to full-screen.
Actual Results:
Issue self-rectifies when Firefox is enlarged.

Expected Results:
Issue should not occur during 'snap' nor minimization.

Default Firefox 4 - Beta 1 theme.
Addons: Ad-block Plus
