Mandatory Print Preview
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.1.5) Gecko/20091102 Firefox/3.5.5 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

What I want is the ability to set thing up (presumably by making some adjustment in the preference or about:config or somewhere) that will cause any Print action the user may take, however activated (whether via the File menu, toolbar button, or a "Print" link on the web page) to automatically bring up Print Preview. The only way to send anything to an actual printer should then be from the Print button in the Print Preview UI itself. If the Print Preview isn't already active, any print action would merely invoke the preview.

Rationale:
Approximately 80% of the web print in a manner different from what the user expects. This is not something the browser can reasonably be expected to fix. (I suspect the problem may be AI complete, if it's even well-defined; in any case it's doubleplus hard.) This result in *vast* quantity of wasted paper and toner, which can get very expensive, particularly for site that have numerous public internet station (such a libraries). We have "Always use Print Preview" signs; we *tell* people about Print Preview at every opportunity. But they can't remember to use it, and then they get upset when we charge them for page they don't want.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a web page.
2. Activate a Print option somewhere (e.g., in the File menu)
Actual Results:
A Print dialog come up that doe not include a preview and (once Ok is clicked) result in stuff being sent to the printer.

Expected Results:
A preview is always shown before anything go to paper.

I'm not arguing for this to be the default setup (though that is something that could be considered by usability people). I would just really like the *ability* to set thing up this way.
