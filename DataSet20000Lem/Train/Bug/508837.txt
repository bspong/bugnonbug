Whenever I wath anything on BBC iplayer or any online streamed video, the video run for about 10-15 second and then momentarily freezes, and then restarts having missed all the frame during the pause, which usually last for about 2-3 seconds. This continues for a long a you watch video and never, ever corrects itself. It never doe this in IE7 or 8, so it's not my computer.
The second problem, is that game using java applications, i.e. pogo, suddenly freeze half way through a game and do not restart. Again something that never happens on IE7 or 8.
If these issue are not resolved quickly, I shall return to IE despite all it's faults! This happened with the old version if Firefox too.
