For some time I have struggled with obscure problem: "Tools" > "Options" > "Downloads" > "View & Edit Actions ..." > "Download Actions" dialog wa completely empty and there is no obvious way to add something there. (My profile is very old and wa used in time when Firefox wasn't yet Firefox.)

Short investigation have indicated that one of mime type wa saved improperly with non-printable character prepended. Removing the three character from mime type revived the dialog again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Quit Firefox
2. Open mimeTypes.rdf in any decent text editor (decency == ability to enter non-printable characters, hex editor)
3. Replace e.g. "audio/wav" with e.g. "%01%02%03audio/wav" (where %0x represent non-printable characters)
4. Save the file
5. Launch Firefox and open the "Download Actions" dialog.
Actual Results:
The dialog is empty.

Expected Results:
The dialog shall list all valid mimeTypes.rdf entries.

I presume that some buggy plugin ha "injected" that stuff into my mimeTypes file. Anyway, I think Firefox should handle that properly, since there is no easy way for user to clean that file. Probably Firefox should remove invalid entry automatically.
