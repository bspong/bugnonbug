My Notebook is running Ubuntu Jaunty 9.04 on the Netbook Remix. I have followed the instruction for rendering support for Tibetan text but I still cannot see it in Wikimedia Projects in certain instances. I have installed the font and have even enabled the Keyboard Indicator to type in Tibetan or Dzongkha but in certain Wikimedia article Tibetan text is invisible. I confirmed this with User:BabelStone. I can see Tibetan on the Rongzompa article but not in the "your computer" section of the Help:Multilingual_support_(Indic)#Check_for_existing_support. B9 hummingbird hovering (talk • contribs) 16:46, 23 August 2009 (UTC) I suspect this might be a Firefox bug. The difference between the Rongzompa article and this one seems to be that that one us {{bo}} and this one us {{lang}}. In principle, the latter should work. I have tried both 3.5.2 and 3.0.13 and the Tibetan script in question is still not visible.

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I have installed Tibetan font and can type in Tibetan in the Keyboard indicator
