When I click the "buy it now" buying option on ebay, all the item available to purchase immmediately without having to bid are listed. I notice, first, that the little "buy it now" icon next to the item doe not display a before. Then, when I click on the sale item, the blue rectangular "buy it now" button doe NOT display at all. Previous version of Firefox worked properly. Internet Explorer work properly.

YOU MUST FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY OR MILLIONS OF EBAY USERS WILL STOP TRYING TO USE FIREFOX.
