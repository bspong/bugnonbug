Yahoo Mail spell check always suggests the word 'your' for every error in spelling with Mozilla recently.

When using Yahoo Mail and the Mozilla Browser the spell check function on Yahoo Mail will ONLY suggest the word 'your' a the "change to" word no matter what word checked or how it is spelled incorrectly. It will identify correctly spelled word but recommends 'your' for everything else, the "Suggestions" box is empty. It doe not happen when using Yahoo Mail and Internet Explorer, only with Mozilla and on two different machines.
It started approx. two week ago, early Nov. but had worked fine for the many month I have been using Mozilla. I uninstalled Mozilla with the "Add/Remove Programs" fucntion and reinstalled but it did not correct the problem.
A friend trying to duplicate the problem said Mozilla and the Yahoo spell check worked for him, a it had for me on my two machine for months.
Thanks,

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Mozilla
2. Go to Yahoo Mail and compose text with a, or several, misspelled word

a suggested CORRECT spelling of the word I wa wanting to use but instead I got the word 'your'

suggested a 'change to' whatever the correct spelling is and list other 'suggestions' but not show the word 'your' everytime for every word.
thanks,
