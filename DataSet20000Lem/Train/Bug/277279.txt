We allow customer in Maryland to file for Unemployment Insurance using an
online application. The application ha been up and running for about 4 years.
It worked fine in Netscape 3.x and 4.x and IE. I recently downloaded Firefox
1.0. I tried to file a test claim (the application cannot be completed or a
false claim will be entered so only a few data entry screen should be tried if
trying to duplicate this problem) using Firefox 1.0 (and Netscape 7.2 a well
with the same result). When the first data entry screen wa entered, I clicked
on "Click Mouse Here to Proceed" button. The transaction stalled for several
minutes. Eventually, an alert box appeared saying: "Document contains no data."
We need to resolve this problem to allow our customer to file claim using the
new Firefox browser. Are there any setting that can be changed to assist them?

FYI, I did a Google search on this issue and found several dozen bulletin board
entry from others who experienced the same problem.
Thank you for your help.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://secure-2.dllr.state.md.us/ui/mdpilot/claims/claim/index.stm
2. Click on Click Here to File Claim Button
3. Click on radio button Yes for the first and No for the others, and skip the
drop down menu on the first data entry screen.
4. Click on the Click Mouse Here to Proceed button
5. Wait more than a minute for the response.
6. Alert box pop up - Document contains no data
7. Click OK and repeat with same result each time.

Actual Results:
Alert box popped up saying Document Contains No Data. I could not proceed any
further and could not complete the application.

Expected Results:
Allowed the user to go to the next data entry screen and the next one after
that, until all data entry screen had been completed and the confirmation
number wa received verifying that the claim had been filed (if testing, please
don't do this a a claim WILL actually be filed; stop before reaching the
confirmation page)

The same exact problem occurs in Netscape 7.2. It did not occur in Netscape 3.x
or 4.x, and never occurs in IE5 or IE6.
