Adjust theme style for touch-enabled cs rule
Created attachment 451644
Tab-height and close-button change

Alex, Shorlander,

last year we introduced some theme style on window that are only applied for computer with touchscreen (via the -moz-touch-enabled cs selector), to increase the clickable area and visual affordance of some elements. We haven't revisited these style yet for the new theme, and some thing look a bit out of proportion, so I'm posting here a proposed patch + some screenshots to adjust them.

The most significant part is the tab height, which look too big at the moment(5px higher than default theme). I've reduced it to what I think look better, and also due to some shadow+border change on the new theme, we have a bigger clickable area than 3.6 but with a smaller appearance! win.

Other change I did wa to reduce a bit the close button, from 18x18 go to 17x17. This loses 35px of clickable area, but look much more compatible with the size, and those pixel hopefully won't be needed after bug 547997.

Things I looked but didn't change because they seem fine are the width of the new tab button and the tab dropdown button. Also, there's the distance between the URL bar dropdown button and the Go arrow.

Of course, these are all my personal opinions, and we can make further change or drop these style entirely, depending on your thought on it.
