Responding to a site email browser load infinite number of tab
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/6.1.3 Firefox/6.1.3

When responding to a trusted website email via Mozilla, upon sending message, the Browser continues adding tab and will not allow me to stop this action without forcing a shutdown of the system.

In this most recent incident, I wa responding to an email from Dell requesting feedback in response to a recent issue. The site URL http://rap2.tns-online.com/s.asp?ID=AB9AFA4915E54ED0ACAE5102AF7DE09C opened up a survey questionnaire. Upon completing survey, I clicked on the send icon and the Browser began initiating tab without end.

I tried to stop/close the browser without success. I wa not allowed to even open other program (word my email in Outlook, etc).

The only way to stop this wa via a forced shutdown (holding the start button for 7 second and waiting an appropriate amount of time tried to restart system.

I am unable to restart computer and receive indication that I do not have sufficient memory. I had 8 gig of memory chip installed which should have been sufficient memory.

Therefore, my computer is useless and I am having to send this trouble report via another computer, and have had to have a Dell Technician dispatched to try to correct problem.
