I don't want to save cooky from every site that try to set them. So I have
"Ask" checked. But there are some site I trust that are OK, I don't need to be
bothered. I have checked "Apply to all cooky from this site" in the
Accept/Deny box when I click Accept, and they're listed in the "Exceptions".
But every time, I still get asked.

I can accept this is working according to a strict interpretation of "Ask". If
so, a a usability issue, there should be a choice meaning "Ask if it's a site
not already in the Exceptions to accept or deny. If it's there, handle it a
instructed and don't pester me."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set "Ask" in privacy preference
2. Visit a site wanting to set a cookie, check "Use for all...", accept.
3. Return to site, or go to a different page on site wanting to set another cookie.

Actual Results:
Nag, nag, nag.

Expected Results:
"I told you once, I trust this place. Quit asking about it."
