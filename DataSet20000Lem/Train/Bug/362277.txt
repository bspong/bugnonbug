It used to be in 1.5 that after clicking on a download link and getting the download location dialog, you could still scroll the main window. You can no longer perform a scroll of the main window while the Download Chooser popup is active in 2.0 under Mac OS X 10.3.9.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a download link in Firefox 2.0 that pop up a Download Chooser popup.
2.Try to scroll the main Firefox window without closing the popup.
3.

Actual Results:
It is impossible to scroll the main Firefox window when the Download Chooser dialog is active. There is no way to move focus to the main Firefox window [clicking, using Command-`, or any other means].

Expected Results:
In Firefox 1.5.0.X, even when the Download Chooser popup wa active, one could still scroll the main Firefox window under Mac OS 10.3.9.

If you need information from two non-local place on a web page in order to form the proper name of the download (say, an application's version number a well a it OS restrictions), it is amazingly inconvenient to not be able to scroll the main window in order to observe each of the two value while creating the download filename. This functionality wa in Firefox 1.5, and disappeared under 2.0 for my Mac OS X 10.3.9 system.
