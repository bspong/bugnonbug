I frequently see CNet TV. This site is mostly okay, but many a time it crash badly and happens with all the Firefox window opened. IE7 and IE8, it is fine. It doe show 'Not Responding' and many time it doe go away for a few second and to save all my open window and tabs, I have to close this one before that annoying message come up again.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to the CNet TV Home Page.
2.For that, go to one of CNet's main sites, like http://www.download.com/ or http://www.cnet.com/ and click the tablike hyperlink at the top for CNet TV.
3.Should happen most of the time.
Actual Results:
The home page come and half of the Flash part appears, but the main part, including the video and the video browser doesn't appear. Then it's gone - poof!

Expected Results:
The video part and the right hand sidebar should've appeared. Then automatically, the daily update video start to play.

I wa using the default theme. It doe happen with all the theme I have used at that time.

I have an HP Pavilion Tablet PC (tx2001au). It ha an AMD Turion TL-58, 1.98 GHz. The GPU is a 128 MB GeForce 6150 Go.

I don't know the crash module. It never show up. Just hangs.
