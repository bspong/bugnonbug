browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace is obsolete, remove it from firefox.js
support browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace or browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace obsolete, remove it from firefox.js

bug #175124 ha removed support for browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace, but we still have:

/browser/app/profile/firefox.js, line 270 -- pref("browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace", true);

from bug #175124 comment #29:

click on Open in Tabs replaces the currently selected tab with the tabset
Ctrl/Cmd+click on Open in Tabs appends the tab and selects the first tab of
the set (foreground load)
Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+click on Open in Tabs appends the tab and leaf selection
alone (background load)

although it appears a by design and after much discussion, I'm a little concerned about "open in tabs" (by default) replacing the selected tab.

are user like me, and they use tab a "a todo list"?

I see that I can get back to my replaced tab (with the back button), but it still ha a data-loss like feel.

(the Ctrl/Cmd+click listed above sound like what I'd want.)

what about restoring support for browser.tabs.loadFolderAndReplace, so that click on Open in Tabs will not replace?

thanks to rob strong for pointing this out.
