Open-Source CVS version of FF force me to accept proprietary, non-Open-Source EULA (license)
As some of you may remember from the dark old times, mozilla.org is an Open-Source project. Apart from Open Source value (like freedom, privacy, user-centric, fairness), it mean at the very minimum to use Open Source license (or Free Software licensese, a defined by OSI or FSF).

Unfortunately, Mozilla Corporation derived from that, using a non-Open-Source, proprietary license for the *binary* distribution of Firefox. In that sense, it is no more free than Netscape 6 was, which used a very similar license and almost identical setup (almost completely Open Source source code, but proprietary licence for binaries, and trademark).
So far so bad.

At least the source code is free of that, I lied to myself.

No more. Now, when compiling and starting CVS trunk "browser", I get a EULA which force me to accept the proprietary license. I am not willing to, preventing me from using the official Mozilla browser. I don't want proprietary software on my computer - that wa one of the big reason why I contributed to Mozilla.

This is an Open-Source project, nothing else. Proprietary license have no place here. The removal of this EULA is *mandatory*.
(BTW: The click-through license have no effect in Germany, one of Firefox biggest userbases, anyways, clicking "Accept" doe not make the user legally accept the license.)
