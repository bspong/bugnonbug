This alert never get triggered and there are 3 node in nodeArray:

for (node in nodeArray)
{
if (node == nodeArray[1])
{alert("match")}
}

It seems like the node in the node array are changed by using a for in loop. I caught this by looking for a type one node in the array. I know that nodeArray[1] is an instance of a type 1 node. However, when I look for it like this:

if (node.nodeType == 1) ... it is never found. If I do an alert for node.nodeType for each iteration of the loop, all of the message say "undefined". Before doing this I tested that nodeArray[1].nodeType == 1, so I wa expecting the second alert to say "1".






Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Just create an array of dom node with 2 or more node and try this:

for (node in nodeArray)
{
if (node == nodeArray[1])
{alert("match")}
}

The alert will never be triggered. Also the type of the node will not be "undefined", even if they are type 1 nodes.
