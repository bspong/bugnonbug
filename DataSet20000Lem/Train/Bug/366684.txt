I have received a reply back from one of our Senior Specialists here. She wa able to recreate the problem on her workstation. However, we do not have a verified solution to the problem. It ha been brought to the attention of the programmer here, but it seems to be something with the Firefox application. Our specialist did notice that after she logged out a the student and lost control of the keyboard she wa able to regain control if she clicked up on the top menu bar...for example after clicking on File and then clicking back down in the Login box she wa able to type on the keyboard again. I know this is not convenient solution to the problem, but it is a workaround that ha been found. Also, she did not have any of the problem using Safari on the machine so that maybe another option for you. If you have any other problem with Renaissance Place or notice any other odd behavior please e-mail me back at your earliest convenience so that we may document that a well.
