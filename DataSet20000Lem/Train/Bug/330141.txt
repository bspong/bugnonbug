Several times, I've had Firefox open for a few hour and at some point my keyboard mapping simply become jumbled around. Trying to type in the location bar, search bar on in any kind of web form becomes IMPOSSIBLE and extremly frustrating along with using key shortcuts. For example, when I type the letter 'z', it produce a 'w' instead! When I try and use Ctrl-Z to undo, instead Firefox performs Ctrl-W and close the current tab! This problem only happens in Firefox and not in any other program like Notepad, Thunderbird, etc. Restarting temporarily solves this very annoying and very frustrating problem. This is reproducable running in Firefox's safe mode, after a clean profile install, and after a fresh system install (I had several other problem that led me to do this).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox for a few hour
2. Try to type in the phrase "http://www.mozilla.org/firefox" in the location bar, search bar, or any web form.
Actual Results:
The phrase "httpM!!zzz:,owillq:org!firefox" is produced.

Expected Results:
The phrase "http://www.mozilla.org/firefox" should have been produced.

I'm using a standard American laptop keyboard, and this also happens on my standard american Logitech full-size keyboard. I've attached a full list of what keyboard mapping get jumbled for reference. Has anyone else experienced this problem or help? This is a major and frustrating bug!
