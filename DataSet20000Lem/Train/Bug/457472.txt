When a search is completed on google and I click the link name on top of the description, it take me to a totally different website than the website address below the description (ie. entered "thesims2" and clicked on the name of the first search item, it opened a new tab and opened a webpage :http://www.monstermarketplace.com/searchw19.asp?q=thesims2&ref=10541&source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beedly.us%2Fsearch.php%3Fq%3Dthesims2)
When I tried the link again it took me to: http://disabilitycalorie.info/search.php?aid=13866&said=61-v2test7&keyword=thesims2&ipr=&rej=1

It take me to a different website every time and this ha only been happening since I go the upgrade to Mozilla 3.0.3

Reproducible: Always

1.go to www.google.ca
