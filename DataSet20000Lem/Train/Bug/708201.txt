Adobe Reader version 9.4.6 fails to update the Firefox plugin which remains a 9.4.5.236
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:8.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0.1
Build ID: 20111120135848

Steps to reproduce:

Downloaded Adobe Reader 9.4 from http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/ and then updated via the Adobe Help menu to 9.4.6 (secure and supported version).


Actual results:

The Firefox plugin is only updated to 9.4.5.236 which cause a Plugin Check to report that the plugin is out of date and a potential security risk.

The only option is to disable the plugin since it cannot be removed.

However, if the user land on a PDF site, Firefox display a dialog inviting the user to choose whether to download the file to the local machine, or to open it with the disabled plugin. If the latter action is chosen, Firefox re-enables the plugin which in turn reintroduces the security risk.

Since the user may not be aware that the plugin ha been re-enabled, action need to be taken to ensure that it ha been disabled once the document ha been closed.

The problem appears to lie on the Adobe side since the plugin (nppdf32.dll) is dated 07-June-11 which seems to imply that Adobe is trying to force user to upgrade to Reader X by not updating older plugins which enable PDF file to be displayed in browsers.


Expected results:

The plugin should have been updated to 9.4.6 a well.
