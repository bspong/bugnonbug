tab-selected-start.svg/tab-selected-end.svg are unnecessarily complex and may affect performance

While triaging and bumping into bug 921673 I just happened to look in:

If I understand the CSS gradient syntax correctly then this:

linear-gradient(transparent 2px, hsla(0,0%,100%,.15) 2px, hsla(0,0%,100%,.15));

basically specifies a gradient that is transparent from the top to 2px down, then is hsla(0,0%,100%,.15) from 2px down to the bottom.

If that is correct, then there is no point in using a gradient. Simply create a box that start two pixel from the top and fill it with the color hsla(0,0%,100%,.15).

But then if we can do that, then we don't need the 'foreignObject' in order to be able to use 'background-image'. We can simply use an SVG <rect>.

And if we can just use an SVG shape, then we don't need the 'clipPath' (expensive) and can just make the shape a path that ha the outline of the clipPath.

So unless I'm wrong about the gradient, then the only thing we need in this SVG is a single <path> element with a fill.
