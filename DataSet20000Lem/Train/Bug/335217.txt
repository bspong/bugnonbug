When connecting to the internet using a vodafone umts card you won't be able to view any web page, if your browser is set to automatic proxy configuration.
If you switch proxy configuration to direct connection, everything will work just fine.
This bug exists at least since version 1.5.
I tried 1.5, 1.5.0.1 & 1.5.0.2 - neither works.
Tried 1.0.4 & 1.0.6 - both work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to the internet using a vodafone umts card
2. Set the browser to use automatic proxy configuration


Actual Results:
No access to web page possible. Firefox keep trying to connect to the address entered.

Expected Results:
Automatic proxy configuration should work under all circumstance (that's why it's called automatic)

I don't know if the problem only exists with the vodafone network (quite possibly so) since I don't have any other card to test with.
Naturally every other connection (LAN, Modem) I tried work just a it should with automatic proxy configuration, otherwise the problem would already have been reported.
Silly IE of course ha no problem at all.
Looks like something changed in the way firefox automatically detects proxy setting from version 1.0.6 to 1.5.
