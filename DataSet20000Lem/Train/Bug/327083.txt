When you install a new version of firefox (either manually or through the upgrade mechanism) the file winprefs.js is deleted from the system.

This should not happen, especially if a system is configured to have certain option set and user should not fiddle with them (ie security, image etc).

The installer SHOULD honour the existance of the file and leave it alone or else I have to copy the file after every update/upgrade back to the location.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. put a winprefs.js file into the directory {%INSTALLDIR_OF_FIREFOX}/defaults/pref
2. into the file you place certain setting you wish to have company wide and NOT changeable by user (ie load config files, setup proxy ... whatever)
3. start firefox to see whether the file is read .. it is read and certain setting in firefox will be greyed out depending on what one wish to do.
4. upgrade firefox
5. file is gone!!

Actual Results:
After upgrade of firefox (manual OR firefox upgrade mechanism) file winprefs.js is deleted from the directory and one need to replace it.

Expected Results:
File should still be there because this may include company wide setting and some thing in the file which preform intial startup setting EVERY time firefox start should not be changesd by user (security iussues!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)



I have reported a similar issue before (bug #304106), but I wa hoping that the installer would NOT touch winprefs.js, so I used that one instead.

However, it deletes (even the automatic upgrade) this one too giving me no
option to re-install that file winprefs.js. However, the problem is than that even an automatic upgrade will delete the file and I am never sure when this would happen .....

A "nightmare" scenario for a sysadmin.
