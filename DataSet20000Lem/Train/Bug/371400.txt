Happens with XHTML 1.0 document containing iframe that display an auxiliary file. In my case, I see it on my machine (running Ubuntu Edgy) when the file are served by Apache, which is configured to serve XHTML file a application/xhtml+xml.

Situation: when served a text/html, the iframe is rendered every time.
When served a application/xhtml+xml, iframe often (but it seems not always) fails to render. My guess is it's some issue having to do with the timing of the loading of the iframe source and rendering. But see below for a repeatable phenomenon.

Some page (served a text/html) that otherwise display this behaviour are at
http://zipcon.net/~swhite/docs/computers/languages/object_oriented_JS/
To see the problem, you will have to copy the file from that directory to another host which will serve them up a application/xhtml+xml.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.XHTML file with auxiliary file embedded in iframes
2.serve file a application/xhtml+xml
3.
Actual Results:
Usually iframe isn't rendered.

Expected Results:
iframe to be rendered.

I have looked at these file also with: Opera, IE6, Konqueror.
None of them exhibit this problem.

Another phenomenon: It look like the iframe render *every other time* I re-load the page by hitting Enter in the URL area. Quite consistently.
