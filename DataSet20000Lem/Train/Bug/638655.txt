FF 3.6 crash often - every 2 or 3 days. C'est la vie.

Usually I have ton of page open from various activities.

I have the option set: when FF starts, show a blank page: NOT restore previous session.


But after a crash this is ignored, without recourse and without any input from me.

That is an extremely harsh experience, a FF lock up my window desktop trying to paint many windows, bog my network trying to open hundred of connections, and bog itself tending to ignore my kb/mouse attempt to get it to stop. It can impair my system for several minute before I get it attention.

On start after crash, FF's behavior is INTOLERABLE. It should do one of the following instead:

1. honor the setting to start with a blank page, or
2. honor a new similar setting on what to do on start after crash, or
3. ask me if I want the old session restored.

What it doe now, restore willy-nilly against my option and resisting my effort to stop it, is absolutely unacceptable, unreasonable, and in violation of it own "contract" expressed in the option settings. This need to be fixed. Please.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open a bunch of page in multiple window and tab
2. wait for FF to crash
3. restart FF
Actual Results:
it restores all prior window and tab without asking and despite option setting

Expected Results:
I get one blank window or a dialog asking me what to do.
