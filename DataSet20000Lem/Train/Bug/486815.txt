After upgrade from Ubuntu Intrepid to the Jaunty beta, I can no longer use SCIM to import CJK glyph into a Gmail text box when running Firefox 3.1 b3. However, SCIM and Gmail work very well together when running Firefox 3.0.8 on Jaunty. The same phenomenon is observed with text box in, e g, this bug formula ; i e, I cannot use SCIM to enter CJK glyph here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Boot to Ubuntu Jaunty
2. Load Firefox 3.1 b3
3. Open Gmail account
4. Click «Write mail» to open a message form
5. Place insertion point in text box
6. Click SCIM button on Gnome panel
7. Attempt to select, e g, «Japanese - Anthy» from drop-down menu
Actual Results:
«Japanese - Anthy» is not selected, and when I type text on my 105-key Scandinavian keyboard, no choice of Japanese glyph to enter into the text box is presented. Instead, the Latin letter I type are entered directly into the text box.

Expected Results:
«Japanese - Anthy» is selected, and when I type text on my 105-key Scandinavian keyboard, I am offered a choice of Japanese glyph to enter into the text box.

I am using the Firefox default theme.
