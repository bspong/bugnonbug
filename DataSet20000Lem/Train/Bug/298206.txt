In the Linux version of Firefox (referenced above) the carot flash in the UID
and/or the password entry field and responds to the mouse, but will not accept
input from the keyboard (a user id or a password). You shouldn't need either to
duplicate this bug. I believe it is a problem in Firefox because everything
work fine in the Windows 98 SE version, and Konquerer (wash my mouth out with
soap, I know) also work on the same Linux platform (open Firefox, doesn't work;
open Konquerer and it works). I am using Gnome, by the way, not KDE, if that
make a difference. Everything is the standard FC4 system, updated by yum, so
it should all be current. NOTE: It only seems to happen on this site so I can't
guarantee it isn't something screwy SBC or Yahoo have done, but the fact it
work with Windows and with Konqueror make me suspicious.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://sbc.yahoo.com (Only in Linux, Windows work ok).
2. Carot should be flashing in the user id field, if not click on the field with
the mouse.
3. Attempt to enter anything in the field from the keyboard.

Actual Results:
No entry appears, unable to log in.

Expected Results:
UserID should have been entered, then password, then logged into the site.
