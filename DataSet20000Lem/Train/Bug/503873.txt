When I start up my computer for the fist time(cold boot) and wait until all application and driver have been loaded(cpu is normalized), then I run Firefox 3.5 and it take about 30 second to open(page ready to browse). If I close the browser and open Firefox 3.5 again it only take about 8 second to open.

Note: I have uninstalled and disabled all addons and I have set OPTIONS to Open Blank Page when Firefox start

I have followed the step described in Bug 501605 and it did reduce de time for 60 second to open to 30 seconds; However 30 second to open Firefox is still way too long.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Turn on computer (cold boot)
2.Wait until all application and driver are loaded.
3.Make sure CPU Usage is normalized (there are no more application loading)
4.Launch Firefox 3.5
Actual Results:
Firefox Takes up to 30 second to be open and ready to browse (home page: http://en-US.start3.mozilla.com/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)


I have been able to reproduce the same in two computers,
Windows XP SP3
Intel dual core 2.6ghz
1GB RAM
