which appears in a Japanese forum.
Key symptom are:
The mouse doesn't appear to register click in the Firefox window (though you can move the pointer) - but it can vary how much of the window is affected. I have had it where the mouse simply doesn't work at all. OR where you can select and click menu item and tool button but not the link on the webpage.
(NB in some instance even tne Windows toolbar at the bottom of the screen is
affected so you can't click those. But this behaviour only happens in Firefox
- a soon a you alt-tab to another window everything work normally again.)

However, if you alt-tab out and then alt-tab back into Firefox, everything then work OK - but only until another you display another web-page, when the same problem re-emerges. Makes Firefox unusable and I have been using it for 5 years. Sad. Entering this from IE.
URL link are most affected and the link do not show up a link when you
hover over them (no tip, no underline).

Have re-booted PC, reinstalled FF from fresh download - running 3.6.8. No
improvement.
I'm on Windows XP Professional fully up-to-date with automatic installation of
updates.
Problem ha emerged today on wifi in parents' house - normally on wifi in my
own house or wired network. No software installed immediately before but did
recently install HTC Sync 3.0 for HTC phone.

Optical mouse in long-term use. Have tried different usb port to no avail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start firefox (works normally at this point on my google home page)
2. go to new page (I do google search)
3. hover over link and attempt to click
4. alt tab to another application
5. alt tab back to Mozilla Fireox
Actual Results:
at 3:

b. nothing happens when you click them
after 5
mouse work normally unitl another page is loaded.

Expected Results:
normal operation - hand icon appears when hovering, click go to requested page.
