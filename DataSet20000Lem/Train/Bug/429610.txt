I'm using Firefox 3, beta 5, W2K. How can something so obvious slip by? Perhaps a solution ha been made, but yet to be released...maybe in the next update....THANKS.
I notice IMAGE rendition problems. Sometimes I see black line going through images, in the NON-Viewable portion of the page - ie, browse to a heavy page (like pcmag.com), read it for a bit..now scroll down...the page ha black line going across....scroll up again, then down, this refreshes the images/page and the black line go away....hmm
