This is not restricted to tabbed browsing, but affect everything where tab appear (so even on a fresh profile, simply open "Edit->Settings" and go to the "Advanced" page, which also ha tab - the 3rd screenshot on the provided URL show this). This only reproduces on Linux with KDE running (proved on 2 installations) - crosschecked with some other installation of FF3 on Linux (using 1xGnome, 1xFVWM and the last one FluxBox) did not bring up this issue.

On KDE, it look worst with KDE defaults. Switching the default behaviour to let GTK apps use their own theme and color (and tell them to use the "Human" theme) make it le nasty, but still not going away (this can be done by opening the KDE control center, opening the "Appearance" screen, select "GTK Styles and Fonts" and apply the described change here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox 3.x
2. Go to "Edit->Preferences", select "Advanced" and see
3. or: Install TabMixPlus, edit the setting to have tab displayed in multiple rows, and open enough tab to make the line wrap
Actual Results:
Tab height seems to be incorrect - except for the active tab, which then look like a top-down T (see screenshots in URL provided). Inactive tab are all to small (looking like cut-off).

Expected Results:
Tabs having normal size - i.e. looking the same a with other window manager
