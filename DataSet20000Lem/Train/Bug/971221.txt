Dialogs created by add-on bug the Awesome Bar (location bar)
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140211030201

Steps to reproduce:

I have tested and confirmed this with two completely unrelated add-on (NoScript and LastPass).

First, using NoScript: make sure NoScript is installed and add-on are forbidden globally (this is required so that allowing them afterwards creates a dialog asking for user confirmation). Reproduce the bug with the following steps:

1) Again, make sure script are forbidden globally (see explanation above);
2) Open a new tab;
3) Type something into the Awesome Bar (location bar);
4) Allow script globally via NoScript (this will open a dialog asking for user confirmation and trigger the bug);
5) Now, you cannot navigate to the address you typed into the Awesome Bar, no matter if you press Enter, Ctrl+Enter, Shift+Enter or any other combination that can be used. If, however, you switch to another tab and then come back, everything will be just OK.

The same can be done with LastPass by opening the add-on's login dialog (being logged off and clicking on the toolbar button) instead of opening NoScript's dialog for allowing scripts.


Actual results:

I could not navigate to the URL typed into the Awesome Bar (location bar).


Expected results:

I should have been able to navigate to the URL typed into the Awesome Bar (location bar).
