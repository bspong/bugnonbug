Auto update enabled without my auth, unknown website added to approved software source list.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.2) Gecko/20060308 Firefox/1.5.0.2

I just had the autoupdate dialog appear, informing me that the 1.5.0.3 upgrade wa installed and I wa required to restart Firefox. This struck me a odd because I turned off the auto-upgrade feature and did not initiate a search for an upgrade.

I told Firefox I would restart later, and entered the Options to disable further auto-updating. After doing that I checked other auto-install option and I saw that a website "paranoid-androids.com" wa listed a Allowed to install extensions/themes.

I've never heard of that website before. Neither ha the fiancee. And the fiancee doe not use this machine, she ha 2 of her own. This wa definitely done without the knowledge of the sole user of the machine.

Because Firefox is half-between the upgrade from 1.5.0.2 to 1.5.0.3, I am leaving this browser window open... Just in case there is some needed data that would be erased during the restart upgrade. Please advise.
