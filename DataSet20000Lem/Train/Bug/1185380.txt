Selected Text Delete Issue.mp4

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150630154324

Steps to reproduce:

On Mac OSX in the Scratchpad or Style Editor
Issue 1: Delete selected text
1.1 - Select text from left to right
1.2 - Select text from right to left

Issue 2: Selecting multiple character
2.1 - Using the alt+shift+left/right arrow
2.2 - Using command+shift+left/right arrow


Actual results:

1.1 - text is deleted one character at a time from right to left.
1.2 - text is deleted one character at a time from the left side of the selected text - if other character(s) exist before the selected text


2.1 - doesn't select the rest of the text up to the next white space in the direction of the arrow. The rest of the character up to the white space should be selected
2.2 - doesn't select the rest of the text on the line in the direction of the arrow. The rest of the line should be selected
(also with issue 2 can't jump to the next white space even when not holding shift: alt+left/right arrow)


Expected results:

1.1 & 1.2 - Selected text should have been deleted. (demonstrated in attached MP4 video)

2.1 - the rest of the character up to the white space should be selected
2.2 - the rest of the line should be selected
(should also jump to the next white space if just using alt+left/right arrow)
