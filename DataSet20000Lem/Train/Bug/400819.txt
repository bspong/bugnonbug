when one chooses his own colors, several web page become unreadable

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load "options" from "tools" menu (in firefox's menu bar)
2. in the "Option" window choose "content" and click "colors" button in the "fonts & colors" box
3. in the color window
uncheck the "Use system colors" box
uncheck "Allow page to choose theur own colors, instead of my selection above"
click "OK" button
4. click "OK" button in the "Options" window

5. load a document of yours from docs.google.com (if you don't have one, go to docs.google.com, sign up, sign in an and create a new one).
assuming that now you are in the document's editor
6. fill with several character 5 or 6 line




Actual Results:
1) the button of button bar don't appear (i.e., the background's color of button is the same of the foreground color)

2) if you click on "file" menu, you get a menu with a transparent background, and character appear superimposed

Expected Results:
1) of course, the button in the button bar should appear, their backgroud shouldn't have the same color of their foreground!

2) of course, character shouldn't appear superimposed, background of file menu souldn't be transparent!

in hte last menu below, i'm gonna choose "normal" severity , it's not a cosmetic problem: several people (especially using old CRT monitors) can't stand for long time white backgrounds, thus a working option for color becomes very important for productivity
