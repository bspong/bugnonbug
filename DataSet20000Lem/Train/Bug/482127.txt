Bookmarks deleted with Firefox update, unable to restore to any of date listed, bookmark deleted again each time I open Firefox

I didn't even notice that Firefox had updated, but all of a sudden I noticed that all of my favourite were gone. I tried looking in profile folder for a file that might contain the information, but wa not successful.

I tried doing a restore through Firefox since 5 restore date are kept; but after accepting to proceed (which would replace my current favourites), I got an error: "Unable to process the backup file". Hopefully my favourite will still be accessible.

Furthermore, after closing Firefox, any new favourite I saved in my last session are not there when I open it.

Firefox doesn't autofill address I've been to in the address bar when I type in the address bar.
