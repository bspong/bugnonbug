_breakOnEnter should not use setBreakpoint
Created attachment 8548775
patch

Currently setBreakpoint is called with either an original location or a generated location. Not only is this very confusing, it also conceptually wrong in some case (i.e. breakpoint sliding on generated sources).

I'm trying to move thing to where setBreakpoint always take an original location, but one thing that is blocking me from getting there is the fact that _breakOnEnter us setBreakpoint to set hidden breakpoints. This is wrong in my opinion.

setBreakpoint doesn't need most of the machinery of setBreakpoint. In particular, breakpoint sliding is not needed, because the very point of breakOnEnter is to set a breakpoint on a script and line that are guaranteed to exist. The attached patch remove _breakOnEnter's dependency on setBreakpoint, and simplifies it in the process.

A couple of note of interest:
- findEntryPointsForLine and setBreakpointOnEntryPoints shouldn't live on
SourceActor, because they don't need any of state of instance of that class.
Since _breakOnEnter also need these functions, but life on the ThreadActor,
it make sense to make them global.
- The second argument to BreakPointActor.prototype.setActor is actually not
required. The thread actor for a breakpoint actor is already set in it
constructor, and is never supposed to change after that.
