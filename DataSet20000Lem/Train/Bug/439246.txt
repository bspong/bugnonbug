On one page of the ELCA (Evangelical Lutheran Church in America) website, certain button do not work. When I take my cursor over them, they are supposed to drop down a menu. Also when I click on the "Ecumenical Dialogue" button, it try to open a page, but it ha not content. IE work fine at this site on this computer. Firefox work fine on my home computer (with a newer version of windows). This appears to be remarkably similar to bug #429676 (unconfirmed), and somewhat similar to 426149 and 428426 which were found invalid, and also 422126 which is unconfirmed. I have not found this problem on other websites, however the problem may exist because the button may have drop down menu that I am unaware of.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I go to website http://archive.elca.org/ecumenical/whoweare.html
2.I move my cursor over the button (eg. Full Communion, Conciliar Ecumenism etc. They should all light up. Only two of them do. They are supposed to drop down a menu. None of them do.
3. I click on Ecumenical Dialogue, and it display a page with no content.
Actual Results:
1. The button do not light up.
2. The menu do not appear.
3. The page displayed after clicking on the one button is void of content.

Expected Results:
1. The button should light up.
2. The menu should appear.
3. The page displayed should have content.

I put normal for the level of severity, but I do not know how severe the problem is. I do not understand why the problem appears on this computer, and not at home, when IE doe not have the same problem on this computer. If the problem were only with the site, then why doe IE work, and why doe Firefox work on my home computer.
