since recent update- when I click back the browser freeze and the only way to fix it is to go to task manager and end program.

I tried leaving it to see if it would sort itself out and after an hour it wa still frozen. On October 28 it wa happening every 4 or 5 time I clicked "back". I restarted the computer and now it is taking longer, but ha still happened 4 time today. When I go to the task manager it always show 2 copy of the window I wa on when it froze. It ha happened on the above website and many others- it doesn't seem to have anything to do with which site I am on. It ha also happened a couple of time when I scrolled. I have tried to find a pattern to this and I can't see one. Just the back button and just since the update wa installed.
