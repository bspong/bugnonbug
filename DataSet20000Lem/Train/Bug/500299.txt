Incorrectly show EV green bar even for CNAME != CN mismatch
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060309 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.11

When I browse to by IP address to a server that ha a legitimate EV cert, but the cert is issued to "www.isecpartners.com", Firefox show me the green EV bar. I believe that instead it should warn me that the CN doe not match what's in the URL.

However, this only happens when I get 302'd to the https:// URL from the http:// URL. (Our server is configured to bounce people to HTTPS if they visit by HTTP.) When I browse directly to https://10.13.40.21, I do not get the green EV bar (but I don't get a warning either).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse by HTTP to a site that bounce you to HTTPS with an EV cert, but browse to it by IP instead of by name.

Actual Results:
I get the green EV bar.

Expected Results:
Firefox warns me when I go to https://isecpartners.com, since our cert is signed for "www.isecpartners.com". I think Firefox should give me the same warning in this case.
