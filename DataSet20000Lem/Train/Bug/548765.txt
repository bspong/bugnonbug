Some day ago I received a mail from a travel agency and try to print it but I obtained only the fisrt page (some user have the same problem but without the detail below).

To reproduce the problem I did various test :

Using my ISP mail account I send a message in mode text of exactly 100 line to myself. Each line contains a number from 1 to 100. My ISP is orange.fr

Reading the mail with firefox, the print give only the first page, line 1 to 54c in my context.

If I read the message with Thunderbird-3.0.1 the print is correct.

I save the mail on disk and read the file with firefox and print it. The print is correct. Perhaps some control character have disappeared when I saved the message.

I have a mail account on an other server (laposte.net)
I send the same message to myself using this server et read using firefox.
I print the message without problem.

So it seems the problem depends on the mail header






Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I have explained how I have the problem but it is necessary to have an mail account on orange.fr to reproduce it
2.
3.
