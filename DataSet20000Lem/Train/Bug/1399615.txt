* Remove Photon-related conditionals in test (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/0b31d58)
* remove browserAction. This change the add-on to require the Photon page action, with no fallback to a browserAction
- Removes test for Photon (assumes it is present)
- Removes bootstrap.js code that deletes the browserAction button
- Removes webextension code reference to browserAction
- Removes Photon conditionals (i.e., assume it's always Photon)

* Add setting to control binary or base64 upload. This add `$SCREENSHOTS_UPLOAD_BINARY=true` to turn the feature on. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3481 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/92b0d53)
* Convert to semantic locale string for the slides. The numeric locale id have made reordering complicated (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/3d590fb)
* Avoid form uploads from being truncated. `FormData` wa not creating correct request body for large images. This change the code to manually construct the form upload. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3472 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/671b003)
* Put a guard around the exception stack rewriting (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/dbc4750)

* Add a new slide to the tour. This slide includes the pageAction interface instead of the old toolbar button. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3442 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9f072c0) (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/2550449)

Changes from 18.0.0:


* Run all add-on svg file through svgo (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/40b9fe0)
* Fix icon appearance for Photon page action. See Bug 1395284]. Right now, the icon is too dark, so it doesn't match the appearance of the other Photon page actions. The problem is that the URI passed a the action's iconURL is a `file://` URI. The Photon theme us context-fill and context-fill-opacity in SVG in order to style SVG icon correctly, and SVG context painting is not supported for file `bootstrap.js` should pas a `moz-extension://` URI instead, which context painting doe support, and which is what the WebExtension browser action toolbar button uses. Additionally, the icon SVG used by the Photon page action need to be updated with fill-opacity="context-fill-opacity". (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/b246cb9)
* Add logging of unexpected clipboard state (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3430). This log case when the passed-in text is empty, or the textarea select doesn't appear to work. Logs are sent to Sentry. Fixes https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3406 (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/10b7c0f)
* Fixed next and prev button for rtl (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/5a08464)
* Moved Save/Cancel button from right to left for rtl language (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/issues/3412) (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/115d6ed)
* Send image to server in binary (https://github.com/mozilla-services/screenshots/commit/9c558ce)
