Firefox 3.0 in a background window claim too much resource for a time interval,leaving no adequate resource to serve the user activity


This is a follow up of the solve Bug "Background cleanup action block desktop on OS/2"

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=439340

The created solution for the bug ha been implemented at the test system

Solution: pref("urlclassifier.updatecachemax", 104857600)


Working with the new preference with a T23 1.13 GHz 640 MB

I observer:

Open FF 3.0 window and working in foreground with the system editor "ae"
entering text.

Suddenly the system doe not process my entry keys, 100 CPU and some I/O -
duration about 4 to 6 sec.

System design?

The normal SQLite process a service for the application and so need higher
priority above the normal application processes.

The google update of the SQLite data base is a real background low priority
process with high I/O and CPU requirements.

Are these SQL ( I/O and CPU ) operation executed with the priority a service
process to the application?

If yes, there are no sufficient resource left to service the user.

The increase of the SQL Buffer reduces the I/O load, but doe not solve the
workload balancing problem -

Speciality on low power machine at the border of the minimum requirements.


New Aspect/view:

The idle state of browser doe not say, the system is idle!
To start automatic maintenance by FF the system ha to be idle for some time
and not only the browser.

The SQLite DB ha been "VACUUM" regularly.

Current is of the Files is

3.07.08 8.50 4112384 0 places.sqlite
3.07.08 8.49 30056448 0 urlclassifier3.sqlite

just after a "VACUUM"





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. You have to work online and doing foreground work, when the Update / Reproduction with the google DB is initiated.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
The system is frozen for the user - no response or very, very slow.

Expected Results:
1. Working with a Notebook, the user doe recognise heavy system activity -
need status indicator to inform the user - the activity is initated bay Firefox and not from a illegal process on this system

2. Proper load balancing
