Browse a while at slow speed (dialup) and view fairly big image (few hundred
kilos) on the web. At some point the display will freeze. I can still use the
magical SysRq and kill X Windows and reboot, so I guess the key still work, but
the display is frozen.

I've noticed it's about the size of the image (as in kilos) not the dimension
(as in pixels). It ha to be image loaded at low speeds, it won't happen with a
local webserver, local intranet or local harddisk which display them instantly.
It also won't happen in a freshly started browser, it take some time of
constantly viewing such image to produce the freeze.

It doesn't seem to be affected by themes, extension and so on. It doe NOT
happen with the same Firefox version on Windows. It happens with various build
of Firefox on Linux, from various sources.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse for big image (hundred of kilos) at slow network speeds.
2. at some point you get a display freeze.

Actual Results:
Complete display freeze.

Expected Results:
Not freeze.
