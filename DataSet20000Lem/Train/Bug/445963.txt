Please try to check this bug soon enough, if possible, because my example site below will only work for a limited time.
Basically, this is a transport site that let you know how to get to a certain address. However, a metro station is currently closed, and that's what trigger the bug on the site. Once the metro station reopens, the bug won't be reproducible unless another metro station get closed.

So, go to:

http://www.ratp.com/

On the left field (Départ / Plan de quartier), paste "Chatelet - Les Halles" and push the "Station" radio button above.
Then, on the right field, paste "28 rue du plateau paris", and leave the radio button on "Adresse".

Then, click the "itinéraire" link on the right input. It will lead you to a page telling you the station is closed. On that page, click the bottom left link ("Consulter l'itinéraire conseillé").
At this point, the bug is triggered, and your tab is having the problem briefly described above: you can't close the tab, can't go back (when you're supposed to be able to) or go to another URL from this tab etc. However, you can go to other tab just fine.
If you close and restart Firefox, the restored session (I set my session to save automatically on close) will be the one right before the bug occurred. That mean tab opened after the bug wa triggered are not there, etc.

Reproducible: Always
