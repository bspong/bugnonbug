Need a preference to turn off your annoying window placement "feature"

When I attempt to move an active window in the browser, Firefox often (but not always) position it inline with the upper left corner of the 2nd-topmost window. This is superlatively annoying because often I want to compare the content of two window to each other and I find myself fighting with this "feature"

I have looked in vain for a way to shut it off -- it ha only been present for the past few months. I am about ready to throw out this browser.

(Secondarily, sometimes the tabbed page change when I scroll over them-- they switch position or an inactive one becomes active, even though I have not clicked on it.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
(happens about 90% of the time.)

1. Open several window in the browser.
2. Attempt to offset the topmost window about an inch from the 2nd topmost.

Actual Results:
The topmost window doe not stay where you put it, but line itself up so that the top left corner of the top two window are in the same place.

Expected Results:
The window should stay where I put it.

I would not mind this feature if there wa a way to turn it off... thus, it should be a preference.
