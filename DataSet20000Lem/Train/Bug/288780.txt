When opening the preference window from the Edit menu (only the first time
after starting firefox), the interface seems to ignore any click (on the icon
of the categories). After closing the preference and opening them again, the
last item clicked on is openened, and preference work ok after this point.

I've seen this problem since before 1.0, but I never got around to reporting this...


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. close firefox
2. open firefox
3. open preference
4. select pref. category (ignored)
5. close preference
6. open preference
7. select pref. category (working now)


Actual Results:
the first time, all user action (with mouse) are (or appear to be) ignored. The
option on the right (if visible) are not (visibly?) modified.

The second (and further) time, the option are accessible by mouse click and such.

Expected Results:
it should have worked the first time, like it doe from the second time onward,
i.e. the category and the individual setting should be responding to
user-actions.

I'm using a plain downloaded version (installed by firefox-installer) on
mandrake 10.1.
