Steps to reproduce:

How to reproduce:
# Start a new Firefox instance (e.g. "firefox -new-instance -ProfileManager")
# Install https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/
# Install https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/session-manager/
# Store the attached file "2000tabs.session" in the "sessions" directory of the generated Firefox profile. This session represents 2000 tabs, each on URL "about:newtab".
# Restart the Firefox instance
# Load the "2000tabs" session:
## Go to menu "Tools/Session Manager/Session Manager/Load Session..."
## Select the "2000tabs" session in the "Session Manager" window
## Click on "Append to Current Window"
## Click on "Load"
# Use the command "top" to observe the idle CPU load
# Wait and observe the idle CPU load



Bonus:
Try to load 8000 tabs, by repeating the step above 4 time instead of once.


Actual results:

The idle CPU load of the "firefox" process hovers around 30% (if you have 2000 empty tab open and do nothing).




Expected results:

The idle CPU load of the "firefox" process should remain under 1%.
