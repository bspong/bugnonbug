some contact in gmail are blacked over when viewing all contact after clicking "To" in the compose window
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.33 Safari/530.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8

If I go to compose an email then click "To" it open my contact list. If I select "All Contacts" from the group selection drop down list it load them in the pane below.

Scrolling through this list I find that in the "M" contact they become covered by a black box and this continues all the way to the bottom of the list.

I can still click on a contact that is obscured by the black box and it will correctly load them a recipients, but you cannot see who you are selecting in advance.

The workaround is to use the search box above the group selector and
type in partial names. This appears to render all contact searched for
correctly.

Confirmed the bug on FF 3.0.8 and 3.0.11 on Windows XP SP3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have a lot of contact in gmail contact
2. login to gmail
3. compose a message
4. click "To"
5. Select "All Contacts"
6. Scroll through the list
Actual Results:
About half-way down the list of over 1700 contact they will become covered by a black box that continues through the rest of the list making those contact invisible, but selectable.

Expected Results:
all contact should be visible in the list

Seems to work correctly in Chrome.
