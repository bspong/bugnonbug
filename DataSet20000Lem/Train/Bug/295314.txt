When i visit a site that need to load a java applet it will, even thou i have
ticked the box in firefox option to not load/allow the java appletes to load.

Also when closing firefox, it doe not close the java console (the java logo in
the syst tray) and firefox stay open in the process list when you press ctrl,
alt and delete.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In tool > otions click on web feature and untick the enable java box.
Click on ok and you can close the browser and open it again or leave it open.
2. Visit a site that will load up a java application then it will.
3.visit the tools> option and web feature and the box enable java box will now
be ticked.

Actual Results:
Java became enabled even thou the option wa ticked to not enable it.

It should have not loaded the java application and should have not made java
enabled in the options.

I have put the software severity to major a i belive this is a personal
security feature, a i myself and my staff only enable java when we need it a
the line of work we are in and the type of site we need to visit on the
internet often load java apps to infect our system with virus and
downloaders/trojans.
