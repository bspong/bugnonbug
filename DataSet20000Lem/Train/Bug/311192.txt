file upload form receives 'Net Reset Error' or 'Document Contains No Data' on localhost, and sometimes elsewhere on the web

When testing a PHP script that uploads file to a server-side folder on
localhost (127.0.0.1), Firefox immediately return a 'Document Contains No Data'
alert, or, with browser.xul.error_pages.enabled set to true, an error page
reading Net Reset Error is displayed. This seems to be a common problem on some
actual web site that also run file uploading script (see bug
299769,287933,292407,265654,etc.).

Scripts of this nature appear to have a fix under Apache whereby Apache's
LimitRequestBody is set to a higher value, but there is no such configuration
available with an IIS web server. However, the script work on IIS with
Internet Explorer :-(

All known configuration change to php.ini or any other PHP or IIS related
setting have been tested with no solution presentable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use a PHP file uploading script on a localhost web server.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Received either 'Document Contains No Data' alert, or Net Reset Error page,
which prevents the web page user from continuing along prescribed navigation
path with no presentable recourse for the developer.

Expected Results:
Allowed the file(s) to upload with no problem, and continued to display script
results.

I have experienced this bug on Firefox 1.0.7 and Firefox 1.5 Beta 1.
