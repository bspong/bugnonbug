100% CPU for c. 40 sec even in safe mode on site with Javascript and advert
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

This doesn't happen on every machine but is very consistent where it doe occur and is bad enough to prevent use of Firefox. Internet Explorer work normally with the page that affect Firefox.

Sites affected are

http://www.yahoo.com
http://www.onelook.com (subpages only, not main page)
http://www.amazon.co.uk

or any page with advertising banners. The CPU go to 100% for about 40 seconds. I have tried this in safe mode and the problem persists. If I turn off Javascript the problem go away.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For example,

1. go to http://www.onelook.com and
2. search for "apple" (without quotation marks)

As the result of the search is displayed the CPU problem occurs. Notably, the result page includes a banner advert.

If the above is tried with Javascript turned off the result page appears very quickly (and doe not have a banner).

Actual Results:
CPU go to 100% for about 40 second before page is displayed.

Some page such a Yahoo's home page take twice a long a if they had two component that make Firefox slow. A CPU trace show a small dip from 100% between the two components.


Expected Results:
Affected page load normally on all machines.


1. Problem occurs in normal mode and safe mode.

2. Problem occurred in 3.0.5 a well a 3.0.6.

3. Some machine are OK but at least two show the problem.

4. Internet Explorer on the affected machine doe not show the problem.

5. If I could upload a file I could show a CPU trace from Task Manager. These trace clearly show the CPU topping-out and flatlining at 100% for consistent period of time and the short blip between 100% period on page with multiple problems.

6. In practice this problem make Firefox so slow a to be unusable and I have to go back to IE. If I work around the problem in Firefox by turning Javascript off some page such a http://www.nationwide.co.uk become inaccessible a they require Javascript.

7. I found a guide on mozilla.org about troubleshooting CPU problems. None of the remedy in that guide made any difference.

8. I have also tried reversing the Javascript setting in Firefox but these made no change.
