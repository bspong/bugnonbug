When I try to shrink the font really small, it "bounces back" to a specific size (like 6pt or something). I can't shrink indefinitely like I could in Firefox 2. The minimum font size is set to None.

FYI, the behavior is different than when a minimum font size is specified. When I specify a minimum font size it stop before going smaller. But with this bug it's actually shrinking a far a I want, but half a second later pop back to some predefined minimum or something.

Tested in 3.0b5pre (minefield) and problem still remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set minimum font size to None.
2. Make sure "Zoom Text Only" is checked.
3. Use ctrl+minus or control mouse wheel to shrink text really small.
Actual Results:
Text shrink like I wants, and then automatically "pops back" to something like 6pt after half a second.

Expected Results:
Text keep shrinking indefinitely.

I almost wouldn't mind this bug so much if it just stopped at the 6pt instead of going smaller and then bouncing back. I think it's the bouncing more than anything that's kind of annoying. But it would also be nice if it let me shrink the text indefinitely like Firefox 2 would. Otherwise, it feel like IE setting limit on what I can do.

BTW, I disabled all my extension and had the same problem.
