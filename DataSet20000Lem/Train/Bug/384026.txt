I noticed graphic weren't loading. I updated firefox-reinstalled all plugin ran spyware and virus scan and even defragged my drive.

They load fine in IE--but I love your product!- Every time I open Firefox I get a n error message "plugin ha performed an illegal operation" restart Firefox.

I hate to admit this but, specifically neopets.com graphic (I play to bond with daughters)

Help!!! I down want to go back to IE snail browsing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start browser
2.Error message
3.Flash related graphic (neopets.com)
Actual Results:
I visited the site and some graphic do not load. I know it is a flash enabled site.

Expected Results:
I could not properly utilize the site

It should've enabled the plugins--It ha worked beautifully since my first FireFox install. Now it just doesn't show the graphic -but Adblock plus asks me if I want to block them ???? It see them, but I can't.

This seems to be the same problem encountered with the MAC OS--but, I run XP Pro-My computer is also used a a server for a home based wireless LAN.
