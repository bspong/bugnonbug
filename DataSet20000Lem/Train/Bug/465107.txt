HUGE memory leak in window xp cause system to become almost 100% unresponsive (consumes all available ram and pagefile space)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: 3.0.4

after about 2 hour of use firefox take up all of my ram and make the system near unresponsive. in fact most of the time the only way to avoid a total freeze is to reboot. this happens just in general use and ha happened with 3.0.3 and 3.0.4

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open ff
2.start browsing
3.wait for 2 hour and check firefoxes size in task manager if you can even ac it at that point
Actual Results:
firefox took up 199+ Mb of my 256 Mb of ram, also, it only stayed at about 199+ for me because it wa constantly loading into my pagefile. to confirm this i checked and my pagefile use went through the roof after this happened. also, only after this happens doe window tell me that it ha to increase the pagefile because it is too small, an obvious sign that something is consuming my pagefile like a wildfire

Expected Results:
well in real life the damn memory leak shouldent exist and all of my ram and pagefile wouldnt be eaten up

i dont think this ha anything to do with it but i wa using the aero fox theme (cant have been that because it happens with the default theme a well)

my system specs:
CPU: mPGA 478 P4 (2.00 Ghz)
RAM: 256 Mb PC-800
System: Dell Precision Workstation 340
