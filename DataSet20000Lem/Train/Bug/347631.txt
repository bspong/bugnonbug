On the attached URL, you can see that in the big cell at the left with the links, that cell look oversized. If the bus pic is removed, the table obey the "width" attribute (it should be 800px width, not less, not more). Same if you replace that picture with a table or a iframe of the same size. In IE6SP2 the table is rendered OK, with no oversizing. Tested in both Win/Linux FF latest releases, bug appears in both. Also tried with "width" atribute and CSS format, result is the same.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load http://tomman.monkeeh.com/links_tmp.htm
2. Check the right cell with link (the one with the picture of a bus)
3. Look how the cell (and table) appears oversized. The table should be 800px wide.
4. Remove the bus picture and reload the page: the table now look OK (a version without the pic, and with the correct table size is located at http://tomman.monkeeh.com/links_tmp2.htm )

Actual Results:
Oversized cell at the right, forcing a oversized table and a horizontal scroll bar (if the resolution is 1024*768 or more)

Expected Results:
At a 1024*768 resolution, there should be a 800px-wide table, centered on the window.

The page wa designed with FrontPage 2002-2003, also the bug doe not appear in IE6 (and maybe other browsers). Tried redesigning the page from scratch, the bug is still there.
