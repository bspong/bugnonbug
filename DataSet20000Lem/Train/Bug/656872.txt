Firefox 4.0.1 doesn't save Manual proxy configuration after closing Firefox 4.0.1

This started happening when i updated Firefox 4.o to Firefox 4.0.1. So i would assume, this bug only happened in Firefox 4.0.1. Anyways,i type in my school's proxy in the manual proxy configuration and port (HTTP Proxy and all proxy protocols). After surfing on the web i decided to close Firefox 4.0.1 and 5 min later, i wanted to surf on the web again so i opened Fireofx 4.0.1. For 30 mins, i couldn't connect to my school internet so i checked the manual proxy configuration and i found that, all the HTTP proxy, port and protocals are empty? I wa wondering why it wa cleared since i already typed in the proxy and port, and assumed it should be saved after closing. Reason why i assumed it should save because the previous Firefox version, like version 4.0, 3.6.13 and other previous version saved the proxy, port and protocals after closing Firefox 4.0.1. Basically, Firefox 4.0.1 doesn't save proxy, protocals and port after closing it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in proxy, port and protocals.
2.Press ok for connection setting and press ok for network options.
3.Close the browser and open it again and go back and look at the manual congifuration proxy. Everything is cleared; proxy, port and protocals.

Actual Results:
1.Type in proxy, port and protocals.
2.Press ok for connection setting and press ok for network options.
3.Close the browser and open it again and go back and look at the manual congifuration proxy. Everything is cleared; proxy, port and protocals.

Expected Results:
All the proxy, port and protocals are cleared and i have to re type them all back to connect to my shcool internet.

Saved all the proxy, port and protcals just like the previous Firefox versions.
