Session is lost between the parent document and IFrame document even when both at the same page and window [when
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050405 Firefox/1.0 (Ubuntu package 1.0.2)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050405 Firefox/1.0 (Ubuntu package 1.0.2)

With the settings:
(Linux)
Edit -> Preferences -> Privacy -> Cookies:
Allow site to set cooky (checked, default)
for the originating web site only (checked, default wa checked)


I tried to write the IFrame content:


document.getElementById("AnIFrame").contentWindow.document.write('<img
src="_relative_path/an_image.gif')

using javascript.

The page where the IFrame is located is already authenticated and carry
session ID.

The image inside the IFrame a the result of the above command unfortunately
doe not carry the session ID anymore, thus it is rejected and doe not display.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set the preference:
'for the originating web site only' checked
(Please see details).
2.Create a HTML page that contains IFrame and javascript:

document.getElementById("AnIFrame").contentWindow.document.write('<img
src="_relative_path/an_image.gif')

3. The page is protected by authentication mechanism (can be running Tomcat)

4. Accessing the page is fine but the image inside the IFrame doe not show
because the GET request doe not carry the session ID like the page.

(I have used LiveHTTPHeader firefox extension to verify the missing Session ID.

Actual Results:
Session ID is lost

Expected Results:
The session ID should not be lost since the page and the IFrame are accessing
the originating website.

Furthermore, I can easily right click and 'view image' to show the image and it
successfully show the image, meaning the session ID is presented to the website.

The document.write should also carry the session ID when the setting 'or the
originating web site only' is checked.

The behaviour is correct when 'or the originating web site only' is unchecked.
I.e., the session ID is carried by document.write

I hope that is not too complicated to be understood.

But the problem is deep and may not be seen easily every day, but a the usage
of the web ha been increasing important, even being used in serious business
transaction, this should be quite an important problem that need to be fixed.

Thanks.

Enjoy using firefox and developing my application to be 100% compatible in
firefox. In fact, I am using firefox for the testing of my code before IE.
