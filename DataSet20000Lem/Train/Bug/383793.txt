The window drawn by firefox somehow gain the ability to float on top of everything else. This is like program such a VLC which have that behavior a a feature. I did not see any option to "make window float" so I think this may be a bug. I'm running OSX 10.4.9. I have clicked on other program's window that can be seen partially, and also tried to use the exposé finder thingy to select a different window. The other program come forward, but the firefox window continues to block any of their windows.

Also, firefox ha gained the ability to move window off the screen, covering the menu bar. OSX usually block program from being able to be placed covering the menubar. I do have 2 monitor hooked up, but no other program is able to position a window partially off the top of the screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.well, I just leave firefox running and use it regularly. After time , possibly after watching embedded video of flash or wmv nature.

Expected Results:
Add an option to make window float, or not. So maybe whatever is causing it can be turned off. If a website can make the window float, it would be nice to have an option to stop them from doing that
