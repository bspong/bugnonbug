At the url above when you click on one of the link prefixed with "Part xx:
xxx", a RealPlayer soundtrack stream start playing. When I click on the link in
the popup window called "Unfiltered Player" sometimes Firebird crashes. In the
JavaScript console I get the following.

Error: Newwin ha no property

Line 7

I don't know why it crashes. It doe not do at every time. It may be that it
only crash when RealOne Player is already open.
I have Firebird set so it will automatically open the file there in RealOne Player.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the url and click on one of the link to play a part.
2. Click on the link titled Unfiltered Player in the popup window.
3.
Actual Results:
Firebird crashed.

Expected Results:
Kept on with it.

I always close the popup window a soon a I click on Unfiltered Player and the
file open in RealOne Player.
I like to play it in the player rather than the window with no controls.
