When Genius NetScroll+ Optical Mouse is loaded, scrolling by mousewheel in Firefox 3 beta 2 and Firefox 3 beta 3 is significantly slower than in Firefox 2 final version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Plug a Genius NetScroll+ Optical Mouse (or a compatible; I used Genius NetScroll Optical Mouse) in your USB port.
2. Install and launch Genius NetScroll+ Optical Mouse driver.
3. Run a long enough page in Firefox 2 final version. Scroll it with mousewheel.
4. Right click on Genius NetScroll+ Optical Mouse driver's icon and tell the driver to stop and unload.
5. Try to scroll through the same page with mousewheel. Note that the page move at almost the same pace a before.
6. Quit Firefox 2.
7. Run the same long enough page in Firefox 3 beta 3 (or beta 2). Scroll through it with mousewheel. Note that the page move at almost the same pace a before.
8. Launch your installed Genius NetScroll+ Optical Mouse driver again.
9. Try to scroll through the same page with mousewheel. Note that the page move at a snail's pace, you have to scroll the wheel several time faster to move the page at the same speed a before.
Actual Results:
(see above)

Expected Results:
The page should have moved at the same pace it moved in Firefox 2 or without Genius NetScroll+ Optical Mouse driver running.

An obvious workaround is unloading Genius NetScroll+ Optical Mouse driver when Firefox 3 is running. However, driver's advantage (e.g. ablitily to use Button4+Wheel analogous to Alt+Tab/Shift+Alt+Tab to switch between applications, and Button5+Wheel to change font size, and convenient mousewheeling the mouseovered area instead of focused) make it hard to live without the driver.

In addition to the above reported facts, I suspect that new Cairo engine somehow report lesser line-height to the mouse driver (mouse driver's setting make me guess that the amoult of scrolling is proportional to the line-height).
