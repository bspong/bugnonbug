Dataloss: Drag to window (tab detach) interferes with session save

Firefox 4.x ha a feature to drag tab outside the browser window to open them in new tabs. So far a I understand, this feature cannot be disabled.

This feature creates a dataloss situation if the user accidentally or intentionally drag a tab outside the window then close the browser. The user ha then lost all the tab in that window: there doe not exist a function to reopen a closed window, and trying to reopen Firefox result in a error that the profile is already in use.

Often using the History to refind the tab is not a viable workaround: the History may be cleared, and some tab may be very old and very buried in the History. Some site do not use informative page titles, further hampering effort to find the correct tab in the History.

Possible solution to the issue:
1) Offer a feature to disable tab drag-to-window. I believe that there exists an open feature request on this.
2) Offer a feature to reopen a closed Window.
3) Store multiple session in the event that multiple browser window have been opened.
4) Store the tab of all closed browser window in a single session.
5) Any other solution that devs or user post here. What is your idea?

My preference go to implementing both solution (1) and (4).

Reproducible: Always
