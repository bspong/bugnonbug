This problem a couple month ago when I upgraded to the latest version of FireFox then (possibly version 3.5.5 on 12/4/2009. I now run version 3.6.3. It only occurs on Amazon's website, all pages. I made a screenprint today to document what I see. I can email it to you, if you want it. I do not have any similar problem with Amazon ste on Safari, Opera, Chrome, or IE8. I like your browser, and have used it daily for a couple years. Accordingly, I have made donation annually to support your work. Keep up the good work & thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.amazon.com
2. the very first page and all subsequent will be displayed so small that it's difficult to read
3.
Actual Results:
the screen display is shrunk significantly. I can email you a screenprint of today's occurrence. I have given up using FireFox on this site, and generally use either Chrome or IE8.


It should disply Amazon.com like it doe any other site I go to. This is the only site where it occurs.
