(mostly copied from the list)

With many (20+) tab displayed (not just loaded), scrolling through tab is visibly slower than FF2.

The main culprit seems to be the smooth scrolling in the tabs; disabling toolkit.scrollbox.smoothScroll make it a lot faster (though still slower than FF2).

The rest of the time seems to be spent in gURLBar.value = value under browser.js onLocationChange's URLBarSetURI call. Commenting out this call (in addition to having smooth scrolling off) make tab switching look a fast a FF2. I didn't dig down into further than that (to see if it's some event listener that's taking time or something). This take 60-80ms.

I'm not sure this is all; it still doesn't seem a quick a FF2. This should be compared le subjectively, but I'm not sure where to do that.

For perspective, this is a visible performance drop, but not a catastrophic one: quickly scrolling the mouse wheel 6 stop in FF2 (with TMP) move down 6 tabs; in FF3 it's slow enough that it miss some, and only move 2-3. (I navigate like this a lot, so this is very noticable.)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Set browser.tabs.tabMinWidth to a low value, load many tabs, and hold ctrl-pgdn. (My actual case is vertical tab with TabMixPlus, scrolling with the mouse wheel.) It's slower and much le responsive than FF2.

Note that to reproduce the URL bar part of this, consecutive tab must have different URLs, or the gURLBar.value = value call seems to short circuit.
