Icon move when activating toolbar button that show panel
There are two kind of "buttons" which can be placed on the toolbar: those who just execute one action ("open new window") and those who show a menu. I am talking about the second kind here. This is true for the current Linux nighlty build, I am not sure if other platform have similar problems.

Currently there seem to be four (!) way a "button which show a menu" can work:

1.) the menu open on mouse-release, icon change position a few pixel to bottom/right. This can be seen here:
- Encoding
- History
- Web developer tool
- Downloads

2.) the menu open on mouse-press, the icon change position a few pixel to bottom/right. Does not support activation of item by press-drag-release. This can be seen here:
- Customize and control


3.) the menu open on mouse-press, icon doe never change position but menu change postion a few pixel to the right after moving the mouse pointer to the menu. Does support activation of item by press-drag-release. This can be seen here:
- Bookmarks

4.) the menu open on long-press, icon change postion but only when moving mouse away from the button while keeping the mouse button down. This can be seen here:
- Back
- Forward

IMHO 1-3 menu should
a) already open on mouse-press
b) support press-drag-release to activate contained item
c) not move the icon around

Case 4 is special, it work fine but the icon should not change position.
