When I try to Post in Forums I always get 404 error (Page Can not be found)
I also get "Your browser sent a request that this server could not understand"

Some websites, when I am asked to click button like Submit, proceed, Continue, and sometimes search, I get the 404 error and when searching I get "Bad Request (Invalid Verb)

I have these problem with IE, Bon Echo, and FireFox. Thats the only browser i use.

This seems to be the only website I can post at.
