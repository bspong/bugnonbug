Firefox 3.x.x crash while navigating a specific site.

A few week back, I downloaded Firefox 3.x (I'm sorry I don't exactly remember which version) on a Intel CoreDuo iMac. While trying to do some transaction on my bank website www.bancanet.com, which belongs to Banamex, one of the biggest bank in Mexico, it crashed repeatedly, so I went back to Firefox 2. Now I tried again with Firefox 3.0.5 on a PC, and the browser still crash while navigating that site.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into a bancanet.com account.
2.At first, it work fine, but when trying to actually make a transaction, the browser crashes.
3.When starting Firefox again, it restored the site, but only one of the frames. When trying to navigate the site, it crashed again.
Actual Results:
I understand it won't be easy to check this out, other than accesing the site using an account. Obviously I can't share my bank account access information. Perhaps you could try to contact the bank's site development team to report on these crashes.

Expected Results:
I don't mind keep using Firefox 2. My only concern is if something should happen and could't be able to keep using Firefox on a Mac, because Firefox is the only browser with which I can access my bank account in a Mac. On PC, the site work fine with Firefox 2 and Internet Explorer. However, I prefer Firefox. I'm not sure about the severity of the problem, but considering that in happens when working on financial transactions, I find it rather sensitive.
