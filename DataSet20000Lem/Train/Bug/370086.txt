At the TD Ameritrade site one of the tool to available for use is the Streamer Console from which you have the ability to launch several application the two that I have noticed a problem with is Streamer and Level II quotes. When I have these two application open and the Firefox browser I have a problem with the Streamer Application. There is a drop down that allows you to select several list you have created in one of the other web page of the site. As soon a you make the selection in the drop down both the Level II and the Streamer application get minimized and sent to the dock. This render the application useless. You can maximize them again but a soon a you make the selection in the Drop Down in the Streamer Application the same thing happens again (both application get minimized and docked).

In Safari when you make selection in the Streamer Application with the Level II Quotes open it allows you to select the list of stock you wish to see in Streamer and doe not minimize the application and dock them.

As and additional thought I really like Firefox it is simple, clean and easy to use! This problem however prohibits me and any other user who ha an account on the TD Ameritrade site from using due to the fact that The streamer counsel is where we do our trading. Please let me know what you think, Thanks.
