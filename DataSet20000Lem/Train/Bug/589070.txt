There is a strange UI glitch that happens after deleting item from a bookmark folder using the right-click menu.

The only way I have found to make the glitch go away and the (Empty) text to appear a it should, is to restart Firefox.

I have only tested this on my home machine, which is using Windows7 x64, so I cannot confirm or deny that this will happen on other platform yet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the organize bookmark menu using ctrl+shift+B and add a new folder to the bookmark menu.
2. After the folder ha been created, bookmark two different web page and store them inside the newly created folder.
3. Open the bookmark menu in the top toolbar (by clicking on Bookmarks or using Alt+b) then mouse over the folder and delete the item in the folder one at a time using the mouse right-click menu.
4. After deleting the last item, you will see the popup window that used to be displaying the item have some weird text over it. This text is whatever part of the right-click menu wa over the popup last.
5. Mouse away from the folder then back over it and you will see a tiny box appear instead of the usual popup that should be displaying (Empty) since there are no more item in the folder.
Actual Results:
The opened popup window got messed up showing what used to be on top of it in the right-click menu. Then after moving away and mousing over the same folder again, the popup show up a a tiny box that you can barely see.

Expected Results:
After deleting the item it is supposed to display a single line that say (Empty)
