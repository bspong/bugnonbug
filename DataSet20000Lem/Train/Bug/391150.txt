expose an API for getting an nsIHandlerInfo object for a protocol
The external helper app service ha a method, GetProtocolHandlerInfo, for retrieving an nsIHandlerInfo object for a protocol, but it's not exposed to frontend code via any API.

Exposure would be useful, since code in the Download Actions dialog (which I'm modifying over in bug 377784) would benefit from being able to retrieve nsIHandlerInfo object for protocol via an API rather than directly from the datasource.

dmose: GetProtocolHandlerInfo say "XXX before we expose this to the UI, we need sort out our strategy re the "warning" and "exposed" prefs"
<myk> dmose: do you know what the issue are there?
<dmose> myk: i just wanted to make sure we didn't break existing semantics
<dmose> myk: i talked to beltzner, and he said he wanted to break the warning semantics
<dmose> and that we'd go ahead and do that now and discus more during security review
<dmose> a far a i know, we haven't broken the "exposed" semantics or the forbidden semantics
<dmose> some automated test in that area would be a fine thing
<myk> dmose: so you're comfortable with me exposing that method to the UI?
<dmose> i think so, yes. maybe paste the stuff i said above into the bug, and add qa-wanted
