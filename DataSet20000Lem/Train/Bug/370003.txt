When clicking E-mail link on web pages, window come up saying: Firefox doesn't know how to open this address, because the protocol (mailto) isn't associated with any program.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061204 Firefox/2.0.0.1

This failure to accomplish sending article to friend by the E-mail link on the article page fails on all. An example:

• Blog This
• E-mail This link will not open to anything except what you can see below.
• Print
• Digg
• del.icio.us
• Sphere

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.The address in the above URL box is one example.
2.Save it to the address bar of Firefox and tap ENTER key.
3.Hope you see the window that say what I entered in the Summary box above.
Actual Results:
Just get the Firefox window that it doesn't know, etc. a stated in the Summary box above.

Expected Results:
Should have brought up a page to enter E-mail address of people the article should be forwarded to by the presenter of the article, ZDNet.

It doe not crash, it just doe not do what it is supposed to do, maybe like Firefox got lost and can't find a way to open the URL that cause a forward to be accomplished about the desired article. I have to copy and paste the article to a WORD DOCUMENT and attach it to an addressed E-mail instead of using the forward feature on the web page.
