Applications prefpane is broken if shell service isn't available at runtime (Applications preference dialogue is empty, no way to add applications)

Click Edit->Preferences->Applications and the application dialogue open up, but it is completely empty. There is no apparent way to populate it.

I have confirmed that this is the case whether or not I'm using an existing profile and have also run Firefox in debug mode to see if there were any useful message when I open the dialogue, but there weren't.

mimetypes.rdf IS populated and (at least from an empty profile) I can add new handler by choosing them when I click, for instance, a mailto: link.

This wa also the case with Beta 1, but I've only just realised it wa an issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Edit
2. Click Preferences
3. Click Applications
Actual Results:
Empty dialogue box with no way to add anything

Expected Results:
I would expect to see the registered applications, with the option of changing them or adding new ones.
