The right click "open link in new tab" option is not working. The result of the request is to open a new tab but it load the current page you are viewing and not the link you have selected. If you select the open link in new window option everything work a you would expect. In addition I have noticed that since updated tab preference to v1.2.8.7 if I select or type in an address from the address bar this overwrites the content of the current tab and doe not create a new one however the open link in new tab issue ha been occuring prior to the extention update.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Right click on any link
2. Select open link in new tab
or
1. Enter URL into address bar
2. Press enter
or
1. Select address in address bar

Actual Results:
For first problem:
A new tab is opened but the host page content is loaded and not the link selected
The second:
Current tab is overwritten with URL
The third
Current tab is overwritten with selected URL

Expected Results:
First
New tab opened and with content of the link selected is loaded
Second
New tab opened with content from URL loaded
Thrid
New tab opened with content from URL loaded

I have tried to change all setting within the tab browsing option to open in window and not tabs, restarted firefox then changed setting back to tab and not window restrated again but still no affect.

I wa experiencing the right click open new tab issue for a while but the address bar issue ha only been apparent since I updated the extention to v1.2.8.7
