On 75% or more of occasions, if I visit a live bookmark item from www.tmz.com from the toolbar - I then find that any of the live bookmark menu dont actually show any list. That is, while the page is open, if I click on any of the other live bookmark word menu (including the TMZ one), it just show a thin outline of where the normal drop down box would appear.

The tmz live bookmark wa created by clicking the RSS icon from the main www.tmz.com website.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.tmz.com, and create a live bookmark from the main page RSS.
2. Click an item from the tmz live bookmark menu. Wait for the page to load completely.
3. Go back and click any of the live bookmark word menu on the toolbar (i.e. "www.tmz.com", or any of the others, and the normal drop down window is now empty (only a thin outline shows).
Actual Results:
As expected, after visiting an item from the tmz live bookmark menu toolbar item, only the outline for any of the live bookmark drop down window showed - without the usual link to r item or any background colour etc.

Expected Results:
It should have showed the normal item from each of the live bookmark drop down menus, with proper window background.
