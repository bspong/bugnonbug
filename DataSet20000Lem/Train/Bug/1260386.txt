Global search in source fails with two TypeErrors
Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to www.idnes.cz (Czech news site)
2. Open debugger, and start global search, i.e., type "!something" into the searchbox.

Expected result:
The global search show some results.

Actual result:
No search result are shown, and after a while, two unhandled promise rejection are reported in the browser console:

Full Message: TypeError: is not iterable
Full Stack: onError@resource://gre/modules/commonjs/toolkit/loader.js -> resource://devtools/client/debugger/content/actions/sources.js:254:1

Full Message: TypeError: text is undefined
Full Stack: GlobalSearchView.prototype<._doSearch@chrome://devtools/content/debugger/views/global-search-view.js:160:11

What happens?

The page load a document with inline script from a misbehaving URL: http://bbnaut.ibillboard.com/g/ca2
This URL sometimes reset the connection, sometimes return 304 status code... the result is that loading the source from debugger throw a NS_BASE_STREAM_CLOSED, and that error is not handled correctly by the debugger code.

The issue can be reproduced only when the idnes.cz page is loaded for the first time. On repeated visits, cooky are set and different resource are loaded. I open a private window when I want to reproduce the bug.

I tried to create a minimal test case (nodejs script that serf minimal set of requests), but then I discovered bug 1259743 and had to give up. I'll try again when creating a test.
