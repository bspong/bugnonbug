In Firefox 36.0.01 on Mac OS X Version 10.9.5, when a playing <video> element with .mp4 source is removed from the page with javascript, the audio continues to play.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0

Steps to reproduce:

I put a video on an html page. Sample markup:
<div class='wrapper'>
<video id="movie" poster="poster.jpg" width="640" height="480" control >
<source src="mymovie.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2&quot;">
</video>
</div>
On page load under certain user agent circumstances, I used javascript to empty the wrapper div and replace with other content. Though it is not set to autoplay, the video can be heard even though it ha been removed from the DOM, and the replacement content is visible.


Actual results:

The audio from the video that wa removed with javascript can still be heard playing. Using Firebug, I could verify that the video element wa gone from the html. I could delete all node on the page, yet the audio would continue until the tab wa closed.


Expected results:

The video should never have played. Even if playing, if the video element is removed dynamically, the video and it audio should cease, a it doe in Safari and Chrome.
