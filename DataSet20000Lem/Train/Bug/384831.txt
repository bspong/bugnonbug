Another person in the Builds forum is having the same issue with the PM.
They are using an Athlon CPU a I am, running Vista. Others in the forum are reporting the PM work for them, so it may be a hardware/OS/CPU problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use any build after 2007-06-12 Hour 6
2. Profile Manager will not display dialog box, only leaf a Ghost running
consuming approx 13 meg RAM.
3. Kill the Process with the TaskManager
Regular startup of the build seem to run OK, it only issue is with the PM.
Actual Results:
PM will not display the dialog box.

Expected Results:
PM Should start.
