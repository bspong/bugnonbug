Port the comm-central "make package-compare"
Created attachment 428093
Fix v.1

It's not very pretty, since it still doesn't know to expand directory or wildcards, and it still doesn't know about file that you know you don't want to package (particularly ugly for Fx, where pretty much every build ha test enabled and thus build a ton of file you don't want to package, many of them poorly named), but for all that, I know that Thunderbird and SeaMonkey are trying to package contentprefs.xpt when it isn't there anymore and you don't (though you probably could from "possible missing or unnecessary"), and they are packaging widget_cocoa.xpt because they know it's there, and you don't.

The two biggest benefit are when it's added a a build step on tryserver (I review patch to package-manifest.in and patch that add or remove file by pushing them to the MoMo tryserver and looking at the package-compare step on all three platforms), and when someone finally get around to teaching it to ignore thing listed in no-package-manifest.in, so it can turn the tree orange when someone doe anything to add or remove a file without saying what they want done with it, but even just having it exist, so I don't have to remember to copy-modify-paste the command out of mail/installer/Makefile.in when I want to see what's going wrong in Firefox packaging, is worth having, and also might get someone to work on improving it.
