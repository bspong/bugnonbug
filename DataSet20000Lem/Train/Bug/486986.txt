I am running my computer at a resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels. I have a widescreen monitor with the start bar moved to the right hand of the screen.

When the firefox window is set to a shorter width, the double arrow button on the right hand side, which should open a menu of all remaining bookmarks, should appear. It doe this if I only resize slightly. However, when a firefox window is resized to cover le than about 3/4 of the monitor screen width, This button disappears, and I can't access any bookmark that are not already visible on the bookmark toolbar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Mozilla
2. Resize width of window.
3. View the fact that the bug ha occurred.
Actual Results:
The double arrow disappeared. As I continued to minimize it, more bookmark disappeared, and the arrow button did not reappear.

Expected Results:
I would expect the arrow to remain, with the bookmark disappearing from the toolbar and reappearing in the menu that the arrow link to.
