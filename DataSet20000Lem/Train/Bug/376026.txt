I don't know if this is mostly relevant with dynamic webpage but I noticed it with them most often. Normal site seem to work. I see this problem with different sites, so it is not related to a particular forum.

It happens quite frequently, that I type a message in the forum, or click on a link to read a posting, and instead of the page the Save File dialog appears and want to safe the page (index.php). As I said I noticed this most often with dynamic pages, so it's usually index.php that appears, but I have seen this with other site a well, so it might not be directly related to PHP specifically.
It doesn't happen always, but a an estimate I would say in 5 from 10 case it doesn't work. Other people on one of these forums, also had this problem, so I decided to file a bug report. Before they mentioned it, I thought my networkconnection might have a problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I'm using most often this site http://modetwo.net/darkmod/ but it also happens on other sites.
2. Click on the forum and try to read some posting
3.
Actual Results:
Sometimes the Save File dialog pop up.

Expected Results:
Expected the page to be displayed instead. :)
