Remove green lock with grey triangle when Mixed Active Content is Blocked
Telemetry data show that the very few user are "disabling protection" on page where we have blocked mixed active content.

Here are percentage of page that went through a "disable protection" action (unblock mixed content) out of all page loads.
Release 45: 0.0007%
Beta 46: 0.001%
Aurora 47: 0.0009%
Nightly 48: 0.00077%

Note that these number are for all page loads, not HTTPS page loads. To be conservative, we could assume that 25% of page are HTTPS (when really it is closer to 44) and multiply the above number by 4. Even then we are talking about 0.004% of HTTPS page loads. Hence, with the current heuristics, we should be able to remove the icon decoration without much trouble.

The disable protection button will still remain in control center. Nothing from the control center will change. The only change is that the url bar will show a green lock instead of a green lock with a grey triangle.

For fxprivacy team triage, I think this should be a P3. It reduces user confusion by eliminating a url bar state and is pretty easy to implement.

I believe all you need to do is change the image here:
