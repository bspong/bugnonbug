Installer quickly and silently crash on Windows NT 4.0 without version 5.80 or newer of Comctl32.dll
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: FireFox 1.0+ en-US win32 installer

The EXE-installer unexpectedly crashes/terminates on an old box with Windows
NT 4.0 following way:
1. It open "Extracting" progress dialog, run silently for a while, then it
extract (an installation) quite quickly.
2. It open an info dialog "Initilizing Setup..." for short and close it.
3. It open an info dialog "Verifying integrity of archives..." for short and
close it.
4. Nothing more appears and the process terminates.

I repeated the procedure (getting the same result) with:
a) FireFox 1.0 Czech language [official download]
b) FireFox 1.0 (US) English language [official download]
c) FireFox 1.0 (US) English language [nightly build from 28-Dec-2004]


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download an installer.
2. Run the installer.
3.

Actual Results:
Installer silently dies.

Expected Results:
Go on with installing or at least report something.

I suspect an incompatibility with an obsolete CPU or something alike. I do not
know how to force the installer to produce a log-file or a similar report, so
I cannot provide more detail at the moment.

See an attached report from "Windows Diagnostics" for detail about the
hardware configuration.
