Steps to reproduce:

Right after start, Firefox us between 300 and 500 MB of memory.
After a while (a few hours, a couple of day at most), memory usage jump to the 2-4 GB range.
Firefox then start being slower and slower, and pause every now and then (as I'm typing this, it's a 2 second freeze every 5 seconds).
I've seen memory usage ramping up to 6-8 GB (that wa 6 GB RSS and 8 GB VIRT a given by top/ps) but I generally restart Firefox before that point because it's then unusable.
This is with ~10 tab open (around 20 to the max).
I've noticed this issue with all the version of Firefox I tried since FF3.
My setup is a 64 bit Debian GNU/Linux.
I tried with Debian packages, Ubuntu packages, and Mozilla binary (the latter in 32 bit mode), and saw no difference.

I attached the output of about:memory.

The only exotic setting I have is a 999 day history.
(Yup, that's a lot, but that worked out pretty well with Netscape 4 on a 486 with 8 MB RAM, so I hope I can still use it on a quad core i7 with 8 GB :-))
