firefox is still running in background and need to be closeded to open a new process
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/530.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/2.0.172.28 Safari/530.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.0.10

Firefox fails to load a new url, and will sit there for minute until I hit escape to close that request. Hitting the 'Go Back' arrow produce the same result of sitting there with the 'loading circle' going round and round.

Closing all open version of Firefox and reopening a new Firefox window result in an error message 'Firefox is currently running and need to close before opening.'

I can find firefox in Windows Task Manager processes, but cannot kill the process. Cannot kill with Sysinternals Process Explorer either.

There maybe an IO awaiting closure, but I have not yet found one. The only solution are to use another browser or restart or shut down the system.

This situation doe not appear to have a pattern. I can have many duplicate of Firefox open or just one. I can have Skype running or not. I can have the gmail account open or not.

This can happen 2 or 3 time per day.

I have noticed that if I download a large file from many level within a site, that after the download finishes, 90% of the time the above situation occurs and I have to reboot.

I cannot deliberately reduplicate the problem.
