When I open http://www.blisty.cz in new window, it frequently happens to me,
that when I middle click a link, the page scroll instead of opening a new tab.
The usual sequance of action I think the browser take in such situation (just
my guess) is, that it first creates tab row, scroll (or rather jumps) the
current page a little to reflect new dimension of visible area, then open new
tab and load it content in the background.
But sometimes it change the order of the action so it first scroll the page,
but because there is no link under the cursor after this scroll, it doe nothing
else.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new window and load the page (there should be no tab row)
2. Middle click on a link.
3.

Actual Results:
The page scrolls.

Expected Results:
The tab row should appear with new tab.

The issue can perhaps be related to autoscrolling or find-as-you-type feature
(I have them turned on). The page opened by middle click are loaded in
background. The tab row is not visible in the case there is only one page loaded.
