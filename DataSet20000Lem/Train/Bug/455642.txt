Firefox 3.0.1 constantly loses connection, while other browser continue to work. Firefox.exe will not unload from memory.
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506)

I am re-using someone's bug report for version 2.0. Almost identical situation.
While casually browsing pages, suddenly all browser activity stop completely.
Firefox act a if it ha lost the network connection. It happens to me every 20-40 minute when using the browser. After the connnection is lost, the interface is still usable, but it is not able to make any new network
connection. Cannot load new webpage or access the Internet in any way. It is like the network wa down, except it ha not -- Internet Explorer continues to work fine.

After I close all instance of Firefox, firefox.exe remains in Task Manager processes. The process cannot be killed manually, and I must restart the computer in order for Firefox to access the Internet. IE continues to work throughout.

At no time doe Firefox report a problem with the connection. I have tried unloading my Zone Alarm firewall from memory but that doesn't help. Windows firewall is disabled.
