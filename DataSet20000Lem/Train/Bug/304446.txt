Two graphic on this page are blackened (treeevil.jpg & treelove.jpg). All
have graphic been given .jpe extension I did not intend. The graphic appear
to load correctly, but then quickly blacken. The graphic can be seen when it is
enlarged. It can be downloaded if I remove the .jpe extension. I do not
understand where the .jpe extension come from or what it means. The problem
do not appear in MS IE. This condition mean that visitor using Firefox are
not able to see my graphic so affected.
