Repeated error: sircumstances exact copy of TB35007213Y but Talkback coul'd not send.

Now, at the 20th character i entered in a textfield at a forum a complete crash.
about four tab open. In the second hour after boot.
The last day i spend up to 14 hour at the same forum without major problems.
No Talkback report, although Talkback wa there i think, also NU 2000 crashguard came up, but the crash wa to severe, and i did my very best to recover the report(s), but no luck.
The textfield wa open for about ten second when this happend, about the same time a the first time this happend, on 16-08 where i HAD a Talkback report:
TB35007213Y
So this from today is a copy of the crash from that report, but this time the system failed to recover.

Note: i am not 100% sure, but i even much think that the Norton Crashguard spoke of a crash of Talkback.EXE. My screen wa very corrupted, so i wa distracted.
