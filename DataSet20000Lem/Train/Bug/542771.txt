The Lan Administrator ha blocked Facebook in my office. Don't care about Facebook, but the problem is that with Firefox I cannot access site that contain a Facebook widget such a "This site a xxx fan on Facebook" or "Share on Facebook" or "Login with Facebook ID", etc. etc.
The site start loading, but when it get to the widget it go to an "Access Denied" page. This doe not occur using IE7+.
I always want to use Firefox, and I don't want to have to use IE for some sites.

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:
The software should not load the widget or load it partially. The important thing is that the page is viewable.

This thing happens also on a specific site I visit: http://www.tvsquad.com/.
It's probably related to the ads. It load it a if it is another page. Check it out yourselfs.

Problem started with Firefox 3.0 and it's still going on with the 3.6 version.
