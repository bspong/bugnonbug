[ur] Search engine setup for Firefox for Urdu
We want to ship Firefox with a good list of search engine for Urdu.

We'll do this in three phases: First, the localization team and flod (Francesco Lodolo) will look at the market for the language and come up with a good set of search providers. Mohammad, we'll need your input on this. The guideline for making recommendation are found on <https://wiki.mozilla.org/L10n:Firefox/Productization>.

We currently use this set for en-US, to which we can fall back in the case of lacking localized alternatives:
Google, Yahoo!, Bing, Amazon, Twitter, Wikipedia

After we decided on a particular search engine, flod will contact the owner and ask for permission and for specifics, like proper search flags. Mohammad, we'll likely need your help to at least get the owner's contact information.

Once we have a specification on what the search engine for Urdu should look like, flod and the localization team will work on an implementation on that. flod will create and attach patch for the desired change and get them reviewed. After a successful review, flod will land them. Mohammad, if you're interested, you could create the patches, too. You'd ask flod for review on those before landing.

Please don't commit any modification in browser/searchplugins to the hg repository without a patch reviewed by flod, Stas, Axel or someone else appointed by flod. The data here is sensitive to user and our search partners, thus requiring extra care here.

The Urdu team and flod will be driving this bug to completion.
