Customizing nav-bar work OK for current window, but default nav-bar content is used when opening another window or at next start-up.

My user's localstore.rdf shows:
..
<RDF:Description RDF:about="chrome://browser/content/browser.xul#nav-bar"
iconsize="large"
currentset="new-tab-button,unified-back-forward-button,back-button,forward-button,reload-button,stop-button,urlbar-container" />
..

The currentset line show my customized bar item but it's even persistent over restart, but it seems simply ignored when creating the nav-bar of any new window.
