Changing CSS of chrome in DOM inspector crash browser

When using DOM inspector on a chrome URL to change styles, the rule often
disappears and the browser subsequently crashes. This happens when changing the
style of just about any object.

The crash problem did not happen in FireFox 0.9.3. I also tested this in Mozilla
1.7 (using navigator.xul) and, although the rule disappeared, the browser never
crashed and the rule seemed to be applied most of the time (which is why I
didn't put this under the "Browser" product).

I thought about marking this critical, since it crash the browser. However, I
can't tell if the problem is caused by a faulty DOM Inspector, or a bug in
FireFox that just happens to be triggered by DOM Inspector. In the past, the DOM
inspector ha been invaluable at finding where to make style change on the fly.
This is not possible anymore.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open DOM Inspector
2. Choose chrome://browser/content/browser.xul and click Inspect
3. Find the node "toolbarbutton" with and id of "back-button". (Should be in
#document->window->toolbox->toolbar->toolbarbutton)
4. On the upper-right, select "CSS Style Rules"
5. Selct the rule ".toolbarbutton-1"
6. Right-click on the "min-width" property in the lower right and choose edit
7. Set min-width to 1px
8. Click OK
9. Entire rule disappears -- this shouldn't happen, but is more a DOM inspector
problem and should be filed a a separate bug.
10. Now close the DOM inspector and go to the main window and hover the mouse
over the back (<) button.
11. Browser crash
Actual Results:
Rule not applied right and browser crash

Expected Results:
Rule applied and browser doe not crash

Usually get an exception accessing referenced memory at 00000000 or 00000001 and
the talkback program starts. I have sent a few report in.
