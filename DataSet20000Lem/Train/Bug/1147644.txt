Youtube title and youtube center don't work.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0

Steps to reproduce:

Go on the latest nightly build and go onto youtube. Get youtube center, and then watch it not work. Unless e10s mode is disabled, both of these thing happen. I don't know if you guy are in contact with yeppha, but please take step to make youtube center compatible with nightly. Also, when I bookmark thing in e10s mode, I have to manually enter the title or open a new window in non-e10s mode.


Actual results:

Most youtube pages, bizarrely excluding actual video pages, straight up stop displaying their titles, which mean in the taskbar I just have a bunch of window open that say "Nightly" and nothing else and the tab title is just the web address. Youtube center just doesn't work unless I'm in a non-e10s window. Also, bookmark don't automatically enter their own titles, making it so I have to open my window in non-e10s to get them to bookmark with proper title or manually enter each title.


Expected results:

Youtube page should have titles, bookmark should automatically enter title when added, and youtube center should work. And this all doe work, provided I'm not in e10s mode. But when I'm not in that mode, I get CPU spike and memory fluctuation. This build is so close to perfect. It's almost there. Just fix these 3 things.
