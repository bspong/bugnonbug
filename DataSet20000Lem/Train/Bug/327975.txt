Cannot clear history, or create or edit bookmarks.

I cannot clear my history, after clicking on "go." All my bookmark also disappeared overnight. I cannot bookmark ANYTHING now, so cannot replace bookmark -- despite re-installing Firefox/1.5.0.1 today.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Left-click "go." Right-click on history for today, yesterday, two day ago. Right-click "delete." Nothing happens.
2. Try to bookmark something. Nothing happens
3. All bookmark have disappeared. (I have done two anti-virus check and used my five anti-spyware program twice, each. I have no virus or spyware problems.)



Actual Results:
My history remained for the last three days. They would not erase.
My bookmark box remains empty; it will not accept a bookmarked address.

Expected Results:
I expected the history to disappear. I expected to be able to bookmark address -- moreover, I expected to HAVE all my bookmarked address intact. I have none.

The software should have allowed me to erase all histories. It should not have erased my bookmarked addresses. It should allow me to bookmark new addresses.
