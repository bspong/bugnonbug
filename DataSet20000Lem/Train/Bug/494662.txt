On certain websites, head font glyph render a meaningless garbage character while body font glyph render normally. On affected sites, this bug is 100% reproducible. It affect both the 3.5 (1.9.1) and 3.6 (1.9.2) forks, but only under Windows. I have used the 3.6 nightlies (though not 3.5) a well a the latest public 3.0 release under Kubuntu Linux, and this problem ha not occurred. Affected website render normally in both the 3.5 and 3.6 nightlies when using the IE Tab extension, a well a in Google Chrome 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the IE Tab extension if it is not already installed.
2. Open WorldNetDaily.com in either of the FF nightlies (3.5 "Shiretoko" or 3.6 "Minefield") using Gecko.
3. Observe the font glyphs.
4. Click the IE Tab icon in the status bar to change rendering engines.
5. Observe the font glyph again.
Actual Results:
Using Gecko, the head font glyph are rendered incorrectly --- all of them in 3.5; larger size only in 3.6 (as per the accompanying screenshots). Using IE Tab or viewing the page in Google Chrome, all font glyph display properly.

Expected Results:
All font glyph should display properly.

Reducing the font size several step (Control-Minus) cause the font to render normally, but far too small. Particularly in the 3.5 nightlies, it is necessary to reduce the font size to such a degree that the page becomes completely unreadable. In the case of the 3.6 nightlies, le reduction is necessary --- typically 3 steps.
