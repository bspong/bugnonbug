In trying to send an "email" [sic] to the usps.com website, I wa taken to a webform at the above URL. Not only wa the site unrecognized, but the cert wa Invalid. The problem is that I am unable to ascertain *why* the certificate is invalid -- or more specifically, Firefox doesn't know why it can't accept the certificate -- Firefox is simply rejecting the cert for unknown reasons. This is worrisome to say the least. Are all of my cert bad is there a corruption in them that's enabling "bad things"...Don't know...
Under the "General" tab, the error say (and I can't Copy/Paste it, because that's also broken on this tab).
"Could not verify this certificate for unknown reasons."
Say what? Uh...It sais it wa issued by Verisign -- and it is for the website I appear to be connecting to (hdusps.esecurecare.net), and it it's valid from dec-2007 to dec-2009, so...I have no clue...(and obviously neither doe Firefox). But I'm certainly not going to accept it -- since I've no clue what is wrong with it.
Since I can't save the cert to disk, unless I want to select each of the 20 field and copy the name and data, separately -- and paste it somewhere -- that would be "40" cut&paste operation to include the cert in an error report, email or to save it in a file. Not an option for someone with repetitive stress sensitivities. :-/
