After entering Master Password, popup asks for GMail password but doe not use
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.5) Gecko/2008120122 Firefox/3.0.5

I have a master password and use GMail, though GMail is rarely used and almost never then on reopen. Yet every time I start up Firefox 3.0.5, I enter my master password and get the GMail password request, with option to save in my password list. Even if I tell it to save the password, it doe not.

SECOND PART OF BUG REPORT:

Then, it frequently crash immediately and I have to start Firefox again, sometimes multiple time.

Though I have a number of extension loaded, I do not have Better GMail or any of the other GMail-specific add-on in my system.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start my coinfiguration of Firefox with a master password and stored password for GMail
2. Enter Master Password
3. Either cancel on request popup for GMail password, or supply it

Actual Results:
Either way it frequently crashes, but it still leaf an active process that must be killed with Windows Task Manager

Expected Results:
1. I do not expect to see GMail password request unless I'm restoring a Firefox session in which GMail wa in an active tab
2. I expect Firefox to start up and not crash

After crash, it should kill the running process automatically, or else when Firefox is starting and it detects a running Firefox process, it should either kell it automatically or ask for User to authorize shutting it down.
