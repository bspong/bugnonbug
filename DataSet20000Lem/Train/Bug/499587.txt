Hello, there!

I experience a odd behaviour when trying to close a tab/window with the osx based keyboard command APPLE+W. The window is emptied from it content, but stick open, now blank and a single tab is always visible - which is againt the preference I chose (no tab bar when only one tab/window is open).

Let´s say, I have a browser window with lot of tabs. As intended, APPLE+W close each and every tab but the last, wherer this behaviour again show up.

When I use the mouse and press the red OSX close button on the upper left window edge, it just close a expected.

This happened on Firefox 3.5 RC1 and RC2. Using Firefox 3.0.11 or older did not show this disturbance.

I am running OSX 10.5.7 natively on Intel Mac Pro.

I hope I can help.

Best wishes,
B.
