When trying to download the DL manager window appears and FireFox hang for several seconds. It is unusable while it hangs. Happens with FF 3.5.6 in Win 7 64 Ultimate while this work flawlessly in XP Pro 32.

The list is empty so it is not an error connect to a huge number of file in the download manager list. But it could be connected or similar to this bug: 508875.
