When there is fixed positioned element on a page it mess coordinate for any html element including flash objects. Active area of flash button are moved outside their visible scope and in some case it is not even possible to click on them.

On the provided URL there is fixed possitioned wall paper with 3 flash application on it. it is hard to click on the flash, which is out of iframe, because active area wa reduced and moved right down. Flash, which is on the top of iframe doe respond only to mouse context menu action. There is also problem with size of horizontal line and other problem can be easily introduced.

I think the problem might relate to the one, which is described in the bug 342096.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.create block element (IMG, DIV) which is fixed positioned via style
2.embed flash app into the page so that is above fixed positioned element
3.embed flash app into iframe and embed it into the page so that it overlap fixed positioned element in the area where is flash
4.try to click on flash
Actual Results:
The flash, which is out of iframe is hard to be controled and the one, which is in, is not possible to control.

Expected Results:
It should be possible fully control flash apps within depicted areas.

IE 6.0 show the page a I expect.
