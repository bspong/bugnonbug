With the Bookmarks toolbar on the top menu level, hovering over a bookmark to see the tooltip, the tooltip along with the bookmark button shadowing, remains when hovering over main top window bar.

This is very similar and most likely connected with the bug 307399, whereby the blue shadowing of menu item stick when moving cursor to top main window bar, found here.

It is also likely to be connected with bug 297080.

All three of these are very bad UI bugs, most not recieving enough attention, and need to be fixed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Hover over a bookmark (with bookmark toolbar on top menu level)

Actual Results:
Tooltip and button shadowing of bookmark remain

Tooltip and button shadowing of bookmark go away when cursor leaf (as with moving the cursor anywhere else in the window).
