There are a couple of issue here.

1. In the Places Organizer window, if you type some text in the search box and click on "All Bookmarks" in the scopebar, but then backspace back to an empty string, the scope will be reset to "Selected Folder", which will be evident in the scopebar a soon a you start typing in the box again.

2. If you hit Ctrl-F, it will focus the search box and should set the scope to "All Bookmarks", a opposed to "Selected Folder" (which is what Ctrl-Shift-F does). Instead, when you start typing you will see "Selected Folder" active in the scopebar. Moreover, the result you get will not be what you expect for "Selected Folder", or even "All Bookmarks". It seems the results, if any, are what you would expect if the scope wa "History".


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Places Organizer (Library) window
2. Click on any folder in the left pane except "All Bookmarks"
3. Hit Ctrl-F to do a "Find in Bookmarks" search (should jump to search box)
4. Type something in the search box you know will match a bookmark not in the currently selected folder
5. Notice the scope is "Selected Folder" (incorrect)
6. Notice the result are not what is expected for "Selected Folder", or "All Bookmarks", but perhaps "History"
7. Click on the "All Bookmarks" scope button
8. Notice you get the appropriate result
9. Backspace over your text and retype it
10. Notice that the scope is now "Selected Folder" (incorrect) and the result are consistent with that
