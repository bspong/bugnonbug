when I search for anything using google search I am redirected to http://searchclick8.com/ and it get stuck there, I put this program on blacklist on my STOPZilla Spam and pop up blocker program and also have McAFee virus protection software installed on my PC.

Another bit of info, when the http://searchclick8.com/ search engine page open the title of the program on the Tab say MFeed Search

Also, Under Tools/Page Info under the security tab I have all aspect of http://searchclick8.com/ blocked yet the page still open when I search for anything using google search.

Note: If I go into Ask.com and search I am not directed to http://searchclick8.com/ so the problem is somehow linked to searching using Google search


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.open google.com
3.search a topic, then select any choice and I am then directed to http://searchclick8.com/
Actual Results:
see above,

Expected Results:
When searching in google search I am always directed to http://searchclick8.com/ no matter what subject I search, if I click on any searh result I am always directed to http://searchclick8.com/

Should open the link displayed on the item list for the topic I searched for, this is not the case!
