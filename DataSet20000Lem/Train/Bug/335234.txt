When having e.g. Firebug open the minimum reported client width in the HTML-page becomes circa 400 pixels, even when the window actually is smaller.

This result in problem giving element a proper width for smaller window size when running plugins which cause this effect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install e.g. Firebug and open it panel.
2. Load the described HTML-file and check the reported client width which update for each resize.

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">
<title>Insert title here</title>
<script type="text/javascript">
function reportSize()
{
var e = document.getElementById( "b" );
e.innerHTML = e.clientWidth;
document.title = e.clientWidth;
}
</script>
</head>
<body onresize="reportSize()">
<div id="b" style="border: 1px dotted black;"></div>
</body>
</html>

Actual Results:
When the window width becomes too small the client width is stuck in a larger value. Also, the right edge of the div in the given example is not visible any more.

Expected Results:
The javascript code should have received a width smaller than the reported when the browser window is a narrow a it can get.

The phenomenon also appears when having many plugins with icon populating the status bar in the lower part of the window. For example, I am running "IE-Tab", "Siteadvisor", "Firebug" and "Foxpose" and when not having the Firebug open the minimum client width becomes smaller than previously, but it cannot be a small a it should when the window is a narrow a it can get.
