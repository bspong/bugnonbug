When I launched three sourceforge download page in separate tab in quick succession, one of the "Save as" dialog wa corrupted. After cancelling the broken "Save as" dailog, letting the other downloads finish and then retrying the download link - the "Save as" dialog wa correctly presented.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open these page in separate tabs:
http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/filezilla_portable
http://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/gimp_portable
http://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable
2. Click the download button on each page in quick succession.
3. Check the "Save as" dialogs.
Actual Results:
Two "Save as" dialog appeared correctly, but the first of the file I clicked to download produced a corrupted "Save as" dialog. (Although I clicked on it first, it may not have been the first to download.) The file type and file location field were blank, and the "Open with" drop down wa located in the wrong place.

Expected Results:
Expected to get a simple "Save as" dialog for an Application, with option to Save and Cancel only.

I'll attach screenshots for a) the "Save as" dialog I actually got and b) the "Save as" dialog I wa expecting.
