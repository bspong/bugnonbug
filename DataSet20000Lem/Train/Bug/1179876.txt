Add link to an "MDN error reference" from console error
The web console emits thousand of error message to web developer everyday. While seasoned web developer understand what is going on, especially beginner need help to understand them. Often the message get copied, put into google, and answered on Stackoverflow.

What we could do is adding a [Learn More] link to error message (like we already do for warnings, see CORS), so that we offer developer a direct way to get to know more about what just happened.

This could also be an icon to reduce the text noise (say a question mark in a circle).

More information is available in this etherpad: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/webconsole-mdn-error-msg and the discussion is happening here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.developer-tools/zUiTSyjIvOs

This bug is about the devtools implementation in the console.

The current [Learn More] function life here: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webconsole/webconsole.js#1693

A link to the error doc could look like his:
https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Errors/JSMSG_BAD_RADIX

where "JSMSG_BAD_RADIX" is an "errorNumber" from https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/js/src/js.msg

I will file a depended bug to get "errorNumber" added to nsIScriptError.
