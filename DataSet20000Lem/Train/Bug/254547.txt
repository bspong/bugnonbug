mouse-freeze Firefox: move bookmark while waiting for login/password-dialog
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; de-DE; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

While waiting for a slow password protected site I decided to rearrange the
bookmark toolbar. When the login/password-dialog came up, I first believed all
input wa blocked.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Reproducibil every time, if you are fast enough or the website is slow enough:

1. Access a site which is password protected and,
2. while waiting for the login/password-dialog to open,
3. move a bookmark inside the bookmark toolbar.
Actual Results:
When the login/password-dialog appears, the login/password-dialog is blocked for
any mouse click, but the keyboard still works.
After using the TAB-key to press OK the moved bookmark is opened.
The bookmark move is correctly undone.

Expected Results:
Accept mouse click and open the password-protected site.

I did not use the installation of Firefox 0.9.3, because the right slider wa
missing and I had an error output below the status bar, after I installed 0.9.3
(English) over 0.9.2 (German/googlebar/optimoz mouse gestures/flash/shockwave).

Since I did not see a commend if it is necessary to uninstall 0.9.2 before, this
might be a bug, too.
