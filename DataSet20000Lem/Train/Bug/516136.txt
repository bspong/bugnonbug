Ok the other night I had to reformat my PC after a virus infected it. It wasn't a complete reformat but a pc recovery. I didn't save my bookmark because I figured they would be in the Firefox folder after I fixed everything else. Well they are there but it bookmark from like month ago. Even then when I try to restore them, they don't show up in the bookmark menu. I keep restoring them from the bookmark organizer but they still aren't showing up. I even tried to import the html files. Is there anyway this can be fixed, and can I find recent bookmark from like the other night? The one that were there before doing a pc recovery? I've looked up answer to this but so far everything ha been unsuccessful. I really hate to have to start over because I had a lot of bookmarks, but if push come to shove I guess I'm going to have to. I've been a loyal firefox user for year and I've never had this problem. Though I have always backed up my bookmark before doing a recovery. So I guess this is partly my fault. Any help though would be greatly appreciated though. Thanks
