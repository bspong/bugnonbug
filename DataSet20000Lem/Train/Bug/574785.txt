Thunderbird (v 3.0.3) email link are inoperative after upgrading to Firefox 3.6.4 yesterday. Clicking on the link, right-mouse "Open Link in Browser" do not start a new tab and open the link in Firefox. I need to copy the link and paste it into the Firefox URL bar.

Links from XChat will open correctly if right-mouse "Open Link in Browser" or "Open URL in Web Browser" are clicked, but clicking on the link itself doe nothing.

I have seen recent forum entry of this same issue on various OS platform and email clients.

I tried Firefox in --safe-mode but the problem is still there.

I followed both notice on setting Firefox a my default email client and internet application. Still have the problem.

I de-installed Firefox and re-intalled via YUM. Still have the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.6.4
2. Open Thunderbird email client
3. click on a hyperlink within an email
Actual Results:
nothing happens

Expected Results:
previous version of Firefox would open a new tab with the content of the email hyperlink.

I have tested this only with Thunderbird and XChat external clients, but I expect it is more widespread than this.
