Probelm 1, intermiten when working in a tab usually the last tab to right, the page will freeze, cpu spikes, I hit reload and sometime this fix the problem.

Also home page issue:

I have 3 tab set open when browser is started. Yahoo, google. neopets.
That work fine, but when I am using one of the tab for example the tab that ha google on it. when I am done searching on that tab and want to bring it back I hit the home button, problem is all three tab either reset, and worse the browser open 3 new tab of the same web pages, I can do this several time and have a huge amount of tab when I am done.

Perhaps you set up the home button to open set # of tab when no tab open. when tab are open and home page button is clicked then only the active tab will go back top it set home page! And put an optin in for that, a well have an option for it to not open all set tab again

thanks
