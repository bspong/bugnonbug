infinite loop in eBay developer API test area
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140716183446

Steps to reproduce:

Windows 7 64-bit, 6-core AMD CPU, 8 GB SRAM, production Firefox 31.0 just upgraded (I no longer have Firefox 30.0 to determine whether this is a new problem; this is the first time I have gone to this particular page on eBay)

1) Login to an eBay developer account (obviously you must have an eBay developer account to repeat this; it is free)
2) Go to "API Test Tool" area (https://developer.ebay.com/DevZone/build-test/test-tool/)
3) Select "Production Environment", "Finding API", "findItemsAdvanced" API call; all other field keep default value
4) Submit the following XML into the "XML Request" box:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<findItemsAdvancedRequest xmlns="http://www.ebay.com/marketplace/search/v1/services">
<keywords>seattle</keywords>
<categoryId>914</categoryId>
<outputSelector>GalleryInfo</outputSelector>
<outputSelector>SellerInfo</outputSelector>
<descriptionSearch>true</descriptionSearch>
<paginationInput>
<pageNumber>1</pageNumber>
<entriesPerPage>100</entriesPerPage>
</paginationInput>
<sortOrder>StartTimeNewest</sortOrder>
</findItemsAdvancedRequest>

(This is a search for the keyword "seattle" in the Postcards category.)

5) Submit the request.


Actual results:

The beginning of the XML returned by the eBay API request wa displayed in another box on the page, but I wa not able to copy it or scroll down. If I clicked on a scroll bar etc. the entire Firefox window would gray out. Watching in Task Manager, I could see that Firefox had apparently gone into an infinite loop, with memory consumption rising and falling by about 90 MB at a time (peak 270 MB, minimum 180 MB, roughly one minute cycle). I waited 15 minute before killing it; Firefox never responded to any clicks.


Expected results:

Internet Explorer allowed me to scroll down and copy the returned XML instantly. I think Firefox could also meet this standard. :-)

For the record, the returned XML text wa about 3600 line long, perhaps 50 character per line average.
