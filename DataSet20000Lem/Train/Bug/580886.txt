After Firfox upgraded two time ago, just recently it upgraded to 3.6.7, but it wa at least one before this one, then I could no longer play on my application game in facebook (Zoo World, Li'l Farmlife, etc..) and I could not view youtube video either. I hate using Internet Explorer, but I have to to play my game and watch videos. I checked out an old bug listed about the same problem it wa sent to a support problem and fixed, but I did uninstall Flashplayer and reinstall it and it still doe not work. And I had tried that before this update too. I even disabled Microsoft .Net a I had just added that to, but it did not change it. Can I have an old version of Firefox, like version 2 it worked then. * And the download box doe not show the downloads anymore, just blank.
