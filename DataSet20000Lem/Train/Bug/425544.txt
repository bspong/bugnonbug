Used USB Overdrive (www.usboverdrive.com) to get the side scroll button on my mouse (Logitech G5 with no other drivers) to work a back/forward. It seems to work unless a text box on the web page ha focus, in that situation it seems to perform a home/end key stroke behaviour. I'm pretty sure it is the proper back/forward command being sent and not just cmd+arrow (which would explain why this happens).

The behaviour is correct in safari where the back/forward mouse button work regardless of what control in the web page ha focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a link so the back command is available.
2. Click a text box on the web page to give it focus.
3. Use the mouse back button.
Actual Results:
Nothing happens. If there is text in the text box then the cursor will move to the beginning.

Expected Results:
Expect the mouse back button to get u back to the first web page we were on.

Workaround is you always have to ensure no text box on the web page ha focus before using the mouse back/forward buttons.
