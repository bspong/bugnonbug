Using the Langdon/Leahy image replacement technique to build a horizontal menu,
I keep running into a rendering error where the image that are replacing the
text don't appear until I switch to another tab and switch back, or hover my
cursor over where the image should be.

For the purpose of this example, I've mirrored a working example of the effect I
am trying to achieve that wa first demonstrated on simplebits.com
)http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2003/09/30/accessible_imagetab_rollovers.html)

To see the working example, browse to http://www.nextdesigns.ca/menu_test.html.
The underlying XHTML is simply a logo and menu, where the menu is a simple list
of link that is styled with CSS and the aforementioned image replacement technique.

To see the failed example, browse to
http://www.nextdesigns.ca/menu_test_fail.html (be sure you clear the cache by
holding shift when you refresh the page). The image won't come up until you
switch to another application or tab and switch back, or hover over the image
with the cursor.

The difference between the two page is the logo <div> in the XHTML ha been
removed from the failed version. This unrelated chunk of XHTML ha to appear
with the menu, or else the image won't load properly.

I remember having difficulty with the PC version of Firefox when i wa fooling
around with this technique, but I no longer have access to one so I can't be sure.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://www.nextdesigns.ca/menu_test_fail.html


Actual Results:
Page popped up, but the menu image did not.

Expected Results:
The image should have successfully replaced the text in the menu
