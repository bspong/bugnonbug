(Continued from bug 582485 comment #38)

If you want to bring up the Back/Forward menu (without right-clicking), you must click and hold. The hold is required in order to differentiate between going Back/Forward immediately and bringing up the menu. Thus, if you want to go back to a specific page, you must click, hold until the menu pop up, drag down/up to the desired history item, and release. The problem is that the hold is unnecessary if you’re going to be pulling down/up this menu. If you click on the Back button and then drag it down, there is no ambiguity: you can only possibly want to see the history menu.

Thus, the proposed solution is to remove the need for holding when pulling up/down the Back/Forward menu and show it the menu immediately.

Fixing this bug will also remove the regression introduced by removing the Back/Forward dropdown (bug 582485): it’s no longer possible to bring up the Back/Forward menu quickly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click down on Back button.
2. Don’t wait!
2. Drag down.
Actual Results:
Nothing.

Expected Results:
Back/Forward menu appears.

The proposed solution is already implemented by Google Chrome.
