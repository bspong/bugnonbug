This is similar to Bug 419345. Upon attempting to open a PDF in the same tab, a new tab, or selecting "bypass PDF download" using the PDF Download add-on, Firefox will hang and whitescreen for 30 second to a minute. It is doing some sort of processing a it's using a close to 100% CPU a it possibly can during this time. After this, the tab you are in (or the newly opened tab in the case of opening a new tab) display a blank page with the URL of the desired PDF. In addition, if Adobe Acrobat wa not already opened, it doe open, displaying a document-less interface.

Right-clicking and saving to my computer bypass this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. (potentially unnecessary?) Download and install PDF Download add-on
2. Click (or right-click) link with PDF
3. Choose "Open PDF" or "Bypass PDF Download" (or select "Open Link in New Tab")
Actual Results:
Firefox hang for about 30 second to a minute and whitescreens. It us a close to 100% CPU a possible during this time. Eventually the relevant window display a blank page with the target URL in the address bar and if Adobe Acrobat wa not already opened, that open with a document-less interface.

Expected Results:
If selecting "Open PDF"- should have attempted to save the PDF locally.
If selecting "Open Link in New Tab"- should have opened a blank tab and attempted to save the PDF locally.
If selecting "Bypass PDF Download"- should have opened the PDF in the same tab.

As I've mentioned, I use PDF Download but I doubt that's the issue a the problem occurred without using that program.
