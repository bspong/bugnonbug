Recently upgraded (passive voice) to Vista...

In all recent version (3.0.10, 3.5 beta 4, 3.6a1), when mouse trail are enabled in Vista (I *think* I had trail enabled in XP without this problem), the mouse pointer get jerky after scrolling the page. If I scroll very slowly (e.g. one "click" at a time with the scroll wheel), the problem doe not occur. If I scroll quickly--with the wheel, or the scrollbar thumb--the mouse response becomes sporadic and "jerky." Re-displaying the page (click on another tab, or reload, etc.) will put the mouse pointer back to a normal responsive state again until the next scroll.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Vista Enterprise
2. Enable mouse trail in Control Panel (seems to happen with any trail length)
3. Render a page in recent Firefox
4. Move the mouse around and see it moving smoothly and responsively
5. Scroll the mouse wheel quickly or drag the scrollbar thumb
6. Move the mouse around again and see it stutter and jerk
7. Move the pointer outside of the Firefox window and see it be responsive normally
Actual Results:
As described

Expected Results:
Mouse pointer should behave normally with or without mouse trail
