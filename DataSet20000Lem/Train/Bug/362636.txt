Reply to group message vanishes when I hit the reply button

In various Yahoo group that I belong to, when I reply to message in either standard mode or the beta reply mode, the text vanishes when I press the <Submit> button. This seems to happen with long replies. This ha not occurred with the reply to an email or digest, which take me into the group and the message, but only when I am logged on and actually looking in the group and the messages.

My work around is to highlight and copy the message, then if it vanishes and my reply is empty, go back and paste the message and try again.

Yahoo know that there is a problem but can't know what the problem is because they have added a warning that the message is empty and the error page asks if I still want to post the message. They would not have done this if it had not become a larger problem.

I have been using the two initialed browser from the two initial company for my group message for the past three day off, alternating with Firefox and have not had the problem with that browser, just Firefox.

This happens approximately 60%-75% of the time.

I listed it a major because this will cause most Yahoo Groups user to change browsers. I do not know if this happens with Google or MSN or other Group bulletin boards.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log on to a Yahoo Group
2. Press Reply to reply to a message and type a reply in. Beta doe not matter. Length may a long reply seem to have the problem or I may usually write longer replies.
3. Press the Submit button

Actual Results:
An error message window pop up saying that the message is blank and do I still want to send it <yes> <no>

Expected Results:
The message to be posted

Somehow Mozilla is clearing out the message text instead of sending it.
