Mimetype output wrong on upload via php($_FILES -file_type) with FF 1.5.0.1

I have restricted uploads to *.pdf,*.zip,*.rar in a simple php upload-function.
With FF 1.5.0.1 (german) i can´t upload pdf + zipfiles because my script check for the correct mimetype. Firefox give wrong mimetypes for zip and pdf !
The result are from the global php var $_FILES['upload']['upload_type'].


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to upload a pdf or zipfile with a simple php upload script
2.Display the content of $_FILES with ' print_r($_FILES); '
3.The output show you under [type] => the mimetype.

Actual Results:
If a pdf is uploadfile, 'application/octetstream' is returned
If upload is a zipfile, FF returned 'application/force-download'.

Expected Results:
Pdf´s should return 'application/pdf'.
Zipfiles should return 'application/x-zip-compressed' or 'application/zip'.

Internet Explorer returns- zip: application/x-zip-compressed, pdf: application/pdf
Opera returns- zip: application/zip, pdf: application/pdf

These are the correct and expected mimetypes.
