Hi outa there,

while programming for ff 1.501 i discovered two bug which are still
present in bon echo alpha 1 so i thought it´s time to tell you something
about it.

The problem occurs when using cs page-break-after or before on a table
which ha tds or th with background color enabled. If you print the
table with color enabled (in this case it´s a telephone list where
every 2. row is background colored gray) the second page of the print
preview and the print and all further page are totally grayed. Here is
a very simple example of the bug: www.riewel.de/ff
Open the page. Enable printing of background color and images. Open the
print preview and step to page two and you´ll see a totally grayed page.

The second bug concerncs F5 reload in the print preview dialog. Open the
print preview dialog. Step to page two and press F5. The dialog will
render a normal HTML site within the preview. The button are getting
funtionless and you can only close the whole window.

If someone need to get into contact for further detail simply add a
jan to the website adress to get my emailadress.

P.S. All bug occured onto a windows-xp sp2 machine.
