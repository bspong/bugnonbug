There are two copy of firefox, both version 3.6.3 in my system, one standard (from the distro) at /usr/lib/firefox and the other at /usr/local/firefox. I'm running with a Slackware 13.1.
When I start one of the program (firefox) and quit it, by giving Contrl-q or whatever other way, the same copy of the program can't start again, BUT THE OTHER CAN. For instance, if I run /usr/lib/firefox/firefox, then I may (after quitting that one) start /usr/local/firefox/firefox, but not the same again! This is funny!

I expect you may fix this. I reverted to 3.5.9, because this work in my system.

BTW, the same also happens with swiftfox 3.6.3, which is another build. My computer is a quad-core AMD Phenom.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start /usr/local/firefox/firefox (or by a symbolic link at /usr/local/bin)

2. Try to start again. Best from a xterm. It return and there is no program running anymore. No window pops-up. It refuse to run again.

3. If you (I discovered this a an accident, because there wa already anothre firefox installed, the same version) start another installation, in my case at /usr/lib/firefox/firefox, it run (and ask you to make this the default browser). The original program don't run twice. After running this other installation, it can't run twice (the same a the other), but the first one may run again.

Actual Results:
Each installtion of the program only run once! If there are multiple directory with the same file (firefox distribution), each one may be run, one after the other.

Expected Results:
I expected only one directory with the program installed would suffice, a always have been.

Firefox 3.5.9 run nice. Something is very broken with the new 3.6.3 release.
As most of the library needed by firefox-bin are self-contained in the installation directory, we can't blame the Slackware Linux, but Firefox itself.
