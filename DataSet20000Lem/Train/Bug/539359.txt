I have some search set up with keywords using "add a keyword for this search" (for example, "w" to search my company's internal wiki). Recently, all the saved keywords I had stopped working. When I look them up in "organize bookmarks", there is no mention of the saved keyword. When I tried to re-create one, I got lot of stack traces, like this one when I try to pick what folder to put the bookmark in (even though all of the option are blank):
ASSERT: Invalid menuitem in the folders-menulist
Stack Trace:
0:BPP__getFolderIdFromMenuList()
1:BPP_onMenuListFolderSelect()
2:oncommand([object XULCommandEvent])

And this one when I click OK:
ASSERT: Invalid menuitem in the folders-menulist
Stack Trace:
0:BPP__getFolderIdFromMenuList()
1:BPP__getInsertionPointDetails()
2:BPP__getCreateItemTransaction()
3:BPP_onDialogAccept()
4:anonymous([object Event])
5:_fireButtonEvent(accept)
6:_doButtonCommand(accept)
7:_handleButtonCommand([object XULCommandEvent])



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pick a site with a keyword you want to set for a search.
2. Try and set it.

Actual Results:
Stack trace (copied from above):

Expected Results:
I should be able to set a keyword for a search. Moreover, my old one should not have been deleted.

I also have a window box running firefox where everything works. I have the same keywords set for the same searches.
