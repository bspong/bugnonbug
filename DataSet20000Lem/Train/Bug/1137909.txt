Implement minimum requirement to allow unblocking of downloads through the downloads UI
Bug 1053890 outline the desired UX for blocked downloads and unblocking of them. Some of the request will require much more work than others. This bug outline the minimum required to satisfy this functionality.

1. Update the richlistitem status line and icon to show that the download ha been blocked and why.
2. Add a context menu item to unblock, leaving the richlistitem showing the now unblocked download a a regular download.
3. Re-use the X button (which normally is used to cancel download) to also be used for "Remove file"

Walk-through of the user experience:
1. User click a link to download a file
2. When the download completes, the remote-lookup tag this a a potentially unsafe download.
3. The user notice that the download ha finished by seeing the normal "download finished" animation
4. The user click on the Downloads button in the toolbar to see the downloads panel.
5. The user see that this is a blocked download.
6a. To remove the download, the user click on the X at the end of the download item. The download is removed from the panel. [END]
6b. To unblock the download, the user right-clicks on the download item and chooses "Unblock download"
7. A dialog appears asking the user to confirm unblocking the dialog.
8a. The user confirms the unblock and the downloads panel now show the download a a regular, safe download. The user can now open the downloaded file by clicking on the download item or using the right-click context menu.
8b. The user cancel the unblock and the download stay "blocked". [END]

Notes for assignee:
- DownloadsCommon::confirmUnblockDownload is already in the tree and implement the confirmation dialog.
- Strings for the status line may already be checked-in and available through DownloadsCommon.strings
- Check the download.hasBlockedData property to see if the download ha been blocked.
- Much of the UI code life in DownloadsViewUI.jsm
- Only "blockedMalware" can be used at this time. The implementation for "blockedPotentiallyUnwanted" and "blockedUncommon" are not complete enough at this time.
