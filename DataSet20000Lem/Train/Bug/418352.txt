With some random extension installed, I poked around when I made an about:URI typo which revealed excess code within the alert dialog. Narrowed down the culprit to the "Toolbar Buttons" extension version 0.4.5.2 by Mike Buckly which when enabled cause invalid about: URIs and valid javascript: to display some extra in the alert dialog. And possibly more.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install and enable the Toolbar Buttons (v 0.4.5.2) extension from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2377 or http://codefisher.org/toolbar_button/
2. Try about:pebkac or any other non-existent about:uri or javascript:alert('ooh! A piece of candy!');
3. Enjoy the XL alert that display the message along with some extra dialog code spilling into the alert itself.
Actual Results:
Displays the alert message along with some extra dialog code spilling into the alert itself.

Expected Results:
Should not be seeing the extra code.

If the extension is disabled, this problem doesn't exist. Although, I haven't tried anything nastier with this so it may be worth trying if applicable. Also, everything else seems to work normally when the extension is enabled.
