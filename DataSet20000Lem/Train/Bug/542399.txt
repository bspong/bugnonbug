With Firefox and Adobe CS3 Illustrator (or InDesign) open the Firefox Toolbar/Menu becomes (or attaches) to the CS3 Toolbar (not certain if this is descriptive enough). Almost a if it is merging with the CS3 application. I believe the CS3 application then slows (or lock up) especially if I try to save and quit. The toolbar becomes almost unresponsive after I try to save. Thunderbird also ha a tendency to do this, though not a often. I did try the newest version of Firefox with the same results. I can't believe no one else is having this problem. I love Firefox and would hate to have to find another browser.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open application Firefox & Adobe CS3 InDesign (or Illustrator)
2. Start working, jump online to search for something
3. Go back to work in CS3 find Firefox now attached to the CS3 Toolbar/Menu
Actual Results:
Hangups sometimes necessitating a reboot of the computer sometimes losing working projects.
