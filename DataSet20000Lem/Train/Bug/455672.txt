Browser is failing to display currency symbol even when they are encoded using entity names.

This website provides information on gold bullion bar and coin and a such contains a lot of currency symbol throughout the site. Since upgrading to Firefox 3 we have noticed that the currency symbol are not being displayed by Firefox, instead being substituted for a glyph type symbol containing the letter FF FD. When we checked our source code a lot of pound sign simply appeared a the symbol so we encoded them using the &pound; entity name and the browser is still not displaying the symbol correctly.

Whilst we can fix this by changing the character encoding on the browser, we had to look up on the internet how to do this. It seems like a step backward when the new version of the browser is preventing text symbol being displayed which were displaying perfectly fine in the previous versions.

Obviously some user are not going to understand what is being displayed and also how they can change this on their browser. Is this down to Firefox simply defaulting to UTF-8 or can we force the character encoding using CSS/PHP?

Many thanks

Our site get a lot of visitor each and every day and now for no reason our site doesnt display properly in your browser. Could you advise on what the preferred format for displaying currency symbol is for the web a we thought we were using web compliant html entity code but obviously these dont display.
