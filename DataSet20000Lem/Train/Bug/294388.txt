The bookmark file contains information when a bookmark wa last accessed. This
cause the bookmark file to be updated regularly, which is an annoyance when
using a versioning system such a Subversion to back it up.

Accessing a bookmark belongs to the browsing history and should not be logged in
the bookmark file. The bookmark file should only be changed when a bookmark get
added/changed/deleted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Import bookmarks.html into a Subversion repository
2. Check out a working copy from this repository for Firefox to use
3. Start Firefox, use the bookmarks, without changing them
4. Commit the bookmarks.html file

Actual Results:
Although the bookmark themselves weren't changed, the bookmark file is treated
a changed, and the change is committed to the Subversion repository

Expected Results:
The bookmarks.html file should have been left unchanged. In this case Subversion
would not have detected a change and not bumped the revision number.
