Firefox start OK, but get progressively le responsive, with drop-down menus, the minimising or closure facility and new tab opening taking longer and longer until the whole thing freeze - leaving the 'Close window' instruction on the taskbar menu a the only way to close the program. It seems similar in a way to the problem reported in Bug number 557938.
