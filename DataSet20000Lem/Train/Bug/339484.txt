Go to, for example http://planet.mozilla.org/rss10.xml .

Firefox will ask if you wish to subscribe, and you have the option of choosing a reader.

Choose the firefox application a a reader.

Select the check box: Open Feeds with my chosen reader automatically, skipping the preview page.

Choose subscribe now.

Firefox go into an apparent infinite loop, opening page after page seemingly without end, and also steal focus on my OS. The page seem to be blank, mozilla not having time to draw them (?), while it open new tabs. Probably they were to show the feed view.

Furthermore, the next time you deign in the future to visit any url to an atom or r feed, firefox will again immediately begin spawning tab or windows. This make it difficult to correct the mistake you've made in your settings.

I think this bug is serious, since it is hard for the average user, once he's chosen the mistaken route I've specified, to correct his firefox settings. He ha to have some knowledge of the preference UI to which he needn't originally have been exposed.
-------

This is probably going to happen to quite a few user while investigating firefox's new feed capabilities. It seems natural that some user would select firefox a an application to view feeds.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a url for a feed.
2.In the feed view, choose firefox a the reader.
3.Choose to open feed skipping the preview page.
4.Choose subscribe now.
Actual Results:
Many, perhaps infinite, continuously spawned tab or windows. Firefox may need to be forced to shut down. Firefox steal focus of other application if put to the background.


Expected Results:
Not to spawn all those window continously. I don't understand what it's doing.
