This didn't start happening until I updated Firefox from 1.5 to 2.0. a with bug 345164. Multiple window are open, Yahoo, Gmail, in addition, it doesn't really matter where I navigate to, the 'Authorization required' screen pop up. It seems to not pop up a often when I enter the name and password at the Linksys screen. Clearing the Private Data doesn't do much. It also happens when I am in Word and have Firefox open a well. The difference is it doe not stop me from what I am doing. It is annoying when the Firefox tab at the bottom of the screen blinks. It doesn't stop until I go to that tab and hit clear. But it come right back in a few minutes. I'd like to go back to 1.5 without the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox.
2. go to GMAIL, Yahoo
3. or any other place
Actual Results:
the Authorization screen pop up.

Expected Results:
It seems to open in the tab I wa last in, so that I am taken back to the authorization screen. I click clear and it gone for a while. I can resume what I wa doing until it appears again.

The screen should not be popping up. This is something new which started with the update of Firefox to 2.0. Never had to do more than close a window to log out of anything with version 1.5 nor did I have to sign on to Linksys in order to use Firefox.
