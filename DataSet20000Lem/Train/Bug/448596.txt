A page that ha a vertical scrollbar ha a textarea with a vertical scrollbar cause the page to get "stuck" when scrolling through the page. In IE, the page temporarily "sticks" until the bottom of the scroll is reached and then the page scrolling continues.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a page with a textarea that also ha a page-level scroll.
2. Scroll through the textarea with the mouse wheel and keep scrolling without moving the mouse pointer (i.e. keep the mouse pointer perfectly still).

Actual Results:
The page refuse to scroll. If you move the mouse a couple pixel and then continue scrolling, it start scrolling the page. You can sit there scrolling all day and nothing will happen until the mouse pointer is moved.

Expected Results:
I do find IE's "continue to scroll" approach annoying when I really do want to scroll to the end of the textarea without scrolling the page. But I find this approach more annoying. Perhaps after 2 second of scrolling without moving the mouse pointer, the page could start moving.
