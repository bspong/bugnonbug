When opening Firefox 3.5, there is no automatic connection to the internet and browser show a "server not found" message. (In contrast to 3.0.11 and IE8 where aAutomatic dialup work fine). Have worked thru all the obvious route such a firewall setting and internet setting without success. NB: once an internet connection ha been setup (e.g. by starting IE8), Firefox 3.5 work fine. The problem is purely the lack of automatic dialup function at launch.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox 3.5 without an active internet connection.
2. No automatic dialup of internet connection.
3. "Server not found" message.
Actual Results:
The browser fails to automatically connect with the internet so open a page with a "Server not found" message. I have to setup an internet connection by other mean (e.g. opening IE8). Then browser works.

Expected Results:
When starting Firefox 3.5, it should automatically initiate a dialup process (like on Firefox 3.0.11 and IE8) that connects to the internet without any further manual intervention and brings up the correct start page.

The problem is purely the lack of automatic connection at the beginning. Once a connection ha been established some other way, browser work fine. Have tried deactivating Windows firewall a suggested on Mozilla support page: no progress. Have checked internet setting and made changes: no progress. Many experienced user are reporting this bug where I live in Germany and nobody ha found a solution yet.
