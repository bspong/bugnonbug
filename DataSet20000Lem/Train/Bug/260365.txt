Minor usability issue with Tools/Options/Web Features

In 0.10PR, the dialog in Tools/Options/Web Features, there are two tick box
at the top of the dialog:

Block Popup Windows
Allow web site to install software

The default for these are great, a are the whitelisting of allowed site
for both. However, logically, I think the description (and therefore value)
of one of these should be inverted. Currently ticking one implies a blocking
action (don't display popup window unless in whitelist) whereas ticking the
other implies a positive action (allow web site to install software a long
a in whitelist). If one were inverted, these would end up as:

Block Popup Windows (if not in whitelist)
Block Websites from Installing Software (if not in whitelist)

or

Allow Popup Windows (if in whitelist)
Allow Websites to Install Software (if in whitelist)

I think this would allow the same configuration a currently available,
but would be le confusing a it is more consistent. This doesn't mean the
effective default setup ha to change, of course (nor should it) - a long a
the correct box are ticked or unticked by default that should be OK.

This is only based on my own usage of the software, not on any in-depth study,
obviously.
