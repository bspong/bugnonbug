Firefox can not access FTP-folders if folder name contain German umlaut ('ü', 'ö', 'ä').

I won't succeed in trying to access FTP-folders with the built-in FTP-client while folder name contain a German umlaut (e.g. 'ü' or 'ä').

For example if I try to access a folder:
/PUBLIC3/MUSTER/Schmitt/DVS/Prüfungen
I get the following error message:
550 No Such Directory "/PUBLIC3/MUSTER/Schmitt/DVS/Pr"

I found that in the error message the file name string will always be cut off at the umlaut's position.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go via FTP to a directory that contains a subdirectory with an umlaut in it name
2. Make sure that you have the permission needed to access the subdirectory
3. Try to access it
Actual Results:
You won't be able to access the directory.
An error message with error number 550 will occur.

Expected Results:
I should be able to browse the folder.

Umlauts in folder name are also not displayed correctly. A question mark is set instead of the actual character.

Trying to access folder containing umlaut in it name using the Konquerer-browser wa successful.
