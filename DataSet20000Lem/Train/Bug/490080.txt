I experienced the "MEGA VISTA Operating system crash probably the same time firefox upgraded itself to to 3.0? from 2.??. all bookmark were lost. I am grateful to you for providing such a great program but saddened to to report you never did heed my advice concerning AUTOMATICALLY placing a copy of these bookmark into a place that could be automatically backed up.
Sticking these bookmark in a "HIDDEN SYSTEM FILE or whatever" {in a spot completely unbackupable wa sadly criminal and negligent.}
Sadly the stability of firefox wa also a defeat, and your arrogance in doing an upgrade from 2.?? to 3.0? and messing around with a very stable and reliable system without warning to you user that the bookmark were at risk wa in my mind unacceptable. It will take probably six to nine month to restore the lost bookmark all tool in my work.
I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO PROVIDE USERS AN OPTION TO AUTOMATICALLY PLACE A COPY OF THE BOOKMARKS ETC INTO A BACKUPABLE PLACE OF YOUR USERS CHOICE SO THAT THIS arrogant act of destruction can never happens again.
