It seems to me the behaviour of the accept cookie dialog ha changed with 3.0.5 to be non-modal. Maybe this is related to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=405239

Now it sometimes happens (a matter of bad timing) that I click on the webpage which cause the accept cookie dialog being opened behind the ff window. It then look like the web page isn't loaded because ff wait for confirmation of that dialog.

Is there a way to make that dialog modal so that it is never opened behind the window?

I use ff 3.0.5 on win xp/sp3.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set "Accept cookie" to "Ask every time"
2.Open a few page that demand setting cooky
3.Click in the main window while the page are loading
Actual Results:
The "Accept Cookie" dialog is opened in the background. If you don't look carefully, it look a if ff would hang and wouldn't load the page.

Expected Results:
The confirmation dialog should always be in the foreground. I think it would be best to "embed" it in the window like the allow-popup dialog.

This seems to be a consequence of
