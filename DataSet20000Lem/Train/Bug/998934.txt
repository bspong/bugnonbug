Whitelist Sync marketing page to allow ability to link directly to about:accounts?action=signup

Example of 'customize' item highlighted in open menu panel

Problem:
A path to the Sync flow doe not exist from the Sync marketing page.

To enter the Sync flow, a user must go to 'about:accounts'. This is where the Sync specific sign up/in flow exists. This is not a standard web page and therefore can not be directly linked to from http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/sync/ It is accessed via the new menu panel, found in the Firefox 29 design.

Note that 'accounts.firefox.com' is a web page that support account creation, but doe not mention Sync specifically because account are used for multiple products. It currently contains no mention of Sync and is not an appropriate flow to send potential and current Sync user through.


Details:
/firstrun and /whatsnew have the ability to interact with the browser chrome to support Firefox onboarding. This mean that the web can trigger reaction in the chrome. e.g.: When landing on /whatsnew, an infopanel is displayed, menu panel can be opened, and item in the chrome can be highlighted to teach user where they are located.

Solution:
Whitelist the Sync marketing page, so that when clicking on a Sync sign up CTA
in the webpage, the menu panel will open and Sync item will be highlighted. This CTA will only be shown to Firefox users. If the Sync flow exists in a web page at some point, we can test both method to see what is best for this context.
