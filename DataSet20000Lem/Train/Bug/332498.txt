modifier-clicking url proxy icon (favicon) should duplicate tab, copy tab to new window, save tab, etc. (using middle/ctrl/shift/alt clicks)
Currently clicking on the back, forward or home button with certain modifier open the relevant URL in a different way (new tab, window, save, etc.). These special way of opening URLs would be useful if applied to the current page too, and would provide a mean of performing several frequently requested functionalities.

Currently:
* Clicking the url proxy icon selects all text in the location bar (whether or not any modifier are used or the middle mouse button wa used)
* Hovering over the url proxy icon cause the cursor to become a grab hand.

I propose the following changes:
* Middle/Ctrl-clicking it open the current page in a new selected tab
* Shift-clicking it open the current page in a new window
* Shift+Middle/Ctrl-clicking it open the current page in a new background tab
* Alt-clicking it save the current page
* When hovered it just look like a bookmark toolbar item, so it is clear that it can be clicked but also reasonably intuitive that it can be dragged. The cursor would be unchanged, which would actually be more consistent with other UI element and programs.

The code and reasoning for choosing which action (already used by the back, forward and home buttons) is here:

This is a split of bug 263942, after discussing that one with timeless on IRC he suggested that it would make much more sense for the functionality to be added to the url proxy icon instead of the reload button.
