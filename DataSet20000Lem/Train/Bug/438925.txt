localized URL prefs in distribution.ini not being interpreted properly
Created attachment 324852
distribution.ini for testcase

When localized pref URLs are used in the distribution.ini file, the value of the pref is reformatted a "data:text/plain,pref.name=pref.value". As an example, if

startup.homepage_welcome_url="http://%locale%.www.mozilla.com/%locale%/add-ons/ebay/extension/firstrun"

is specified in the localized prefs section, the value of the pref startup.homepage_welcome appears in the en-US build of fx3 a data:text/plain,startup.homepage_welcome_url=http://en-US.www.mozilla.com/en-US/add-ons/ebay/extension/firstrun

On startup, fx load the entire pref value a the URL, not just the URL. Gavin mentioned that bug 386696 may be responsible for this.

Steps to reproduce:

- Create a "distribution" directory off the application directory
- Copy the "distribution.ini for testcase" attachment to the distribution
directory
- Start Firefox3 with a new profile

Expected results: Firefox 3 appearing with a customized firstrun page and start page

Actual results: Firefox 3 appears with a tab that try to load data:text/plain,startup.homepage_welcome_url=http://en-US.www.mozilla.com/en-US/add-ons/ebay/extension/firstrun a a URL and the start page (see attached fx3_startup image)
