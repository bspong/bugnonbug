When I am in a game, the page will jump up to reveal a new banner that ha loaded. Also, several time he browser would just close/quit/shutdown. I wa able to restart with the "restore" option, but closing is a problem, especially when buying online.

I just downloaded V2.0 yesterday because V1.05xx quit working. When I attempted to open it, a Mozilla pop up appeared wanting me to install or turn on a feedback agent. 3xI checked cancel... it would still pop up. Then I installed,, and it wouldn't open at all.

Hope you can fix the V2.0. If not, I will reinstall the 1.05xx... again hopefully without that nasty popup of a feedback agent.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to gamehouse
2.Open and pay a game
3.page/window jump up when new Banner appears

The application quitting is sporadic. Cannot specify how/when.

Actual Results:
Page/window jumped up to show banner.

Expected Results:
Stay on the spot of the page where I am working and not automatically jump anywhere else.

Not arbitrarily shutdown, but run until I close it.

I only use the default theme of Firefox.
