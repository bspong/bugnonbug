History autocomplete doesn't autocomplete "fi" to "file://" URIs correctly
BUILD: Current trunk debug build

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1) Start Firefox with a clean profile.
2) Say that you don't want it to be the default browser
3) Wait for the start page to load.
4) Hit Ctrl-L on your keyboard.
5) Type "file:///home/bzbarsky/test.html" in the URL bar and hit enter.
6) Wait for the HTML to load.
7) Hit Ctrl-L on your keyboard.
8) Type "fi" in the URL bar. At this point the autocomplete dropdown appears.
It contains one entry in it.
9) Hit the down arrow key once.
10) Hit the right arrow key once.
11) Hit the left arrow key twice.
12) Hit the backspace key twice.
13) Type the letter "x".
14) Hit enter.

EXPECTED RESULTS:

After step 9 the URL bar contains the string "file:///home/bzbarsky/test.html" and the caret is at the _end_ of the string. After step 13 the URL bar contains the string "file:///home/bzbarsky/test.xml". After step 14 the XML file loads.

ACTUAL RESULTS:

After step 9 the URL bar contains the string "fi" and the caret is at the _beginning_ of the string. After step 13 the URL bar contains the string "xfi". Step 14 give an error page.

This look like a likely regression from bug 202992. Could someone check on that, please?
