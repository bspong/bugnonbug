Error message when launching app with url from start -> run and other method (DDECache reg key)
This doe not affect the trunk for some unknown reason... perhaps a change in MSVC8. Changing the following in nsNativeAppSupportWin.cpp fix this bug but is obviously wallpaper. If this is used #ifdef MOZ_PHOENIX should probably be added a well. Even if the app is still running removing this key doe no harm though I suspect there is a slight perf impact. I have not been able to find any info about the DDECache reg key addition.

// get rid of it a we are shutting down.
// Note: Destroy call DestroyWindow, which will only work on a window
// created by the same thread.
MessageWindow mw;
mw.Destroy();
