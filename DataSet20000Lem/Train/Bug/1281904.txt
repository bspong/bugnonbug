Audio/video autoplays even with plugins.click_to_play = true
Regardless of plugins.click_to_play, visiting the test URL cause audio (and unless explicitly blocked each time a described below, video a well) to start playing without requiring that the video player be clicked on. I also tested this in Safe Mode.

When I have plugins.click_to_play=true and the "Click to play per element" add-on is enabled for extra protection, I see the same thing. Even when I click the plugin icon next to the URL and say "Block plugin," this block doe not survive a browser restart (and if there are multiple tab open, that mean multiple overlapping video and audio stream starting up together when multiple tab are being reopened at once). After clicking Block Plugin, refreshing the page, I see a black/dark gray area instead of the video and I see an information bar asking "Allow http://www.usatoday.com to run "Adobe Flash"? but the audio still plays, and it even continues a autoplay advance in to the next video. Clicking the plugin icon next to the URL, I get the same question with option "Allow Now" and "Allow and Remember" with no option to block the plugin that should already not be playing. I see this in FF43 a well.

This surprise startup of audio is very annoying, for all the same reason I have click_to_play = true and use the add-on to try to block plugin autoplay.

It's also not clear when clicking on a link to a news story that it'll have an autoplaying loud video (or ads), and the video don't necessarily add to the content (esp. the video up now at the example URL, in contrast to the video that wa there this morning which had a newscaster adding some additional substance and detail).

Please reclassify the Component if I got that wrong.
