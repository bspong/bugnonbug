Firefox/Linux/Wine: Downloaded file is executed automatically
report from Hannes Mayer

see below for original email]
Here is an update:

This is a simple PHP test script to demonstrate the problem:

<?
// script name: test.php
// call this script with: test.php/test.exe

header("Content-Type: audio/x-pn-realaudio");

// symlink of notepad.exe in current directory to
// /usr/lib/wine/notepad.exe.so (in debian package wine-utils)
readfile("notepad.exe");
?>

Firefox just downloads "test.exe" and executes it immediately!
In this case notepad show up, but could be any malicious code aswell!

Best regards,
Hannes.

Dear Firefox-Team!

Version info: FireFox 1.0.5
OS: Linux Debian stable with WINE installed

I've just discovered something pretty scary:

While being on amazon
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000015KR/002-5031764-6125631?v=glance
I've clicked on
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/clipserve/B0000015KR001004/1/002-5031764-6125631
(scroll down to "Listen to Samples" - "Realplayer" - "Listen"-Link)

and TATA!! Suddenly WINE came up with a window, telling me:
wine: cannot determine executable type for L"Z:\\tmp\\hurl.exe"

After following the "amazon-realplayer-link" with
http://www.rexswain.com/httpview.html

I saw that after some redirects it end up with this:

GET /scripts/hurl.exe?~kk-600111/0009587_0104_00_0002.ra HTTP/1.1
Host: www.content.loudeye.com
Content-Type: audio/x-pn-realaudio
Content:
pnm://rm.content.loudeye.com/~kk-600111/0009587_0104_00_0002.ra

Taking a look into /tmp/hurl.exe I found that it contains
pnm://rm.content.loudeye.com/~kk-600111/0009587_0104_00_0002.ra

This is pretty alarming to me, since the realplayer URL could be some
malicious executable aswell, cause damage/data loss etc.. to the system.

If you have any further questions, just email me.

Best regards,
Hannes.
