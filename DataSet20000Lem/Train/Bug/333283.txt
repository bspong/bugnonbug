Entered search argument, searched, result popup on the screen for a second, then instantly disappear.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
On various sites, page appears to load fine, then, at the last second, various text / graphic element disappear. Peculiar to FireFox; not reproduceable under IE tab or when using MSIE.

Expected Results:
Expected text / graphic to remain visible. Expected various ad to be blocked by Adblock.

Have tried disabling NoScript, Disabling Adblock. Using IE Tab display the page fine, but of course without the advantage of FireFox's popup blocks, etc.

Captured some of the code (available a source, but not displayed..) (note: serach argument wa "firefox", and this wa one of several 'hits'):
<TD><A HREF="view.php?id=5139540" title="Firefox 1 0 5 (Windows)"><strong>firefox</strong> 1 0 5 (Windows)</A></TD>

Have seen same problem on several different websites. I suspect it may be linked to a particular bit of "PHP" code, a each site I've seen with this problem doe use PHP. But I'm not so code-saavy. Any ideas?
