Create UITour event framework
A number of the dependent of bug 1080942 need a new event framework in UITour, to allow part of Firefox to tell a tour webpage that something happened. Let's use this bug to figure out what that should look like, so it's not spread among those other existing bugs.

There are basically 3 part to this:

* Define a content API for tour page to register and receive event
* Define a chrome API for Firefox code to easily trigger such event
* Implement the UITour.jsm / uitour.js code to glue #1 and #2 together

I think it would make sense to base this on something similar to DOM event listeners, especially on the content-exposed side. [But minimally so, no bubbling/capturing/cancelable etc. The intent isn't to exactly clone addEventListener] So, something like:

* addTourListener(eventType, callback)

e.g. UITour.addTourListener("party", function onParty(event) { ... });
where |event| is a JS object with event.type == "party" and event.data an
arbitrary object supplied from chrome.

* removeTourListener(eventType, callback)

(If we even need it; I'd suspect we don't)

* dispatchTourEvent(eventType, data) [from chrome code]
e.g. dispatchTourEvent("party", { likeItIs: 1999 })

The UITour module would be responsible for routing dispatchTourEvent() call to any open tour page.

Consider this a starting point for discussion, I'm not beholden to any specifics.
