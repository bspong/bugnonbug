Popup window open in fullscreen mode on OSX when window.open is called with windowFeatures argument
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0

Steps to reproduce:

I'm running Firefox on Mac OSX 10.8.3 in OSX's native "Fullscreen Mode" (the one where Firefox get it's own screen).

Then a web app call window.open() with the strWindowFeatures argument. ( see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.open )


Actual results:

The popup window is also opened in native fullscreen mode even when width and/or height are specified in the strWindowFeatures argument.

When window.open() is called without strWindowFeatures, the new windoo open a a new tab instead, propably according to the user preference "open new window in a new tab".

This is reproducible in current version of Firefox 19, 20 (beta) and 22 (nightly), I didn't test 21.


Expected results:

The new Window should be opened in front of the existing main window like the downloads dialog doe when pressing CMD+J or like the "view source" window when pressing CMD+U or it could open on a "Desktop" screen.

Anyway it should have the specified dimension and the behaviour should be consistent.
