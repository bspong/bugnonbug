Many addons are compatible with later version (read: alpha) of firefox, but the developer may not yet have included that in the install.rdf, or may have not updated the install.rdf, etc. When you switch between trunks, ie from alpha 8 to 2.0.0.6, there is a forced compatibility check, but it must not actually be checking local data (ie modified install.rdf files) because it mark extension incompatible which I have modified to be compatible. This can be fixed by reinstalling the addons, but is certainly an irritating bug when switching between an alpha release and a public release. (All extension of course work fine on the public release compatibility check, but when I go back to testing the alpha, all are marked incompatible)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Gran Paradiso Alpha 8, quit.
2.Run Firefox 2.0.0.*, quit
3.Run Gran Paradiso Alpha 8.
Actual Results:
All extension that are not listed by their author a being compatible are marked incompatible, even if their install.rdf file have been manually modified (because the extension actually DOES work)

Expected Results:
Gran Paradiso Alpha 8 should have checked the local install.rdf information to determine compatibility.

Let me know if anyone need clarification, it a simple enough problem, but I may not have explained it well. marinebio72 AT comcast D0T net
