The Places Library, a it stand today, lack some critical feature which are provided by the history sidebar and it is not a streamlined a the Pre-Places bookmark organizer.

First, instead of providing the History, Tags, and Bookmarks in a tree, they should be provided a a series of view (much like the History Sidebar dose).

+------------------------+
| View Menu |
+------------------------+
| Bookmarks |
| Tags |
| History |
| Search |
+------------------------+
| [] Split-view |
+------------------------+
| Show Columns > |
| Sort > |
+------------------------+

(Or, I suppose the Bookmarks/Tags/History/Search group could be added to the Organize menu... Either could work for me)

In addition, a 'Sort by Date and Site' sorting option should be added to provide missing functionality from the History Sidebar. This is a very useful sorting mode and it should not be missing from the main Organizer.

When searching, the search bar should automatically limit it's search scope to the type of content that is being viewed.
I.E. when looking at bookmarks, the search bar should search only bookmarks, and when viewing history it would search only history, etc...

Finally, and I know this is a contention among many users, there should be an option to switch between a single-view and a split-view.
-The single-view would be much like the Pre-Places bookmark organize was. The Bookmark folder (and history sites) would be presented in a hierarchical tree with their content listed below them
-The split-view would be what currently exists, with the folder/site hierarchy viewable in the left panel and the folder content viewed in the right panel.


(Sorry in advance if this should habe been broken up in to multiple bug or added to a meta/tracker bug. This is my first bug so I'm not quite sure on the etiquette)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Places Library
2.
3.
Actual Results:
History, Tags, and Bookmarks are presented in tree view with no option for advanced history view

History->Show All History open Library with the History folder selected
Bookmarks->Organize Bookmarks open Library with the All Bookmarks folder selected

Searching automatically search all Places entry

Expected Results:
History->Show All History should open Library in the History view
Bookmarks->Organize Bookmarks should open Library in the Bookmarks view

View/Organize menu should provide option to switch between the Tags, Bookmarks, Advanced History, and Search view

Search should be context sensitive and limit search to content of current view (History/Tags/Bookmarks)
