The problem wa found while using the FlashGot plugin. I emailed the author of
this plugin stating the memory leaks, and he said this is a problem with
firefox, NOT his plugin. This make sense too:

---------------------------------
I wa just recently using FlashGot v0.5.8 along with the most recent version of
FlashGet to obtain a huge amount of picture file from various galleries.

I followed the following process:

1) I would right click a picture, and "Build Gallery"
2) I would fill the 'Preview' edit control with the actual HTTP address to the
FULL SIZED picture, I didn’t want to use the thumbnail/source combination.
3) Thirdly, after the gallery wa built, I right clicked in a blank area and
clicked "Flashgot All".
4) FlashGet then began processing a batch of around 500 picture in one go.

I followed the above step on several galleries, which range from 10 to 500
pictures. It depends.

Anyhow, after obtaining about 1000 picture file via your plugin and flashget, I
noticed my computer lagging INCREDIBLY! I checked my task manager to find that
firefox wa consuming 1.1GB of my memory! I have 1.5GB Total.
