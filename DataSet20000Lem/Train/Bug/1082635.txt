Confirmation dialog unresponsive
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:35.0a1) Gecko/35.0a1 Firefox/35.0a1

Steps to reproduce:

A1. Navigate to http://user@example.com
A2. A confirmation dialog pop up ("You are about to log in to the site "example.com" with the username "user", but the website doe not require authentication. This may be an attempt to trick you. Is "example.com" the site you want to visit?")
A3. Click "Yes"

OR

B1. Enable E10S
B2. Uncheck "Enable E10S (multi-process)" in preference
B3. A confirmation dialog pop up, asking to restart firefox for change to take effect
B4. Click "Yes"

In both cases, clicking "Cancel" or "No" dismisses the prompt a expected.

Probably happens with other builtin confirmation dialog too. Javascript confirm() work a expected.


Actual results:

A. Nothing happens, dialog stay open.

B. Nothing happens, dialog stay open. If cancel is clicked, E10S checkbox reverts to enabled state, preventing user from disabling E10S unless disabled via about:config




Expected results:

A. Dialog should close, browser should navigate to the given address

B. Dialog should close, E10S should become disabled, browser should restart.
