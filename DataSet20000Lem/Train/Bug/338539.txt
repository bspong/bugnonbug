I'm using the Blogging software WordPress. Sometimes when I edit a post, Firefox doesn't show the complete content of the predefined value in the textarea. If I don't see that and submit the form, the "hidden" content is lost.

This happens from time to time on larger posts. It's not a fault of WordPress because the full post is set a the textarea value (I've looked at the source when it happened the last time).

The position where firefox stop to display the content seems to be random. In the attached data, it's line 117, character 80, which is not a special character but in a normal word.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install blogging software wordpress (wordpress.org) or create a page with a textarea
2. Create a post or set the textarea content to the attached content.txt
3. Reload the page several time until Firefox truncates the content of the textarea.

Actual Results:
Firefox stopped displaying the textarea content at line 117, character 80 (attached data)

Expected Results:
Firefox should display all content

Set to critial because I lose the half of my post data when I submit the trunctated content. I think it's happening since I've upgraded to Firefox 1.5.0.3.
