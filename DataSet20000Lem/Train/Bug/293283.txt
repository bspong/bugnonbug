When printing colors, size of printout is changed -- made larger so only part of page area prints.

When I retrieve a color-rich page such a a mapquest routing with maps, if I
print for "greyscale" I get the same size of font and figure a the display.
However, when I print in color, all the size appear enlarged, perhaps a much
a 150% (hard to measure) with the result that only part of the visible page
area is within the printer bounding box.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Retrieve a page with lot of color
2. Print the page, selecting 'greyscale' output
3. Print the page again selecting 'color' output

Actual Results:
The color version appears significantly enlarged.

Expected Results:
The page should be identical, except of course for the coloration.

NOTE, other program (such a OOo) do not exhibit this behavior; showing that
Firefox is the likely culprit. Sometimes, at least, I can save a page and print
from a different program -- but that's a real PITA
