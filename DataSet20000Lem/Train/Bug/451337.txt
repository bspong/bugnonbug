Problem noticed after closing Firefox and reopening, occasionally the Bookmarks toolbar is not visible, also the close (x) icon on tab is not visible. The space on the toolbar for the Bookmarks toolbar display a grey space, ie no icons.

It seems to occur when Firefox doe not fully close - firefox.exe is still visible in Task Manager > Processes tab.

If I close Firefox, and 'End Process' on firefox.exe in Windows Task Manager/Process tab, then reopen, the Bookmarks toolbar (and tab close icons) is now visible.

This problem ha occurred on two different machine - work laptop and home desktop - both Dells. I've tried re-installing latest version from Mozilla but problem still occurs.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close Firefox (?)
2.
3.
Actual Results:
firefox.exe still visible in Process tab in Task Manager and Bookmarks Toolbar not visible.


Apart from having the SwitchProxy Tool 1.4.1 add-on installed everything else is a per the standard install.
