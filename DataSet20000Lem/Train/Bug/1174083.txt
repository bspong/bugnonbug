1. Flash today's (6/12) master build in a Flame device
2. In the browser app, open appA
3. appA register a SW
4. about:sw in b2g show up that SW
5. Install appA
6. Open appA directly, appA register the same SW again
7. about:sw in b2g currently (once Bug 1168226 ha been landed) show up the SWs registered at step #2 and step #4 which is the expected behavior
