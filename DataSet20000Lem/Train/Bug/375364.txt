I just installed this version over my previous version, 1.5 something or other. Since, session restore of all tab and window isn't working even tho I have it set to do just that upon reopening Firefox. I did find where someone had such a problem but you closed the problem saying something about not fixing it for meta-tags or some such, but this wa working fine before I "upgraded" to latest version. Only time it worked wa when Firefox crashed on me. It never work when I close all open Firefox windows. It only open the window I wa working in last.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open more than one Firefox window with multiple tab
2. Close group on all open Firefox window
3. Reopen Firefox and watch it only open the last window you were in, losing the other window(s) and tabs. (I have resorted to using notepad to copy all URLS to from all tab every time I need to reboot my PC so I don't lose track of where I was/what I wa doing before I needed to reboot.)
Actual Results:
Firefox only open the last window/tabs you had active.

Expected Results:
Should open all Firefox window and tab like version 1.5 ... did.
