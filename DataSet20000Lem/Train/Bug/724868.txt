Firefox always freeze that everybody knows, but this version freeze the way beyond any other versions.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0
Build ID: 20120129021758

Steps to reproduce:

1. After logging into window 7, by clicking the firefox icon. Once firefox starts, it take forever to load a page. Then by restarting the browser I can load page now. This happens everytime.
2. I did nothing but opening a new tab (1st tab in that window) and loading a webpage.
3. At http://www.imdb.com, clicked "watch trailer" button and cilcked play button on the video.


Actual results:

Whenever firefox load a page (any website) it freeze few second for no reason and then back to normal. When I play a video at http://www.imvu.com, video always lag and not in sync with audio, but if I play the same video after the buffer is 100% it play with no issues. Lately I'm experiencing same problem with youtube sometimes. See, it's frozen for 5 sec even when I'm typing this report. Please do something about this freeze issue, it's been here since Firefox V1.0. This issue is so so annoying. Thanks


Expected results:

Instead the software should have done one best thing which is not to freeze and annoy the user. Creators, please take this freezing problem off from firefox. I don't think you keep this freezing issue purposely to market seamonkey, do you ?
