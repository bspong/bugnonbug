Recently, my firefox program ha been having trouble loading webpage off of
hyperlinks. When selecting a new tab or new window off of a hyperlink I often
get a blank window or tab that doe not load the website data. This problem
doesn't happen everytime I try to display a new tab or new page off of a
hyperlink, but it happens extremely often. I've also noticed that picture and
graphic are also having trouble loading up on the website that do load and
display. For instance, when visiting someone's picture gallery on myspace.com
I'll often get broken picture icon instead of the picture themselves. However,
once I right-click the icon and choose "viewimage" the picture will then display
on the original screen from that point forward.

I've talked to a few other people who have experienced this same problem and
they say it's due to a faulty extension and the only way I can remedy the
problem is to remove all trace of firefox from my computer so that a new
firefox profile can be created. However, everytime I uninstall and reinstal
firefox I experience the same problem all over again because despite the fact
that I've uninstalled firefox, firefox leaf information behind that return
once it is reinstalled again. What can I do to purge my computer of all remnant
of my current firefox information so that I can start fresh again?

Reproducible: Always

graphic are loading leaving broken picture icon behind instead.
