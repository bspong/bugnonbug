Location bar allows user to begin entering a location only until page loads, then automatically move the insertion point into the browser window.

When hitting a page that ha a JavaScript Applet, or any other reason the page
would load more slowly, the location bar will allow user to begin entering a
URL, but then once the page is loaded, the cursor move down into the browser
window and a the user continues to type, word on the page that start with the
letter being typed (into the location field) are selected in the web page that
just loaded a the user types. This is very frustrating, enough to stop using
the browser. This is especially annoying because we are required to have our
homepage set to our company homepage and it ha a JavaScript that load slowly.

I immediately start typing the URL of the page I want to go to and a the page
finish loading, I am not able to finish typing the URl because the insertion
point move automatically to the browser window.

Thanks,

Thomas

3.Get really annoyed when you can finish typing the URL without manually moving
the insertion point back into the location field.

Expected Results:
Let user finish typing in the Location field even after the page is done
loading. I don't understand why it ha to remove the insertion point from this
field once the page loads. It doesn't serve any purpose.
