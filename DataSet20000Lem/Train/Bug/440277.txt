I downloaded the updated version twice for my Mac I have version: OSX 10.4.11.
I did the following:
1. clicked on the download-update version for mac, it downloaded perfectly
2. took the firefox icon to the application folder
3. the notice came to replace the older version , which I said yes to.
4. then the note from "Copy" came: "The operation cannot be completed because you do not have sufficient privilege for some of the items." No mention on which item they were.

However I have this comment twice after each time I tried to update: "The operation cannot be completed because you do not have sufficient privilege for some of the items."
I have a password for any change I make, this wa not generated.

I own this Mac, I am the administrator for this stand alone system. It is my personal and professional base for all thing computing, including the Internet. I do have friend who use this computer on occasion, and have a separate branch for them; hence the password for all changes.

I will be completing a "detailed bug report"
