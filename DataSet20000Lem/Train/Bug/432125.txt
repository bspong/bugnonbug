firefox profile is set to default with too many link in bookmark folder
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14

This problem occurs under Windows (XP SP2) and Linux.

I have many link stored in the bookmark folder (also with subfolders, ...)
File Size bookmark.html: 2.17 MByte

When I sometimes start firefox, all preference are set to default.
This problem wa several times, and the bookmark were still there and not lost.

So I copied a Backup into the Mozilla folder, that restores the settings.

This problem occurs very often, so I make a clean profile and setup the preference by hand.

But the problem is still there, and now when it set to default, the bookmark file is corrupted (only character , the square, is in the file) --> Bookmark data is lost. That is in Windows XP SP2 (I also defragment the system, but that didn't solve the problem.)

First the problem wasn't under Linux (Gentoo Linux 2007.0), but after importing the working bookmark file to sync the bookmarks, the problem wa there in the same way.

I have installed following themes/addons; iFox , NoScript, but when I uninstall these plugins, the problem is also there.

Is there a border of amount of link in bookmark.html, that I have reached?!

In common the error can appear after 3 days, or after 1 or 2 weeks, or on one day twice, I think that it depends on the frequency, I add bookmark links?.

Both Firefox Versions under Linux and Windows have the latest version (2.0.0.14)

Best regards, B.A.
