Mozilla 1.7b and Firefox 0.8 are not compatible
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Mozilla 1.7b and Firefox 0.8 are not compatible on the same computer under
Windows XP. I had Firefox running for sometime now without any problems. I
installed Mozilla 1.7b and immediately started having problems. Firefox would
crash most of the time when I opened the Options and deleted Cache and other
housekeeping. Mozilla would crash when viewing some web page from Mozilla.

Solution: Uninstall both Mozilla and Firefox. Delete Phoenix directory under the
settings. Then Reinstall Firefox. Without deleting the Phoenix directory, the
problem continue.

After the above solution, everything work fine again. But Mozilla 1.7b and
Firefox 0.8 are not compatible on the same computer.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox
2.Install Mozilla 1.7b
3.Clear Cache, History, Cookies, etc. from Firefox.
4. Browse to the Mozilla website with Mozilla

Actual Results:
When clearing the cookies, cache, etc., Firefox froze and the system reported a
crash.
When Mozilla tried loading the Mozilla website page, it crashed each time.
When un-installed and re-installed, the problem continued. Only after
un-installing both and deleting the Phoenix directory could Firefox be
re-installed where it would run properly.

Expected Results:
Housekeeping to take place with firefox and seeing the mozilla website page with
Mozilla.

I wa using the Wood theme with Firefox. It had been working fine before
installing Mozilla.
