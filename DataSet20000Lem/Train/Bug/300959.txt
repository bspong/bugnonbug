Only happens at www.msnbc.com and only on some link there, and only since they
recently "improved" their site. Also happened in Firefox 1.0.4.

Attempt to print some pages, and it just sits there while CPU use go to 100%
and just sits there. Have to switch to another program window and then back to
Firefox and the only cure is to close Firefox and restart.

3.
