I built a web search tool from flash instead of html. It's located on the right
near the top of the page. It works, but the mouse pointer doesn't change
(remains an arrow) and I never can get a cursor in the input field. Still, once
I click it I can input text and everything else work okay.
This problem doe not occur in IE6.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just try clicking the flash edit field. Nothing happens.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
no cursor in edit field and mouse pointer doesn't change for text.

Expected Results:
Should have blinking cursor in edit field and mouse should change to text bar
when hovering over typed text.

It's worth noting that with IE, my "Yahoo Personal Site Search" generates a
generic result page. Firefox however, correctly open my custom result page. I
have no clue why IE won't open it. I must assume that it's something to do with
how the two browser communicate with Yahoo's server. As I'm still learning
flash, any tip here are appreciated for getting IE to open the correct page.
The techno-weenies at Yahoo know even le than I do!
