Using Open All in Tabs (from right click menu) doe not work at all in Places for Firefox 3.0b2. Instead of opening all the tab from bookmark in a various folder of any size, only one, blank tab is opened alongside any currently opened tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click "Show All Bookmarks" or otherwise open Places
2. Select any folder with bookmarks, be it the toolbar or within the Bookmarks Menu
3. Right click to find the option to open all bookmark in tabs.

Actual Results:
Notice how only an empty, untitled tab is launched. If "Open All in Tabs" wa selected from the Bookmark Toolbar folder, then the launched empty tab replaces the currently open tab. If any folder of bookmark is selected, then the launched empty tab is placed alongside currently opened tabs.

Expected Results:
I would expect all the tab to be opened alongside currently opened tabs. Otherwise, at least prompt to replace open tab with the new one that are supposed to be opened. Right now, none of the "Open All in Tabs" are opened from Places.
