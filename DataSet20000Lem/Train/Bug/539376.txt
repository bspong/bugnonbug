A previous session is NOT restored after cancelling the "Firefox - Restore Previous Session" window (by clicking the upper right X).

Sometimes my computer crash or freeze while firefox is running (for whatever reason...this doe not matter....it is usually because too many other program are open). I often decide to force quit Firefox by using "Task Manager" to free up some memory. (You can open "Task Manager" by pressing the ctrl-alt-del key at the same time.)

When I restart Firefox the next time, I will get a pop up window with this message:
"Your last Firefox session closed unexpectedly. You can restore the tab and window from your previous session, or start a new session if you think the problem wa related to a page you were viewing."
And it show 2 buttons:
"Restore Previous Session" and "Start New Session"

This popup window is a normal and expected behavior of Firefox. So far so good...

BUT... If I close the window by clicking the X at the top right hand corner of the window, the previous session information is erased and a new session begins. (The reason why someone might want to close the window right away is because sometimes they can open Firefox by accident and they might not want to use it at that moment.)

But I gave Firefox no such instruction to start a new session. I never clicked the "start new session" button (nor did I click the "restore previous session" button either). When I close the entire restore session popup window (I do this by clicking on the upper right x.) it open up anyway (which is OK) but it start a NEW session and I lose all my previous session information.
In the option menu I do have the "restore previous session" option entered. So Firefox SHOULD open up with my previous session restored.

But it doe not.
So please fix this "bug".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Close Firefox in "Windows Task Manager" (press ctrl-alt-del to open "Windows Task Manager")
2.Restart firefox.
3.The "Firefox - Restore Previous Session" window should open. Close it by clicking the upper right X.

Actual Results:
Firefox open a NEW session and my previous session information is deleted even if the "show my window and tab from last time" choice is stored in "Options".

Expected Results:
Firefox either should not have opened at all OR
Firefox should have opened with the previous session restored. (This mean the window and tab from last time should be open.)
