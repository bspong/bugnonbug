places.sqlite showing the bug

If a user go to an RSS feed, show the preview and then add it a a Live Bookmark, the "Add Live Bookmark" dialog allows the user to add the Live Bookmark to the "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder. When this is done, no Live Bookmark display in this folder. If the feed url is subsequently visited, the location bar will show a star. If places.sqlite is examined, the Live Bookmark is found to be within it. It simply isn't rendering.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to http://ianmcdonald.livejournal.com/data/rss
2. Select "Subscribe Now" from the feed preview page (make sure the combo box at the top show "Live Bookmarks" for the subscription method).
3. In the "Add Live Bookmark" dialog, expand the folder list for "Create in:"
4. Select the "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder a the location and choose "Add"

Result: No Live Bookmark appears in the Unsorted Bookmarks folder but it is really there.
