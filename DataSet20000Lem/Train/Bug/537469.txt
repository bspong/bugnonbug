What happened to SHOW IMAGE??
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.1.6) Gecko/20091201 Firefox/3.5.6

You had one good tool that I tripped over. When attachment load a a page of image - and I do this often - they never finish loading before the browser time out, so I end up with a bunch of little square box and the image file name on the page. Till now I could always right click on the icon and say SHOW IMAGE and it would immediately go out and load that image refreshing the page. A pain considering it should have loaded in the first place, but a godsend since it didn't. The NEW Firefox that I wa forced to upgrade to changed all that. Now you right click and the menu show a "RELOAD IMAGE" listing which DOES NOTHING AT ALL. Just sits there and let you click it.

Oh and an aside, I STILL get that nuisance window when I use the back button on any compiled page. It's been three year now and that still isn't fixed. Lets hope you can figure this one out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.download multiple image attachment in GMAIL to a page
2.firefox quits downloading them before they all arrive
3.your new menu listing RELOAD IMAGE doesn't work at all
Actual Results:
I just told you. Read the description.

Expected Results:
See Above.

This is nothing special. Just a simple feature that worked on Firefox and someone screwed up in your last revision. Since this wa the workaround, there is no workaround now. For that reason it's a major feature problem.
