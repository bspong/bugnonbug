No session cooky are send when Firefox retrieves page when using View Source
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.8) Gecko/2009032609 Firefox/3.0.8 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Firefox will not send the session cooky when it re-downloads a non-cached page (no caching allowed or page is expired) when using 'View Source'.

This is related to bug report 466317. I agree with the write of that bug report that ideally Firefox will keep a copy of the page in memory (or disk) even it's not allowed to cache the page. This would allow the 'View Source' function to display the actual page being viewed. When Firefox re-downloads the page the server might present a different page.

But if it re-downloads the page, I think it should send the session cooky to the server otherwise the server might not be able to present a page at all.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit a page on a server which is not allowed to be cached and requires session cooky (i.e. shopping basket page in a webshop or a login protected page).
2. Press Ctrl-U to view the page source
3. A new request is sent to the server without the session cookies.
