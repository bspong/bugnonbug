URL is Mozilla "homepage". Offline, Mozilla close the window and msg "Not able to find server" pop up. I used to be able to minimize the URL page and view offline---now, Mozilla close it---what apain!
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.6) Gecko/20060728 Firefox/1.5.0.6

It's pretty simple! See above! This never happened prior to last download....After I'm offline, I want to be able to refer back to the 7-day weather forecast from time to time, but Server Not Found appears and the URL page is a gone-er! Now, every time I want to see it, I have to go online! HELP!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Connect online via earthlink total access.
2.Click on Mozilla Firefox...my URL should appear a homepage.
3. The toolbar reads, "Cannot Connect to Server." (URL page ha been deleted.)
4. Click on my toolbar to bring up the URL page.
5. URL page appears.
6. Disconnect earthlink total access, and minimize Mozilla Firefox.
7. Sometime later, while offline, I choose to look at my Mozilla Firefox homepage URL that wa minimized. Click on toolbar to maximize.
8. My Mozilla Firefox homepage URL is gone and the Mozilla Firefox window, "Server Not Found" is there!
9. I then have to re-connect online and re-select Firefox in order to view the homepage URL.


Actual Results:
Please see above! Actual result? I waste a whole lot of time!

Expected Results:
Please see above.

Software should have retained the Mozilla Firefox homepage URL for viewing indefinately (until such time a I close it.), rather than dumping the page! That's the way it used to function!
