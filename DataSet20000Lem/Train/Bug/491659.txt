I just installed update for a couple of my extension and after installing them the addon manager said "2 new extension have been installed". This should say that 2 existing extension have been updated. It made me a little paranoid and I had to go through my extension to make sure nothing had been installed without my permission.

It occurred to me that maybe these were extension that had been disabled due to computability, in which case I can understand how they could be considered to have been newly installed, although really a different message should be used in that circumstance.

Unfortunately, I can't test to verify whether it doe only happen with previously disabled extensions, since I have no control over when update for my extension are released. I see it a lot though, and I think I'd have noticed if most of my extension were disabled, so I think this probably happens every time an extension is updated. Again, I can't test it again a all my extension are up to date.
