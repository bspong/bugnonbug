Website display WIDE (elongated website), unlike all other browser

The CSS and website programming meet WC3 standards.
The web site is stretched horizontally to a point where the main content of the page is not visible unless you scroll completly to the right. Even when you scroll over, the image and layout is formatted abnormally. I can supply you with all source code so that you may take a look at the detail and direct programming to format the website.

This only occurs in the newest version of FireFox. My website display properly in all other browser such as: Opera, FireFox (2.0.0.20+/-), Internet Explorer, Google Chrome.

This pose a great threat to my website, considering alot of consumer find firefox to be the most reliable and flexible web browser.

ONLY the shop ha this type of problem. Not my other pages, just my shop.
