Showing version 2.x.x password when upgrading from v3.0.12 to v3.5.1

Using linux, decided to test out the latest official version of firefox 3.5.1, a downloadable from the firefox homepage. First impression wa positive, but quickly found out that the password been used appear to be very old one from I believe (purely from memory) the firefox 2.x.x days. Also any new password created in firefox 3.0.x do not appear at all under version 3.5.1. I have reverted back to my firefox 3.0.12 version, and all my password are back there, upto date and correct again. So it seems to me that firefox 3.5.1 latest official release is I guess obtaining password from some file which wa used in the firefox 2.x.x day but is ignored or superceeded in firefox 3.5.1.

This is quite critical, because it mean that version 3.5.1 in my opinion isn't an upgrade option.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Upgrade from 3.0.12 to latest version 3.5.1
2.Go into property and look at saved password
3.
Actual Results:
Saved password out of date - from old Firefox system, or any password created in 3.0.x do not appear at all.

Expected Results:
Should have shown the same password a in version 3.0.12
