I wa viewing 44mb log file in text format with 436,771 line some line with width of 300 chars. This file is pushed by IIS Server. Firefox wa very slow while viewing the page. Firefox crash while searching for a string in that page.

Once the file is downloaded completely, it wa quite fast. But when I open multiple firefox window/tabs, some time other tabs/windows look good. But often crash because of the tab with a page of 400,000 lines.

I tried with the latest nightly build, it look little fast. But it crash like 2.0.0.3r.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open text file with more than 440,000 line
2. Search for string in the page, scroll up & down.
3. Open multiple tabs(2 or 3)

Actual Results:
Firefox turn extremely slow.
Crashes often.
Task manager show firefox.exe hitting with 500,000 & peak memory usage of 600,000kb in 512mb ram system

Expected Results:
Should have optimal performance while viewing large pages. It should cache large file & make user view experience smooth.
