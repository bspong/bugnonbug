In all Firefox 3.5.1. ha been very slow in loading web page - see Firefox 3.5 slow a in S-L-O-W in support Forum. I have been having terrible trouble with it in particular loading secure login page using http (telegraph job sign in web page a an example - but not limited to). Looking at the error console I get various reeor line I get Expected declaration but found '*' Skipped to next declaration, lot of these line then Error in parsing value for 'display' then a number of other error to numerous to write.
The other thing that then happens is if I just close the tab by hitting X - it lock FF from loading the page of a new tab it just hang there. If I then exit out of FF and restart it again I get a message saying "an instance of Firefox 32 is still open, please try closing the window ..... etc
I have to go into task manager close down FF and then restart.
If I leave FF running trough the error after 10 minute the http webpage appears. If I run the same page in IE8 (64) the page load in a couple of second - really fast.

I have just upgraded to 3.5.2 released today and sorry to say I am still getting problem loading http web pages,
Note Minefield 3.6a1 pre also ha this http problem.

Over all not real improvement - in fact I believe 3.5.2. is worse a in addition the file drop down menu are slow to appear. I do not have this problem in IE8

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get an account in Telegraph job online
2. Go to the sign in page and try to sign in (https url)
3.
Actual Results:
error a described in detail i.e. just hang there for 10 minute and eventually load

Expected Results:
After signing in the page should load up your online account page - quickly

I am not the only one having these issue - especcially on the speed side.
I will file another bug report for the slow drop down menus, and not being able to restart firefox after closing unless I task manager it.
