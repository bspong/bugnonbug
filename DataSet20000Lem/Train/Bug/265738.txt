Unfortunately, this bug is not consistantly reproducable; it just happens every
now and again (probably about once a day under reasonably heavy load). When I
press a 'submit'-style button (recent example include the Chat Room under
http://www.rondaksportal.com/citizens/index.php3 and 'Go' at
http://www.kwiz.biz/showpoll.php?pollid=3902), the browser simply shuts down
completely, disappearing a if kill -9'ed. However, it happens rarely enough
that it doe not often happen twice with the same button.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Do lot of web-quizzes.
2. Keep pressing Javascript-style 'submit' buttons.
3. Eventually, the browser will close suddenly.

Actual Results:
Every day or so, the browser will close suddenly with no warning (taking all it
tab with it and all other Firefox windows) directly after pressing one of the
buttons.

Expected Results:
Taken me to the page containing the result of pressing the button.

I don't recieve any error messages; is there something I should turn on so that
I do?
