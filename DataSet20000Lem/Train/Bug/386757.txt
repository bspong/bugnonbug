Remove Firefox logo from javascript alert() sheet on Mac OS
The security alias get a steady stream of worried email prompted by scam security-software ad that put up an alert() or confirm() announcing that "we" have detected porn and/or virus and that the user should install ProductX to clean it up ("DriveCleaner" is the most common one lately, but they keep changing names).

Users on other platform get the same ads, of course, but we mostly hear from the Mac users. On MacOSX these dialog are "sheets" that slide out of our chrome like an infobar, and contain a big, prominent Firefox logo that seems to overwhelm any clarifying message we're trying to send with the "The site XXXX says" text.

Maybe we want to re-evaluate the dialog textual change that were made in FF2 ("The site at xxxx says...") and see if that's working on all platform (should it be bold? bigger? can we even do that given the frozen prompt interface?) and I think I saw another bug or discussion on that. But at the very least we should remove the prominent Firefox logo-of-approval from the mac prompt and replace it with platform-appropriate generic icon (or even nothing).

On window these dialog use the standard /!\ and (?) icon for alert and confirm/prompt respectively.
