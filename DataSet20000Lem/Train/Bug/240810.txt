Firebird's old Download Manager display in Firefox and it is impossible to close it.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko)
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.8

I noticed this bug while upgrading from Firebird (0.7) to Firefox (0.8)
Under Firebird, I downloaded Firefox, thus using the download manager (the
left sidebar, CTRL-E). I closed Firebird (leaving the download manager
active), and installed Firefox. I then launched Firefox.
At first, I wa really impressed, my prefs were conserved ! That's a nice
feature. But then I noticed that the download manager wa still there (as a
side-bar). I hit CTRL-E, and a brand new download manager show up, in a cool
window. Strange enough, the sidebar stays. I want to close it by clicking on
the 'cross' button but that doe not work. In fact, the only way to get rid of
the sidebar is to
1. close Firefox and relaunch Firebird
2. close the 'sidebar' download manager
3. close Firebird and relaunch Firefox
4. the sidebar's gone !

This is really a minor bug, but still, I'm sure it could annoy some people
