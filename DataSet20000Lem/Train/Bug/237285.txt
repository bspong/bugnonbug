specific image doe not load on page
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.23; Mac_PowerPC)

Several people using Firefox .8 on Windows 2000, and a couple on OSX, have
reported that when they view http://www.wested.org, the first large image in
hte blue area (New Product, Censorship in Schools - /imgs/home_feature1.jpg)
won't load. They say it happens nearly every time they view the page. If I have
the user empty their cache, the problem will go away for a while, but then it
will come back. There's nothing different about this image that I can see, and
I know that the users' browser are requesting the image correctly, because I
can see it in the log -

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page using Firefox in Windows 2000.
2. Maybe wait a sec if you don't see it, then try again.
3. It should happen soon.

The bug occurs with the default theme. The bug occurs both onsite and offsite.
The bug occurs on several different model of computers. I hope you can
reproduce it, because it's driving me crazy.
