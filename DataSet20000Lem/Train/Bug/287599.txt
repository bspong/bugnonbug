When I added from
http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html#central-engines the
following search engines:
# LEO - English to German translator
# IMDB - The Internet Movie Database
...then after once using them (no matter, which one), then after restarting
Firefox, were bookmark gone... But, if to open bookmark management - they are
there! Doublechecked permission and owner/group - everything were right (600
for right and user:users for owner:group).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. As root user, go to
http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html#central-engines and install
the following search engines:
# LEO - English to German translator.
# IMDB - The Internet Movie Database.
2. Open a user Firefox and use one of those search engine and close Firefox
after that.
3. After reopening Firefox, bookmark are gone... But if you open bookmark
management - they are still there...

Actual Results:
I loosed my bookmarks... If I didn't have backup, it could be big problem. But I
had backup :)

Expected Results:
Bookmarks should not disappear after using self installed searching engine!
