HTMLTooltip scroll is not working when using a XUL Panel wrapper
Follow up to Bug 1267403.

Context:
Devtools are now using a HTML implementation of a tooltip, which is supposed to replace the XUL panel for devtools. However, when hosted in a XUL document we try to use a XUL panel a a container for the HTMLTooltip, in order to allow the tooltip to extend beyond the devtools toolbox.

Issue:
When using a HTMLTooltip relying on a xulPanelWrapper, scroll will stop working unless the mouse cursor is on the XUL panel.

Setup:
When bug 1285189 lands, HTMLTooltips will no longer use a XUL panel wrapper by default. To reproduce the issue, you need to first enable it at https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/4764b9f8e6d4/devtools/client/shared/widgets/HTMLTooltip.js#l203

STRs:
- go to https://www.mozilla.org (for instance)
- open devtools/inspector
- expand markup node in order to have a scrollbar in the markup view
- click on the "ev" bubble next to a node in the markup view
- (event detail tooltip should open)
- make sure the mouse is not on the tooltip (some part of the tooltip are invisible, to be sure, you can keep the mouse on the "ev" element)
- try to scroll

ER: markup view should scroll
AR: nothing happens
