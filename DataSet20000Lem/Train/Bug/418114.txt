I wa working on a dhtml application and wa working with removeChild and copying/pasting. I noticed that this broke after the first time I hit the remove button. This wa in a table (removing a row) - I did an example using divs with the same result. (as seen in the provided URL)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Copy something on the provided page (highlight and ctrl-C)
2. Paste somewhere else
3. Click one of the "Remove" button
4. Highlight something else and copy again
5. Paste again - notice, it's the same a what wa in step 1.

Also, I noticed that when you right click on the selection, the copy function is greyed out.
Actual Results:
Copy function no longer worked until reloading the page

Expected Results:
It should have copied the highlighted text a expected.

I'm using the default theme, with no plugins enabled. I had to move my work to, gasp! IE to continue working on this project :( (where this work just fine)
