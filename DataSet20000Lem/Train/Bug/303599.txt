Deer Park ha problem if it insallled with NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation set to
1 in the Windows registry.

With NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation = 1, when DP is installed, a 8dot3 shortname
such a DEERPA~1 is not created. It seems that DP us 8dot3 in many places, a
I ran into a couple of problems. Software update would silently fail. I would
receive numerous error page on the first start of a new install (Bug 296916).

The only reason this bug made itself apparent is because DP installs into a
directory with space in the name ("Deer Park Alpha 2" for example). These
problem will also appear if a Firefox user installed Firefox into a folder with
space in the name.

While it may not be a bug, many many people have NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation
set to 1 for performance reasons. If this is determined not to be a bug, DP
should at LEAST give error message explaining what the problem is, because this
took literally month to figure out.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem set
NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation to 1
2. Reboot
3. Remove C:\Program Files\Deer Park Alpha 2
4. Do a clean install

Actual Results:
Bug 303598 and Bug 296916

Expected Results:
Not be dependant on 8dot3 notation, or at least print error message if and
8dot3 file cannot be found.

Run "dir /x" in C:\Program Files to see if an 8dot3 notation exists for a folder.
