Since I updated my Mac with the latest update from Tuesday, and Wednesday this week (Mar. 19, 20), Firefox becomes unresponsive after a period of time. This doe not seem to be linked to any particular URL, or to any particular action. Since I noticed it today, it may be related to the last update Time Machine and AirPort Updates. I did notice on one of my Macs (MacBook Pro) that installing this update changed the setting for Configure Settings to Access the Internet. I had to put it back to Auto-Detect. But, this did not happen on two other Macs. The hanging ha occurred on two of the Macs, and I have to use Force Quit to quit Firefox. Sometimes it doe not happen for an hour, and other time it happens every few minutes. Clearly, something in the update is conflicting with something in Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Let Firefox sit with multiple Tabs open. Perhaps site with auto-refresh may provoke.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox hangs. Need to use Force Quit to stop.

Expected Results:
