Bookmarks should open to the top of the list every time; otherwise it appears to scroll on it own.

After I click on "bookmarks" and I scroll down the list I leave bookmarks. When
I click on bookmark again, the bookmark menu seems to automatically scroll
back to the top on it own making me feel out of control of my computer. I
believe this happens because when I open bookmark again the 2nd time, it doe
not open at the top of the list. It open where I left off, and my mouse is
usually pointed at the up arrow when I reopen. Bookmarks should always reopen
at the top of the list, even in the same browsing session.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Scroll down more than one page through the bookmark menu
2. Select a link
3. Reopen bookmarks, and it will automatically scroll back to the top on it
own unless you move the mouse away from the up arrow quickly.

Actual Results:
The bookmark menu scrolled back to the top.

Expected Results:
The bookmark menu should have started at the top of the list the 2nd time I
used the menu.
