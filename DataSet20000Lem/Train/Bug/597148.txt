Web Console can cause script in the page to throw
STR:

0. Make sure you have the Error console enabled. (about:config#devtools.errorconsole.enabled)

1. Open the Error console.
2. Open www.robodesign.ro.
Notice no error are shown, nothing is broken.

3. Open the Web Console.
4. Refresh the page (F5 or whatever).
Notice all network request are nicely logged by the Web Console. Also, no exception are shown in the Error console, nothing bad.

5. Press F5 and quickly press Ctrl-Shift-K (the shortcut to toggle the Web Console), hold the key down or press them a fast a you can while the page loads. Rinse and repeat this step a few time (the refresh and quick toggling of the Web Console).

Expected result: the web page load nicely while the Web Console open and close like a beserk.

Actual result: the Error console shows:

Error: Cannot get outputNode by id
Source File: resource://gre/modules/HUDService.jsm
Line: 4621

Error: myAddEvent is not a function
Source File: http://www.robodesign.ro/js/index.js
Line: 1446

The first error is clear: it come from the window.onerror handler of the HUDService which is not removed and which try to show exception in the Web Console which is not open. This is bug 597136.

The second error is the point of this report: myAddEvent is not a function?? If you look in the JavaScript file, it's always defined. Why doe it break now? Why doe the code throw?

I once got google-analytics.com/ga.js to throw: Math.random is not a function (or undefined, I can't remember exactly, seen this only once). Weird.
