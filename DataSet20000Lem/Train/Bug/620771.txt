Firefox chrashed while starting up and shown the "Mozilla Crash Reporter" window. If I press "Restart Firefox" — it restarts and crash again. If I write a bugreport into that window and press "Restart Firefox" — it say "There wa a problem while submitting your report".

I ran Firefox with "-safe-mode" argument (BTW, it would be so nice for inexperienced user to have the "Safe Mode" button in the bug report window), turned off all the extension and wa turning on them one by one. Firefox crash again, when one of those extension is on: FoxyProxy Basic 1.8.3, Stylish 1.0.11 and Vimerator 0.7.3. Problem occurred after updating a part of the system (Gentoo GNU/Linux, it still run "emerge -e system").

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install one of those extensions: FoxyProxy Basic, Stylish or Vimerator
2. Restart Firefox
3. Get the segfault.
