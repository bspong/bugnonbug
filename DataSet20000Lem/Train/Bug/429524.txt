Using Yahoo Sitebuilder, I create a PNG file when I ask for text to be converted to graphics. This text/graphic is placed over a jpg image and render a white text over the jpg image. When I view in firefox it look good. When I print preview it look good. When I print to the printer, the png image print with white both inside and outside the text outline and the vector that make the edge of the text are transparent.

Is this problem with the PNG file or with Firefox?

I'll report it to Yahoo if I know it's the PNG file...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Yahoo Sitebuilder and place an image on any webpage.
2. Use text tool to place text over the image.
3. Change text property to "display a graphic" or "convert to graphic"
4. Once everything is setup you can press F12 to open/display the new page in (default) browser
5. Print it.


Expected Results:
Well, I guess if you can display the image correctly on screen then I think you should print the image correctly on paper.

For the record, IE 7 "ignores" the PNG image and print nothing but the image behind the PNG image
