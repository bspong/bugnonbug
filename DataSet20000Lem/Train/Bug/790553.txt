Increase the timeout when connecting to Firefox for Android from the Remote Debugger
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/21.0.1180.89 Safari/537.1

Steps to reproduce:

Entered the Android ip address and port, pressed OK. Then left the keyboard and went to the phone which wa a little bit away from the keyboard, and pressed "OK" to allow the remote debugger to connect.


Actual results:

The remote debugger had given up already and I had to restart the process again and be FASTER!


Expected results:

The remote debugger should wait longer because I only have two hand and two eyes, so I can't be typing in the keyboard and looking at the screen while looking at and holding the phone ready to hit the OK button a soon a the dialog pop up. The default allow user for only THREE second to react!

A brilliant demonstration of this come from none other than Kevin Dangoor, in the video that demonstrates the remote debugger. Kevin must have done that many time already, but still fails to connect to the debugger in the video because he take a little longer to hit the OK button:

I guess a safer default timeout should be 20? 30 seconds? I've manually set devtools.debugger.remote-timeout to 30000 (30 secs) and the experience is way more relaxed and le stressful :-)
