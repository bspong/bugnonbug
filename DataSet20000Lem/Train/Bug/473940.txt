A blank download manager appears download a second file. A first one had been downloaded successfully, showing a fully functioning download manager a well. The first file had been downloaded into a selected location different from the default location. The page where the download startet us some java script function (DHTML) and also popup windows.
The download manager ha had lost input focus between the two download actions, but had not been closed.
Closing and re-opening the download manager window did not fix the problem.
Anyway, the download wa completed. The downloaded file wa small and saved locally in virtually no time. Maybe, some timing poblems have prohibited the correct update of the download manager's window content.
