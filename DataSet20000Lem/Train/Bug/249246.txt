Installer Icons for FF+TB Cause 100% CPU usage in explorer.exe

Something seems to be wrong with the FF and TB Installer Icons
(FirefoxSetup-0.9.exe and ThunderbirdSetup-0.7.exe, a well a the .1 releases).

When browsing to a network share folder containing these files, the default
window application icon is shown (rather than the neater-looking installer
icon). CPU usage in explorer.exe shoot up to 100% for several minute until
the installer icon get properly generated/displayed. Once the icon are cached
by windows, this doesn't happen anymore (use TweakUI to clear Windows icon cache
to see this bug).

Interestingly, this doe not happen when the file are contained in local
folders. It only happens when they are contained in a network shared folder.

The icon display fine for FirefoxSetup-0.8.exe and the moailla*.exe series.

I have seen this on 2 seperate machines, on 2 seperate networks, on 2 seperate
OSs (WinXP & Win2k), so it's not something on my configuration.

This is a big problem for people such a myself who are trying to deploy FF+TB
in a corporate environment by installing the apps on multiple system from a
network share.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a folder on another machine in your network and share it.
2. Place FirefoxSetup-0.9.exe and/or ThunderbirdSetup-0.7.1.exe in the network
share.
3. From a different machine, browse to the shared folder containing those file
using Windows Explorer

Actual Results:
CPU shoot to 100% for several minutes, installer application icon are not
displayed.

Expected Results:
Installer application icon should be displayed immediately. CPU should not
shoot to 100%

Screencap coming.
