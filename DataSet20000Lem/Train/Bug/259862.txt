Firefox 1.0PR on Windoze 2000

This is the first version of Firfox/Mozilla for which this bug ha occured.

I have a Hushmail (www.hushmail.com) secure/encrypted email account.
Loaded 1.0PR from 0.93 on Monday, 9/13/04. I first uninstalled 0.93 b4
installing 1.0PR

To compose an email on Hushmail, a javascript app creates a small window
to compose email in. 1.0PR block this window and won't let me compose an
email under any circumstances.

When I put the 'compose' url into the 'allow popup' utility, it truncates the
url to it primary part, and not it full entry, e.g.:

enter: https://mailserver3.hushmail.com/hushmail/index.php.....
stores: mailserver3.hushmail.com

Even when I completely turn off popup blocking using
Tools -> Options -> Web Features
and completely restart the browser, clicking on 'compose' from my hushmail
menu still produce a message that this url is blocked.

Is there anyway around this?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open hushmail account.
2.Click 'compose' from menu.
3.Popup blocking message appears and composing is blocked.

Actual Results:
Can't compose email anymore in hushmail. ;(

Expected Results:
Clicking compose should allow a window to appear into which
you can compose an email message. This bug ha never occurred
for any other version of Firefox/Mozilla I have ever used.
