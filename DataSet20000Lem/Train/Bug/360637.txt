Hey All,

I've got some JavaScript code that ha stopped working with FireFox in version 2.0 Still work fine in 1.5.0.x line. I'm not sure where to turn to about this a it just a baffling issue.

I'm using the prototype library and the first attempt the script make at using the Object.extend() function it give me the error "Object.extend is not a function pklib.js Line 554"

While I would ordinarily think it wa a problem with my code, if you do a page refresh it work just fine.

Anybody have any idea what could be going on? Its like it ignoring some of the JavaScript while starting up.

To see the issue, go to http://www.epitunes.com/Music and click on any of the Play buttons.

The music player code also work everywhere else on the website where it is embedded into the page (not standalone).

Thanks for any idea you might have!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.epitunes.com/Music
2. Click on Play button (Launching popup music player)
3. Note javascript Errors
4. Refresh page and note there are no error

Actual Results:
Unusual error (Object.extend is not a function)

Expected Results:
No error on first popup

Again this code wa work fine with FF 1.5.0.x, not with 2.0.

A few people on mozilla.dev.apps.firefox have noted that these bug number may be involved: 343417, 355161

This sound like it could be caused by bug 355161, a regression in
Firefox 2 that is scheduled to be fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.1.

Hmm, it look like it is a regression in Mozilla then.
I'm getting a regression range between 2006-07-07 and 2006-07-08 on trunk:
http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsquery.cgi?treeid=default&module=all&branch=HEAD&branchtype=match&dir=&file=&filetype=match&who=&whotype=match&sortby=Date&hours=2&date=explicit&mindate=2006-07-07+05&maxdate=2006-07-08+07&cvsroot=%2Fcvsroot
and I'm getting a regression range between 2006-07-25 and 2006-07-26 on branch.
So that make it likely a regression from
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343417 somehow.
A simplified testcase of the problem in question would be very helpful here.
Also, I think you should file a bug about this.
