Bookmarks Manager when importing bookmark created a duplicate of a folder I
already had on the system rather than taking the two identical folder and
combining them into one. This is very problematic a I tried importing two
time to see if it would help and I ended up with three Bookmarks Toolbar
Folders so I can't delete the two extra due to the nature of the Bookmarks
Toolbar Folder.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmark Manager
2.Click on file menu
3.Choose import

Actual Results:

Expected Results:
Consolidated the folder into one each rather than duplicating my existing
bookmark folders.

I would like this bug to be tested on all version of Windows a I don't want to
end up with two Bookmarks Toolbar Folders on my Windows XP Pro system. I'm
using .9.3 of Mozilla Firebird on the PC I found this bug on.
