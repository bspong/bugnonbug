No Titlebar

I downloaded and am using firefox ver. 3 for the Apng editor. Somewhere, I have lost the titlebar, and can't find anyway to get it back.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have not reinstalled yet
2.Somehow I got the ElfWgps toolbar spyware thingy (Hijacked IE 7. Which I don't use.)
3.Tool Bar is gone. I have no way of getting back to it. I see the drop down menu items, but not the blue bar with the X, _, and square. I only have the one extension (APNG editor.)

Restarting, or otherwise, I can't get it back. I'm using 2 monitor with 2 different chipsets. I watch a lot of online video (Veoh, Bablegum, Joost, Miro.) and don't know what happened. I have run PCTools Spyware Doctor from Google Pack. I don't know what it removes, I get the popups telling me what I have and how to get rid of it every few days. Since I only use Firefox, I don't have anything to do with IE except to update my copy of Windows XP and don't trust anything that show up because of it.

Full spec of my system are posted here in HTML:

Actual Results:
I have had the new firefox for le than a month. I don't know what happened.

Expected Results:
Toolbar just disappeared 2 or 3 day ago. I don't know what happened.

Well, I should see the toolbar.
