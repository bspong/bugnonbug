Sorry, can't figure out to which component this belongs -- it's not just a location bar/autocomplete issue:

When a combo box or form autocomplete or URL location bar is currently dropped down, keybindings that the window manager would normally intercept, e.g. to switch windows/virtual pages, are stolen.

It is odd that these are the only time that they get stolen, and few other program exhibit the same behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find a textbox and invoke autocomplete, or simply drop down the location bar
2. press alt-tab or your window manager equivalent
3.

Actual Results:
nothing happens, or at best, the autocomplete window dissappears. No window switching or whatever, go on.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have done nothing. The keystroke should have gone to the window manager, and it would do whatever (eg, switch focus)
If focus wa switched, the firefox would have detected this, and ideally the drop down box should have retracted.
