Clicking "Normal (video only)" try to resize the window. THis doe not work
with the default setting in Javascript. This seems an important feature, to be
able to make the BBC player a small a possible, and made me view in IE so I
could see it a I wanted.

I would have thought this had been discussed at length in bugzilla, apology if
it has, cannot find anything on search.

Suggest that web-page spawned window can be resized by Javascript. I completely
agree that no site should be able to resize my own windows, but if the site ha
spawned it I am happy that it ha this control in this "sandbox" of it own
window. I argue that in this situation the user expects the site to manage it
own window, and a failure to allow this make Firefox look unprofessional.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to news.bbc.co.uk
2. Open the video console
3. Click "Normal (video only")

Actual Results:
Layout changes, window size doe not change.

Expected Results:
Window size change

I appreciate this is perhaps an opinion-based matter, and apology if it ha
been covered before, but IMHO Firefox appears incorrect to a user using default
prefs by not allowing what in a sense is a basic "web app" ability.
