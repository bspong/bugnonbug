Yahoo! Messenger is affecting the Firefox Browser.
When you log in to Yahoo! Messenger,
(and sometimes it will just happen again anytime while Yahoo! Messenger is open, doubling the effect),
a space appears above the Firefox Menu bar, making the viewable web page window smaller.

It may be a minor thing, but when you're playing online game and such, it can hinder playability somewhat by pushing part of the page down and out of view.

I have 2 example of this. The 2nd is what happens when it happens twice in the same session. (I have had it happen up to 12 time in a session, reducing the viewable web page to half the height of the screen.)

I am running the basic Firefox Browser, with no customisation.
