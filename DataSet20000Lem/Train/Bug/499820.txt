The URL history cannot be deleted, either by single URL or the entire history. This worked in the previous version 3.0.10.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit several URL's.
2. Go to the Location DDL and press the down arrow for the list.
3. Select any of the URL's by highlighting with the mouse pointer (do not click).
4. Press the "DEL" key to delete.
5. Repeat from step 2, and you will notice that URL still exists.
6. Go to the Options dialog and elect to clear browser history--no change.
Actual Results:
Any attempt to delete the URL history, either single or all, result in no change. There is no error message given. The function behaves normally, but the result is no change.

Expected Results:
The individual URL selected should be gone and not selectable again. And if the entire browser history is deleted, no URL's should show up in the Location DDL.

This wa not a problem in 3.0.10. It is not a major problem, but it ha a significant effect on the user experience. People wish to cleanse their browser of link no longer needed and so it is very annoying to be faced with them permanently.
