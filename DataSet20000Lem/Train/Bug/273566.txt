Memory leak when animated GIF used a background-image, even at idle

When an animated GIF is applied a the background-image of a DIV, memory usage
in Firefox is extremely high, even at idle. For instance, visiting this page:
http://www.couloir.org/flash/nonflash/index_ani.html , you will see anywhere
between 20%-60% memory usage at idle when running 'top' in the terminal. On the
same page with the animated background-image removed and all else being equal (
http://www.couloir.org/flash/nonflash/index.html ), memory usage at idle
decrease to around 1-2%, which is more normal. Safari can run both page linked
above with no memory leak at all.

This happens regardless of whether I'm running any of the specially optimized
build of Firefox (for the G5 or G4) or the plain vanilla version available for
download here.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a DIV
2. Add an endlessly-repeating animated GIF a the background-image of that DIV
3. Load in Firefox
4. Watch memory usage at idle rocket

Actual Results:
Memory usage increased from 1-2% at idle to 20-60%.

Expected Results:
It should have behaved a Safari doe -- very little memory usage at idle,
regardless of what type of background-image is specified.
