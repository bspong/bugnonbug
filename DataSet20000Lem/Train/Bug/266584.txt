default browser setting set the "open" action without ensuring that it's the one being used (avant browser stay default browser after "Set a default" in Firefox)

i installed firefox a few day ago. before that i used avant browser.
making firefox my standard browser (in "options") did not work. it say that
firefox is already the standard browser, but every application (e.g.
thunderbird, trillian) open avant browser for web links.

i think cause for that is:

avant brwoser creates a new standard action for url:http called "avantbrowser"
firfox only change the open action but doe not make it the standard action
same applies for http

making open the standard action again solved the problem for me

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install avant browser and make it the standard browser
3. make firefox the standard browser
4. open a web link in a mail with thunderbird
Actual Results:
the page will be displayed in avant broweser

Expected Results:
the page should be displayed in firefox
