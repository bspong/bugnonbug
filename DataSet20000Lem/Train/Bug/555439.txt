Whenever I open a tab to a web site with an RSS feed, the orange web feed icon appears not only in that tab, but in all previously opened tab a well. In addition, the icon appears in all subsequent tab that I open later, even for site that have no web feeds. Of course, I do not discover that the new site ha no feed until I click on the web feed icon intending to subscribe—and nothing happens. If I then open that same site in a completely new window, lo and behold: the icon is now (properly) absent.

In short, one web feed icon for one site on one tab indiscriminately "infects" both past and future tab opened within that same window.
