Firefox on Windows or Linux support complex Bangla Script. But in Mac OS X the script is not supported. Apple ha OS level support of Unicode using Apple Advance Typography (AAT) and provide specific library for the Developers to develop their Applications with them. Currently Apple is not supporting OpenType font and support only TrueType font with AAT 'morx' table. As a result, no OpenType font work with OS X and it applications. So, OpenType is not a recommended font format for Mac OS X. I heard that, Firefox is planning to adopt it own unicode rendering engine. If it doe not support AAT Mac user will be in same darkness. I think for Firefox Mac version Apples ATSUI a it a carbon application. Some open type AAT font can be found for Mac OS X at http://www.ekushey.org/projects/osx/

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just go to http://mukto.org/ or any other unicode Bangla or Hindi or any other complex site.
2.
3.

Actual Results:
No complex script support for indic language like Bangla or Hindi

Expected Results:
Proper Unicode rendering a seen in Safari or Firefox for Windows or Linux. Expect to see proper rendering with AAT font like Safari. Firefox team ha access to ATSUI libraries.

Please download font from http://www.ekushey.org/projects/osx/
