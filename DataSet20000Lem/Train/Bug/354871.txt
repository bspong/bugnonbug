having a text field with arabic LAM and hamza above Alef or hamza below Alef shift the position of the insertion of new character to some position diffrent than the position of the cursor, if you try to open the supplied link and try to add text in the middle of the first line, you will see it being added somwhere before the current cursor position, but on the second line, this doe not happen because there isnt &#1604;&#1571; or &#1604;&#1573; there. i suppose this is due to the diffrence between counting glyph and counting characters.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open link provided
2.try writing someting in the middle of the first line
3.

Actual Results:
the added text is added in a position before the position of the cursor

Expected Results:
text should be added on the position where the cursor is

im not sure this is limited to the &#1604;&#1571; and &#1604;&#1573; , there could be more sequenses causing this problem
