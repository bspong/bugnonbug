Address bar from one window may be made to appear a if belonging to another
Hi folks,

Not sure if you care, but in the default configuration, Firefox 3.6 on Win make it possible to hide the status bar and other essential chrome by apparently miscalculating the minimum permissible value for window.outerHeight. Try this:

http://www.example.com
javascript:void(window.outerHeight=1)

Jesse also mentioned that Firefox 4 deal away with the status bar. Both of these behavior permit several window to be almost seamlessly "spliced" together, so that a small window showing the address bar is shown on top of a partly obscured, aligned window that display content from another origin.

I previously put together a demo of this for Chrome (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/chsplice/); the same principle would apply to Firefox. The resulting document appearance is:

In Firefox, the attacker can also use focus() and blur(), which make more convincing attack with three window possible.

I realize this is a fringe concern, but it may make sense to tackle it at some point. Possible option involve graying out address bar for any window not currently on top, or at least sinking an initial click when a background window is brought into focus, so that the vector can't be used for a form of clickjacking.
