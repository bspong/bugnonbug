need a way to preview livemark feed before having to subscribe
There is currently no way to see what the heck you are subscribing to when you
select a livemark feed. For some site (eg, http://www.electoral-vote.com/),
it's not at all clear a to what sort of content is available in their feed. Not
to mention most feed are unhelpfully named "RSS". To simply just take a peek
currently, you must:

Select the livemark entry from the status bar icon.
Choose a name and location to add it to your bookmarks.
Click add.
Navigate your bookmark to the entry you've just created.
Open the livemark, look at the item titles.
If the title is ambiguous, select an item to see what actual URL is linked.
Navigate again through the bookmark tree to the livemark.
Right click and delete it, assuming you were just curious what wa available.

There need to be some way to preview a livemark feed. All that it need to list
is probably the title, maybe the image, and all items, including where they link to.

Alternatively, instead of a separate preview function, the livemark list in the
status bar could already be "live", such as:

[livemark icon]
\ title
\ (loading...)
\ item 1
\ item 2
\ ----------------------
\ subscribe to this feed

Or something like that. This might even better expose to novice user what the
heck that icon is for, a they would directly see the list of headline or
whatever content is being served.
