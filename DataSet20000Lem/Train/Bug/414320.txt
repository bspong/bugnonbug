Can't stream an ogg-file with my Java applet when I pas the URL with JavaScript
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/20071015 SUSE/2.0.0.10-0.1 Firefox/2.0.0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.8.1.10) Gecko/20071015 SUSE/2.0.0.10-0.1 Firefox/2.0.0.10

I have a problem with a Java applet that represents a sound recorder and player.

- I ran it on two different server running Debian 3.1 --> One of them show the problem, the other one not
- The problem only exists with firefox under Linux and Windows, not with IE, and not under MacOSX (even with firefox)
- The problem is independent from the JRE
- I went back to the initial version of Firefox 2, same probleme

The applet ha a method play(String url) that creates an instance from the class URL with the given string and us then the method openStream(). But openStream throw an AccessControlException. Now The very ugly thing: It only happens when I call the method play(..) from the exterior with JavaScript, e.g.:
<a href="javascript:document['soundrecorder'].play('http://java.s1.olefa.com/test.ogg')">Play</a>

If I pas the URL simply a a parameter like:
<applet .... >
<param name="initial_track" value="http://java.s1.olefa.com/test.ogg">
</applet>
if open the stream correctly although exactly the same method with exactly the same parameter is used.

I prepared two examples:
The first is the server that ha the problem with the JavaScript call, the second one doesn't have the problem at all. On both site are two players, the first with link "Play" is the one with the JavaScript call, the second on each page the one with the simple parameter. To see the exact exception message, take the first link, open the java console and click the link "Play" at the right of the first player.

http://java.s1.olefa.com << problem
http://java.s3.olefa.com << no problem

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the page http://java.s1.olefa.com
2. Open your java console
3. Click the the link "Play" at the right of the first player
Actual Results:
You'll see the Java exception in the java console and the file will not be played.

Expected Results:
The player should play the ogg file correctly
