PLEASE NOTE:In the above box Hardware Platform...I'm not sure what you need there?

I downloaded Rhapsody software 4.0 in order to download and share certain song on Facebook with friends.
Mozilla will not connect/play song properly with Rhapsody and Facebook.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login using Mozilla which take me to AOL webmail
2.login into Facebook
3.Click on the downloaded link/song in Facebook and it won't open the page that it should and play the song/link
Actual Results:
same a above with the addition that I use AOL webmail

Expected Results:
Rhapsody open a page with Mozilla, but it's not the page that allows the song to play a it should.

Once I click on the link/song in Facebook it should open another Rhapsody page that state something like Finding Rhapsody. But instead it open another Rhapsody page and it stop and say's done in the lower left corner of that page.
