I have blocklist installed, which mean that I have an extensive list of host blocked, which cannot be accessed. (Either via the host file or via the Blockpost plugin in Outpost firewall).
When I browse some web site (like the hotmail main page for example, the web page is full of these try again button a all the host (except the one I need) cannot be contacted. Pretty annoying if You ask me, FF 1.0.7 wa clever enough to put there a transparent image instead (or did not show anything).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Block some host in Your host file or firewall (look up a web page that us page from a lot of other web site, and block all except one).
2. Visit the web site while most of the host are blocked.
3. Enjoy the annoying view of FF 1.5.

Actual Results:
Page is full of Try again button and error messages.

Expected Results:
Not error messages, no try again buttons, just a transparent image (or just put there nothing ultimately rendering the background only).

If You don't want to build this into FF 1.5 a a default feature, it's fine with me (some user need to know about the errors). But then leave one option to force a behaviour that allows hiding these annoying messages, please.
Thank You!
