error on startup after installation
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Firefox/1.0

I get a number of error message when I try to start the new release of Firefox.
the error message mention something about an entry point.

I am using a PC compatible with a 1 GHz Athlon processor and 256 MBytes of RAM.
I have an 80 GByte hard drive with 10 GBytes available. I am using a DSL modem
at 256kbps, via a local ISP in Monterey, CA.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. install Firefox, standard options.
2. try to start firefox. error box come up, clicking "OK" brings up another
error box. These cycle and cannot be removed except by using Task Manager to
stop the process (takes several tries, too!).
3.

Actual Results:
I reinstalled Firefox 1.0 again, then tried again. No luck. Fortunately, I
still had a copy of Firefox 0.8 so I reinstalled that, then all wa well. Now
running version 0.8

Expected Results:
started normally. expected to have to reset the home page and possibly import
my old bookmark from version 0.8.

incidentally, I also expected the install program to tell me that it recognized
version 0.8 and give me the option to migrate my bookmarks. This did not happen
during installation.
