When going from http protocol to http I get a 'Connection Partially Encrypted'

Go the www.christmasnightinc.com click on a product and add it to the basket. This is done by clicking the big 'I want it' button. Then click on the green checkout button. This is when the 'Connection Partially Encrypted' error appears.
Using the Live HTTP Headers plugin I can see there is get request of...

http://www.google.com/uds/stats?r0=el%7Cjquery&nc=1282768604742_7685


Which I believe is the reason for the error.
All other request use the http protocol. I know the form that is submitted on the basket page set off back end processing that ultimately redirects the user the the https://www.christmasnightinc.com/checkout page.
I tried debugging this to see where in the process the GET request for the google stats url wa being made, and it look like a soon a the page is redirected the get call to google is made.

I'm having trouble figuring out if this is cache issue or just some weird bug.
I've tried multiple time clearing the 'recent history' of firefox, but who know if that actually get rid of everything.

Finally, another thing I'm noticing is that the 'Connection Partially Encrypted' error appears to be time sensitive. If you go to the basket and click on the checkout quickly the error occurs every time. If you wait a minute the error doe not occur. Very unusual and only occurring in firefox.
