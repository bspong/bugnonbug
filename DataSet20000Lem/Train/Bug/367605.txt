When starting Firefox with setting "When Firefox starts: Show my window and tab from last time" and then closing before all page have been completely loaded or possibly some haven't even started to render, some of the unloaded page are lost. Having a slow connection and lot of page make this happen very often.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use browser setting When Firefox starts: Show my window and tab from last
time
2. Browse and open tab you'd like to keep open, let's say 30 tab for example
3. Close browser
4. Start browser
5. Close browser before all page have been completely loaded or especially before some page haven't even started to render
6. Start browser again
Actual Results:
Some of the 30 tab that weren't loaded before the browser wa closed are now opened a about:blank.

Expected Results:
All 30 tab would have been opened properly, so that the address for not a single tab would be lost and browsing could be continued just a expected.

This bug ha been in Firefox since 2.0 betas, so it's not caused by any newly-made code.

The Camino implementation of session manager suffers from the same problem. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=361092.
