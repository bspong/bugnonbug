.js file referenced by page contained in iframes not loaded from applicationCache

an application using applicationCache to be accessed offline doe not work correctly if it ha a j file included in an html file in turn included in the main application page through an iFrame: the j file is not correctly loaded from cache even if correctly referenced by the manifest of the application; instead FX4 always try to load it from the server.

FX3.6, Chrome 9, Safari 5, Opera 11 don't try to reload the j file from the server (of course, unless the appcache file is changed)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open the test case
2. accept the offline caching
3. reload the page
Actual Results:
if you snoop the traffic on the reload you'll notice that script.js (the j file referenced in the html included in the iframe) is re-requested to the server.

Expected Results:
the script.js file is loaded from the application cache, not from the server

if you don't want to snoop the traffic I'll attach the testcase: deploy it on a web server on your machine, load it with FX4 then shut down the server and reload the app; you'll notice that the "executed" alert is not shown.

In those case I noticed that re-include the j file may convince FX4 to load it from cache (sometimes work sometimes not):
if (!checkThatTheScriptWasLoadedCorrectly) {
var scr = document.createElement("script");
scr.src = "script.js";
document.getElementsByTagName("HEAD")[0].appendChild(scr);
}


Also note that FX behave correctly if the j file is included directly by the main file: http://www.lightstreamer.com/temp/fx4_appcache/SIMPLE
