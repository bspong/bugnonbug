using different theme is a semi workaround, but then I like the firefox default
theme :-) so it probably ha to do with the theme, I would try and fix it
myself, but I am not into making theme enough, nor do I have time right now.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.make the userContent.css file, change the background like they show you how at
http://texturizer.net/firefox/tips.html#app_toolbarbackground
2.feel free to add a few more element that the style is supposed to apply to
3.start firefox and notice it only comming up with the background applied to the
"menubar" when it should be applied to several other places.

Actual Results:
come up with the background only applied to the "menubar" when it should be
applied to several other places.


Expected Results:
it should be applied to several other places. like
menupopup, toolbox, toolbar, .tabbrowser-tabs


changing theme is a little bit of a workaround (I tried 2 others, they worked
fine), but I like the default theme.
