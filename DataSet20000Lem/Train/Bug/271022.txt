If a window from an extension (or from a browser window that cannot be opened
from the sidebar without a specific extension) is opened in the sidebar, an
error will show up in the JavaScript Console. I have noticed this both in my
current profile, and in a new one. You may need to set
"javascript.options.showInConsole" to "true" in about:config for this to show up.

The error is a follows:

Error: searchBox ha no property
Source File: chrome://browser/content/browser.js
Line: 3330

And the line is:

searchBox.focus();

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension which allows you to open up a window in the sidebar
(Download Manager Tweak, EMButtons, QuickNote, etc.).
2. If not set up to do so by default, set up the extension to open up a window
in the sidebar.
3. Open up the window affected by the extension, which should now open up in the
sidebar.
Actual Results:
The error mentioned above is generated in the JavaScript Console.

Expected Results:
The error mentioned above should not be generated at all.
