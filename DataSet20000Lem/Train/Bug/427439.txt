When I click the Firefox icon, it take 45-90 second for it to actually appear on the screen. During this time my CPU use is 100% and trying to open other program will not work.

In my task manager, Firefox begin with a very small memory usage that increase incrementally until the browser finally opens.

I have preformed complete uninstalls and re installs including private data and have shut down every non OS vital process to try and find a software conflict - the problem remains. When I run the browser in Safe Mode, it take the same length of time, and after 45-90 second the safe mode dialogue box appears.

If I close Firefox and immediately re-open it it will open in approximately 5 seconds. If it ha been closed for some time or the computer ha just booted it up, the problem is present.

This also happened on Beta 4, it doe not happen Firefox 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Firefox will open after 45-90 second while taking up 100% of the CPU.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have opened immediately, within a few second of pressing the icon.

The bug occurs with the default theme with no extension installed.

I have a 1.7ghz Athlon 64 processor, 1GB RAM and an ATI Radeon X series video card, running Windows XP SP2 32-bit.
