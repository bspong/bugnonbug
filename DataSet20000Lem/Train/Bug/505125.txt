With multiple Tabs open Firefox stop responding at some point, unpredictable when

Have seen multiple time since upgrading to 3.5.1 where I'll have several Tabs open and then Firefox stop responding and nothing I do can get it working again short of going into Task Manager, and then trying to kill it cause it to spawn new processes, and it take many attempt to finally get it to kill it. Re-opening Firefox give me the pop up window asking if I want to restore all previous window and saying yes will restart everything and it will all work for a while and then just stop responding. It ha also done this on occasion when the PC ha been hibernating, though it isn't consistent. Before 3.5.1 I wasn't seeing this kind of activity. It is not something that happens when I go to a particular website, it just seems random, though almost always happens at some point when I have 4 or more Tabs open. I have 4 gig of memory and typically may only have Thunderbird running a well. I use AVG Anti-Virus and Zone Alarm, and am on a wireless connection with a Buffalo router.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just opening up at least 4-5 Tabs will cause it to happen
2.
3.
