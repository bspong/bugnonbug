I have noticed this on several different web site since updating yesterday, 4-23-09. When hovering over an <a> with a CSS hover attribute the mouse point flip back and forth between the pointer and hand leaving you unable to do anything on the page. Note it doe not seem to do on all CSS hovers. Example: http://www.mishawakacity.com/electricpermits.asp then hover over "Building" in the middle of the page. try it a few time then it happens.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to page: http://www.mishawakacity.com/electricpermits.asp
2. Hover over the "Building" a few time
Actual Results:
Mouse pointer is stuck in loop between pointer and hand and you can no longer click on anything.

Expected Results:
A normal hover.

I have the following addons installed:
ColorZilla 2.0.2
Firebug 1.3.3
FireFTP 1.0.4
PDF Download 2.1.0.2
