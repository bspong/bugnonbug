non-native fx2vr tab style out of place with common gtk theme
it probably isn't a good idea to use inflexible non-native widget style on tab on a platform that get a bunch of fairly different widget theme usually shipped and easily selectable by default, and where the default selection varies by distributor and the season

the environment ha a fair bit of tabbed apps, so the gratuitous difference in appearance is not very nice

theme a of fx2.0b1 replicates native tab style well, test and icon detail nonwithstanding (which I guess is fine), although the tab tend to be a bit undersized

fx2vr themed tab look out of place due to different hue in several themes, and in several theme spiffy detail especially on the selected tab are lost.

it's probably better to just use native tab style on gtk by default since that stuff work (which is awesome! and it's a shame to throw that away by default), and let the platform do the whole looking cool thing flexibly and relatively consistently overall since it can if we let it

screenshot us theme packaged in debian, overlap with theme shipped in an ubuntu dapper default install (where there are more) is >50%

Firefox 2.0b1 on the left, gedit 2.14.3 in the middle, Firefox 2006-09-01-04-mozilla1.8 on the right.
