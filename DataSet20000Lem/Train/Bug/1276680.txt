[Prerequisites]:
- Latest Activity Stream add-on version (1.0.18-dev) wa previously installed on a clean profile.

2. Open Activity Stream Timeline from the browser toolbar.
3. Scroll down the list until the next batch is automatically loaded.
4. Hover one of the newly loaded link and click the "X" button.
5. Click the "Remove from History" button.
6. Refresh the page and look for the removed item.

[Expected result]:

- The issue is also reproducible when removing bookmark from the Bookmarks tab.
- Attached a screen recording of the issue.
