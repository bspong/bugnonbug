www.mozillazine.org should be featured in the actual FF/TB UI for "non techies" to ask for help and offer input.

There is no "official" place for "Joe Public" and "Jane Browser" and "Pat Person" to just vent about an issue, ask for specific help and/or learn how to actually Beta Test, become a Developer, or get to be a Mozilla Guru.

This is a well established forum, and with a legit "official" moderator from the MOFO and the FF/TB Developer Team to "moderate and apporve" post for a possilbe "official" area, a great wealth of information for positive change could be had with only a litte lextra effort.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I have a problem or question.
2. Ask "Uncle Joe" or got to MSN. Somehow a Google pate appears.
3. See Bugzilla, and go back to Daily Soap Opera News, or if dilligent find Mozillazine.
4. Guest post and get a reply, and a lot of "attitude".
5. Ponder the moment.
6. Download IE8 and walk away.
Actual Results:
A possible PR opportunity is lost, a possible assistant is lost, and feedback in an informal mode is lost.

Expected Results:
USer is directed to place at Mozillazine moderated by FF/TB "officials", problem resolved, no dup bug opened, all happy.

Peace to all who follow the Red Dino! Soupport to all who worship it; respect to all who keep it going. :)
