Firefox crash when I pick Research:Fixed Income:CDs on Fidelity website
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008052906 Firefox/3.0

When I log in to the Fidelity website and choose to do research on CD offerings, Firefox crash either immediately or when I try to go back to the page that display my positions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Find someone there who ha a Fidelity account, a I am not going to tell you how to log in a me.
2. Choose "positions" on your account.
3. On the menu at the top of the Fidelity page, choose Research:Fixed Income.
4. When that page come up, choose FDIC Insured CDs
5. Firefox generally crash at this point. If it doesn't, go back to Portfolio Positions. Then it will crash.
6. This is new behavior in that Firefox 3.0 used to crash once in a while on the Fidelity website. Now it's almost guaranteed. IE ha no problem. I also didn't have this problem with Firefox 2.3(?), the previous version. Maybe Fidelity changed something, I don't know.
Actual Results:
Firefox crash and asks to send a report, restart, quit, etc. I sent a report once but am reluctant to send more due to the sensitive nature of what I am doing to cause the crash.

Expected Results:
Act normally.

Can I download a previous version of Firefox? I hate to have to run IE to get around this problem.
