Using ALSA, but it may be misconfigured any possible way, or not. Regardless, firefox 3.1beta2 is the first one which actually dy on popups and new window (like file>>new window), beta1 did not seem to suffer this one. Strace show that the child wait forever on sound which seems to be blocked by parent (as far a I remember, or vice versa, I try to freeze after I finished typing this), while parent get angry and try to terminate (with the active child in the way). SIGTERM usually help - killing off the whole FF shebang naturally.

(I did not find my report on that which I thought I've filed, neither find any possible duplicates, but you may remember them..)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF
2. trigger a popup, or open a new window

Actual Results:
Complete FF freeze (blocking on soundcard open)

Expected Results:
Opening the window nicely.

I'll try to get some stracing. If you need any data on alsa config try to be very specific, a I'm not up to date on any possible alsa config detail and the way to find 'em.
I have esd running, but I'm not supposed to use it. AFAIR it doesn't change anything, but now that you reminded me, I'll try that a well. (Shouldn't freeze, anyway.)
