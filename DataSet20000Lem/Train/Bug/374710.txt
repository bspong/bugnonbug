When using Firefox 2.0.0.2, and the update to 2.0.0.3 wa downloaded and applied, the update failed with the following error message "One or more file could not be updated. Please make sure all other application are closed and that you have permission to modify file, and then restart Firefox to try again. this window ha only an OK button. Click OK, and the entire process start over again with the same results.

I am the administrator of this stand alone PC and have all administrator rights. Same result if I try the update from Windows Safe Mode.

I un-installed Firefox and tried to load from the complete version 2.0.0.3 download and got the following error message: "Error opening file for writing: \r\n\r\ncomponents\r\n\r\nClick Retry to try again, or/r/nCancel to stop the installation."

Had to restore my hard drive to get Firefox back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just repeat the above.
2.
3.


Expected Results:
same result

The error message should tell the user what is going on or make the instleer overcome these problems. The second error message with the /r/n/r.... tell the User nothing!
