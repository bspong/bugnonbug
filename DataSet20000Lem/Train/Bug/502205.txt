I tried the Private Browsing Mode entered one site in the adress panel of the tab where the information about the Private Mode is shown... some minute later i ended the Private mode and the normal Session wa not correctly restored.

So i tried to login on my site but the Passwords where not available.
I looked in the Password Manager but it wa completly Empty so i restarted the FF 3.5.

Same Problem Password Manager still empty.

So i tried to import all password that i have yesterday exported with FF 3.0.7 (because of Bug "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=496731")

The Counter in the Import Function doe not show that is anything imported but it say that he completed the import.

I looked again in the Password Manager an it wa still empty

I closed FF 3.5 and deleted the signons.sqlite from my profile and restartet the FF 3.5

Now the Passwords are correctly imported. But not all of my passwords, i think that problem that not all is imported depends on "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=496731"
