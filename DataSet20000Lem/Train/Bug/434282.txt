I open up firefox 3 on either XP or vista and my resource usage go from my normal 17% all the way upto 96%. And believe me when I say that I have over 2 gig of RAM on all my computers, seems to me that Firefox 3 is constantly "dumping" And it messing up other process on the computer when this happens especially with Internet explorer running (I recommend you don't try to use or run I-explorer unless you like constantly restarting your computer) I don't know how else to explain it but that's what happens. BTW I really wouldn't let other people know about this because a soon a your computer start to freeze on you I notice that some file tend to disappear including security files, and that might cause a panic if people know about it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox normally.
2.start Internet explorer normally.
3.Watch resource monitor if you have one, then take note on how crazy it goes.
Actual Results:
my resource are eaten up like crazy, and I can't do much on my computer besides wait for it to eventually respond to my commands.

Expected Results:
run smoothly is what the software should have done but it doesn't.

None that I know of.
