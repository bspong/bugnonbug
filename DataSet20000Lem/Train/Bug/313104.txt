I have downloaded 'Mozilla Rich Text Editing Demo' from
www.mozilla.org/editor/midasdemo/. I have added text in text editor and then
added image in the text. The cursor freely move over the text by arrow key
'left' and 'right', but cannot move over the image. I have used version (1.0.2,
1.0.6). I have also tested Thunderbird version (1.0.7). Thunderbird have the
same problem in the mail compose window.
But when I used version (1.5 Beta 2) this bug wa solved but not correctly.
The cursor moved over the image and one letter in one step. If behind the image
there is no even one symbol a mistake repeats.
