The width for input text box is lost, thus all text box show the same length.

The URL point to a ASP.NET(C#) web application.
Text input box in this application's web form is defined in aspx file using below forat:
<asp:textbox id="orgName" runat="server" Width="300px" MaxLength="255">
When browsing using IE, the width attribute is effective. When viewing source of the web form, we see
<input name="orgName" type="text" maxlength="255" id="orgName" style="width:300px;" />
When using firefox, the width attribute is missing. When viewing source, we see:
<input name="orgName" type="text" maxlength="255" id="orgName" />. Because of this, all text input box show same length, which make a web application very ugly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.login to my web application(the URL above), using test1@tgp.com password is 1234
2.start a form, or edit existing ones.
Actual Results:
See all the text box are of same length. While in IE they are pretty.

Expected Results:
Text box are set to very different values. They should vary in length.

My guess is this is particulary happending to ASP.NET web applications.
