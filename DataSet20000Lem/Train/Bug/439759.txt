I'm working with Fedora 9 without problem till short ago.
Some day ago (probably after some update) flash plugin stopped working in Firefox.
Firefox 3.0b5 act exactly a if the plugin wasn't installed (it doesn't appear in the plugin list and page with flash claim to need the plugin).
The plugin is correctly installed, through the rpm flash-plugin-9.0.124.0-release.i386 from base Fedora repository.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open the plugin list (from Tools>Extensions)
3. See that flash plugin doesn't appear in the list
4. Open any page that need flash (for example www.pcbox.es)
5. It will ask for installation of the flash plugin.
Actual Results:
- Flash plugin doesn't appear in the plugin list
- Pages that need flash ask for it, a if it wasn't installed

Expected Results:
- Flash plugin appears in the plugin list
- Pages that need flash work correctly
