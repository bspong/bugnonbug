Selecting to a link on Blue's News and then selecting to go Back to Blue's News
doesn't return the browser to the displaying the same portion of the page.
Going Forward and then Back again will return the browser to displaying the top
of the page.

This ha been seen on other site a well, but I don't remember exactly which
ones. Firefox 1.0.4 and IE do not have this problem.

of the page.
