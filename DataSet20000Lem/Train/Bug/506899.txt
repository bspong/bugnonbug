on www.flasmar.com, main page, the short tittle of Featured product move right and description move on top of where tittle should be. You can check easily the different behaviour on short name (as Hornet, RKB R2, Neo or Sirius) with the other longer name products.
On previous version of Firefox or on IE8 it show correctly, so there is something you changed from 3.5.0
