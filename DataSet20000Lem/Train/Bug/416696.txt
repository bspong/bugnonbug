Currently Firefox 3 nightly have the option to "always do this" when you restart the application. However, I would like the option to be able to have independent choice for add-on and a normal restart. For example, I always want my tab restored when I install and add-on, but I would like to keep the choice of whether to restore when I do a normal exit. Currently if you tick "always do this" then firefox will always restore my tabs, whether it an extension or normal exit.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install and add-on, or do a standard exit and save tab
2.Tick always restore my tab
3.Tabs are restored on restart for both add-on and normal exit and save.

Actual Results:
Tabs are always restored on either and add-on or standard exit.

Expected Results:
Independent choices, so I can tick always restore my tab when I install an add-on, while still preserving the choice on whether to restore my tab on a normal exit and save.
