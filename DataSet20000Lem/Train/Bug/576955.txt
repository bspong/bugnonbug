Massive memory leak

I wa doing a number of thing at once when I found my computer running slowly. This shouldn't be happening, I thought, I bought a hexacore for goodness' sakes. So I ran "top". It reported that Firefox wa using a massive 2 GB of virtual memory and 1 GB of resident memory. I have 2 GB total so that is quite concerning. I had about 10 tab open, in which most were just blank (I have problem connecting to the Internet). I'm not sure what the problem was, I had no extension installed at the time, and I'm having a hard time reproducing it. I wa doing a CPU-intensive task at the time, but it didn't use up a lot of memory (running make -j6) but that shouldn't have locked it up. Additionally, I found desktop responsiveness drop to an all-time low, and my mouse wa frozen for a few seconds. Possibly it may have been a problem with the Flash plugin.

It could be the same thing but Firefox occasionally just crash now with no error I can find. Does it log error to a file I could attach?

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce




Default Firefox, version 3.6.6 from the 64-bit Ubuntu repositories, with 32-bit Flash 10.1 installed via the "Click here to install plugins" manager (which incidentally run video but then doe not accept click in those videos).

Severity critical because the software hang and crashes.
