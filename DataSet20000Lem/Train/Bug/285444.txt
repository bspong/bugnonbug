If I have a textbox, for example, in a table and I type in some value and go to
another page and come back, then the textbox will be blank. However once I put
the table in a form then the value is retained when coming back to that page.
It also work fine if the input control is not in a table or a form.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. copy and paste this code to see simple example

<html>
<body>

In a table in a form:
<form>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><input type=text id=text2></td>
</tr>
</table>
</form>

Just in table:
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
<td><input type=text id=text2></td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>Not in form or table:<br>
<input type=text id=text1>
