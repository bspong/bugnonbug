params added nsISearchEngine::addParam() are sometimes forgotten after a restart (especially for engine added without icons)

When a search engine is created using addEngineWithDetails and no or an invalid icon URI is specified, the parameter added later using nsISearchEngine::addEngine for this engine are not serialized to the file. This means, that the created engine only work until Firefox is restarted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. execute this javascript code with privilege (from j console or something):
var iconURL = "";
/* var iconURL = "http://www.google.com/favicon.ico"; */
var s = Cc["@mozilla.org/browser/search-service;1"]
.getService(Ci.nsIBrowserSearchService);
var name = "Google 2";
ss.addEngineWithDetails(name, iconURL, "", "", "GET", "http://www.google.com/search");
var addedEngine = ss.getEngineByName(name);
addedEngine.addParam("q", "{searchTerms}", null);

2. try the newly created engine, see that it work
2. restart Firefox
3. notice that the engine doe not work anymore

(check that this ha something to do with the icon:)
4. delete the engine
5. execute the above code again but with the first instead of the second line commented out
6. see that the engine work even after restarting a hundred time
