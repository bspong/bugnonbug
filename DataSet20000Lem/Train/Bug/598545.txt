My browser is not loading site that constantly update, such a Twitter, Facebook or Gmail, although Gmail doe load in it html version. The browser say "Done" in the bottom left corner but the status bar in the bottom right never quite finish and the content is missing (in both Twitter and Facebook the bar along the top with some option did load, but the main content did not, with Gmail it just said that it wa loading my account and never did).

I also cannot scroll using the scroll pad in my laptop mouse, even though it still work in other programmes, and I can't change tab by clicking on the tab top, I have to use Ctrl+tab.

I have also just noticed that when I try to close smaller dialogue box (for example the one that appeared when I clicked "Help" -> "Search for updates") they do not close. Nor will the "Do you want Firefox to remember this password?" drop-down disappear, even after clicking "Not now" and the X.

Reproducible: Always

1. Try to go to www.facebook.com, www.twitter.com, or www.mail.ncf.edu

1. Go to any website
2. Use the scrolling part of laptop mouse
3. Make a new tab and try to change back to the old one by clicking on it title
4. Notice that neither work
Actual Results:
As described above

I am using the default theme, I have a persona loaded, still happened when I disabled the persona extension.
