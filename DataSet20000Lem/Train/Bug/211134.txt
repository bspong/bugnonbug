When I go to File > Print, the print dialog come up with the option to print a
specific range of pages. I propose that this range be pre-filled with "From: 1
To: 1."

On a personal level, 99.999% of the time I have used the print range option in
order to make sure I only print the first page of a web site, a a lot of the
time I get a second page with unwanted, overflow graphic and such.

I am willing to bet that 97% of the time, the general population wish to start
the print range at the first page anyway, so this prefilling would be at least
half right in many cases. (how often do you print page from 5 to 7?) The
general user would then have to only replace the "1" in the To: field if they
wanted to print more pages, and they would be all set.

Internet Explorer 6 prefills their page range with "1," and I have found this
useful.
