Huge Firefox Memory Leak Overnight...
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b2) Gecko/2007121120 Firefox/3.0b2

I only had two tab open, one which wa Google homepage, the other wa my webmail via Juno ... The max memory consumption during my 8 hour of continued use wa no more than 33mb, which is great. I went to bed, and when I got up, I came to see that Firefox memory consumption had jumped from 33mb, to more than 337mb in memory usage, simply when I wa sleeping and no activity wa going on my pc at that time.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
Haven't tried to reproduce yet, but will update this tomorrow if I get the same problem overnight..



I have no extension other than what's the default DOM 1.9b2, and default Firefox theme.. I have a few snaphots of task manager to show how the memory use is not only excessive, but continues to grow even when Firefox is currently idle.

As you can see (if my image go through) the memory climb from 301mb, to 337mb in around 30 seconds...
