While on HUFFINGTONPOST.COM, a political blog, the browser crashes. Sometimes it crash on startuP. Almost exclusively though, this behavior appears when clicking to different article either within the site itself or linked outside the web site elsewhere.
After closing out of the bad window and re-starting Firefox into the browser window that had displayed the problem, this behavior would repeat itself. After trying to get on to this site again for several times, I am able to, but clicking to other site and article repeat the behavior. This behavior doe not routinely occur when starting from other site or browsing on other web sites, but it can occur but not a frequently. Sometimes browsing is normal for a little while. The frequency of spinning around the site most certaibnly increase the chance that FF crash once more.
It is rather rudely apparent on HUFFINGTON. Lots of video and medium link and ad etc;;
