When I enter http://futurebeacon.com/ into the URL window, the browser go to http://americanfreeenterpriseparty.org/ instead. When I enter http://www.futurebeacon.com/ into the URL window, the browser go to the correct address. The inclusion of the www is oddly required. http://americanfreeenterpriseparty.org/ is a URL I frequently go to.

Thank you for your help.

http://americanfreeenterpriseparty.org/ is a URL I go to often.

The browser should go to the URL placed in the URL window.

This anomaly is absolutely consistent and repeatable.

This adversely impact upon the value of futurebeacon.com if there are many people who use this browser in OSX.
