After a few hour of using the browser, using multiple tab and a couple plugins, the browser UI itself fails to refresh correctly. The entire top navigation bar is wiped out and left with whatever wa on the screen before when changing windows. The button "Next" and "Back" a well a the location bar and "file/Edit/View" option are unrefreshed.

In some case mouse-overing the button or clicking the buttons/elements refresh them, but this go away when another window is brought to the foreground.

Just recently, the browser wa still generally working after this refresh issue, but youtube video would only play for a couple second and then stop, might be related.

The problem persists after completely killing the firefox process (and also when closing it normally) and restarting the browser, it doe not persist through reboots.

I attempted to get a screenshot, but for some reason the paste option fails with "Error getting the clipboard data!" when pasting into MS Paint, might be related.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run browser for a long time with lot of open tabs.
2. ???
3. Fail ;)
Actual Results:
UI fails to refresh correctly

Expected Results:
The UI should have refreshed correctly.

I did have this problem when using the Beta version, I wa hoping it would be fixed in the new version. Alas, my slackness ha paid off.

I am using the following plugins:
FoxyProxy 2.7.5 (wasn't actively using this when trouble occured, the issue also occured before I started using this plugin)
IE Tab 1.5.20080310 (not actively using this plugin when error occurs)
NoScript 1.6.9.3 (I use this one all the time)

I'm setting this to Major because it make the browser all but unusable every time it happens, but no data is lost.
