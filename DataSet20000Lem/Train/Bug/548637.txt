This is a random occurrence. This product version loaded yesterday. On large pages, text panel (at washington post, Reuters, bugzilla error report page), the page load normally. If user scroll down and stops, the page scroll normally, then jump (can happen several times). The jump is a few line up or down, but make reading very, very difficult. This ha to be new behavior, surely I would have noticed on previous version had it occurred. At first I attributed this to new element being loaded, but have seen it after several minute on one page.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.goto http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,679980,00.html#ref=rss
2.wait
3.
Actual Results:
page jumped several time. The interval between jump increase (they get further apart)

Expected Results:
Page should have stopped after loading (I think). It should move in response to scrolling. With no scrolling, the display shouldn't move randomly up and down.

Still better than IE, but not a good a FF 3.0 or so.
