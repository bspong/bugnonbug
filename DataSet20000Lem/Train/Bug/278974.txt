Home Page GROUP is not saved after closing. Always reverts back to random single home page

In Firefox 1.0 under Linux (Slackware) when I try to set a home page with a
group of pages/tabs ("use current group"), I go through the process and when
closing Firefox and reopen it the home page setting have reset back to a random
single page. If I set the home page a a single page (any page) OR a blank page
and close and reopen, the setting are kept correctly. Problem is obviously only
when saving a home page a group. The problem can be duplicated indefinitaly.

I have tried to reinstall Firefox multiple time with and without the Mozilla
Suite installed (1.7.3), I have deleted and created multiple new profiles, both
for Root and for a normal user, I have removed ALL trace of anything related to
Mozilla/Firefox in the Linux box ( in case some old profile wa "hidden"
somewhere), and problem still appears every time. The Mozilla Suite is NOT
affected (in my case).

Any other information you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.

Thanks and keep up the excellent work!

notice it before installing any other theme and working just wiht the default one.
