If the user attempt to move a Bookmark to a sub menu (folder) using drag & drop
and the drop down Bookmark menu, but instead cancel it by moving the mouse back
into the Bookmark menu and releasing the button, and then click on any bookmark
before the sub menu (folder) closes, the sub menu (folder) will stay open.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a Bookmark and a Folder.
2. Open the Bookmarks menu.
3. Click and hold on the Bookmark to begin the drag & drop procedure.
4. Drag the Bookmark into the created Folder, but do not drop it there. This
will open a sub-menu containing the Bookmarks, if any, in the Folder.
5. Drag the Bookmark back to it original location.
6. Quickly drop the Bookmark and click any Bookmark before the Folder sub-menu
closes.
Actual Results:
The Folder sub-menu will remain open even though the Bookmarks menu is closed.

Expected Results:
The Folder sub-menu should have closed with the rest of the Bookmark menu.

This occurs with both the Default theme and the Luna theme.

It is (relatively easily) avoided by waiting until the Folder menu close before
clicking on a Bookmark.
