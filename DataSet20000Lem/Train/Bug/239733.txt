Font type selector too small
User-Agent: ELinks/0.9.CVS (textmode; Linux 2.6.4 i686; 128x48-3)
Build Identifier: Mozilla FireFox 0.8 csCZ, ftp://ftp.czilla.cz/mozilla/F0.8/

The "font type" selector in Fonts Preferences (I mean the serif / sans-serif etc
drop-down box) is too small, resulting in something along the line of "Ser..." /
"San..." shown in the Czech localization. I think this is rather a general
problem than problem with the localization (or is it their fault and should I
report it to them?).

It is possible to guess which one is which (if you know what exactly are you
looking for, therefore probably NOT for a newbie user, though), but it is kind of
embarassing when you show the browser to a friend, and it's annoying and
confusing too.

While at it, it would be nice to have the preference box resizable, but I guess
this might already live a another bug, or I should file it seperately anyway (if
I cared enough ;-)...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Preferences dialog (General section pre-selected)
2. Click at the "Fonts setup" button
3. Watch the horror




I used the default theme, stock Windows 98 (Czech localization a well, but that
shouldn't matter) etc.
