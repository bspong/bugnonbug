with SWF files, when wmode=transparent, tab respond to hover, but not click, and won't close
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.4) Gecko/20070515 Firefox/2.0.0.4

I have now been able to reproduce this with three different flash SWFs of various size (dimension and file).

When using wmode="transparent" for a SWF file, part of Firefox become completely unresponsive. Mouseover still work (tabs are highlighted a I move around, bookmark and toolbar button do a well) but click do not register on the tab themselves. Clicks on toolbar button are fine.

This includes closing the offending tab, a well. The red X highlight on mouseover, but doe not respond on mouse click.

The only way to close the tab is to right-click, wait for a short delay until the context menu appears, then Close Tab that way. After doing so, the previous attempted click happen at once, a if Firefox had been held up and the gate were released.

Removing all Actionscripts and/or modifying the file produced no results. The only solution wa to remove wmode="transparent".

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create flash file of any dimension and complexity
2. create an HTML page and set wmode="transparent" in the embed and object tag
3. open a few tab in firefox to any web page
4. open newly created html page in firefox 2.x and try to click any other tab
Actual Results:
clicking other tab doe nothing. clicking red X on any tab also doe not work. clicking bookmark and toolbar button work fine. to close tab (and get firefox to respond again) you must right-click the flash tab and go to "close tab". all previous click were captured and now bubble out at once.

Expected Results:
allowed me to change tabs, or close tabs, using the normal interface.

wa able to reproduce this on four machines, so i do not think it wa build specific.
