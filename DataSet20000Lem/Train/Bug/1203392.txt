Shutdown/Startup hang after setting privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown=true
I accidentally set privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown=true in my "main" profile (I thought I wa in a test profile but forgot -no-remote - doh!). After shutting down Firefox, the Firefox process refuse to die - it's been sitting there chewing 100% CPU for 15 minute now. If I kill the process and restart it, I see a new window but nothing is loaded and the process again sits on 100% CPU without working. If I kill *that* process and restart I am told it will be started in "safe mode" and I see about:sessionrestore open - if I hit "restore" it again sits on 100% CPU without opening anything.

If I run with -console, I see the message from bug 1183435, but it's not clear if this related.

The end result is that Firefox seems completely broken for me - nothing I could do would make it work. Fortunately I thought to start with -console, found bug 1183435 and realized that preference is the problem - but only after I restored my profile from a backup. A normal user hitting this problem would simply be left with a completely broken Firefox.

I still have the profile.

[Adding "dataloss" keyword a it make the profile seem completely broken - an advanced user might think to try deleting the profile to work around the problem, which loses everything in that profile]
