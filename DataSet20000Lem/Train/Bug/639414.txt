Problem script with google chrome and firefox when i start mozilla lab TEST PILOT
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b12) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b12
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:2.0b12) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b12

When i opened firefox, Mozilla Labs TEST PILOT started, but it told me than the script wa already used by Google Chrome (I wa using Chrome before), then it tried to open "chrome://testpilot/content/welcome.html", then the page started to open just a bit, and i never could try Mozilla Labs TEST PILOT.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Google Chrome installed before on my computer
2.Install and Open Firefox 4.0 Beta 12 (Mozilla Labs TEST PILOT is integrate in there)
3.Mozilla Labs TEST PILOT will start and it will never completely load the page Mozilla Labs TEST PILOT
Actual Results:
page of Mozilla Labs TEST PILOT not completely load

Expected Results:
A window opened told me than the script wa already used with google chrome !

I went to "https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/" to tried to install Mozilla Labs TEST PILOT (who supposed to be installed already), i restarted firefox, and i tried again to start this link : "chrome://testpilot/content/welcome.html"

And it worked (weird than i can open link starting by chrome://...)!!!!!!

Then i think the problem come from Mozilla Labs TEST PILOT who already installed with Firefox 4.0 Beta 12.

PS : Sorry for my english, im french ^^
