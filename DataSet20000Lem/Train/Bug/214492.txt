Hi, first of all.
Nice thing you did with Thunderbird.

Enough of this, to the point..
I am trying mozilla for the first time, and I am quite happy with the results. But:
The homepage
http://tng.kicks-ass.org/board/
ha still to be loaded by my poor old IE.
The problem, my Thunderbird isn't loading all pictures. Most of them appear a
broken links, (but they do work!) and for example smiley in thread are not
displayed at all.
And .. in mozilla, I miss the function IE provides, Show picture.
IE doesn't open a new window for the pic, it just load the broken link on it's
current location. Mozilla open a new page for the picture..

Btw, i don't use any proxies.

cheers, UNI

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just load the Homepage http://tng.kicks-ass.org/board/
2.
3.

Actual Results:
see for yourself, page isn't willing to load image

Expected Results:
Show me some smileys, thread symbol etc.

The problem can be fixed by viewing every little picture first and then reload
the page. That is a workaround, but no excuse for this .. bug :(
