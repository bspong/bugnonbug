FF.exe I see it in the task manager and ha no window. I can use a session and there will be multiple ff.exe, but when I close them there is always one left over which can not be closed or killed. Is the same after I restart the computer. Tried to use Add/Remove program through Control Panel, but it will stop every time and tell me I have to close FF before I uninstall. Catch 22 - Can't close it can't kill it can't uninstall it. No other program hang or is un-killable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.shut down or restart computer
2.open add/remove program to uninstall FF
3.will not uninstall and say to close FF first, can not close or kill from task manager
Actual Results:
Just did (see above/previous discription)

Expected Results:
Should be able to close FF, should not have FF.exe open without a corresponding window, should be able to kill FF.exe, should be able to uninstall FF.

Should be able to close FF, should not have FF.exe open without a corresponding window, should be able to kill FF.exe, should be able to uninstall FF.
