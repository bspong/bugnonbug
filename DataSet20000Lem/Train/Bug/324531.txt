When Firefox window is resized below 4cm width bottom right hand corner resize grip disappears, firthermore cursor doe not change behaviour (change into arrows) when over the right side of the window allowing to resize it.
Only vertical resize is allowed.

- mouse cursor should display arrow to allow window resizing when over window corner and side

Bug occours also with default theme.
Display setting is 1024*768
