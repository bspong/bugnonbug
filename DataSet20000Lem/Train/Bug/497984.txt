Hi,
I have firefox.app on a server. I have mounted a share where firefox.app is located on the client machine.
When I double-click firefox.app, it crash twice before it start (It take good 7 minute to start on dual core 2 Ghz machine). I have tracked down the problem. It seems that it is looking for a profile in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox. When it is available (after 1st start), firefox work fine. However, for the very first time, when it is unavailable it take age to create one and that too after crashing twice.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have firefox.app on the server. Mount that share on client.
2. Make sure there is no profile. Delete one if it exists in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Firefox
3. Double click on firefox icon.
Actual Results:
It crash twice and start after 7 minutes.

Expected Results:
It should start immediately.
