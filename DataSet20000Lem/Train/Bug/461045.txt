Bug Report:

Save File / Add Bookmark Interface Trap
1. Click "Download File" (from any site)...

2. The "You have chose to open" dialogue appears.
3. Choose "Save File"
4. Click "Ok"
5. The "Enter name of file to save to..." dialog appears.
6. In most other software, at this point I press "Apple-Shift-D" to change the Finder directory to the Desktop.

The problem is that before I can do so, Firefox performs step 7 on it's own...

7. Window focus change from the window in Step 5, to instead focus on background window (originating window).

8. As this happens so quickly, step 6 occurs after step 7, and the Add Bookmark drop down is triggered in the originating window.

9. No amount of clicking or pressing escape will cancel the Add Bookmark drop down, and it is unfortunately impossible to enter text and/or complete the Add Bookmark process. The user is now trapped between the save dialog and the Add Book mark dialog.

10. Force Quit Required

Note:
1. Don't press "Apple-Shift-D" after the window focus curiosity happens.
2. Instead click to re-focus back to the "Enter name of file to save to..." window.
3. Properly save the file (Apple-Shift-D not a problem at this point / optional).
4. Now without closing the originating window, repeat the process...
5. The window-refocus issue will not occur.

Let me know if this is a trackable issue?

Best,
Joe
