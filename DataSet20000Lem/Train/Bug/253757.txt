Sub-menus on context menu don't open automatically

Several extension add sub-menus to the context menu. In previous builds, the
sub-menu would pop open on mouseover. On 20040730, a left-click is now required
to open the extenson's sub-menu.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install an extension that us a context menu (for example, MakeLink
http://www.netsoc.ucd.ie/~finuvir/makelink_1.2.xpi ) and restart Firefox.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and mouse over the context menu item "Make
Link >"


Actual Results:
The context menu did not open, and a left-click wa required to open it.

Expected Results:
The context menu should open automatically on mouseover.

I saw this bug with three of the extension I use (Make Link, Linky, and
BBCode). Another user in the forum verified the bug with two other extension
(ReloadEvery and ImageZoom). Looking through yesterday's checkins, I thought it
might be associated with either Bug 243720 [bookmark can't move into sub-folder
in personal toolbar (drag and drop)] or Bug 203183 [Bookmarks context menu stay
when clicking other menus].
