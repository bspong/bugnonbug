Firefox go "non-responsive" and freeze the OS. Using Internet Explorer 7 on the same site and url, IE7 handle it properly and doe not freeze the OS. The exception is "Windows Media Player"; the other exception is a Popup reference to a song list.

Reproducible: Always

Firefox should handle the exception a IE7 does; i.e., raise the alert bar and ask for instruction (Allow Active X this time; Allow popup this time)
