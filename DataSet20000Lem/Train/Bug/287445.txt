URL reference (#) do not work in file URLs when run from outside
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

If I run a file:/// URL through Windows' "Run" dialog, the #reference portion of
the URL is stripped by Firefox, resulting in the page starting at the top
instead of from the desired anchor.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a dummy test file, I'll call it C:\test\test.html... it doesn't have
to be anything special, any HTML will be fine.
2. Enter Firefox, type "file:///c:/test/test.html#anchor" in the address bar and
hit enter (this step work fine, and is for comparison.)
3. Go to the Run dialog (either via Win-R or via the Start Menu), type
"file:///c:/test/test.html#anchor" and hit enter.

Actual Results:
Firefox open a new tab with "file:///c:/test/test.html" in the address bar.


Expected Results:
The address bar should be "file:///c:/test/test.html#anchor", and Firefox should
have scrolled to the element with the specified ID.

Internet Explorer doesn't suffer the same problem, so the issue must be either
in Firefox itself, or perhaps in the remote sending of the URL to the existing
instance.
