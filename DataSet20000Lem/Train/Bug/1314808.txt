Steps to reproduce:

This issue actually started when I *lost* all my add-on (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1290457) after updating to FF 47 ... I then downgraded back to FF 46. Shortly after that, my HD failed (and the issue stopped being an issue, obviously). However, Firefox run extraordinarily slowly now. I know I have a few extension (24, in total (see below)), but with a new SSD in the machine, I thought it would fly.

I tried to diagnose if it might be the connection -- but, I then found that to be unlikely (because I can't imagine a poor connection causing the CPU to spike) -- (see attached images). Also, the problem doesn't occur when using Chrome. In general, it's always using a lot of CPU - but, 4-10 time per HOUR, it lock up (second image). The screen fade and the mouse pointer is replaced with an hourglass.

I wa advised by a volunteer (I believe) to download the "Gecko Profiler extension" and do some analysis.

Here are three link to the data (I believe the third one happened *during* one of the "not responding" episodes:

But, I have no idea how to read/interpret them.

I then upgraded from 46 to 47 (despite the fact that 47 caused all my problem initially). I did this so I could run the about:performance tab. Apparently "all" my add-on "seem to have slowed down Firefox "very often" ... This seems preposterous.

I have a total of 24 add-on and 15 (15!) of them have this warning next to them. I can click on each one to read the "more" section; but -- again -- not sure what I'm looking for. I did this, primarily, so whomever see this ha a much information a possible,

I really don't want to switch to Chrome (how can they insist that the tab be *above* the address bar?) but, that's starting to look like my only option (which is a shame, since I've used this family of browser since Netscape, year and year ago .....)

Thanks!


Actual results:

4-10 time per HOUR, Firefox lock up (second image).The screen fade and the mouse pointer is replaced with an hourglass.


Expected results:

It shouldn't be locking up :)
