Address bar auto-complete only work sometimes

When I open my browser and type 'mail.yahoo.com' sometimes it auto-completes and
sometimes not. I cannot find any pattern with it, and it only happens with this
URL.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser (my homepage is google)
2. Type 'mail.yahoo.com' into the address bar

Actual Results:
It doesn't always auto-complete.

Expected Results:
Should have auto-completed after about 'mail.y' because I've never visited any
other page beginning with mail.y

This ha been happening for a long a I can remember, since I wa running
Phoenix 0.4. I'm stumped because I can't find a pattern to it. I sometimes
open my browser and type in 'm' and it's the first entry in the list. Then I
close my browser, open it again, and it doesn't auto-complete even though it
just did thirty second before! It also happens to me on Linux, where I usually
run the latest nightly and update every few days.

I have selected the "remember me" option when logging into yahoo mail, if that
make any difference.
