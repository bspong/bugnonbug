RE: Commonwealth Bank of Australia Netbank website

(http://www.commbank.com.au) - then access and log into Netbank

There is a problem with using Mozilla and viewing detail of account transactions. Using Internet Explorer, Safari and Google Chrome there is no problem.

When I log in then click on one of my account I am supposed to see a list of my recent transaction but with Mozilla the account name is listed but no transaction appear. When I try to access transaction via a different method I then get a website error telling me that transaction history is temporarily unavailable, with a reference code.

At first I thought the website wa failing but with all the others browser transaction appear fine.

I like to use one browser for everything and wa prev using Mozilla but I bank regularly online - in Australia Commbank is our largest bank so the issue is probably worth looking into. I am now using Safari.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to COmmonwealth bank website (www.commbank.com.au)
2. Click on Netbank logo
3. Log into Netbank
4. Click on any of the account name listed
5. The page will load but no account transaction are listed

NB. This used to occur occasionally (ie. not all the time) over the last few month but now occurs all the time
Actual Results:
See above

Expected Results:
A list of my recent transaction

It mya be that the bank website ha changed it coding but I can;t understand why Explorer, Chrome and Safari all work fine but Mozilla doe not.
