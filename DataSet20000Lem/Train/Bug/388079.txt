When attempting to remove some cooky by selecting multiple cooky in the cookie manager, it will often delete the wrong cookies.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Convince any phpBB-driven forum to set it four *_data, *_sid, *_t, and *_f cookies. (For this, I used the MozillaZine forums, but any such forum should do.)
2. Open the cookie manager.
3. In the search box, enter a search that will display only those four cookies. (e.g. "mzf")
4. Select the first and third cookies.
5. Press the delete key or click the Remove Cookies button.
Actual Results:
The first and *fourth* cooky get deleted. Apparently. However, re-opening the cookie manager show that only the first cookie got deleted.

Expected Results:
Exactly the selected cooky (the first and third) should get deleted, and the cookie manager should should reflect this immediately.

The workaround is obvious, but irritating: Delete cooky one at a time.
