--Moz & IE Browser Bug: Browser Height Test : Screen Resolution set to 1280 x 1024
--Justin West
--12/13/2006

This Mozilla bug appears to be an issue with the way the browser interprets height="100%".
I tested this in Firefox 1.5 and 2.0 on PC, screen resolution set to 1280 x 1024.
I wa also able to replicate this issue in IE 6.0 and IE 7
IF you cannot see the content or the border(s) being cut off at the bottom of this test page, try reducing the height of the spacer image until you can see content being cut off.
Additionally, you may need to reduce the font-size in the style above or remove some of the my text content.

The problem occurs when using content within a table that ha it height set to 100%, when at least two element exist within the table and one of them is also a table with height set to 100%.

This example demonstrates the bug when the screen resolution is set to 1280 x 1024.


It seems that the overall length of the content ha to extend past the viewable browser area(scrollbars) to replicate this bug.
This example replicates the bug consistently.
As the html content get more complex, with cs style getting added,
and DOM-injecting javscripts being referenced, the bug becomes intermittent...to the point where refreshing or even hiding/showing the status bar will cause the bug to go away or come back. Larger portion of content can get cut off a well.

Replacing the table with divs using cs doe not appear to fix the problem either.
This is a problem with height="100%" (height:100%;)

A workaround for Mozilla Browsers:
Wrapping all content with a single element (a div, or span) in case where there are more than one element within a table that ha a height of 100% allows the browser to calculate height correctly.

Uncomment the span tag I've added, save and refresh your browser (You may need to clear your cache.)

Still working on an IE work around that will also work with Mozilla...


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a table that ha it height set to 100%.
2.Create two or more element within the first table. One of them must be a table with height also set to 100%
3. Make the overall content extend far enough down the page that the page need to scroll.

Actual Results:
Two things.

1. If the content within the first table consists of two elements: a div followed by a table, a portion of the content within the inner table get cut off.

2. If you add a third element after the inner table: another div, the above content will render correctly, but this third element will be invisible, yet still take up space on the page where it *should be.

Expected Results:
In applying these step you will see that portion of content appear to be cut off prematurely. Also some content is not visible yet take up space on the page.




I expect that using height=100% whether in table or applied to divs through stylesheets should cause the element to expand to the greatest possible height within it's parent without causing content to be cut off.
Added example source below(a file upload feature would make this easier):

<table height="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td width="400" style="border: solid 1px #0000FF;">

<!--Uncomment span tag a a workaround for Mozilla browsers-->
<!--<span>-->

<div>This is element 1 in table 1 with height at 100%</div>
<table height="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
<td width="350" style="border: solid 1px #FF0000;">
