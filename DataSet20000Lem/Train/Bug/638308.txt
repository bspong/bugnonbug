Firefox 3.6.14 wa released yesterday, and this is causing issue with the Silverlight player on www.netflix.com. The first time a movie is played, everything work correctly. However, the second and subsequent times, the Netflix player page display a "Thanks for installing" screen. After restarting the browser, a single play work after which the problem appears again.

The issue did not appear in previous version of Firefox. I suspect this is due to some Silverlight plugin detection not working properly with this new version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.6.14
2. Use a Mac (doesn't reproduce on Windows)
3. Log into www.netflix.com
4. Click "Play" on a movie
5. The movie play
6. Click the browser back button
7. Click "Play" on another movie
8. The "Thanks for installing" screen appears
Actual Results:
The Netflix "Thanks for installing" Silverlight screen appears, and the movie doe not play.

Expected Results:
The movie should play.

Have tested this on Tiger, Leopard, and Snow Leopard. All version of Mac OSX tested produce the same results. The issue doe not reproduce with the same version of Firefox on Windows.
