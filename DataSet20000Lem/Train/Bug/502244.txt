Since installing 3.5, clicking on webpage link result in error messages, more often than not. Sometimes this is corrected by reloading the page with the original links, and sometimes hitting "retry" on the error page will resolve it, but the page are very slow to react. In general, all webpage have been very slow to load in the first instance. Freezing during page loading ha been frequent. The problem were noticeable immediately after upgrading from 3.0 to 3.5.

3. If the action in #2 do not resolve the problem, then close Firefox 3.5 and restart the browser.
