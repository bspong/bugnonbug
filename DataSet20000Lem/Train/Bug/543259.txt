Script is still running error after exiting private mode
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; de; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

From time to time i get the error that the script resource://gre/res/hiddenWindow.html:12 is still running and the question if I want to terminate it, this happens most of the time after exiting private mode but I've also encountered it while closing Firefox. The Problem hasn't occurred to me before updating to Firefox 3.6 and in fact I haven't encountered it on any of my other machine (3x Win 7 32-bit, 1x Win XP 32-bit) even though i sync Firefox using Weave on most of them and also use the same extension on most of them.

I have also encountered this even though I have selected "don't ask me again".

I know this is not very specific but I would really appreciate it if you could look into it, of course I am available for question or testing.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start private mode
2. Browse for some time
3. Exit private mode -> Error happens sometimes
4. Exit Firefox -> Error happens sometimes
Actual Results:
I get an alert that the script resource://gre/res/hiddenWindow.html:12 is still running.
