We are using httprequest together with our connection management which try to determine connection status by httprequest response checking.

In FF 2.0, 3.0 the behavior wa odd but still deterministic.
request.abort() - caused request.status == 0
broken connection (server down) caused j error:
try{
request.status;
}
catch(e){
alert("offline");
}

FF 3.5.2 return all the time request.status == 0, for both .abort() and offline. So we are not able to determine what happend.

You should retund .status=404, .statusText="Not Found" instead of status=0(or JS error in older versions) and statusText causing JS Error in all versions.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open asynchronous httprequest to invalid URL
2. onreadystatechange() method will show request.status == 0 instead of 404
(or JS error in older FFox releases)

Actual Results:
Latest FireFox return the same status for aborted request and unavailable server

Expected Results:
There should be status = 404 for unavailable server (offline) and Status=0 for Aborted request
