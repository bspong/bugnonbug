( The picture show toolbar of Firefox3 beta4 in upper window, and Epiphany's in lower one. )

It sound like a misconfiguration. But probably not. Please give me a chance to explain all over.

When I first time see this. ( with a precompiled copy ) I believed this is some sort of misconfiguration. I ran over all gtkrc-2.0 on my system. But found no icon overridden wa set. And BTW, I can't find any icon like those 2 on backward/forward button on in /usr/share/icons/ nor /usr/share/theme/. And it didn't matter what fallback iconset wa set in all the gtkrc-2.0.

I'm bewildered and followed the instant reaction: delete the .gtkrc-2.0 in my home. But that didn't help. In fact, It doesn't matter whether I emptied my home or try by a new user. The result is the same.

Second, I tried upgrade GTK+. libgnomeui, libbonoboui... all the "firends of gnome." But it didn't do any help either.

Finally, I grab the source tarball and compile it on my gentoo box. The compile process when on smoothly( good job, guys. ) But still, the icon didn't change on the 2 buttons.

Yeah, I did google some screenshot of Linux version from the other users. None of them exhibit the same behavior. But my Epiphany is working normally here. How could this be explained?

As a average user, I did all I can. Any suggestion & idea is welcomed. I don't mind if I have to fiddle with debugger like GDB. Thank you all.( Besides that, Firefox3 beta4 just ROCKS)
