Download location incorrect and restricted when integrated into OS X default User Template
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10_4_11; en) AppleWebKit/525.28.3 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.2.3 Safari/525.28.3

When building a master drive image for Mac OS X 10.4.11, I utilize a custom User Template per the general steps:

1) Configure an account with the preferred application settings.
This includes configuring FireFox to always download to /Volumes/Storage/Downloads.

2) From a root account, we clone the original account into the default User Template via these steps:
rm -r /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/*
cp -R /Users/buildmaster/* /System/Library/User\ Template/English.lproj/

3) The resulting User Template location is then set to owner root and group wheel and a repair of permission is performed before any new account are created.

4) At this point, there is 1 account on the system and that is the buildmaster which the end user doe not use. From this account, new account are made, such a User2.


When making a build master with an install of FireFox 3.0-3.0.8, I have no known problems. I have not tested 3.0.9. Version 3.0.10 is the only known version with issues. I have not solidly confirmed the result of updating to 3.0.10 on a User Template cloned with an older version then updated.

As noted above, FireFox is set to download to /Volumes/Storage/Downloads.
When using FireFox from ANY account other than the original buildmaster, the download process alert me:


Downloading /Users/buildmaster/Desktop/98MDjMzA.png.part

/Users/buildmaster/Desktop/98MDjMzA.png.part could not be saved, because you cannot change the content of that folder.

Change the folder property and try again, or try saving in a different location.



1) The buildmaster wa not set to download to it desktop. It wa set to download to /Volumes/Storage/Downloads.
2) /Volumes/Storage/ along with the /Volumes/Storage/Downloads are set to ignore permissions.
3) From the User2 account, I can verify /Volumes/Storage/Downloads a the download location, I can change the config to use the User2 desktop and even set the download location to a newly created folder and still receive the same error.
4) removing FireFox and searching the drive for firefox and removing all plists and other file then reinstalling FireFox 3.0.10 doe not resolve the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FireFox 3.0.10
2. Clone the base account to be the default User Template.
3. Create a new account and from the new account, try to download anything from within FireFox 3.0.10

See "Details" section of bug report for step to create a custom User Template in Mac OS X.
Actual Results:
Actual results: FireFox wa excluded from usability and alternate browser wa required.

Expected Results:
FireFox should have respected the setting of where I told it to always download.

Enterprise setup utility for FireFox (specifically on Mac OS X) would be a great asset.
