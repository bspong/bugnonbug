By placing tab into titlebar users, especially on netbooks, can save vertical space. This feature is higly demanding among user and they are expecting it.
There are several scenario how to handle this:
1. Chrome/Opera way: Tabs are partially in title bar when window is unmaximized and fully when maximized.
2. Standard (or new, Firefox... go figure): Tabs are fully in title bar when window is maximized and fully out of title bar when window unmaximized.
Personaly, I'd go for number two; it offer an easy way how to switch between two states.

For basic idea how it would look like, see mockup from Stephen (it's picture number two).

We need figure it out how to handle situations:
1. When another item in title bar appears, e.g. edit tray.
2. Tabs should be touching edge of window? If so, how to handle window dragging?
3. Should have tab same size, or get smaller?

There may be more questions, feel free to write your concern and ideas.

Reproducible: Always
