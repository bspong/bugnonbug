I'm using the Tab Groups feature (which, by the way, is great) but I noticed that, if a tab not in the current active group need to prompt for a password, the prompt go to foreground and the tab get added to the current group, but after you have introduced your password and the prompt go away, if you switch to another tab, the foreign tab is removed and placed back into it's original group. Furthermore, during the time the tab is displayed in the current active group, if you right-click over it and try to "Move to Group", no group is displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a page which requires password prompt
2. Group your tab so that the prompting page end up in a group in the background
3. Restart Firefox
Actual Results:
The prompting tab prompt for a password in the foreground and get added to the group that is currently active

Expected Results:
This is what I'm not sure... should the prompt be in the background too? Is that even possible? Or should the group of the prompting tab be brought to the foreground?
