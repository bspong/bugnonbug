Firefox on x86-64 in Arch Linux with XFCE hog up ton of RAM. I usually idle around 170-180 MB, and it shoot up very high in GMail, either after using it for a while, or just opening an instance of Google Talk, around 200-240 MB. it eventuall start swapping on my system (I've only got 512 MB on this system) and continues to creep up; seems like a memory leak. It seems like Firefox is using an abnormal amount of RAM. This with le then 3 tabs. Sometimes only 1.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to GMail.
2. Start fiddling around in GMail, or open up Google Talk
3. Watch a RAM steadily creep up, never stopping.
---- or ----
1. Start Firefox.
2. Leave it open for 15 minutes, browsing around to different websites. RAM usage get pretty high under these normal conditions.
Actual Results:
RAM usage increase dramatically, and continues to creep up.
---- or ----
RAM usage start out fairly high, and creep up.

Expected Results:
Normal RAM usage. Maybe 150 MB at max for my usage (about 3 tab open at any time MAX).

I love Firefox and have had a hard time finding an alternative. I really want to use Firefox, and want to keep using it. But the RAM situation is causing problems. I've tried everything I could to fix it, and it doe not work. AdBlock Plus is an absolute must, though the issue for the most part still exist with it disabled. (Though, idle RAM usage is indeed lower by about 10 MB or so)
