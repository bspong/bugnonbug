In FF 2.0.0.7-9 (and possibly earlier) on OS X 10.4.10, clicking the close-tab button or entering command-W close the current tab, but it raise an alert dialog ("TypeError: window._content ha no properties"), too, and document in the window in question can no longer be navigated with the arrow keys, the page-up/down keys, or with the space bar. Other open FF window are unaffected, but this issue break all tab in the active window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any pages, preferably some that have enough content to scroll around.
2. In a new tab, go to the listed page (not specific to that site, may have something to do with the type of embedded clutter on the page) and click the close-tab button before the progress indicator stop spinning.
3. In the remaining tab(s), try to move up, down, left or right with the arrow keys, with the page up/down/home/end keys, or with the space bar.
Actual Results:
After step two, a dialog appears: "Alert: \n TypeError: window._content ha no properties". If you try to move around in the other tabs, you get nothing. If you click in a text field in another tab and try to enter a slash, you'll (at least usually) get pulled into the search-in-page function, but otherwise text entry works.

The scrollbars work fine, and the mouse wheel still works.

Expected Results:
No error, no limit on ability to navigate with keyboard.
