Keyboard navigation of 'Add Bookmark' 'Create in:' incorrect

Adding a page to the bookmark (either through Ctrl+D or Bookmarks->Bookmark
This Page) cause the 'Add Bookmark' dialog to appear. Moving the focus to the
'Create in:' listbox and having the listbox expand, when I use the up- and
down-keys to navigate the option in the listbox, the order of the highlighted
item is incorrect. For example, I have three item listed (from top-to-bottom)
in the 'Create in:' listbox: Bookmarks, Perl page (official), and Bookmarks
Toolbar Folder. Moving the focus to the 'Create in:' listbox cause the listbox
to expand with the first item (Bookmarks) highlighted. Pressing the down-arrow
to move the focus change the focus (and highlighted item) to the third item in
the listbox, 'Bookmarks Toolbar Folder'. The expected highlighted item _should_
be the second item, 'Perl page (official)'. Pressing the down-arrow again,
cause the highlighted item to be the second item ('Perl page (official)').
Continued pressing of the down-arrow cause the first item (Bookmarks) to be
highlighted, and the cycle repeats. If a fourth bookmark folder (e.g.
Bookmarks, ECC sites, Perl pages, Bookmarks Toolbar Folder top-to-bottom 'Create
in:' listbox listing) is added, the keyboard navigation cycle is (assuming 'ECC
sites' is visible in the 'Create in:' entry area and using either the up- or
down-arrow), 'ECC sites' and 'Bookmarks Toolbar Folder' exclusively. Adding a
fifth bookmark folder (e.g. bug sites, Bookmarks, ECC sites, Perl pages,
Bookmarks Toolbar Folder top-to-bottom 'Create in:' listbox listing) cause the
focus order to be, 'bug sites', 'ECC sites', 'Bookmarks Toolbar Folder',
'Bookmarks', and 'Perl page (official)'.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open the 'Add Bookmark' dialog.
2.Change focus to the 'Create in:' listbox and cause it to show all the bookmark
folders.
3.Change the highlighted bookmark folder using the up- or down-arrow.

Actual Results:
From a top-to-bottom listing of the 'Create in:' drop-down of 'folder 1',
'folder 2', 'folder 3', 'folder 4', and 'folder 5', the order of highlighting
and traversal is folder 1, 3, 5, 2, and 4. On a 'Create in:' drop-down of
'folder 1', 'folder 2', 'folder 3', and 'folder 4', the order of highlighting
and traversal is _only_ folder 1 and 3.

Expected Results:
From a top-to-bottom listing of the 'Create in:' drop-down of 'folder 1',
'folder 2', 'folder 3', 'folder 4', and 'folder 5', the order of highlighting
and traversal is folder 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. On a 'Create in:' drop-down of
'folder 1', 'folder 2', 'folder 3', and 'folder 4', the order of highlighting
and traversal is _only_ folder 1, 2, 3, and 4.
