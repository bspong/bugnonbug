show tag result in url bar autocomplete

As an intermediate step between where I am with it right now (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395161) and faaborg's mockup (http://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/granParadisoUI/places_UnifyingSearch_i1.png), here's what I'd like to propose for m8 (meaning, something I think I can finish and get reviewed today.)

Upon typing in the url bar:

* prioritize exact (case insensitive) tag match to the top, and use the tag icon instead of the star. among the tag matches, sort by frecency. The reasoning here is to promote tagging, to make finding tagged item easier, and now user can use tag for the additional purpose of affecting search results. Say I want g to be google. I can tag google.com with g and if that is the only page tagged with g, it will always be first. I'd rather user use tag to do this, than just bookmarking.

* after the tag matches, the frecency result for bookmark + the first chunk of history. the reason for this is so that unvisited bookmark will be "near the top", yet not completely outweighing unbookmarked visits.

* after all that, continue on with the rest of history (in the current asynchronous fashion).

Note, this should be a fast a thing currently are, a tag searching and bookmark searching fast a those are typicallly several order of magnitude le than history.
