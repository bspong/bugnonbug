<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243078">Bug 243078</a> is
the "right" way to fix this bug, but it's not going to be fixed in time for Deer
Park, which mean another six month or so of Firefox looking like a
seven-year-old Windows 95 app on modern Windows systems:

1. Icon spacing doesn't match Internet Explorer, and appears to have been
designed to maximise viewable space. This is fine assuming that the toolbar
button aren't going to be used that much, but having a 16px Back button isn't
great for people with le than 20/20 vision. It also look ugly.
2. Menu bar have a 3D look which doesn't fully match Windown 95 anyway, but
look awful on XP Luna. Menu highlight should follow the Windows Luna scheme
for now until the above bug is fixed, because it look nicer on the most popular
Windows distro at the moment and doesn't look terrible on older version (most
modern apps, such a recent Office versions, use the Windows XP look regardless).
3. Menu spacing is likewise miniscule, making it harder to hit individual item
a well a being le attractive and readable.

Patch coming up.

Reproducible: Always
