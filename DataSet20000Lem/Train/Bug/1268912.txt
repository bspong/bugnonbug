Sync's client.name2 string should use a curly apostrophe/quote instead of a straight quote
As part of bug 1268159, the rest of the quote character in string were converted to curly quotes. However, the apostrophe in sync.properties for client.name2 seems to have some affect on other code.

When the ASCII apostrophe wa converted to a Unicode \u2019 character quite a few xpcshell test failed.

My guess is that the unicode character is tripping up some other code in the mock testing server.

:rnewman, any idea here?
