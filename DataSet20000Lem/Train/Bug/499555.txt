Safer shopping feature suggestion:
Now that shopping on the web is ubiquitous, we need way to help improve the user's safety. There are so many scam that even more sophisticated user are getting taken and it get worse every day.

The automatic Phishing detection built into browser is great, but we need to take this to the next level.

After my wife got scammed by an on-line merchant, I got to thinking: why can't browser automatically pop up a warning to user if a site they visit ha poor BBB rating or numerous complaint about fraudulent business practice on other consumer sites?

This would really help consumer get over their fear of the web and on-line purchases.

Consumers need a way to protect themselves *transparently* - without having to research every company they purchase from using Bizrate or similar websites, which aren't very complete, anyway.

Having this built into the browser would dramatically reduce the risk to the consumer and also greatly improve the safety of the web for many users.

Every browser need an option for this feature. Together, we can starve these nefarious business that engage in deceptive practices.
