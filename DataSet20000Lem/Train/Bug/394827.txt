Originally occured with .MAFF functions, Firefox refused to save any file with a .maf and a .mhtml in the save a dialog window. On further investigation, 'save as' did not correctly link file with file folder content for save a "web page complete". I had trouble isolating what actual extension wa used when trying to save a complete web page, but I think it just doesn't give it one. Upon adding the .htm/.html extension to the filename, it wa correctly linked by window with it 'extra folder' (don't know how to describe it), but I do not know how many time I have erronoeusly saved complete web page that wound up with no extentions. Also noted, about mozilla archive, fic wa achieved by deleting 'extensions.ini' 'extensions.cache' and 'extensions.rdf' while Firefox wa offline. Thank you for investigated this issue.
