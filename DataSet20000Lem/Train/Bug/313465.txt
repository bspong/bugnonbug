Macromedia Flash Player 7 by default support mouse wheel scrolling of content. For example, in a Flash movie I have a text box which is approx. 300 pixel high in which I have my page content. When using MS IE6 when you hover over this content, you can use the mouse wheel to scroll through the content a you would with a regular HTML page. In Firefox (build 1.07 and 1.5 Beta 2) this mouse wheel support doe not function.
