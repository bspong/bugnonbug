On Windows XP Professional, Service Pack 1, if you repeatedly open and close Firefox throughout the day, Firefox continually consumes page file space until there is none left. This is especially true if you open multiple tab each time (I do this a I check CNN.com). I have tried this with nothing running on the system except Firefox and can reproduce it each time. As you open and close the browser, if you check page file usage in the Task Manager, it grows exponentially each time Firefox is launched. Eventually, the OS report "Virtual memory too low" error and the system hangs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Check the page file usage in Task Manager with no application running.
2.Open and close Firefox several time (you do not have to actually visit any URLs to see the issue). You may wish to open several tab each time.
3.Check the page file usage again in Task Manager. I have seen page file usage go from around 100MG to 1.2GB after launching Firefox 6 or 7 times.

Actual Results:
My page file usage went from 140MB to 1.2GB with nothing running but Firefox.

Expected Results:
Firefox should free the allocated space each time it is closed. I cannot tell if the browser should be releasing space each time a tab is closed or each time the browser is closed.

I have no special theme or customization option installed. This occurs using Firefox with just the default setup. I also have not changed any of the available option under the Tools, Options menu.
