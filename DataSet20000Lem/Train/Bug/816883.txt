Firefox unable to save text content in offline mode, subsecuently reports: already loaded and presented can not be read from Inet
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux i686; rv:17.0) Gecko/17.0 Firefox/17.0
Build ID: 20121120063346

Steps to reproduce:

Full Firefox title from About menu item:
Firefox 17,0 - Mozilla Firefox for Canonical - 1.0

1) Visit page: http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/INSTALL
2) Enable offline mode. (Firefox menu button -> Web Developer -> Work offline)
3) Try to Save the page (it is pure text file, a I catch) somewhere on your disk.
4) It will fails with message-dialog. The page will not be saved at all.



Actual results:

It will fails with message-dialog:

Download error
/home/user/path/where/to/save - "web page title" could not be saved, because the source file could not be read.
Try again later, or contact the server administrator.

Attempt to view page source via right mouse button click will bring the next:

Document Expired
This document is no longer available.
The requested document is not available in Firefox's cache.As a security precaution, Firefox doe not automatically re-request sensitive documents.Click Try Again to re-request the document from the website.

But in fact the page content to be saved is fully available on screen and via copy-paste. It is possible to copy and paste the text into an text editor.


Expected results:

This look like Firefox totally unable to save already loaded _pure_ text page in offline mode.

Related bug:

Firefox _partially_ unable in offline mode to silently save already loaded pages. Instead it will bring up 20-30+ dialog about inaccessibility of JavaScrips and similar thing do not located inside the page body. Why to try to save them from Internet, explicitly beeng in offline mode.

The page may _not_be_saved_at_all_, if I will correctly shutdown my computer instead of pressing 20-30-60+ time on OK button on every error message dialog.

Rarely, this behaviour may lead to user downloaded _data_loss_. Example: computer wa suspended for weekends, then user wake it back, deside to save page, already loaded two day ago. The page content and code exist inside user's computer, inside "opened Firefox windows", but it wa deleted from a server while suspending among weekends. The wanted data will be lost for a user.

P.S. While being connected to Internet via mobile phone in rural district it tooks 5-7 minute to load some pages. Is some time not possible to do it subsecuently twice (servers often will drop low speed connection now days). Also traffic price is too high.

Excuse me, please, if grammar mistake ocurs. I have tried my best, but English is not my native, nor profession. Excuse me.

Best regards.
