My program set the 'selected' attribute for a <SELECT> drop down control to the third option in the list. But, when I am still on the page and refresh it, eventhough the dependant content is displayed right, the actual value in the drop down list change to the first item. I would rather be able to explain better with this example.

<select>
<option>Option1</option>
<option>Option2</option>
<option>Option3</option>
<option>Option4</option>
<option>Option5</option>
</select>

The page depends on the value of this drop down. When I select, Option3[for instance], the page reloads and all dependant data[I query my MySQL server to get related data] load correctly and the drop down show "Option3. But, when I refresh the page now, the content appears for how it would be if it wa "Option3", but the value indicated in the Drop Down control is "Option1".

If you need a more clarified explanation, please do send me an email.
