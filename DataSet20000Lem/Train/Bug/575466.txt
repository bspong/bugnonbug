When Firefox recognises that you've entered a possible "username" / "password" combination on a site it brings up the "Save Password" dialog/dropdown. Using the site "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org" a a n example and going to the login page you enter the "username" and "password". The "Save Password" dialog/dropdown come up with the text "Do you want Firefox to remember the password for "username" on mozilla.org?". As you can see the last part of this line read a "mozilla.org". Now when you click the "Remember" button to store the "username" / "password" combination into the Password Manager it actually store this using the URL "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org" which is correct. So the text displayed in the dialog/dropdown is misleading and should really be "Do you want Firefox to remember the password for "username" on "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org"?" to correctly represent the context for the information about to be stored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/" and click the "Log In" link at the top of the page.
2. Enter a "username" and "password" and click the "Log in" button.

Actual Results:
The "Save Password" dialog/dropdown appears with the text "Do you want Firefox to remember the password for "username" on mozilla.org?".

Expected Results:
Expecting the dialog/dropdown to show the text "Do you want Firefox to remember the password for "username" on "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org"?".

I've put the severity down a "Trivial" because Firefox still correctly store the URL "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org" for the "username" / "password" combination in the Password Manager. But this bug is misleading and could possibly lead user confusion.
