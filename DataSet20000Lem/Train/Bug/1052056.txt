After Firefox 31 upgrade on Win xp, tab won't open
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140605174243

Steps to reproduce:

Upgrade to Firefox 31.0. Never had any problem upgrading Firefox. I have Windows xp and "AVG do not track" extension. When opening a new tab in Firefox 30 and earlier all I had to do wa click the scroll button on a link in the open browser and a new tab would open for that link; very handy when comparing product or detail of items. After upgrading to Fx 31 from 30, clicking the scroll button work the same a left click button... open new link in same tab. I could not open new tab at all.
I restored the whole OS to an earlier image using my imaging sw and will not upgrade to Firefox 31 until resolved. Firefox Options doe not have setting for browser tab use a IE.


Actual results:

1. After upgrading to Fx 31 from 30, clicking the scroll button work the same a left click button... open new link in same tab. I could not open new tab at all.
2. And some graphic would not load; like the placeholder were missing.
3. Also, shift+left click on a link would not open a new browser... instead work the same a left click button... open new link in same tab.


Expected results:

1. When opening a new tab in Firefox 30 and earlier all I had to do wa click the scroll button on a link in the open browser and a new tab would open for that link; very handy when comparing product or detail of items.
3. Also, shift+left click on a link should have opened a new browser.
