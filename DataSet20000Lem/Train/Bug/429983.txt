My company ha a system that we use for product tracking. We have a page where we can upload anything we want to it... it's a pretty basic interface where you hit the "Browse.." button and you can select any file on your desktop. Then you hit upload and it theory it should upload the file to our site. The URL bar doe populate with the location of the file (i.e. C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\plc4.dll) I however get a error everytime "There appears to be something wrong in the path to the file provided. Please click the "Browse" button and try again." This issue ha been in every Firefox 3 Beta so far. I have finally taken a couple minute to report it. I can upload the file all day long with any I.E. and Firefox 2. I really like firefox 3 so I hope this can get resolved. I'm guessing you guy need more info a I wa pretty vague - but I can't get into to many detail a our software is pretty secure so I can't give out to much info.
