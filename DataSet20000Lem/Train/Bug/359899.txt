Page still seems to be loading after is say 'done' LOCAL SERVER
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.5.0.7

I've put a stripped out page at http://firefox.gimme5.co.uk where the first 5 main tab behave a described below when on a webserver on my local machine....

I have a navigation built for a website that ha javascripts which effect the look, highlighting the appropriate navigation tab by parsing the URL to find the first folder it in for example www.site.com/products/software/sdk.asp will highlight the product 'tab' a thats the main folder the URL is in.

The problem is that it work fine in IE and appears to in Firefox, BUT if Firefox load the page, highlight the tab and say 'done' if you don't wait for an additional 4 second (my best guess) then when you click on another tab, the page it go to will render wrong. This is really annoying a the coding is absolutely fine. THIS ONLY HAPPENS WHEN I'M RUNNING IT ON MY LOCAL MACHINE WEBSERVER AND I'VE RECODED IT FROM ASP TO PHP TO RUN ON APACHE LOCALLY AND IT STILL DOES THE SAME THING.
When I'm viewing the site from the web I can only just get the site to falter - any idea why????
