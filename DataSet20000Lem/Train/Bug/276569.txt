If i remember right IE have ActiveX, but Opera don't and also Opera is using
webstandards or? like FX.
And if i try to listen to different webradio station they mostly fail when i try
the use the FX, but not if i use IE or Opera.
Why is this?. IE yes i do understand since it have activeX but opera not and it
play fine in opera

Try this like http://www.cadenaser.com/ and press "escuchar" that will open a
popup radio
FX = no sound, nothing.
IE = work fine.
Opera = work fine.

The same go for this site and many more, http://www.nordicwebradio.com/ just
pick any radio link.

So is this a bug or by design? Just like to know why opera that *don't* use AX
can open and play webradio station that FX can't, since they both *don't use AX
and they also use normal standards.

If I install AX for FX I can listen to the station but not without it in FX.
But a I said I can in opera and not using any ActiveX.
