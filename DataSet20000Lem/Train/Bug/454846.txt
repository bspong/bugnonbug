On our private intranet, we have current SOPs. They are linkable and contain a Macro (VBA) which includes command to save the SOP to the user's machine. This work in Firefox version 2.0.0.16 (Gecko 20080702) and earlier. It stop working with version 3.0.1. This function is critical to the SOP working correctly & updating itself. Thus I had to uninstall version 3.0.1.

Here is the code:

Sub autoclose()
Dim wordApp As Word.Application
ActiveDocument.Save
Application.DisplayAlerts = wdAlertsNone
ActiveDocument.ActiveWindow.Close savechanges:=wdDoNotSaveChanges
End Sub

Sub autoexit()
Application.DisplayAlerts = wdAlertsNone
ActiveWindow.Close savechanges:=False
End Sub


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Our Intranet is private.
2. I have put a temp example on a different web site that show the problem
3. http://gaia.ecs.csus.edu/~benningd/Mozilla/1toc.html
4. click on "Test Example that fails"
5. choose "Open with Microsoft Word"
6. if your Macro security is low enough, it will run the required script and set a date in the header.
7. Click to close MS Word. (Here's where the problem happens.)

8. Try it in version 2.0.0.16. It exit cleanly!
Actual Results:
Words pop up and asks, "Do you want to save this?"
and when you hit no, it generates an error and asks to call the debugger.

Expected Results:
At step #7 above, nothing except a closing of the MS Word should happen.
If you right click and "Save as..." then open the MS doc a a stand alone, the script run correctly and there is a clean exiting from the Word doc when you click on the close button.
