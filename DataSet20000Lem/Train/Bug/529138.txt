With VAN extension installed and enabled, For web page like gmail, cnn, google news, and http://www.universetoday.com/2008/05/18/comments-on-no-doomsday-in-2012/, firefox freeze for second to minutes, if you click to activate the tab. The firefox will crash many time a day for the same reason. I disabled all extension one by one, and finally isolate the problem to this extension. Please note that VAN is also the trouble maker that made Chrome crash when Chrome first came out.

Reproducible: Always

3. open a new tab and use cnn.com
4. come back to the first tab, and try to scroll the page
5. Watch the CPU utilization. if you have multicore, you should see a lot of activity on one core.
Actual Results:
web page freeze for second to minutes. Sometimes it unfreezes and sometimes it crash

Expected Results:
You should be able to scroll the page freely a soon a you move to the tab without freezing.

Citibank developer suck. The caused problem for both Chrome and Firefox.
