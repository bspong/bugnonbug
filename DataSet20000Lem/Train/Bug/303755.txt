When I had too many bookmark in the Bookmarks menu causing the arrow to
appear, I clicked on "Manage Bookmarks..." with the "Bookmark This Page" not
showing the menu. Basically, I scrolled up until I saw "Manage Bookmarks" at
the top. Then when I cleaned up my bookmarks, such that the menu wa short
enough that the arrow disappeared, "Bookmark This Page" did not reappear!
Furthermore, the arrow were gone, and there wa still room for the arrows.

I fixed the problem by creating enough bookmark to make the arrow re-appear,
then making certain that "Bookmark This Page" wa at the top, then deleted the
extra bookmarks.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Overload the Bookmark menu until the point where the arrow appear
2. Scroll up until only the "Manage Bookmarks" shows, and "Bookmark This Page"
doesn't show
3. Delete or clean up bookmark leaving only a few (5 or so) such that the
arrow disappear

Actual Results:
"Bookmark This Page" disappeared, the arrow disappeared

Expected Results:
Displayed "Bookmark This Page" or redrawn the menu.
