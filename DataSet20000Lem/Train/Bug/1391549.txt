Initial state of sidebar icon should reflect the sidebar side (left/right) pref even if sidebar wa closed before restarting Firefox
Bug 1366851 made the sidebar icon to display the current side of the sidebar by accordingly flipping the icon. However, the initial state of the sidebar icon always show a left sidebar even if the sidebar ha been moved to the right.

STR:
A) Create a new profile and start Firefox with it.
B) Initial state of the icon sidebar is on the left and clicking on it show the sidebar on the left [1].
C) Click the sidebar header button and select "Move Sidebar to Right"; both sidebar and sidebar icon change accordingly.
D) Close the sidebar (important).
E.1) Restart Firefox, or...
E.2) ... open a new browser window.

ER:
Closed sidebar on the right, with the sidebar icon showing a right sidebar.

AR:
Closed sidebar on the right, but sidebar icon show a left sidebar; opening the sidebar fix the sidebar icon.

After step E.2 this happens on the new browser window (in the original browser window the sidebar icon correctly show a right sidebar). Omitting step D (i.e. leaving the sidebar open) workarounds the issue and the sidebar button correctly show a right sidebar.

This is Firefox 57.0a1 x64 on Windows 10 Enterprise x64; ATM I cannot test other platforms. As for a regression range, this happens ever since Bug 1366851 landed.

[1] I'm on a LTR locale; I guess the opposite happens on RTL locales.
