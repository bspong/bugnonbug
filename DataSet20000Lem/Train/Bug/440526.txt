FireFox will not restart after system crash
User-Agent: Opera/9.50 (X11; Linux i686; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.0b5

I installed Mozilla Firefox 3.0b5 yesterday onto a RedHat/Fedora Core 9 (64 bit running a 32bit install). Everything seemed to go fine in the install yesterday and all this morning. There wa at least one FF window open when the following happened.

The machine "hung" a little while ago -- I am not suggesting at this point that FF caused the hang. I had to power cycle the machine to get it to reboot. After the reboot I tried to restart Firefox but get a popup message that says:

Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window,
you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system.

FireFox is not running according to 'ps'. I am assuming that there must be a lock file that is still hanging around but I can not find it and the man page doe not list it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Assuming that you had a working, open FF session before a machine crash... crash the system
2. reboot
3. try to restart FF
Actual Results:
a pop-up widow with the message

Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system.

Expected Results:
Actually start a new FF session
