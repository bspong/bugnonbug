OpenSuSE 10.3, KDE 3.5, and Windows Vista (pre SP1), Latest Java and Flash releases, FF since 3b3 and current 3b5pre (both repository version and Mozilla build)

Some sites, this one in particular after starting login, cause Firefox (3, not 2 or other browsers, except SeaMonkey release) to slow down to a crawl, often causing it to freeze and having to be killed, or FF crash after PIN confirmation. Don't know if this is related to Java or Flash implementation. Sometimes reinstalling Java and Flash package corrected the problem, but not in the current nightly), and it doesn't seem to be a broken site issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://home.ingdirect.com/ in FF beta (or SeaMonkey release)
2.After login and entering PIN on next screen
3.Slow, freeze, and/or crash


Expected Results:
Account page

This doe not happen in FF 2 release or other browsers, except the current SeaMonkey release. Other site where this occurs seem to be heavy with Flash and Java implementation.
