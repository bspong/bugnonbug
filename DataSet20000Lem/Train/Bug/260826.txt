After importing Mozilla 1.7.2's setting to Firefox during the installation
Firefox freeze every time when I try to download a file or save an image.
Skipping the import process Firefox work properly in my environment. Mozilla's
download setting wa 'open a separate download panel' that isn't between
Firefoxes options. A missing or buggy exclusion handling may cause this bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox to a machine on which Mozilla 1.7.2 is installed
2. Check 'Netsacpe/Mozilla' in the 'import settings' panel on startup
3. Try to download any file (i.e. .exe) or image

Actual Results:
Firefox massively freezed, while '[filename].part' file generated on hard disk
in the chosen directory. this file-part stopped growing at about 160K because of
the browser freeze.

Expected Results:
Download the requested material, optionally open the download manager (checking
'open download manager' in option didn't even change the result).
