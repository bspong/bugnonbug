Problem with FF2.0/Apache Communications Causing Apache to Lock/Crash
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; InfoPath.1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727)
Build Identifier: Firefox 2.0 (Sorry, Il'll Edit When I get back to my PC)

Hi All,

I am a developer for The Cacti Group (www.cacti.net) and I have recently upgraded to FF2 and unfortunately discovered an error in communication between Apache 2.x and Firefox 2.0 while rendering graphic behind the scene that cause a) The page to only partially load 2) Stuck process in Apache (aka Hung Server) 3) libpng error in Apache log.

This problem is 100% repeatable. It occur's in Windows Firefox and Windows Apache 2.x on the same system (my test box). I would like some guidance a to how to help the Firefox team understand what is happening a this is a bad thing. I don't want FF2 locking up Apache server out there.

If someone can please provide guidance, I will follow your instructions. Whether it installing an non-stripped version of FF2, or turning on DEBUG somehow, I am at your disposal.

Regards,

TheWitness

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto Cacti Web Site
2. Goto Graph Management
3. Edit Advanced Ping Graph
4. Turn on Graph Debug
5. Refresh Page Several Time

Actual Results:
Sometimes, the page refreshes just fine, but within 6-7 attempt to refresh the page, it fails to load 100% and the Apache Server hangs. In the Apache log there is a libpng error. I can not reproduce this problem in Internut Exploiter (v7.0).

Expected Results:
The page should always return successfully

I am available to work with a FF developer to isolate, but need your assistance a setting up test environment.
