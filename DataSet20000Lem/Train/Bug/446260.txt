Will never render properly it always cause Firefox to either hang or possible to show that code and you can then here the embedded video

but in Safari for Windows and IE it will render the page just fine WMP embedded and all. I did not report it to a broken web site since It ha the most current release of Gecko and also Firefox 2.0.0.16 also ha this issue do it is not just 3.0.1

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any website with the above code (there are lot of them)


Actual Results:
Video play audio only and sometimes firefox hang

Expected Results:
Video is embedded properly like in Safari or IE

Note this also occurs on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS with 3.0.1 and I have no extension for it and the default theme In window XP and Vista I have a ton of them and yet that code is the only one that it doe not seem to like very much
