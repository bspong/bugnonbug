javascript: typeof window.sidebar returning 'undefined' instead of 'object'; adding mycroft searchplugins broken
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.5b) Gecko/20030916 Firebird/0.6.1+

Note: this may be a bug or a change in how window.sidebar is handled and
Mycroft's detection method is now invalid.

Mycroft (mozdev project for search plugins) is displaying the following warning
on my Mozilla Firebird browser:

=====
Warning!

Your browser cannot use search plugins. You need a Mozilla-based browser like
Beonex, Mozilla Seamonkey, Netscape, or Mozilla Firebird. Other Mozilla based
browser have not yet been tested, please send u some feedback.
=====

Looking at the html code, I see the following code:

=====
<script type="text/javascript">
bo = "<a href=\"http://www.beonex.com/\">Beonex</a>";
mz = "<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/releases/stable.html\">Mozilla
Seamonkey</a>";
n = "<a href=\"http://channels.netscape.com/ns/browsers/\">Netscape</a>";
fb = "<a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/releases.html\">Mozilla
Firebird</a>";
oth = "Other Mozilla based browser have not yet been tested, please send u
some feedback.";
if ((typeof window.sidebar != "object") || (typeof
window.sidebar.addSearchEngine != "function")) {
document.write("<h2>Warning!</h2>");
document.write("<p>Your browser cannot use search plugins. You need a
Mozilla-based browser like "+bo+", "+mz+", "+ns+", or "+fb+". "+oth+"</p>");
}

</script>
=====
Entering 'javascript: typeof window.sidebar' into the location bar return
'undefined'. Earlier Firebird build would return 'object'.
