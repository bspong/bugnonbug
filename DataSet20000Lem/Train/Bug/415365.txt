At the neopets site some of the banner ad give out rewards. There is one banner ad which I can not click through on the FF beta or ff2 (which I wa using yesterday). It is the banner ad for the Mr. Men Show. I tried letting the page fully load and that did not make a difference. Yesterday I opened the Opera browser and wa able to click through on the ad and get the points, etc. Only Firefox ha this problem. You may have to refresh the page a few time to get the right banner ad to come up. It is also on http://www.neopets.com/winter/adventcalendar.phtml page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page.
2. Attempt to click on the Mr. Men Show banner ad.
3. Get nowhere.
Actual Results:
Nothing. Still on same Neopets site page. Did not open a new page.

Expected Results:
Opera wa able to open from this ad to a new page on a different site.

This also happened yesterday when I wa still using Firefox 2. I think the ad us Adobe Flash.
