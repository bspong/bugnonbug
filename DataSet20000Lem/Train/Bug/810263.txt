The tab is loading, but behaves a though it were not loading
Hello,

I encounter a strange bug in Firefox 3.6.23 Windows, and in Firefox 16.0.1 Linux.

Time t0.

I have an e-mail from Bugzilla in my webmail. I use the webmail Microsoft Outlook Web Access, in light mode. In the e-mail, I middle-click the link of the bug, and I go in the new tab.

Time t1.

The link is not a direct link. It is a link transformed by the webmail. So it directs me to a redirection page. The redirection page is loading, and the tab show that. So far, so good.

Time t2.

The redirection page is loaded, it is a white page. It ha interesting function like these :

function ldLnk()
{
try
{
window.location.href = a_sURL;
}
catch(e){}
}

function clDlg(i)
{
if (i == 0)
ldLnk();
else
setTimeout("window.close();", 1);
}

And it ha an empty body with onload="ldLnk()".

I see nothing moving. So I guess I am in a dead end. But after several seconds, the tab start changing... The tab's icon becomes Bugzilla's icon. And some content begin to load in the page. This take a while. After again several seconds, the target page is completely loaded, for example https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=801786 . The address in the address bar is https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=801786 .

Time t3.

Between t2 and t3, about 10 second have passed. Here is the problem : during this period, the tab did not show anything telling me it wa loading. Usually, when a tab is loading, I have four clue telling me to wait : 1) the throbber throbbing in the tab title block, 2) the top right throbber throbbing, 3) the bottom status bar / status text saying "Connecting to..." and so on, 4) the bottom right progress bar - except on Firefox 16.0.1 Linux where I usually have only the first three clues. But here, between t2 and t3, I have none of these clues.

Thank you for correcting that.

Nicolas
