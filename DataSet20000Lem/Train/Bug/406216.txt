Closing other tab by event listener of "TabClose" event possibly cause a null pointer error and break Firefox.

We extension author sometimes use "TabClose" event to do something, and I thought to close tab related to the closing tab. However, I saw the NS_ERROR_NULL_POINTER error when I actually did it. This problem reduces convenience of this API ("TabClose" event).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add event listener which close following tab of the closing tab, to "TabClose" event.
2. Close the current tab.

Actual Results:
Firefox selects no tab and NS_ERROR_NULL_POINTER appears in the error console.

Expected Results:
Firefox selects the last tab (which wa the previous tab of the closed one) and no error appear in the error console.


Code to reproduce the description:

gBrowser.addEventListener('TabClose', function(aEvent) {
var tab = aEvent.originalTarget;
while (tab.nextSibling) gBrowser.removeTab(tab.nextSibling);
}, false);
