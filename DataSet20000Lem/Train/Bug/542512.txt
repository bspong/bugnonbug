As you may know the srandard window.close(); doe not work in firefox, see issue 190515.

However, window.close() is supposed to work for window opened by Javascript. If you open a window by Javascript, then the user restarts firefox for an add-on install, firefox no long treat the window, a one opened by Javascript. I mean after the restart, the window.close() function no longer work ,even if the window wa opened originally with javascript.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. window.showModalDialog()
2. install add-on (with restart)
3. click button with window.close()
Actual Results:
The window will not close.

Expected Results:
The window should close, because the window wa opened with JavaScript.

It seems like when Firefox restarts it remembers what page you were at and session cookies, but it doe not keep track of which window were opened with JavaScript.
