Please see Bug #253046, comment #55 and comment #56. Please consider this the
"separate bug" suggested in comment #56.

On some site that provide streaming audio or video using Windows Media Player,
the stream cannot be accessed with recent nightlies. FF wrongly claim that a
plugin need to be installed.

Two such site are:

www.kabc.com
www.nakednews.com





Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Using a recent branch nightly such a Aug 20, visit
http://www.kabc.com/listenlive.asp .
2. Click on the link: "Netscape user click here for TalkRadio 790 KABC on the
Internet!"
3. Repeat step 1 and 2 using 0.9.3 milestone.

Actual Results:
Using nightly, FF told me I needed to install a plugin. When I clicked the
button to install, FF told me there is no plugin to install.

Using milestone, the WMP plugin opened and played the streaming audio.



Expected Results:
Open the WMP plugin and play the audio stream.
