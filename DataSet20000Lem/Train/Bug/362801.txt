Will not attach Word and sometimes Excel Documents - if it does, only I can see them and then when it sends, it disappears when reviewing the 'sent' box.

I am using my Rogers server for e-mails. I have spoken with Rogers Technical Support who successfully attached Word document from their end. I have tried from my work computer (a PC), and it attache fine. Word and Excel document will attach for me sometimes, but not always - it just wait and wait to attach and then time out. When it doe attach, I can see it before it sends, but then in checking the 'sent' box, it isn't there anymore. I have no problem with PDF documents, so have to convert EVERYTHING to pdf before sending.
