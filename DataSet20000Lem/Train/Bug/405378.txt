When in Yahoo! Mail Classic COMPOSE, "Insert addresses" no longer works, but still DOES WORK in IE7!
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.9) Gecko/20071025 Firefox/2.0.0.9

All of a sudden, I can no longer insert address either into the "To", "CC", or "BCC" address line when using "Compose" in Yahoo! Mail Classic--however, I have NO such problem when using Internet Explorer 7! When I check on the "Insert addresses" link (or "To:", a they both do the same thing) when using Firefox 2.0.0.9, my Yahoo! Mail Address Book will open a it normally should--but when I check-off those persons' name whom I wish to send the Email either a a "To", "CC" or "BCC" (by using the appropriate check boxes), and then click the "Insert Checked Contacts" radio button, the Yahoo! Mail screen now always go BLANK--instead of going back to the "Compose" page a it should with the address having being inserted into the address bar of the message being composed! This ONLY happens in Yahoo! Mail "Classic"--NOT in the "new" Yahoo! Mail (which I don't like because of having smaller font which are harder to read)--and doe NOT occur in Internet Explorer 7!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Yahoo! Mail Classic and click "Compose" radio button.
2. When on the Compose page, click either the "Insert addresses" link or "To:" (to the left of the main address bar).
3. Yahoo! Mail Classic Address Book opens.
4. Check either the "To", "CC", or "BCC" box for those people whom you wish to send the message to by any of these methods.
5. Click either the top or bottom "Insert Checked Contacts" radio button.
