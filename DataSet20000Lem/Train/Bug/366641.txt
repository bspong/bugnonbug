location autocomplete should not include invalid entries.
When I start typing a url autocomplete show me every related typing error I ever made.

To fix this:
if a new not-seen-before url doesn't resolve to or return anything, don't add
it to the list of known urls.

I'm not asking you to remove a url from the autocomplete list when it go 404, since that might be temporary, or when a site is down, again temporary. I'm not asking you to edit the list in any way. Purging the list is not desirable for a number of reasons; you might purge something that's wanted.

I'm asking you to be more selective about what you let on the list in the first
place. If it doesn't return anything, don't let it on the list. Raise the
barrier to entry.


So, create a list of newly-seen urls, and only move a url that wa entered from
that table to the list of url for the drop-down list once it ha been shown to
resolve to something. (What the url resolve to might change over time, but
that doesn't matter, and each url shouldn't be updated depending on a 301/302
redirect - this is about matching whatever shortcut the user types, and storing that shortcut IF it resolve to something.)

You'd think that this would be related to bug 9203, but apparently it's not, because location autocomplete (when you start typing a url and firefox pop up a list of suggestions) is not the same a location drop-down (when you click the downward-pointing arrow at the right of the url bar). Even though they look _exactly the same_ onscreen. They look the same - popup with list of url - but they're different! Like a user can tell.

This is worse than having both Find and QuickFind, where Quickfind is just Find without the options. At least the user can see there's a difference there.

This is incredibly bad from a UI perspective, and apparently someone need to point this out. And bugzilla list the same category (location bar and autocomplete) for both.
