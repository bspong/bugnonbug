I have my Windows Machine set to 'High process' priority for active window. I don't think enough people are reporting this because they usually have their window non-optimized. I think somewhere in firefox's optimizing routine is causing it to go something like 'Real-time' causing it to spin at 96% cpu processing usage. This ha *always been a problem. If someone can do look at this, with their xp machine set 'High priority' -- unfortunately i forget the hkey for this, but if needed can supply the regkey.. I always have my machine's apps running all on high-pririoty-- no other app cause this problem, so I suspect it's somewhere in the optimizing engine causing this misbehavior. Thanks for looking into it.. I can't be sure exactly when it doe occur but it is happening more often after 1.5.







Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set regkey for apps to run 'High' on active.

Actual Results:
Perhaps most likely to occur with flash video, or flash animation and having a few tab opened..
