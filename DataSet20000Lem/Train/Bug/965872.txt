Created attachment 8368027
actor

This bug is for the backend of the storage tool.

This bug will cover the first iteration of the actors.

Attaching patch with:
- The main storage actor
- Three child actor : cookies, local storage and session storage.

For version 1, we are targeting read only. So the patch:

- Allows you to query and get all host and cookies/local storage items/session storage item
- All child iframes/windows etc are also listed.
- Gives live update on any change in the above three.

The detailed protocol definition is present at https://etherpad.mozilla.org/storage-inspector-protocol

Things to do:
- Lot of duplicate code
- On some sites, local(session)storage check for the dom-storage2-changed event are not working properly because of how it is implemented right now.
- The update event should be batched.
- Add comments.
- Cookies created via Set-Cookie header from network call are not accessible. There is no way to link these cooky to the current web page a the domain of those cooky is different and platform doe not link them to the current page domains.
- Make sure the actor work in chrome mode.
- Make sure the actor work across product (android, FxOS etc)


Here is a little script to see the actor in action : https://gist.github.com/scrapmac/8714857
