I would like to (humbly) ask ... nay, probably "beg" is a more appropriate verb ... the Firefox development team to consider the development of a "Merge" bookmark feature in the Bookmark Organizer. Personally, I see the implementation a very low-profile UI -- simply a "merge" contextual item that would appear when more than one folder is selected within the Bookmark Organizer.

Once selected, it would merely merge the content of the selected bookmark folders.

This can be accomplished somewhat by a cut-and-paste of bookmark items, but that process becomes ornery and annoying when attempting to merge, say, 10-15 bookmark folders. Being able to select the folders, right-click and pick a "merge" contextual item would be quite convenient.

(How do I end up with 10-15 bookmark folders? I tend to bookmark all tab open in a window before closing a Firefox window for one reason or another -- whether I am shifting to another subject or closing down for lunch or for the night.)

Reproducible: Always
