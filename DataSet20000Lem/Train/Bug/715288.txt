Actual results:

When presented with the Restore Session window, one can choose which windows, or which tab in a particular window to restore. However there is something missing from the options.

Consider the screenshot attached below. It show two window with a couple of tab in each window. One can choose to restore all tab by clicking the Restore button but that will open an additional window. There should be an option to restore all tab in the same window. Perhaps you can add a button "Restore All tab in the same window" or something of that sort.

Several scenario exist where such a functionality is not only necessary but also essential. Here is one. Suppose one run firefox on a virtual machine with limited resource and for a particular reason the user ha opened enough window to freeze the virtual machine. Then the only option left is force quitting firefox. Upon reopening firefox, the user is presented with the Restore Session option and all closed tab are desired to be restored. However if the user press the restore button, all those window will reopen again and the VM will freeze again. However if an option to restore all tab in one window is available, the machine will be able to handle the task or restoring the tab without freezing.

Perhaps I went overboard with my extensive writing already but another reason this feature is needed is simply simplicity and time-saving. Often times, one find themselves inadvertently with a few open windows, each containing a dozen tab and want he want to have all tab in the the same window. With the existence of such an option he can force quit firefox and then in session restore choose the aforementioned option.
