I have absolutely no use for the Bookmarks Toolbar, yet I can't get rid of the
associated "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder". I can rename it, move it into another
folder, and change the description, but for some stupid reason or another I
can't delete it. Even if I delete it by editting my bookmarks.html file the
damned thing still show up next time I use my bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Method one:
1. Start Bookmarks Manager
2. Select the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder
3. Attempt to delete the useless thing

Method Two:
1.) Close FireBird
2.) Open Bookmarks.html with your favourite text editor
3.) Delete the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.
4.) Save the file.

Actual Results:
Method one:
Using the "delete" key on the keyboard ha no effect.
The "Delete" button on the Bookmarks Manager toolbar is disabled and can't be used.

Method two:
No sign of the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder exists in Bookmarks.HTML, yet the
stupied thing is still there next time you start FireBird and use your bookmarks.

Expected Results:
Deleted the folder.
