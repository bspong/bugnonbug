How about adding a feature that would allow user to open all the link painted
with mouse in new tab or windows. Many page contain a list of link that must
be clicked individually to see the content of the page but if user could open
multiple link with a couple of mouse move it would become easy to see such pages.

Instead of tab it could be handy to have link opened in a new kind of a
viewing system. The system could be something like a normal image viewing
program (without thumbs, only slides) but it would display web content. There
would be a list (not necessary visible) of site that are to be viewed with this
page viewer. User then click next and previous button to view through all the
pages. Maybe user should be able to drop out non interesting links.

An example about the first and the latter combined.

User enters a FTP-directory containing multiple images. Instead of clicking them
all, user paint all the files, chooses "viewer" from the right button menu and
then is able to view the image easily in one browser window. This would work
for web page containing image url catcher etc. After dropping out poor image
user could then press choose "save files" making a nightmare to be easy downloading.
