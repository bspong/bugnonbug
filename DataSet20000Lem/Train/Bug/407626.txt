For a long time, I kept a user-made toolbar on my Firefox 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 installation to hold button that I do not use, but which I must skin in my themes. When I wasn't checking these button for correctness of skin, I would keep the toolbar hidden. When Firefox wa started, the user-added toolbar would not be visible. It would only be visible if I checked it in the View > Toolbars menu or in the toolbars context menu.

Some time in October or November, this toolbar started showing up when I started Firefox. I figured I had a conflict with an extension or a corrupted localstore.rdf file.

Today, I tested that hypothesis with a clean profile. Same results: a user-added toolbar show up on Firefox startup, even when it ha been deslected on the toolbar list.

The toolbar for the All-In-One Sidebar extension doe not have this problem: it is only visible when I tell it to be visible.

Reproducible: Always

5. Un-check the new toolbar from the context menu.
6. Close and restart Firefox.

This behavior started some time in October or November of 2007.
