I finally found the reason for a problem I had for a long time with FF 2 (and possibly also with 1.5).

Pop-up window always appeared narrow - no matter if they were without specific dimension or with specified width and height.

It turn out that when there are many taskbar icons, no matter what add-on they belong to, the width of pop-up shrinks. The more such icon are there, the narrower pop-up appear. I made thorough tests, and found out that this wa the problem.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install a large number (say 8-9-10) add-on that add taskbar icons.

(I made sure it doe not matter which add-on are used. Mine are:
colorzilla, fasterfox, firebug, html validator, zotero, TMN, scrap book, server spy, google notebook.)

2. click a link that open a new resized window, preferably narrow one, so the effect is clearly visible.

3. You can gradually enable or disable these add-on to see the how this effect pop-up behavior.
Actual Results:
sized pop-up appear much too narrow.

Expected Results:
sized pop-up should appear with the dimension specified by the javascript command that open them.

sized pop-up should appear with the dimension specified by the javascript command that open them.
