I have tried to log on to my account on ANZ and Colonial First State. I get the main web page, but when I click on the Log on button, nothing happens. Other button in the window don't work either.

Also, when I close down Firefox it doesn't seem to shut down properly even though I click on Quit and not to save the tab that it say are open, even though none are open. When I restart Firefox, it tell me there were more tab open and sorry that it can't find them. However, I had closed all the tab before closing Firefox except my homepage one.

When I click the Quit and Save button, even though there is only one tab open - having closed all the others - Firefox will not reopen when I click on the Icon on the desktop.

This same problem is happening to me. I use several site that pop up window for special us through javascrip. Starting with Ff 3.6.3 they have all stopped working and unchecking the "block popups" option doe not help.

I have also noticed that once Ff encounter this situation... i.e. block a popup, it stop working correctly. For instance Google on the bookmark toolbar will no longer work and, when I close down Ff it can not be restarted. The latter is remedied by going to the Windows Task Manager, Processes tab, and locating Firefox and ending that process... Ff is not shutting down properly after this situation.
