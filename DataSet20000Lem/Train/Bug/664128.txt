Firefox accumulates memory indefinitely after visiting a website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Disable all plugins
2. Close Firefox
3. Start Firefox and check for enabled plugins. If there are such go to step 1, else close Firefox and continue to step 4
4. Start Firefox in safe mode
5. Maximize the Firefox window
6. Navigate to gamespot.com
7. Click "Click here to continue to GameSpot" on the page
8. Wait the next page to load fully
9. Minimize the Firefox window

Actual Results:
Increase of the Firefox memory usage - after about 4 hour and 20 min the private memory of Firefox reached 500 MB. The following image obtained with Process Monitor show the memory usage of Firefox for that time interval:

Expected Results:
Constant or near constant memory usage within a reasonable bound. I didn’t observe accumulative memory usage pattern with Google Chrome 12.0.742.91.

I instructed Firefox to generate nspr log file in the beginning. Leak Gauge didn't find leak in this log file. The attachment contains the information from about:memory obtained at the end of the test.
