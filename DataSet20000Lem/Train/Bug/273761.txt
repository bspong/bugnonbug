Yahoo! game (Poker in my case) fails with some kind of Java error even though
Java is enabled. When I open the particular 'poker room' in Yahoo! It say
Java is not enabled, but it is. Then within seconds, Firefox fails. This did
not happen ever before Monday. Now it is also happening if I use Netscape a
well. Neither happened previously to Monday.

This happens every time and usually force me to restart my iBook. Yahoo!s
response wa that Games do not work with newer version of Netscape or any
version of Firefox. Since I have been using both for month without any issue
at Yahoo! Games, I wonder if they changed something. They do say I can use an
older version of Netscape, but why?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Yahoo! Games
2. Select Hold'em Poker, and a new window open with the different game available
3. Before displaying, it get an error with Java then crash Firefox

Actual Results:
Crashes Firefox and usually force a complete restart of my iBook

Expected Results:
Open and play

Additionally, Talkback is now refusing to send the error report, the queue just
keep building up and never is able to send.

If this can not be addressed, I will need to find another browser to work
with...I can not keep having the machine crash.
