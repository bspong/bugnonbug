Pop up ad windows(watch stream or video popups), when clicking on minimize maximize or close button stall firefox, the button flicker and make everything unstable. Right click wont come up with options, or right click on window to close, close button never highlights. When i end firefox in tast manager, say it is still running. Doesnt happend in IE

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. www.channelsurfing.net
2. click on one of the link to watch a stream
3. Overtime minimize maximize and close button wont work, make everything unstable
Actual Results:
Firefox can give in at anytime, causing instablitily with the software

Expected Results:
Able to close any window with out being unstable, rather it be popup, popup video or anything, only stall when pop window with ad or video, such at streamed video popups

Seems like popup video from private server website run by only a few people, not any big name website cause issues.
