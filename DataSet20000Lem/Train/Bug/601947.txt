Tab drop-down menu accessible in all tab BUT one

Tricky to explain. :-/
Doesn't even happen every time, nor do I know which criterion there are which decide whether the menu will be accessible or not.

With several tab open, it's sometimes necessary to close some of them because FF will go up 200 Meg memory use in no time (maximum wa 650 Meg!!) It usually happens if you are surfing on web site with a LOT of Flash stuff running.

That's when I encountered the issue described below.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
- Browse with Firefox 4 beta.
- Create LOTS of tab from web link (though 7 or 8 might already do)
- Check whether you can access the tab-specific context menu (Reload tab...Close Tab, 9 item in total) on *ALL* of the tabs.
Actual Results:
There are (rare) case where the drop-down menu is accessible via RIGHT mouse button for ALL tabs, but there are frequent case where you can press the button a much a you wish, with EXACTLY ONE (!) tab the menu won't appear.

Expected Results:
Drop-down menu must appear with ALL tabs, independently of condition whatsoever.

"Workaround" is

(built-in method)
- to open a new tab and manually "assign" the URL of the "broken" tab (i. e. the one with the non-working context menu) to the newly opened tab

- duplicate the tab using Twanno's Duplicate Tab extension, then delete the original "broken" tab
