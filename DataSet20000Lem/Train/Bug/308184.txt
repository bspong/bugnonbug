Tried to install 1.0.6 over my 1.0.4 (at your insistence!);
After eintirely eliminating my 1.0.4 installation (bugger!) the installer
gave an error message, something about -214 not being found.

The User Forum ha similar reports, but the only suggestion wa to delete the
file in Windows' Temp folder, which did not help a I still got the same error
message the second time I tried.

BTW, all I wanted to do wa to install an extension, but found that someone in
their infinite wisdom decided to not permit it until after I installed the
latest release. Now, I can't even use Firefox at all! Wouldn't it have been
kinder and more user friendly to relate old Extension version to the version
of FF that they'd work with--and permit access? Maybe I didn't really want to
be bothered with waiting on a full half-hour upgrade download, not to mention
the days(!) delay in trying to correct the mess someone's installer ha made of
my system. BTW2, the previous 1.0.4 installer worked like a charm!
