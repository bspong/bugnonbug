Flash control for video on site such a YouTube and Hulu do not appear to be working properly in the latest Firefox betas. For example, the pause button and video time index slider have no effect, a if they are receiving no input.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Youtube.com
2. Click on any movie
3. When the movie start to play, try to pause it or move the time slider. Nothing happens.

This also work with Hulu.com, although on Hulu it is *sometimes* possible to move the time slider - particularly if you get the thick control bar to come up. With the thin control bar, you can not affect the video's playback at all.
Actual Results:
Flash video control do not work, although the mouse work properly with other page elements.

Expected Results:
Video control should work.

I'm not positive if this is the result of a change in Firefox or something in Flash itself, but it did work until the latest betas, and flash hasn't been altered on my computer lately.
