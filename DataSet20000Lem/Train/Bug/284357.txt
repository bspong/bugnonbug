Since 2005-02-28. When opening a link to a secure site (https) in a *new tab*,
the location bar doesn't show the URL of the page. For example, command click on
a link to Bugzilla in Peter(6) nightly build thread
(http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=227465) to open it in a new tab.
The new tab open in the foreground, with the warning message (entering secure
page). The page load but the URL is not shown, and the reload button is not
shown. The reload menu item is greyed out. (see attached screen shot)

This is possibly related to bug 284130.

This only happens when the preference '
security.warn_entering_secure.show_once' is set to false (show warning message
every time)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Command click on a http link to open in a new tab (ie to Bugzilla)
2.New tab come to foreground, warning message show up (OK)
3.
Actual Results:
The page load correctly, but the location bar is empty and the Reload button and
menu item are disabled.

Expected Results:
The location bar should show the URL of the page. The Reload Button should be
active.

Both with my ususal profile and a plain default fresh new profile.
