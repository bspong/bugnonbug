I think we should seriously consider this type of adaptive learning. Another
difference is that the first match in Quicksilver is set a the default action
on enter (like Safari).

I'm not sure what the 5 delight item currently are, but what do people think about bumping the least interesting item for a quicksilver inspired adaptive learning algorithm in the location bar auto-complete? (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=395446)

For instance, if every time you type "ph" you select a bookmark called "phonebook", that result will be bumped up in the result for "ph" in the future, even if you have a bookmark called "phishing UI" that ha a much higher overall frecency than "phonebook."

The search in the location bar is already a killer feature, and I think this would streamline the interaction even more.

That sound like a good modification to the frecency algorithm to me.

alex, that'd be *very* cool. a this bug is closed, can you file a new bug,
clearly spec'ing out the behavior?

See also bug 370117: it ha a patch that make u keep a record of how many
time a form history autocomplete entry are used, so that we can sort them by
frequency of use in the dropdown. That patch implement a formhistory-specific
API, but we could instead modify nsIAutocompleteResult to enable the
autocompletecontroller to notify the nsIAutocompleteSearch implementation of a
selected result, and have it record that data and take it into account when it
performs searches.
