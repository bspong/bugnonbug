I wa saving picture from (http://www.scifi.com/atlantis/gallery/index.php?cat=season03) by dragging them from the firefox window to a Finder window. After about 50 images, I wa no longer able to drop the image on the Finder window. It looked like the drag and drop wa happening, but the file wa never dropped in the finder folder. When I opened up a new tab and tried to go to another site, I wa unable to go to another site (entering the URL produced no action and the page wa blank--like the site wasn't responding). I opened another tab and went to google, which didn't work either. I then tried to quit firefox and I wa unable to quit firefox. I eventually had to Force Quit firefox.

The behavior is almost like the drag and drop action onto a Finder window is walking over memory and may eventually cause enough damage that firefox no longer function properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.scifi.com/atlantis/gallery/index.php?cat=season03
2. Open up a Mac OS X Finder window.
3. Drag the picture from the firefox window to the Finder window.
4. Select NEXT in the firefox window to go to the next picture.
5. Loop on this process by going back to Step 3 and continuing each step.
6. Eventually, after about 50 steps, the dragged picture will no longer drop into the Finder window. I dragged several more time after it stopped working.
7. Open a new tab and try to go to a new URL like yahoo.com or google.com
8. The new tab window should remain blank.
9. Try to press the x, to close the tab window
10. Try to "Quit Firefox"
Actual Results:
Drag and drop picture no longer save in the Finder window and I can no longer go to a new URL in a tab. If I open several tabs, I had trouble closing them. The tab appear to still be there (the x show up) but there is no outline of the tab. If I choose "Quit Firefox", firefox remains and doe not quit.

Expected Results:
I would expect the drag and drop to work (even after numerous dnd actions), I would also expect that opening a tab would still work and that asking Firefox to quit would still work.
