I always place my Live Bookmarks in a folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar. Live Bookmarks of similar type and/or origin are put together in subfolders. The name of this folder (RSS-feeds) is visibel at the right hand side of the folder icon.

If FF is updated, the name of this folder disappears. Right Click and selecting Properties give a window with the name: Properties for "(null)"

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add new folder to the Bookmarks Toolbar
2. put Live Bookmark in it
3. update FF
4. restart FF
Actual Results:
Name of folder with Live Bookmarks is removed. Folder is still there and the content seems unaltered.

Expected Results:
The name of the folder should not have been removed.
