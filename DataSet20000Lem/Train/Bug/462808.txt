I began having this problem since v3.0. Many time web page take forever to start loading, or won't finish, unless I minimize firefox and then restore it. Every time I do this, the page is finished loading. If I don't do it, it will get "stuck" in loading pages. I also noticed, this happens much le frequently, if the "Always show the tab bar" option is unchecked.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the "Always show the tab bar" option in firefox.
2. Try to load a web page.
3. Doesn't load or get "stuck" trying to load it and take longer, seems to load perfect once you minimize and restore firefox.
Actual Results:
After I did that, most web page took much longer to load.

Expected Results:
Should load page normally a it did in version before 3.0.

I'm really not sure why it doe this. I've narrowed down to the "Always show the tab bar" option. I tried everything else, and I'm sure this is it. I know it's not another option or setting or add-on. I'm also not sure why minimizing and maximizing would help, but it does. It seems like it force the page to load when they won't otherwise. It is le frequent when "always show the tab bar" is off, but still annoying.
