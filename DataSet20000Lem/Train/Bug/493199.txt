Need API for addon to hook into a Sanitizer
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pl; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The sanitizer is designed to clean all private data when needed. Unfortunately it work only for main application and not for addons. It is possible to hook into it but it is unofficial way of doing it. What I would like to propose is to allow addon programmer to respond to user selecting Tools/Clean private data in order to remove log file and other potentially sensitive data.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+DEL
2. Tick everything and allow Firefox to clean private data
Actual Results:
Firefox private data is cleaned. Private data stored by addons is NOT. There is no official way for an addon author to respond to "sanitize" event.

Expected Results:
Both Firefox and addon private data is cleaned. It is impossible to tell which site were visited and what password were entered before cleaning.

This proposal is due to the discussion with Adblock plus author - see

Note! This is NOT a problem with Adblock. Adblock should only be considered an example of an addon that could benefit from such an API.
