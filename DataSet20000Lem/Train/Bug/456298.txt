i have a data only disk (winxp) that is sleeping 90% of the day unless accessed. when i launch firefox, it wake the disk a if it need to read something from it, but the drive is not used for swap, temp files, bookmarks, settings, or anything. firefox in fact will work fine with the drive disconnected. why the need to scan the disk if it's not reading anything from it?

i've heard of the same bug under ubuntu where firefox will even wake up sleeping networked drive on other computers.

dont believe the past version did this. although there are other piece of software that do the same thing (outside of diagnostics/file explorer where scanning attached drive is expected.)

wouldn't mind keeping firefox open all the time to prevent this, but gotta clear memory leak now and again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. sleep attached hard disk
2. launch firefox

Actual Results:
disk woke from sleep

Expected Results:
let sleeping disk lie

haven't tried different sleep mode in bios.

a far a i understand it, firefox is likely just using a standard library or somesuch that ha this behavior built in. scanning a disk under any sleep mode should wake it up. i think the problem is with the scanning of the disk.
