I scanned a document and split it into individual image of word using my Image Reflow utility http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/notes/#reflow and put this on a web server and pointed Firefox at it. The page loaded OK no problem. Unfortunately, the web server later went down, and I urgently needed to get the document across to a different computer. The only copy I had now wa in Firefox's memory. So I set Firefox to Work Offline and tried File / Save As. That is, attempting to save a page that ha hundred of image in it. Result, I got hundred of blank dialogs, and not all image were saved (about 200 of them were saved OK, the rest were not). They are all present and correct in the browser window so I know they must be there somewhere. I don't know what determines which one were saved OK and which were not.

The blank dialog box had no message, just 2 button (with no label on the button either). The Downloads window cannot be clicked on due to the dialog boxes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page with hundred (preferably thousands) of small image
2. Work offline. Verify all image are still there in the browser window.
3. Save the page
Actual Results:
Not all image saved; hundred of blank dialog box are displayed.

Expected Results:
All image that were in the memory should be saved; no blank dialog box should be displayed (or at least the dialog box should be informative).
