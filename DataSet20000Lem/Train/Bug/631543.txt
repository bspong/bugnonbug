Pinch zooming work in 3.6+, but appears to have been unassigned in 4.0b*pre

For example, in 3.6 the pref "browser.gesture.pinch.in" ha a default value of "cmd_fullZoomReduce" which result in a zoom out. FF4.0b7pre and later (maybe earlier too? Haven't checked yet...) appear to have this and several other gesture blank by default.

I can suggest default value to return the zoom pinch to their previous function, but I suspect a dev somewhere ha better answer for this, and maybe even a reason they were unassigned?

Either way, this is a potential problem for tablet and Mac users.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF4.0b7pre or later
2. Attempt pinch zoom gesture with or without shift modifier
3. ...
Actual Results:
Pinch gesture do nothing.

Expected Results:
Pinch gesture should do something. My preference would be zoom (I'm pretty sure this universally accepted function at current time)

...with adoption of tablet hardware, this could be a biggie for the 4.x release.
