On either HTMLDocument type or XMLDocument type Mozilla Firefox is not consistent with returning a viable XPath Result node set via document.implementation

Attached shortly will be some sample code with expected result versus actual result similar to the MDC wiki pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.XPath d.evaluate doesn't return an XPath Result on a document.implementation
2.See attachment for sample code
3.getElementById work but XPath Result node set not found
Actual Results:
getElementById work but XPath Result node set not found

Expected Results:
Several developer are expecting document.evaluate to return the XPath Result node set yet there are multiple instance where this is not working.

I'm hoping implementation of the code is correct a I've spent several week discussing this among other developers, reading ton of article and chatting on other forums. Please be kind if there is something incorrect about the code and any suggestion would be highly appreciated.

Clean profile used in all test case under 3.5.X to 3.6.X (and even one nightly 3.7 build earlier this month)
