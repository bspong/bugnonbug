worked fine up untill last night, now any page I try to open say "Server Not Found"
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.11) Gecko/20071127 Firefox/2.0.0.11

It is not a firewall issue. I have tried the troubleshooting offered by firefox.
I cannot view any webpage. it tell me Server not found. it happens with every website. it happens even if I reload. this happened once before abut I had a virus and had to start over. nothing is wrong with Netscape or IE, I can browse the web on them but NOT on firefox, I checked my connection settings, I have not changed a THING about my PC it just WILL NOT work anymore.
this is an example of the recurring message i get:

Firefox can't find the server at us.f322.mail.yahoo.com.
* Check the address for typing error such a
ww.example.com instead of
www.example.com

* If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer's network
connection.

* If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure
that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
