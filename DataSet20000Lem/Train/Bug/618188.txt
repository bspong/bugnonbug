browser-chrome: browser_600545.js (and _601955.js) intermittently time out
The browser chrome test browser_600545.js intermittently time out and then cause a few other error afterward saying "found a tab after previous test timed out"

Zpao wa saying that it might be a listener being removed too late when a tab is closing. The test wa found to be flaky in running solo mode a well on bug 600545.

also there are some odd warning scattered about the logs: "NetworkPrioritizer.jsm, line 117: reference to undefined property aBrowser.webNavigation" too, which may not be related. Filing a separate bug on that too.

aBrowser.webNavigation"
