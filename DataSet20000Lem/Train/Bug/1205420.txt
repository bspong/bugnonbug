>> Does the application provide user with notice and control?

Users are fully in control to start and stop screen sharing at any time.
We currently require user to install a Firefox add-on to whitelist our application, which is a step we would like to remove to improve the user experience.

When the local screen is being captured and shared, the UI clearly reflects this state.

Please let u know if anything need to be altered to comply with the whitelist policy.
