Javascript is inefficient
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0

Steps to reproduce:

Sites that use Javascript can be very slow and greedy with CPU usage. Though the resource monitor indicates that only one CPU (of four) is at 100% usage, FF is mostly or totally unresponsive until whatever JS is looping is complete.

Some examples:

The current Lastpass plugin.

This is a good example although you need a subscription. It is the DVD queue listing.

Actual results:

While the site (or plugin) is loading, or thinking, FF is barely responsive, sometimes not at all. This doe not occur on site that use no or very little JS. The CPU monitor show that one CPU (of four) is at 100% usage.


Expected results:

Some of the time is downloading library and markup. However, the network monitor show only a brief activity while FF continues to apparently do nothing for a few to ten of seconds.

But since other browser (Chrome, Opera) can load these site much more quickly, without the unresponsiveness, I suspect an inefficiency in Javascript.
