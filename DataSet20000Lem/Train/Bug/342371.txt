Windows Media Player Does not close properly when the window is closed via extention.

When viewing a web page with an embedded Windows Media Player file, and the File page is closed other then through close tab, or close Firefox(the x), or sometimes even refreshed the following is displayed:

"
Windows Media Player Plug-In Dynamic Link Library

The plug-in performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to restart Firefox
[] Don't show this message again during this session.
"
I can reproduce this about 75% of the time.
After this bug Firefox becomes uslessly slow, and often us 100% of prossesor power.

When you close Firefox completly it leaf a phantom Firefox running preventing running again unless you either terminate the phantom Firefox, or restart the computer.(see attatched screenshots)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install the Extention: All-In-One guestures at http://perso.orange.fr/marc.boullet/ext/extensions-en.html
or through Mozilla Update
2.Go to http://www.imagevine.com/l-videoclips-top.aspx
3.Open a video by clicking on View
4.Close it via the extention(hold right-click in the space below the video and draw an L)

Actual Results:
Displays:
"
Windows Media Player Plug-In Dynamic Link Library

The plug-in performed an illegal operation. You are strongly advised to restart Firefox
[] Don't show this message again during this session.
"
And in near hang condition

Expected Results:
Properly terminated Windows Media Player

I would classify this a an extention problem, but I have experianced this, to a lesser degree, by reloading. Very irritating Bug.
