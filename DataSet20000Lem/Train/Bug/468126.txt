crash within 1 min of loading gmail account,
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: latest firefox 3 downloaded 12/4/08 unsure of detail of build

best I can do to help is a follows:
no key stroke beyond the login to gmail.com required to crash, no crash file created. am also running "noScript" plugin. firefox 2.0.0.14 run fine with NoScript. Have fallen back to that level. Reproducible at will.

other web site seem to work however (checked 4 I use regularly because gmail wa number 5 that loaded.)

I am sorry I did not write down the address of crash. But I had a time dependent task to respond to so I fell back quickly.
I down loaded FF3 yesterday and installed but it started so that I did not need to login to gmail until today. FF3 ran fine all night until I shut down and rebooted Win2000. Only difference wa the login to gmail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox 3, load www.gmail.com, enter Id and passwd, hit button, directory of email load, one get the time to read 4 or 5 summary line (not open just in directory) and boom! without doing anything else. I repeated it 4 time including rebooting system between first 2 and last 2 times.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Crash with box that say no crash file generated


Expected Results:
kept working

I would have to reinstall ff3 to get more detail

can not tell if related the other win 2000 crash bug in list a it is for much older version and the detail look different.
