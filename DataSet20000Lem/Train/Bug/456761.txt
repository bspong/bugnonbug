After the patch for Bug 448939 landed, the URL bar ha lost the "level" attribute. This "level" attribute is very important because:

1. Firefox 3.0 ha removed the "yellow" URL bar indication for secure URLs, but many user are using customization CSS code to bring back this color indicator following the tendency from Google Chrome and Internet Explorer. Without this attribute no CSS code are possible to do this.

2. Firefox 3.0 ha implemented the Security UI based on two things: A colored button inside the urlbar and "Larry". I'm sure most of FF user ha never meet "Larry", and the only visible indicator for a secure URL is indeed the button. With the level attribute it's possible to third party theme to indicate the secure level for a location in many other ways. How the indication look should be a skin choice.



Reproducible: Always




The level attribute doesn't hurt if maintained and is very useful, so please let it be...
