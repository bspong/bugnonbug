i have a standard form that people post some values. On the next page they see confirmation details. What i would like is to have a simple button that close this page. Since they have an "x" button to close the form why not provide them a nice button that will close the current page ? It not logical for me that this is restricted since we are talking about a user event, not something automatic.

If you wish to secure this then it would be better to provide a nice alternative. i.e. register window from browser history (from the post form) and then be able to close. Otherwise how can i do it ? I can not call window.open a you realize to post values.

I appreciate your answers.
