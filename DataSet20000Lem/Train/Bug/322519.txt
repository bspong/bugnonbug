Sometimes when using an HTML accesskey, it will act on a tab which isn't currently focused.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load multiple tab with page which have HTML accesskey features.
2. Ctrl-Tab between the tabs. Switch to other application with hotkeys. Return to Firefox.
3. Use an accesskey.

Actual Results:
Occasionally the accesskey will be sent to a previously-focused tab, and not the currently-focused one.

Expected Results:
The focused tab should have the accesskey sent.

I have not attempted to reproduce this in safe more, but will if asked: http://kb.mozillazine.org/Safe_mode

This is related to all sort of other problem I've seen in the past with tabbed browsing displaying a page but not having that page a focused. It isn't only accesskeys which will not work under these circumstances, but other regular keys.. like space for moving down a page, or control-w for closing a tab (which won't do anything).

Because there are other way to reproduce this effect, this report may well be a duplication of an existing report. My searching ha not come up with anything related though.

The workaround is to click with the mouse on the body of the page. Then space, accesskeys or ^w will work a expected on the currently-focused tab.
