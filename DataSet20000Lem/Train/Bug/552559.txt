searching from search bar (google - and logged in) - default to IP address rather than signed in state

When searching from the search box (google selected) from a different country, the search will run with the local country's google page rather than user preference even if logged in under a google account (the local page doe not recognize the login either).


Example:
search typed: "english pages" (no quotes)
conditions: logged in to google.com (us account) with English preference set, sitting at a hotel in Belgium
yields: http://www.google.be/search?q=english+pages&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
problem: no translation option given
checked database for other bug similar: yes. There are two other bug with a similar issue but not tied to searching from the search bar itself (rather from the location bar - though the fix may be the same) and related more to wanting local language (bug rather than a consistency flaw with google search integration). Neither bug connected sufficiently to warrant adding to it.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have a google account in one location
2. use an ip from another google local area
3. search from the search bar
(see below for an explicit example)
Actual Results:

Example:
search typed: "english pages" (no quotes)
conditions: logged in to google.com (us account) with English preference set, sitting at a hotel in Belgium
yields: http://www.google.be/search?q=english+pages&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a
problem: no translation option given
checked database for other bug similar: yes.

Neither bug connected sufficiently to warrant adding to it.


Expected Results:
The software should have maintained awareness of the google cookie specifying language preference and logged in state rather than ignoring it.
