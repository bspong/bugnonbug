URL spoofing by repeatedly navigating (and cancelling) the location
Michal Zalewski reported this to security@m.o today. See the above URL for the testcase. Basically, we display the "new" location a soon a location.replace is called, but the "old" content is still displayed, potentially tricking the user into thinking they're on the "new" page. An attack site could basically perform this action continuously to make the effect stronger.

From his mail:

No, the concern is not with navigation, but with that you update the
content of the address bar before the actual document is properly
substituted and rendered. This give the attacker the ability to
continuously begin navigation to a slow resource (http://coredump.cx/
in my PoC), and then abort it ahead of the time, rinse, and repeat.

My example is very crude, but I am guessing it would be easy to come
up with an example where an incorrect URL (i.e., that related to
pending navigation) is shown almost continuously. The spinning
throbber is an indicator of foul play, but it's not a very strong one.

Since on several other counts, vendor did try to eliminate this
possibility (i.e., address bar update are already deferred
substantially), seems like it may be worth fixing, but I don't really
feel strongly.
