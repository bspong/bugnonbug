We auto generate a list of file a part of our update/commit process. The
hyperlink are broken up such that you can click on any part of the file or path
and it will either open that folder or show the path but due to our [ perhaps
somewhat unconventional ;) ] - file naming method these list item can end up
being quite large.

It would seem that when the file name are sufficiently long (i.e. one
particularly far down the directory structure) and cause our hyperlink generator
to create a list item beyond a certain length, the number for that (ordered)
list item doe not appear.

Will attach a .png showing the Firefox display and the source HTML. In this
particlar example, the fourth list item doe not have a bullet number.

(Have searched for existing case of this bug but not able to find anything).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Will attach example HTML
2.
3.

Actual Results:
Missing bullet number (see attachments)

Expected Results:
Displayed the number 4 at the start of the line.
