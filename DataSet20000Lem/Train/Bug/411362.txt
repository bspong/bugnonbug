I have a div with overflow: auto and height: 215px. The div hold a dynamic grid (row count is dynamic but width is static). On page load, the div will render extra whitespace at the bottom of the last row (approx 70px extra in height and the width remains just fine). When I simply right-click on the the div (usually on the white space), the extra whitespace disappears! From that point on, everything is fine and this doe not occur. It is hard for me to consistently reproduce the step to make this reoccur. When I figure out more I will revisit this bug report. Thanks!

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start server
2.visit page with div
3.see error only sometimes, not every time :(
Actual Results:
error doe not happen every time.

Expected Results:
unfortunately doe not happen every time. will investigate further and post findings.

The grid is dynamically built from reading a collection (java), parsing the collection and creating HTML element to be used in the grid. i can send a simple screen shot of the problem if possible. thanks.
