Over 100 Tabs - Grab/Move one and Gnome Cursor freeze and no Keyboard or Mouse - OS still run

OpenSolaris 2008.11 running FF3.0.4 with ~119 Tabs open freeze Gnome
when a Tab is grabbed and moved. The "|\" Cursor remains 'stuck' on
and neither the Keyboard or Mouse operate.

My "Hardware" is VirtualBox 2.1.2 (updated / installed a few day ago).


If I use my Reset switch then OpenSolaris' Gnome Desktop will popup the
"[Restart] [Cancel] [Shutdown]" Dialog with the 60 second countdown but
since the Keyboard and Mouse don't get control I need to wait for the
timeout to get the default action (shutdown).

If I have other program running (that have screen output) I can see that
they are still working even though I can't use the Keyboard or Mouse.

This is a similar issue to 458048 in that another Bug Report about
"many tab crashing" wa set a a dupe to 458048 but that one is different
and closed: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=458048

I need to reboot my OS and reopen Firefox (and choose to reopen all
the Tabs) in order to get control back. If I don't move a Tab and close
some I should be OK.

Where could I find "crash-logs" if it doe not actually "crash"?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open approx. 120 Tabs (easy to do if your working on half a dozen things).
2. Wait until all Tabs are loaded and right-click-drag one.
3. The Cursor will change to the "Drag-Cursor" and not change back
4. The Keyboard and Mouse freeze.
Actual Results:
The Keyboard and Mouse freeze. Need soft / hard reset.

Expected Results:
I should be able to grab the Tabs and move them around. It work
perfectly well with much fewer Tabs.
