Raw MIME type should be displayed in Open/Save Dialog, not only human readable file type description
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20051221 Firefox/1.0.7

Klicking on a link with a MIME type that cannot be opened by FF show a dialog where I can choose to save the file or maybe open it in another helper app. The Description of the file type seems to be derived from the extension, not the MIME type. It is taken from some kind of registry or if no match is found it is constructed by capitalizing the file extension.

On the internet, generally the MIME type is more important than the file extension, so I suggest that the mime type is displayed to the user a well, maybe instead of the current text, maybe in addition to it. For protocol where no MIME type is available (FTP, file, ...), the MIME type might be omitted, displayed a "unknown", derived from the registry or whatever approach you prefer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Klick link to extension displayable by FF or a plugin and some unrecognized or save-only MIME type.
E.g. *.pdf sent a application/octet-stream

2. Klick link with unknown MIME type and known but non-unique file extension.
E.g. *.dat for application/ms-tnef (from bug #293804)
Actual Results:
1. FF describes the File a a "PDF File" but doe not open it inline.
It is difficult for an average user to guess where this different behaviour doe come from.

You have chosen to open foo.pdf which is a: PDF File
(*) open using acroread ( ) save to disk

2. FF show the (probably incorrect) file type description known for this extension, but doe not offer the MIME type, which hopefully would be unique and might be of more use to the user.

You have chosen to open bar.dat which is a: MS Video File
(*) open using mpeg player ( ) save to disk


Expected Results:
1. "foo.pdf is of type application/octet-stream and would be handled by your OS a a PDF File"

2. "bar.dat is of type application/ms-tnef and would be handled by your OS a a MS Video File"
