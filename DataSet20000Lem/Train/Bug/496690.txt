I used to think FIREFOX wa great, so much faster than IE.... now... I have had enough of FIREFOX... It take forever to load, constantly show "FIREFOX NOT RESPONDING " MESSAGES & FF open with the update page & my homepage.... IS ANYONE GOING TO FIX THIS ?????? I WANT A TRUE FIREFOX SUPPORT...
N O T some forum where 10 people give you 20 different reason for stuff & wind up argueing amoung themselfs.....

in three week I have gotten NO help from the forum sites... leaving me & I'm sure others feel this too a just left by the wayside, just left hanging... WHERE IS SOME TYPE OF PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT
