Suppose you have a page with multiple set of radio buttons. In the middle of the page, suppose that you have a hidden set of text field that are used for a template (i.e. something that can be cloned and replicated at will upon a user action, such a a row in a dynamic list). On the page's onload handler, a script us cloneNode to grab the element and then call removeChild to remove the node that wa cloned from the DOM.

Upon a normal refresh of the page (not shift-refresh), the checked state of the radio button that follow the cloned/removed node are off by the number of input that were a part of the node that wa removed. Shift-refresh restores the state.

More information and a test case can be found at http://people.rpath.com/~scott/cabinet/cloneremovebug.html

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://people.rpath.com/~scott/cabinet/cloneremovebug.html
2. (optional) Change the checked state of one or both set of the radio button
3. Refresh the page (not shift-refresh).
Actual Results:
Note that the second set of radio button do not retain the checked state, while the first one does.

Expected Results:
Both set of radio button would retain their checked state after refresh.
