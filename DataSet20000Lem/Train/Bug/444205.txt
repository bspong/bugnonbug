If the location bar or the search bar ha focus, there is no easy way (using the keyboard) of returning focus to the main browser pane. The only way I can think of is to hit control-shift-F6, but even this is not ideal, since it won't return focus to the exact place you had originally (e.g., if you were in the middle of editing a text box).

My suggestion is to have "Esc" return the focus, and perhaps have a dedicated keyboard shortcut a well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://www.google.com
2. Type a few letter into the input box on the page
3. Hit control-L
4. Hit "Esc"
5. Hit control-shift-F6
6. Type a few more letter
Actual Results:
After step 4, nothing happens.
After step 5, a dotted line appears around the entire tab pane.
After step 6, Quick Find bar pop up, and new text is not added to input box on the page.

Expected Results:
After step 4 (and step 5), focus should return to the input box on the page.
After step 6, new letter typed should be appended to the text already in the input box.
