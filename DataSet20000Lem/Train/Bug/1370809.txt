Firefox 53.x page loading stall at Avast account site, can't halt, script compatibility
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20170517122419

Steps to reproduce:

attempt open online account page at https://my.avast.com/en-ca/#home


Actual results:

With older version FFox (46,x) the Avast account page open normally.
With current version (53.0.3) page loading stall indefinitely, just show rotating "loading" symbol, and UI also becomes non-responsive to stop [x] button (test ran for 4 hrs, multiple test done over several days).


Expected results:


The online account page should have come up. Page wa saved both in stalled and unstalled situation on different platform and saved sample then opened with both most current and older edition of FFox (including also ed 52.1.2 esr). In all tests, only the current release (53.x) hung. At very least a script error msge should have appeared, and clicking stop button should have halted loading. (Note that reload button still worked, but same result, just hanging.) Tested in both W7 Pro SP1 and W10 platforms, same result. Have also advised Avast support of the problem. Saved page zipped and on file, available on request.
