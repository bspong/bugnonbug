download show file suffix a file type instead of Content-Type
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

This is similar to #282910. The firefox-0.8 and before doesn't have this
problem. I am not sure if firefox-0.9 ha this problem. But 1.0 and 1.04 a well
a the newest build have this problem.

I use a perl script to send file of different types, such a application/pdf,
video/quicktime, image/jpg etc. The image file are hadled correctly by the
browser, i.e. they are displayed in the window. But for pdf files, the download
window show up (as it should be), but the file type is shown a PL. Since the
firefox-0.8 handle it correctly, I am quite sure the server have sent the
correct Content-Type. To make it absolutely sure, I used a perl script (instead
of browser) to request the same URL and got the following header fields:
200
Connection: close
Date: Sat, 09 Jul 2005 05:20:25 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.26 (Unix) mod_perl/1.27
Content-Length: 26237
Content-Type: application/pdf
Client-Date: Sat, 09 Jul 2005 05:20:26 GMT
Client-Peer: 192.168.1.3:80
Client-Response-Num: 1

Looks like the download part mishandled the Content-Type and file suffix.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.server side: set up a perl script to send a pdf file with a header
Content-Type: application/pdf
2.use firefox browser to browse the script
3.

Actual Results:
In download window, it show PL file type.

Expected Results:
It should show application/pdf file type.
