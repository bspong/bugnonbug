When the FF window is dragged to the right of the screen, hiding the right part of the search box (the magnifying glass is at least partially hidden), if you type letter in the box, the suggestion window appears to the left (about 70 pixels) of the FF window _out_ of the window (instead of inside the window with the right of the box aligned with the right of the screen a expected). In the worst case, your window is still large enough (less than 70 pixel from the left border of the screen), the suggestion box can disappear to the left of the screen.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF windowed, move the window to the right of the screen until the magnifying glass is at least partially hidden
2. type letter in the search box

Actual Results:
The suggestion box appears about 70 pixel left of your FF window (outside of the window).


Expected Results:
The suggestion box should have appeared under the search box with it's right border close or touching the right border of the screen.


I tried the opposite: moving the Search box to the left, then moving FF to the left until the Search box disapperas. In this case, the suggestion appears to the left of the screen, inside the FF window (as expected).
