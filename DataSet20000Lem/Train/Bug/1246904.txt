Consider turning all eslint warning into error
I just realized that the ES job that run in our CI environment only fails if there are ESLint errors.
ESLint warning are fine, they don't fail the build.

This mean that it's possible to land a patch that remove some exclusion in .eslintignore even if the corresponding file still have warnings.

And this happened in bug 1242278.
Since that landed, all ESLint job report the following warnings:

TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:667:15 | "prev" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:680:15 | "next" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:958:25 | "added" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:1504:1 | Line 1504 exceeds the maximum line length of 80. (max-len)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:1519:13 | "container" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:2852:14 | "val" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)
TEST-UNEXPECTED-WARNING | devtools/client/inspector/markup/markup.js:2892:17 | "name" is already declared in the upper scope. (no-shadow)

I would like to argue that if we're going to turn a rule ON, we might a well make it report errors, not warnings.
I see very little purpose in having warning only if they're not going to be reported anywhere visible to developers.

When you're *writing* code, having warning and error in your IDE seems fine. As a developer you could use this information as: an error is something that just won't work if I test my code now (syntax error), and a warning is something that isn't really nice, and that I should fix before committing the code, but I can still work on my own thing before doing that.

This only work if both error and warning would fail the CI ESLint job.
If only error do, then we should just forget about warnings.
