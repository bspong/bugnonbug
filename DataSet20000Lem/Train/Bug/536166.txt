After automatic update, open page and tab are not restored from session before the update

However, I get no warning box when doing automatic nor manual shutdown of Firefox to permit updates. And the behaviour is the same, regardless of whether I shut down manually or automatically - all previous session tab are lost. Instead I get a default set of 4 tabs, my home page tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Receive an auto update
2. Ensure multiple tab are open and not just your defined home page tab
3. Shutdown either manually or automatically when prompted by Firefox.
4. Restart Firefox and check which tab are opened
Actual Results:
Only home page tab are open after restart, none of the other tab that were active in the previous session prior to the restart.

Expected Results:
The problem creates a strong disincentive for people to install updates. In user psychology, keeping my session tab is "my problem", doing update is "Firefox's problem". This problem force user to choose between the two alternatives. If forced to choose, they will choose not to update.

The software should remember, and restore, all tab from the previous session, even after a Firefox update.
