clicking on a hyperlink inside excel open a firefox window but the URL ha appended firefox/HTML/shell... This is not 100% consistent, but any time I close both excel and firefox, then open excel and click a hyperlink, it fails. This sequence work correctly 100% of the time in firefox 3.0.11 but not in 3.5 Please note that it doe not appear to be a window problem, this is in firefox 3.5. I can get it to work 100% of the time in IE and also in FF 3.0.11. It only fails in the new FF 3.5. I have two type of hyperlink in the excel sheet. The first is a standard ftp link of form ftp://xxx.yyy.zzz/ and the second is an html link of form html://xxx.yyy.zzz/. The html link is generated on the fly where the ftp link is embedded into the spreadsheet. Both type of link fail with the appending of firefox/HTML/shell... at the end of the URL in the address bar.
