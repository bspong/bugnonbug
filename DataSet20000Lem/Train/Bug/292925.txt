New window in extension open behind older ones.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en-US) AppleWebKit/125.4 (KHTML, like Gecko, Safari) OmniWeb/v563.34

To reproduce the problem, do the following. (The problem is the same from Bookmarks Synchronizer,
although it obviously need to open other windows).
1) Install syncmarks 0.3 extension
2) Click "Browse"
The file browsing window open behind the current window yet doe not have the focus and focus
cannot be moved to it. You have to close the SyncMarks window first, then click "OK", which is
obviously not what is needed here.

This might be related to bug 232605, but I cannot tell. I hope it is appropriate that I call this a "major
feature" that is broken, a it is the only reason I do not use Firefox. I use Omniweb because it doe
bookmark synchronization. Firefox cannot do this for me due merely to this one, old, outstanding bug.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Install syncmarks 0.3 extension
2) open synchmarks extension by double clicking it in the list of extensions.
2) Click "Browse"
Actual Results:
The file browsing window open behind the current window yet doe not have the focus and focus
cannot be moved to it. You have to close the SyncMarks window first, then click "OK", which is
obviously not what is needed here.


Expected Results:
Should have opened the file browsing window in front of the syncmarks window.
