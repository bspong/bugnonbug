any myspace profile just about with a custom design will not display correctly and it impossible to view certain part of the page. I know it is not code failure on the web developement side for myspace i do know that it is a failure in every version of firefox go to any myspace custom profile youll notice you cant scroll sideways to view the rest of it using internet explorer 7 there is no problem what so ever displaying the page in fact it doe it more neetly but since i think you software is not only great fast and secure but it is also antispyware protected and google is the home page You guy have it right on the money but people are still using internet explorer for thing like that. Im pretty sure it somewhere in your coding where it display java asp or custom html functions. my name is jim i write program myself and wanted to let you know. thanks
