If a website had poor bandwidth or is under a heavy load causing web page to load slow due to the lack of bandwidth, firefox will hang until that page is finished loading

Reproducible: Always

2.search for anything
3.using the mousewheel to open in new tab, open a few tab
4.firefox will hang (not responding to any click or anything) until those page are finished loading

Actual Results:
after doing the steps, you will see that firefox will become inresponsive to anything (hang) until the page are finished loading. and if the page don't load due to the site dropping a packet or crashing, then firefox will stay hung until you ctrl alt delete and close it

Expected Results:
What should the software have done instead of hanging? it should have waited to load the page with out hanging so i can do other work while the page are loading.
