As there is no way to ensure that Firefox leaf a JavaScript/Flash module enough time when the user close the browser window using the mouse, I am popping up an alert window upon "unload", so that my script can do final processing until the user ha closed the alert window.

However, on the Macintosh, Firefox sometimes doe not pop up this alert box at all, until the last browser window is being closed. Also, a soon a the alert box is closed by the user, the browser window that wa actually closed before (causing the unload event) pop up AGAIN (albeit completely empty in it client area). Finally, Firefox 2 even crash after this happens; at least Firefox 1.x doesn't crash at this point.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Simply use the following BODY tag in your HTML file, and open it with Firefox on Mac OS X:

<BODY onunload="javascript:alert('hello');">


Expected Results:
It would be nice for Firefox to pop up the alert window right away, and leave the window that caused the "unload" event closed. This is what happens under Windows.
