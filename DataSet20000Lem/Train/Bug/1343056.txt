Session Restore is broken due to recent regression in FF53 & FF54
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.88 Safari/537.36 Vivaldi/1.8.755.3

Steps to reproduce:

STR:
To reproduce the problem Use FF50 & FF54.

Also set setting: restore tab & window on restart
e10s on /off doesn't matter

now use this session-store file

https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqDeaDGj6aTxgb4MpSkzyOsD5grHNg

might not be totally sfw.

use FF50 and open the session.

to the right there are 75tabs & 2tabs to the left.

now click open tab to the right, especially the tab labeled new-tab.
They have site stored in them(NO DATA LOSS!)

now open the same session in FF54 and click tab and they are restored properly that is even new tab with data/no data loss.


But now the problem can be reproduced

now open the same session in FF54 and then close FF54 and start again

see the total number of tab they are reduced from , all tab which sometimes shown a new-tabs even with data are removed
IMPORTANT DATA LOSS

Now this is fairly common with default profile(except restore tab at start)
and a low speed/crap connection.
Like open multiple tab quickly on a page and the connection of isp ha low response and some page fail to load and tab are labelled a newtab(but stil contain data a they should of url and etc),
restarting FF50 doe not loose those tab but FF54 doe loose them.

Please Fix this to work like FF50 doe so none of the important data is lost due to improper connection or renaming to not properly loaded tab etc

I am sorry if wa not clear in my explanation.
if any more question are there i'll try to answer them.



Actual results:

This is a major regression and user updating will unknowingly suffer data loss!!

just use the same session in FF50 no loss of data
in FF54 no loss first time with same session(sessionstore file is ok and working properly)


but just use the same session in FF54 & restart FF54 twice and data loss.

And FF54 doe not save data which is incomplete/not totally correct
but is important still like
improperly loaded tab / not completely loaded tabs/ tab stopped loading for some other reason
and named new tab.
FF50 doe this properly & so did FF53 just before this bug wa filed & session store wa modified




Expected results:

https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqDeaDGj6aTxgb4NQiu_HtoNHAK0YA

Open in FF50 : 58 tab open and session is loaded properly.
Click on the tab named new tab & data is loaded properly=NO DATA LOST

open in FF53/54 : restart again
from 58 tab it go don to 19 tabs=IMPORTANT DATA IS LOST

58 tab to 19 tab

IDK why but FF50 data restore is VERY RELIABLE & FF54 is just not up-to the mark.
In normal browsing , incomplete tab and website which do not load properly or some reason FF crash etc then FF54 loos data & info unlike FF50 which no matter what keep all info & restores properly

The bunch of patch (Bug 1323987 and Bug 1306294) should be backed out.
