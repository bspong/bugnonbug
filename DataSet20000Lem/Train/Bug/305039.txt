Make Windows installer more 'Unicode-aware'
Currently, our installer on Windows show garbled string when the codepage
(character encoding) of an installer is different from the codepage for
'non-Unicode' application on Windows 2x/XP (and the default system codepage on
Windows 9x/ME). That's because it us 'A' version of Windows APIs even when
'W' APIs are available on Win 9x/ME (let alone Win 2k/XP). (e.g. |ExtTextOut|).

There are two consequences. The first is what's mentioned at the beginning of
this report. The other is that we can't make installers for language that are
not supported by any of legacy Windows codepages. For instance, Hindi or Tamil
installers can't be made.

To fix this, we need to replace |ExtTextOut| and alike with the corresponding W
APIs. In addition, translated string for each localized installer need to be
converted to UTF-8. A trickier part is how to deal with Windows APIs whose 'W'
version are not available on Windows 9x/ME unless MSLU is present (e.g.
SendMessage). It might be possible to define 'UNICODE' in 'Makefile' or
equivalent and to rely on the fact that MSLU is very likely to be available on
virtually all Windows 9x/ME (even then, we might have to know it location,
which is not easy)
