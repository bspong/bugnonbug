UI to recycle plugin container

The plugin-container.exe is an enormous resource (cpu and memory) hog when even simple flash applet appear, and it seems to have a tendency to slow down the entire browser permanently after being started. I don't know if that's because it repaints the window twice during scrolling or not, but anyway, I'd like to have a way to kill plugin-container and automatically restart it upon switching to a tab with a plugin. I have an older processor and a GPU with only 256M RAM, which occasionally cause Win7 slowdowns, so it might not be a bad for newer ones.

Alternately, a timed reload, once an hour or so. I suppose it would have to request permission to keep from killing thing like Pandora or Citrix.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load several site that have flash animation in tabs.
2. Close some of the tabs, load youtube, etc.
3. Go back to an all-text site, and notice how slow scrolling and tab switching are, even with no Flash on the page.
4. Check a tab with flash, compare to an instance of 3.5, and notice how much slower scrolling a page is in 4.0b7 than 3.5 when it scroll across the Flash area.
4. Close all tab with flash, and notice how much faster scrolling and tab switching becomes.
Actual Results:
Slow scrolling, very slow tab switching.

Expected Results:
Full speed scrolling on any page without Flash, and at least pre-3.6 scrolling speed on page with Flash.

Is there a way to turn GPU acceleration off so that I can test the effect of the GPU on page speed?
