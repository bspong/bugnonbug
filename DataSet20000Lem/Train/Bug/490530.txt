Undo FF3.5b4's removal of Close button in last remaining tab

In Firefox pre-3.5b4 if the tab wa the last one in it window, it would still have a close button, and it could be closed by Middle-Click, which wa very convenient (for me, at least), since I could quickly close a window I didn't need anymore.

Now, in Firefox 3.5 Beta 4, this button (and Middle-Click close functionality) is gone (like it wa in pre-3.0 a far a I remember), and I REALLY want it back.

Since I guess people will be against this (my personal experience with Microsoft, no offense to anyone), I suggest we (you?) let u choose -- make u a checkbox under Preferences/Settings/Options/Whatever-it's-called -> Tabs -> "Show Close button on last open tab" or smth like that.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1a. Click the close button in window's last remaining tab
1b. Middle-Click on window's last remaining tab
Actual Results:
Nothing, since there is no Close button and no Close-by-Middle-Click functionality for the last remaining tab.

Expected Results:
Window is closed (if it's the last window, Firefox quits)
