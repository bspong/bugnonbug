to the right of the word "ob·vi·ate" there is a flash mod (speaker) and to it's right there are image of the accented word spelling..
I read most of the page (definitions and usage) and the 'word images' where still not loaded. I did not know what type of item wa not loaded so I went through the page source to find out if I needed to install a 'plugin', svg, java, flash (already installed), well you get it. I did all this and i'm a very slow reader, before the image of the accented spelling showed up.. I actually watched them appear one by one, slowly and smoothly... actually kinda neat..
Anyway this go to another post.. 6.0x is loading page image very slowly.
load text and some element Very quick, but image of any kind.. these image are very small and where the last thing to load, a few minute after majority of page.
