When paying for item on ebay, click on paypal and the next step should take you to the paypal login page. Instead the browser take you to an EMPTY screen which simply display "Fatal Failure". I can no longer use Firefox to pay for item on ebay. In addition, I can no longer log into my online bank using Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to my ebay in order to pay for items.
2. Step thru ebay process to pay using Paypal.
3. Click to "go" to Paypal.
4. Screen (empty) read "Fatal Failure"
Actual Results:
I contacted both ebay and Paypal who both stated "browser error." Since I can login and pay using IE or Chrome, I have to agree with them. In addition, I can no longer log into my online bank account!

Expected Results:
I always get "Fatal Failure". I should have been taken to the Paypal login screen.

I can no longer login to my online bank account using Firefox. Ebay "add to watch list" button no longer function - read "Java(0)". Very odd.
