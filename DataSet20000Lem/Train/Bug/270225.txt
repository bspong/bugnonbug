White box appears in Rich Text Editor (WYSIWYG)

Something changed in the 1.0 release that caused this problem to occur in our
implementation of a Rich Text Editor. In the demo provided
(http://eval5.paperthin.com/demo/firefox/) you may not see it right away. Click
between the HTML and Normal tab and you will see. We test this same code on
the Preview Releas (0.9) and we have no problems.

Obviously, this could be our code but since it still work in .9 we were
wondering if there wa something that chanaged that may have caused this.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the HTML tab
2. Click on the Normal tab
3. See the big white block covering the tool bar

Actual Results:
A white box appears over the tool bar

Expected Results:
The tool bar would react correctly

We are in the process of offering our product on the Mozilla and Firefox
platform which for the past 7 year ha been exclusive for IE users. We would
REALLY REALLY REALLY like to release with the Firefox support. Unfortunately,
the Rich Text portion of our product (we are content management software
company) is an essential piece.

Your help would be GREATLY appreciated.
