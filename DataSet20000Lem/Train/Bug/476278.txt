Actual Results:
Firefox delay abnormally long when loading a page (such a www.google.com) after waking from sleep. The page display a white page with a "Loading www.google.com" in the status bar. The internet connection is active, a I am able to ping www.google.com and Safari is able to immediately start browsing.
