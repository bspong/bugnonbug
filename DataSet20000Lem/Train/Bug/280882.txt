subjectAltName in presented ceritficate from secure site confuses Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20050110 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0+dfsg.1-2)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20050110 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0+dfsg.1-2)

When Firefox encounter a webserver that present a SSL certificate that ha
multiple identity with subjectAltName it will get confused, or at least give a
confusing message.

If you have a certificate with CN=hostname-1 and subjectAltName=dnsName:host-2,
and you go open a hostname-1 URL in the browser Firefox will not look in the CN
field for identification, only the subjectAltName extension field.

I don't know if the above is according to spec or standard, but it also present
a bad error message. The error message is a follows:

You have attempted to establish a connection with "hostname-1". However
the security certificate presented belongs to "hostname-1". It is possible,
though unlikely, that someone may be trying to intercept your communication
with this web site.

If you suspect the certificate doe not belong to "hostname-1", please
cancel the connection and notify the site administrator.

Now if you click the `view certificate' button presented on the same screen, you
will see a certificate that belongs to `hostname-1'.
