Steps to reproduce:

Hi,

There is a problem with HTML5 notification permission request in Firefox 55.0b12. It's not shown (or blinking) when HTML page which asks for notification permission is run inside 'popup' window opened from Firefox add-on.

I've created a simple Firefox add-on which creates popup window and navigates to http://www.bennish.net/web-notifications.html web page. This page check HTML5 notification site capability. Notification permission request show should appear once you press 'Authorize' button.

Note:

1. The problem is not reproduced in Firefox 54
2. The same problem exists in Firefox Nightly version
3. To reproduce the problem please make sure that you've cleared Site Preferences.
4. Password save dialog is not shown a well.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Unzip firefox_notifications.zip (attached) to some folder
2. Go to Beta Firefox and navigate to about:debugging
3. Click on "Load Temporary Add-On" button and select any file from the folder
4. Press on cogwheel button located in Firefox toolbar.
5. Press 'Authorize' button.



Actual results:

HTML5 Notification permission request is shown


Expected results:

HTML5 Notification permission request is shown
