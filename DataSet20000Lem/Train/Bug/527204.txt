Modality of "Options..." and child dialog

Why is the "Options..." dialog modal? No changed in the option dialog will result in an immediate change of rendering of tab or other part of the window. So I don't understand why it should block the rest of the window. Furthermore, if you are new to Firefox and you use a tutorial to change some prop you can't switch between the tut and the option dialog (that's not quite comfortable). The only thing you could do is open another window of Firefox and change the option there.
So I think the option shouldn't be modal.

And another problem with child dialogs:
If I open the "Add-ons" dialog from the option dialog there are all three control - close, full size and minimize - but at least the minimize-control doesn't make any sense. If I minimize the addon dialog I still can't do anything in the option dialog, because the addon dialog is modal, too. Why? If I open the addon dialog from the menu "Tools" it isn't modal. But from "Options" it is. Doesn't make any sense to me...
(All the other dialog opened from "Options" that have these three control aren't modal.)

And last: In the "Advanced" tab of "Options" many button haven't got the "..." at the end, even tough they open a new dialog.

Reproducible: Always
