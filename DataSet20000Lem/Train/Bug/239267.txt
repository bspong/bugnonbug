Printing (previewing or paper printing or even file printing) doe not work on
most of web page I've tried.
Two cases:
- no text appears, only frame and pictures. Perhaps a font problem?
(http://www.w3.org/)
- text is present, but completly screwed up, with every character overlapping
(http://www.emse.fr/~xserpagg/)

Moreover, on the last page, style (cCSS) are not properly rendered (fixed
position header for example).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.w3.org/
2. File -> Print Preview
3. No text

4. http://www.emse.fr/~xserpagg/
5. File -> Print Preview
6. Text overlapping


Expected Results:
- Correctly format the page so it is pretty printed!
- Replace font if they do not exist for printing.
- correctly handle CSS.

Moreover, what would be really great is that Firefox scale the page (fonts,
pictures, ...) so the width of the display match the width of the selected
paper type.

This happens with page containing style (CSS) or not.
