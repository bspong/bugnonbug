If the mouse is released while the pointer is outside of the focused/frontmost window, then the mouse-up event seems to get misdirected. For example, if you drag a scrollbar and let the pointer drift out of the window before you release the mouse, then the mouse-up event go to the window that the pointer is over. If the pointer is over another Firefox window, it will be focused/brought to the front, even if there are window from other application in front of it. If there aren't any Firefox window under the cursor at any depth, then the mouse-up isn't recognized at all, and the window act a if the mouse button is still down.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open more then one Firefox window, and arrange them so that they overlap
2.Drag anything in the frontmost window (scroll bar, selection, pop-up menu, etc), and move the pointer onto one of the other window before releasing
3.Release the mouse button
Actual Results:
Window that pointer wa over becomes frontmost

Expected Results:
Frontmost window should recognize the mouse-up and stop dragging while remaining frontmost
