loading new tab hangs, RAM usage through the roof
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:25.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/25.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131112160018

Steps to reproduce:

No reproducible steps, random behaviour.

I will try to post about:memory, if I can access the page next time it happens.

System: win 7 64 bit, FF 25, several extension installed, can list if it helps.


Actual results:

Randomly, at least once a day, FF hang when loading a new tab, memory usage at least 1 GB (but last instance wa almost 2,5!); the rest of the feature remain responsive: I can switch tab scroll pages, open menus, etc. but no page will load.
To fix, I have to shut FF and then kill it through process explorer.
Happens randomly whether I have two or ten tab open, no one site consistently involved; ha been going on at least the last 6 month (so various version of FF), have tried disabling all add-on and re-enabling a few at a time, make no difference, behaviour still happens randomly, no bug reported I have seen in forum and such exactly match my circumstances, and no proposed solution ha worked.


Expected results:

I shouldn't have to kill FF and restart from one to several time a day!
