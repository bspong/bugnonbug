Crashed while browsing, addons not disabled but no longer appearing or functioning properly

I wa browsing within 3 Firefox window consisting of about 150 tab (using slightly over 1,100,000K of memory) when an error message dialog box appeared stating (paraphrased from memory, I forgot to screencap it):
"The application ha sent an unusual request to be terminated."

The error message window only had an "OK" button, so I clicked it, which closed the Firefox process. I reopened Firefox and selected "Restore Previous Session" when prompted. However, instead of restoring my session properly, it only restored the first Firefox window and it tabs. Furthermore, it disabled the functionality of most (but not all) of my add-ons, but they were not disabled in the Add-ons manager.

I wish I could provide more details, but this is how it happened a I remember it. Though, if there is relevant crash information logged somewhere on my computer, I may be able to provide it with some instruction.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Actual Results:
Firefox crashed. On a Session Restore it failed to properly restore my session and most of my add-on lost functionality despite not being disabled.

Expected Results:
Optimistically, Firefox shouldn't have crashed. However, in the event of a crash, it should have performed a Session Restore properly and the add-on losing functionality is perplexing.
