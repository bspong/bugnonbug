firefox refuse to remember last window setting when closing and starting up.

installed firefox 2.0.0.1 (whatever...the latest), over the existing firefox version...all of a sudden it put all window in the upper left corner minimized to a 1 inch square (I run hi-res)with every feature and window, bar none. A pain in the butt. It does(or did) this every time I opened firefox, and since I run dual monitor (in span mode)this really made it a real pain in the butt.
I tried just re-installing it, craped out again.
I finally uninstalled firefox using the uninstaller from window and thought I would just go back to the previous version, but hell no...your site say you will only support until april (fooey)....pissants...so I re-installed 2.0.0.1 AGAIN FRESH!!!!!and it is running good now.
don't you guy use an analyst to check this stuff for bugs? You almost had me going back to some OTHER m crap(ms is always crap)and I would rather die that use the world most virus suseptible software in the world.
The fact is that I had to UNINSTALL it and reinstall it rather than just install the latest version. At least it didn't write over my files.

I AM THE WORLDS GREATEST COMPUTER ANALYST IF YOU GUYS CAN'T FIND THIS BEFORE IT WAS EVER RELEASED.
Try having someone in your officee actually run this software inside out before releasing it. I have been programming since 1974 and could find this in my sleep.
