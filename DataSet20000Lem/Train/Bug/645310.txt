Firefox 4.0 for Mac us up a lot of memory
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0

I've recently upgraded Firefox to version 4.0 from 3.6.16. Now I'm experiencing a lot of lagging and memory are constantly being used up. I've checked the Activity Monitor (Mac Application) and Firefox is using at least 875MB of memory when I have 3 tab open and they are Facebook.com, Stackoverflow.com and localhost phpMyAdmin. When I close to 1 tab remaining, the memory range from 860MB to 890MB.

Sometimes Firefox hang when I open a new tab or close a tab. Other application will start to lag due to Firefox. I cannot open window effectively. If I close Firefox I experience no lag from other applications.

Should I downgrade to 3.6.16? I certainly have no problem having memory constantly being used up when running 3.6.16.

I have a white MacBook with 2GB memory, almost half of the memory get used up by Firefox!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Normal browsing Google, Facebook, etc...
2. As you will see the memory will be used up to at least 850MB+
Actual Results:
Laggingess
