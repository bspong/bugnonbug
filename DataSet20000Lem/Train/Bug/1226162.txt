Hangs turning on/off web console in responsive view
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20151015173334

Steps to reproduce:

(FF Developer edition 64bit on Mint 13 64 bit. I7, 8GB RAM.
Tested with 0 add-ons. Also tested after a reset and new profile)

I simply load a page that us bootstrap and jQuery (both in the local FS), and:
CTRL+SHIFT+M (web console)
F12

Now I work a usual, reloading the page to test the new code I'm developing.


Actual results:

Not rarely, when pressing F12 to close the web console, FF hangs.

If I try to close it (button x on the windows), after 10 Mate ask me "Firefox is not responding, do you want to kill?".
Actually is not completely frozen because waitin a minute it really close properly.

Unfortunately I can't reproduce it systematically.

There is a SIMILAR behaviour (but it's not the same because you can close FF without killing it) due to the Inspector picker. Try this:
F12
click the inspector picker
now press F12 and nothing happen unless you click some other buttons. While the inspector picker is enabled F12 doesn't work and this is a bit deceiving... but it's not the subject of this bug report.


Expected results:

I expect FF to close the web console without freezing.
