Frequent lack of responsiveness / hanging on some machine

My father ha been using Firefox for many year because his son work at Mozilla and because he doesn't like what Google doe with his data.

Unfortunately, he's recently regretfully told me that he ha switched to Chrome since he can't keep Firefox running without becaming unresponsive.
I've seen this behaviour a well and it seems to only report to Windows. In other words, I'm not sure if we report back to Mozilla.

After using Firefox for 5 to 15 minute it would become unresponsive and have to be closed.
One of the time I've noticed that it wa related to a Javascript script becoming unresponsive.

One of the website he would visit besides Facebook is this:
http://www.rtve.es/noticias/mas-24/
IIRC the unresponsive script came from there.
Side note, that site show no video stream for me (Nightly on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) and doe not show audio nor video for jmaher.

I installed Firefox 64-bit (which wa very hard to find) on my father's laptop and it seemed to help, however, there were other site that stopped working for him.

Here's the build identifier from few week ago [1] and attached you can find the about:support.

I'm going to their house this Thursday (hopefully). If I can still reproduce it I could bring the laptop on Friday to the office.
