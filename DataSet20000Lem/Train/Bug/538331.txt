On update perform action based upon the update metadata
Instead of just opening a web page after an update Firefox should be able to perform an action based upon the update's metadata.

The basic flow would be:
a. update is performed.
b. update service would set a pref so Firefox could easily tell that an update wa performed.
c. Firefox would then read the last update's data via the update manager which would contain the custom action value provided by the update snippet and perform the associated action for this value.

Note: I'm leaning towards this value being a string since it is provided by the update snippet and is per app defined in order to avoid bug where someone want to use a string. It would be human readable then so the value's meaning would be clear.

The current action I know of are:
1. do nothing
2. open a web page (as is done today)
3. show the notification bar

Note: the notification bar is meant for notification regarding a page's content but we have made an exception in relation to the license notification and I suspect that is what we will do here a well.

I will be filing a bug for the app update part of this after I have it better flushed out. I've discussed this with ddahl and he is going to take this bug.

beltzner, have I left anything out?
