Mozilla firefox give the same error message for every website ( "can't connect to server ) a if i don't even have an internet connection (which ofcourse i do, and it work just fine!! Everything else - IE, messenger, etc - work just fine )

Also, if i try to go to my modem's ip, mozilla can't find it while IE can.

I thought maybe it wa some kind of network problem so i also checked if mozilla worked on my friend's network, but it didn't.

I also checked if it's my firewall doing this, but that's not it either. I changed some setting to make sure my firewall trust Firefox, but that didnt work. Then i even just turned it off completely but that didnt do anything either. ( I use BullGuard v8.0 )

Oh right, and i tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times. I even completely removed firefox from my computer ( delete those file in registry and such ) and that didn't work either! Then i tried downgrading to mozilla firefox 3.0 ... didnt work, and to mozilla firefox 2.0.0.17, but it still gave that exact same message

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open mozilla firefox
2. Try to connect to any website
3.
Actual Results:
Error message that sais that the site seems to exist but that my browser ( that would be firefox then ) just can't connect to the server.

Expected Results:
It should - obviously - have connected to the website's server, it should have loaded the website.
