Hello
This is more of a generic oversight than a bug that I truly hoped would be fixed in FF3, doesn;t appear to have been yet.
When you switch between application on Macintosh with CMD+TAB you are forced to use the mouse in order to carry on navigating / performing command inside the currently viewed tab.
Part of the charm of Mac's is that your mouse is le of a necessity and the window not focusing back to the currently active tab is a restriction of what is otherwise a common feature of application developed on Mac.
It is my opinion that this is typical of Firefox on Mac, a platform used by your most vocal supporters, web developers.
Same thing happens when you click the icon in the dock.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Highlight a portion of text from a web site
2. Now open Safari
3. Switch back to Firefox
4. Try to copy the text with CMD+C
5. Check the clipboard for result
Actual Results:
Nothing get copied

Expected Results:
Expected the text to be copied. This is a generic example of how keyboard navigation doesn't work in Firefox when switching between applications. I define "doesn't work" by having to use the mouse to continue working.

This is very, very annoying and a a web developer this is not a problem that is encountered a few time a day, it is a part and parcel of my daily routine.
