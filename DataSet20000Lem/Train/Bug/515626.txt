On the inncenter.com site (and, after a google search for "firefox 3.5 block popups with popup blocker off" it occurs in other system a well), firefox will cease allowing popups, even if the popup blocker is deactivated totally. This cause severe problem with web program which use popups to save data.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse for awhile on popup intensive sites, such a inncenter.com (a private hotel booking engine back-end).
2. After an indeterminate time (sometimes a few hours, sometimes a day or two) the popup blocker will begin blocking all popups from the site, even though the site is in the allow list.
3.
Actual Results:
Popups blocked, must reset firefox to fix, causing loss of data entered up to the point of the failure.

Expected Results:
Popups continuously allowed from permitted sites, without error. Also, a "show this popup" option if errantly disallowed. (I've seen this button in other contexts, I believe, but it's somehow missing here).
