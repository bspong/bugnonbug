When I enter a single word into the location bar, such a "blah", or "google" I get a "file not found", pointing to "jar:file:///C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/chrome/en-GB.jar!/locale/browser-region/region.propertiesblah".

When I enter two word the browser correctly us Google's "I'm feeling lucky" search.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. search for "blah"
Actual Results:
File not found error, pointing to "jar:file:///C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/chrome/en-GB.jar!/locale/browser-region/region.propertiesblah"

Expected Results:
Using Google's "I'm feeling lucky" search, probably finding a result such a "http://www.blahdvd.com/"; or some error message that doe not involve a file [on my system] not found. Nonetheless the error message indicates a bug somewhere down the line.

I am using the default theme; I wa in the middle of updating "DownThemAll" last night, but cancelled due to the internet cutting off.
