Ensure that Firefox can be easily deployed at 1.0
Firefox 1.0 is in a few months, and we're missing some piece to make
deployment of the browser really feasible/manageable. Not sure how much of
this is also present/needed in Thunderbird either, we can morph this if needed.

- autoconfig is currently broken if LDAP isn't built. (bug 240897)
- we don't have any support for locked prefs when doing disabling (bug 241526)
- we don't have any official documentation/tools for sysadmins to use autoconfig
and ben's upcoming extension manager command-line installation (needed for
global installation of extensions) (sort of bug 226876, but more specific to
the implementation end)
- we don't have an MSI package available, especially needed for Active Directory
deployment (bug 231062) this is a major blocker for breaking into that space
- there's no way of dynamically limiting UI etc post-deployment (i.e. hiding
Bookmarks after the fact) since we're effectively limited to using
userChrome.css in the defaults/base/chrome directory. Not sure what the best
solution to this one is. (global version of userChrome.css? probably need a
spinoff for discussion)

Of course, I'm not directly dealing with the people doing deployments, so I'm
not sure how critical this is to major customers, but it seems like a major
issue in mid-level (100-1000) deployment based on feedback in forums/bugs/IRC.

This is something that I feel we can't miss for 1.0 and I'm willing to drive the
bus myself on this, but feedback is good a to how important this is perceived
to be and what I might be missing.
