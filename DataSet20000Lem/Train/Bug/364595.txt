download addons
imap
forecast fox
restarted browser
then went to tools-options-tabs-a new tab -- is checked
no more tab browser open in same window all the time
behind the startup page - when closed i have a tab (untitled)
this cannot be closed, if i try to close it on the task bar
the browser close down


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.install 2.0.0.1
2.download add on's imap and foxforcast 0.9.3.1
3.firefox will not open tabs, always first window
4.however foxforcast will open in a new tab, next to the first tab

Actual Results:
i cannot get tabbed page anymore all page open in the front window and when that front window is closed, i find a blank tab titled (untitled) which cannot be closed.

Expected Results:
i tried to re-install which did not resolve the problem.
i used fox safe mode and set all back to default - no help

Firefox worked a expected, which for me is a new tab for every page. After the add-on's i dont get tabbed page anymore.
