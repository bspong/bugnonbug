Master passord bypassed by Greasyfork script Show plaintext password on MouseOver that show all saved password for page on login # ff 48 and previous and/or later
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160823121617

Steps to reproduce:

Install https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/32-show-password-onmouseover maybe others work too.
If you enter the masterpassword once and then you will see all your password in plaintext on any login page without entering it again like in>saved login settings.


Actual results:

If i login to a site with a saved password i enter my masterpassword once then all of my other saved login page appear in plaintext on all site i have more than 150 saved password all unique and 30~128+ characters.
If i leave my browser open in a shared space 5min someone can see copy and steal my password very easy and very fast, i already use grease monkey and installing that took nothing at all,and no security checks.
Clicking to settings>saved logins present an index of all the site i have saved password for requiering no security check.
Same problem again settings>privacy>cookies exception/ show cookies/ no security check.


Expected results:

If i set a master password sensitive setting and config should be frozen and out of reach behind the password, and prevent the user from installing any addons,forks or script to them,or presenting the password index,saved cookies/cookie exception or rules,i should be able to set a level to it from entering it once or everytime.
I should be able to lock firefox entirely when i am away forcing me to enter my password when i return.
