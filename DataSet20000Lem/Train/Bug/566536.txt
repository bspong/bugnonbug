Submitting a form to a page which contains an alert() followed by a window.location cause the alert dialog to pop up but the dialog ha no content.

On my machine you have to submit the form at least THREE TIMES for the bug to be visible.

Mousing over the dialog reveals the content.

Clicking other part of the UI make the dialog unresponsive until repeatedly clicked. You have to click inside the alert box the same number of time you've clicked outside of it.

Closing the tab/window reset the behavior.

1.html:
<form action="2.html" method="get">
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>

2.html:
<script language="JavaScript">
alert('The Prepared Alert wa updated successfully.');
window.location='1.html';
</script>
