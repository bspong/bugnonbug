When browsing nearly any forum of other webpage, upon hitting the "back" button to return to the main site, Firefox return me to the top of the first page, rather than leaving the window centered on where it wa before.

Suppose I choose to go to the "processors" forum (just a an example -- this
happens on EVERY webpage I've seen, but sometimes it come and goes) at
PCPerspective. I have to scroll down a couple screen heigths to get to the link
for the processor forum. When I'm done reading that forum and want to go back
to the main page with all the forum links, Firefox just display the very top of
the page instead of going back to the link I just clicked a the top of the
view. I'd say I spend an extra 15 minute a day just scrolling back to my last
view. But otherwise, Kudos! Excellent work!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a website, scroll down it half way or so
2. click a link to take you deeper into that website
3. click the "back" button. Whammo, back at the top of the previous page.

Actual Results:
I wa back at the top of the page instead of where I wa looking when I clicked
the link that took me forward.

Expected Results:
when I hit the back button, I expect the browser to go back to exactly where I
wa before I went forward.

The bug occurs no matter which theme I'm using (I've tried 5) nor which version
of Firefox I'm using (it's been a problem since at least 0.8).
