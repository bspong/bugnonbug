Firefox for Windows 2.0.0.3 reported a security patch. I gave it the okay to update. When I exited and tried to restart, nothing happened. I checked with Task Manager and found that Firefox.exe wa present a a task, but not consuming any CPU time. I tried to terminate it, and it still hung around. I restarted Windows (XP Pro SP2 with security patch applied) and tried again. It still behaved the same, so I rebooted and uninstalled Firefox 2.0.0.3. Oddly enough, 2.0.0.4 wa not listed, but 2.0.0.2 and 2.0.0.3 were, in the Windows Add/Remove Programs list. I discovered I only had 2.0.0.1's install program in my downloads, so I installed it. Things worked until I retried the update. Same problem once it wa updated, so I took it out again. Then I downloaded the latest SeaMonkey install (2.0a1pre), ran it and tried to bring it up. Same problem! I am using Firefox 2.0.0.1 at the moment, since I have thing to do (plane ticket to buy to see my grandson (;)).



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 2.0.0.4 on my machine
2.Start Firefox
3.Bring up Task Manager
Actual Results:
I observed that Firefox wa listed a an active task, but it wa not consuming any CPU time. Firefox never finished starting.

Expected Results:
Brought up the browser.

Note that I have Macafee Security Firewall installed, but this problem happens when I disable the firewall, so I know it isn't the problem. I also uninstalled the SiteAdviser addon, so it isn't involved. Besides, this wa working until 2.0.0.4 wa installed!
