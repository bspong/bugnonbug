Adjust panelmultiview binding to allow easy swapping of mainviews
The specification for the bookmark panel widget (bug 855805) call for the following behaviour:

1) When the widget is in the main panel, clicking on the widget open a subview that list some number of option and bookmarks. Bookmark folder are also visible in this list, but clicking on them open up that folder in the Library.
2) When the widget is in a toolbar, clicking on the widget open a panel listing some number of option and bookmarks, but when clicking on a bookmark folder, a subview is opened that display the content of that folder. We only go one level deep, so clicking on a folder within the subview open that folder in a Library.

The panel view that list the bookmark and option is common between these two locations, so we'll make use of jaws' patch that open up subviews within their own panels.

We need, however, to have that panel support subviews, and have it recognize the bookmark panel a the main view. This mean making it easy for subviews to become mainviews, and vice versa.

I suggest we drop the notion of panelmainview and panelsubview, and just have panelview tag within a panelmultiview. The mainViewId attribute of the panelmultiview will allow u to set the main view in mark-up, and the setMainView method of the binding will allow u to programmatically swap view in and out of the main view position.

Not entirely sure if this is the best way forward, but it seems to work for the WIP patch I'm putting together for bug 855805. Definitely open to suggestion on this though.
