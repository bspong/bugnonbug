Installer deleted unrelated folder
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/7.02

Downloaded the firebird installer from Dec 11th and ran it. I accidentally
installed to d:\internet when I wanted to install to
d:\internet\MozillaFirebird. The install ran and installed Firebird, but it
also deleted several folder in d:\internet, including Thunderbird
(d:\internet\Thunderbird) and Netscape 4.7 (d:\internet\Netscape).

Sorry, haven't tried to reproduce this, it is just too destructive.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run installer.
2. Install to a folder that contains other folders, such a a Thunderbird install.


Actual Results:
Thunderbird folder is deleted.

Expected Results:
No folder are deleted, except possibly an existing Firebird install.

Before trying the install, I had renamed the previous version from
d:\internet\MozillaFirebird to d:\internet\MozillaFirebird-0.7. After the
install, the only three folder left in d:\internet were MozillaFirebird-0.7
(previous version), d:\internet\Mozilla (Mozilla suite 1.4) and
d:\internet\MozillaFirebird (new install). I had also copied the whole Phoenix
profile folder to make a backup, but there didn't seem to be any problem there.
