when I try to print a web page I get only part of the page or image per sheet of paper and I get several page depending on the web page all with a portion of the web page. This problem happens on all the web site I've tried to print eg Mapquest, Google, Mozilla etc. If I use print preview I see the same problem. This doe not happen if I save a web page to my hard drive, it doe not happen if I "print" the page to Paperport or Adobe Acrobate a a pdf file, it doe not happen if I switch to IE and print the same page from that browser, it did not happen with the older version of Firefox (1.1? I think). I am using A Brother HL-2070N laser Printer

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on file, print preview OR file, print
2.
3.

Actual Results:
File, print preview/or file, print: see several page with portion of the web page on each,

Expected Results:
I should have a piece of paper with the web page printed to look almost like the one I am viewing in the browser, example if I print out a Mapquest map I get 4-5 page with bit of image on each page, not the nice one page map to a location I used to get with the older firefox version, IE print the map out properly if I use that browser

I can send a screen capture of this if it help
