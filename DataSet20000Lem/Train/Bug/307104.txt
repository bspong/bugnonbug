local directory link in personal toolbar folder cause freeze, unwanted subfolder
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050822 Firefox/1.0.6 (Debian package 1.0.6-3)

In a subfolder of my personal toolbar folder, I have a link to the local
directory, file:///usr/share/doc/, which ha 1348 subdirectories. With Mozilla
Seamonkey, this link open a view of the directory in the browser window, within
a fraction of a second. Entires are sorted in alphabetical order.

With Firefox, moving the mouse over this link (whether aiming for it or not)
cause the machine to freeze for several seconds, with a lot of disk activity.
During this time firefox won't yield focus to any other program. When it ha
finished it open a toolbar subfolder containing the directory in a random
order. This would be useless behaviour, even if it wa quick. It seriously
reduces the usability of the toolbar.

After the subfolder ha been opened once, it is quicker to reappear, presumably
due to caching.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a subfolder in the personal toolbar folder, and put a link in it to a
reasonably populous local directory (in this case /usr/share/doc/).
2. move the mouse over the link.
3. wait.

Actual Results:
machine freeze for some seconds, unusable menu appears.

Expected Results:
the link should open in the normal way, a if it wa written into the url bar,
or wa the href of a link. This should happen quickly, a it doe in those
cases. The listing should be sorted in some sensible fashion, such a
alphabetically.
