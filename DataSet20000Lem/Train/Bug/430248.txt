The past 2 Minefield release have been freezing when opening multiple tab either via open all in tabs, or by loading a session from session manager extension.

Extensions appear to be involved, and it not just pin pointable to 1 single extension, disabling all extension fix the issue.

To attempt to resolve the problem, i disabled all extension 1 at a time and tested for the lock up, i finally pin pointed the problem to either Flashblock, Flashgot, or an australian english extension, but upon renabling the other extension the freeze started again.

This lead me to believe that the crash occurs because of the amount of extension loaded, rather then the extension themselves. All extension are up to date, Tabmix plus, session manager and nightly tester tool were the only extension enabled when the problem wa resolved at first, after slowly disabling 1 by one, Adblock, Chromedit+, Console2 and download status bar were still enabled.

Enabling ANY other extension ontop of this cause Minefield to freeze when opening multiple tabs. (25-50 tabs)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install more then 8 firefox extension (session manager required to load sessions)
2. Surf to a variety of websites, in between 20-45 tabs, and save them to a bookmark folder or a a session
3. Reopen this folder in all tabs, or load a session
Actual Results:
Minefield will load nearly all of the tabs, and when 3 or 4 are left to load it will completely freeze at 95% cpu usage

Expected Results:
Minefield should finish loading the tab without problem a earlier build and firefox 3 beta 5 doe

As i have said though, it can't be tracked back to 1 individual extension, it occurs when a combination exceeding 8 or 9 extension is used.
