Figure out what to do with the tab consoleActor in b2g
The tab consoleActor is entirely silent on b2g because page errors, console api call and network request cannot be associated to the top level chrome window of b2g.

Findings:

1. outerWindowID is almost always 0 for nsIScriptError objects. When it is provided, the ID doesn't match the top chrome window of b2g (the window that load shell.xul).
2. nsIScriptError.category is generally fine.
3. console API message seem to have outer window IDs, but they don't match the top level chrome window (shell.xul).
4. no network request can be logged because the nsILoadContext of the nsIHttpChannel doe not have the |associatedWindow| property. I get NS_ERROR_UNEXPECTED whenever I try to read that property.

For the few case when I get window IDs, their URLs are of the form:

http://system.gaiamobile.org:8080/
http://keyboard.gaiamobile.org:8080/
http://browser.gaiamobile.org:8080/
... etc

This seems to suggest we can have some system-known window and per app windows? Or am I wrong?


This bug report is about: figuring out if we want to make the tab consoleActor work (and how?), or just remove it. Here we should also get a perspective on a very related topic: do we want a consoleActor per app? How do we do that in b2g? I learned from Rob that there's a plan to have per-app processes.

Looking forward for thought and suggestions. Thanks!
