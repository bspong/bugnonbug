html doc with iframe, doc given name in javascript, say 'x'

iframe contains link to several html pages, all link with target='x'

click on link in iframe load selected html page (replacing current page containing iframe)

But the new page load scrolled down to the position of the link on the page it link from.

So if link in original page iframe is 100px down from top, new page will load scrolled down 100px. Or 200px or whatever y position of link is on original page.

Hitting reload in Firefox will then reload to top of page.

It appears that Firefox see the y pixel position of the link in the iframe a the top of the page - thus substituting y=0 with y=100 or whatever when the linked to page loads.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Three html docs: index.html with iframe that call iframedoc.html and new.html
2.javascript in index.html header window.name = "x";
3.link in iframedoc.html: <a href="new.html" target="x">View New Page</a>
4.Open index.html, click on link in iframe
5.Pixel position of link on page in Firefox determines how new.html loads.
6.If link is 100 pixel down on index.html, then new.html will load scrolled down 100 pixels.

Actual Results:
y pixel position of link uri in iframe on first page determines top y pixel position of page that replaces it.

Expected Results:
New page should load with document top visible, top left x=0 y=0, not scrolled down by location in pixel from the top of the link on the previous page.

All previous version of Firefox load page properly.
