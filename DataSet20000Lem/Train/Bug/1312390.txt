Steps to reproduce:

When I'm debugging a Web application, I think that it would be useful to count with an option to set a "tracepoint" instead of a "breakpoint", in the JavaScript Debugger of the Web Developer Tools.

In other languages, a "tracepoint" is like a "breakpoint" that doesn't stop the thread(s), and give you the possibility to print selected variable of the current scope to the console. I know that you can use the "console.log" method or any of it multiple variant ("console.debug" or "console.trace") in your source code. But "tracepoints" don't require that you modify and reload the source code every time. And it's not invasive: it doesn't clutter the source code.

In other contexts, such a in the one of NetBeans IDE and Java, this option is not called "tracepoint". Instead, it's just shown a an extra option when you set a typical "breakpoint". The IDE let you choose how you want to suspend the execution: in the current thread, in all thread or without suspending the thread(s) at all. The Debugger of Firefox could show something like that too. If it's hard to implement, it could be limited to 2 options: suspend or not to suspend.



Actual results:

The Debugger doesn't allow to set "tracepoints".



Expected results:

It would be useful that it allowed to add "tracepoints".
