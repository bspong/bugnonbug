This ha happened a few time since about the 20th of June trunk build (but could have happened earlier without me knowing).

After normal web browsing (on site that don't use any OOPP), the last two bookmark on my bookmark toolbar will spontaneously either disappear or cannot be dragged around, and a cursor remains there even though I have neither dragged anything into that area, nor is my mouse there.

I cannot get rid of the cursor or retrieve access to my bookmark without restarting the browser.

A screenshot is attached.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
This problem ha occurred a number of times, however - sometimes it actually hide the bookmark there (as in the screenshot), other time I can still access the bookmark however the cursor remains, and I cannot drag around those bookmarks.
Actual Results:
The problem occurred when I wa simply browsing MozillaZine... but it is not site-specific.

Expected Results:
This problem should not occur.
