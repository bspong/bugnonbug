Recorded Frame rate visualization
As a developer, I'd like to be able to have access to a visualization of the frame rate of my application in my instrumentation recording so that I can easily find the place where the application frame rate performs below par.

Acceptance Criteria:
* Browser instrument the frame rate
* Instrumentation ha minimal impact on performance
* Tools provide a basic visualization of the frame rate that show developer what is going on with the frame rate in their recording
* Visualization UI should be extensible so that it's easy to add the right "click-throughs" to find root cause of frame rate slowdown.

Notes:
Related to 929114 where frame rate is visualized in real time, but this is different, the visualization should be a place where developer can now click through to actually map the slow down to a cause, see separate US for flame chart. See separate user story for each type of root cause and different way of visualization.

Note that recorded frame rate visualization versus live frame rate visualization don't have to be the same UI, in fact, they should not be, because the two are very distinct usage context and will require different interaction modality and different sizes.
