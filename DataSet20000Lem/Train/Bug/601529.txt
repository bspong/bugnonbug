This is approximately a duplicate of #437517, but that bug ha been closed and "Tyler Downer [Triage]" is ignoring replies, saying that the bug ha "No reply".

Third party tool - like wget with the --load-cookies option - consume the Netscape cookies.txt file. This is primarily useful for automated downloads from site that require a login, especially those with logins that are hard to automate, e.g. captchas.

Since Firefox 3.0, this file is no longer generated; instead, cooky are stored in a sqlite db, cookies.sqlite. This is infinitely le useful for third-party consumption, ad-hoc consumption, etc.

There's no simple workaround that I'm aware of, apart from manually and laboriously copying and pasting cookie name and value from the UI into a command line. That get old really quickly.

Just writing the cookies.txt file would be sufficient.

I'm currently forced to run Firefox 2.0.0.20 to get around this issue.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Log in to a site that store a cookie to maintain login status
3. View profile directory in preferred shell and note absence of cookies.txt containing cookie from login
Actual Results:
cookies.txt file is missing and doesn't contain persistent cookies.

Expected Results:
cookies.txt file should exist and contain persistent cooky stored by web sites.
