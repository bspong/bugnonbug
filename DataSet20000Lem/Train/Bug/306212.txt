When I edit the text in textarea, I input some cjk character by xim input
method or gtk im module. I click the left mouse button to move the carect
position when the preedit string exists. Then the caret position is moved to
where the mouse clicked, but the preedit string is not commited, so when I type
another character, the caret position is move to the old place and the preedit
string is changed. The intented behavior is that the preedit string is commited
when the user click the mouse button on textarea.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open some url that ha text area.
2. input some text and place the caret in the middle of the text.
3. enble the input method and input some cjk character on the caret place.
4. then click upper line or lower line to move the caret to another place.
5. input another cjk characters.

Actual Results:
The caret move to the old position and change the old preedit string.

Expected Results:
When the user click the mouse, the current preedit string should be commited and
the caret should be moved to where the user clicked.

I think the solution is to call gtk_im_context_reset() on mouse click. In
GtkTextView of gtk+, it also call gtk_im_context_reset() on mouse click event.
So I made a patch for this.
