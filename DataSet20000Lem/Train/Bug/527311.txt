Addressbar suggests adaptive result regardless of requested behavior

In Options > Privacy you can configure addressbar suggestions, choosing beetween

- history and bookmark
- history
- bookmark
- no suggestion

Addressbar still suggests history and bookmark also if I've set "history" only, they have the same behaviour while "history" shouldn't suggest any bookmark.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 3.5.x
2. Go to a website.
3. Add this site to bookmarks.
4. Clean history, cache etc. (so history is empty)
5. Options > Privacy, change setting from "history and bookmarks" to "history" only
6. Begin to type the website address into the addressbar...
Actual Results:
Addressbar doe show the suggestion for the site! But it isn't in history anymore (we did clean history, cache etc.), it is in bookmark but we configured "history" only suggestions.

Expected Results:
It shouldn't suggest bookmark if we configured "history" only suggestions. "History" only option is broken.

I find this bug on 5 different system (XP, Vista, 7), clean Firefox 3.5.x installations, ITalian language.
