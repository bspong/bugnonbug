Components do not expose disk interface

It wa requested at my Mozilla brown bag talk that I provide a list of interface that could be improved to make the browser more flexible about writing state to disk. One of the major issue I ran into wa that the file output stream wa being referred to by CID instead of contract ID in nsUtils, but that seems to be fixed in Firefox 3. However, I am aware of three additional component that do not have preference or interface suitable to prevent their disk access:

@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1
http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_browsersessionstore1.html
The sessionstore ha a number of method to govern attaching additional information to nodes, but no writeToDisk hook that can be reimplemented to preserve the "Undo Close Tab" feature, but prevent browser session from touching disk (or to write it to an alternate location, or encrypt it, etc).

@mozilla.org/dom/storage;1 - http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_domstorage1.html
According to http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/DOM:Storage, it seems that DOM storage is eventually supposed to persist on disk in the event of crashes, yet there are no prefs nor interface to govern this. This is probably due to Bug 339445.

@mozilla.org/cookiemanager;1
http://xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/comps/c_cookiemanager1.html
It is possible to disable writing of cooky by demoting the cookie manager's lifetime policy to transform everything into session cookies, however this prevents the implementation of "memory-only" cookie jars, or encrypted cookie jar that the user can toggle between without writing them to disk. It may still be possible to do this (with a lot more complicated code) with session cooky and hooking the add method, so perhaps this is a minor concern.

I will add more to this bug a I come across it. The formfill interface probably need to be added here, but I have not investigated them in detail yet, since Torbutton just disables formfill and password saving in Tor mode by default for now.



Reproducible: Always
