Tab Grouping

A more than useful feature would be group tabbing. At work I tend to have open
more than 20 tabs, opening up and closing tab all the time. While searching for
a topic in google, I often open-up half a dozen search results. While browsing a
forum, I open up all potentially interesting thread in the background. (etc.)
And while tabbed browsing is something I couldn't live without, it tends to
become "inadequate" to use in such scenario (with quite a lot of tabs), even
more so when most of the tab would be naturally grouped in sets, yet are
"unordered" in the tab menu.

To correct the problem I tend to open up 3-5 Mozilla Windows, 5-10 tab in each
window. A google search that seems to return many "good" result tends to get
copied/pasted-opened in a new window, tomcat/jetspeed related tab go to
another, forums/blogs/news/pages I visit daily go to a third etc. And while
Windows XP greatly lessens the problem for me with it tabbed taskbar, a tab
grouping in a single Mozilla Window (I imagine preferrably through the sidebar;
where clicking in a "tab group" would show in the main window the correspoding
set of tabs, the others disappearing in the background) would be even better.

I guess the description could be better but I hope you get the idea.
