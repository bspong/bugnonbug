'No Style' doe not work on certain sites. Error in Chrome file: Permission denied to call method Location.toString
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032619 Firefox/3.0b5

To see this error reported in the Error Console you need the preference: 'javascript.options.showInConsole' to be set to 'true'.

It happens on site with frame like:
http://www.worldofwarcraft.abc.pl/
http://www.l2tools.abc.pl/

You get
Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to call method Location.toString
2 times, followed by:
Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to get property Window.LycosAdFrame
followed by:
Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to call method Location.toString

No file or line number (in older FF including 2.0.0.13)
It happens every time you load this kind of site (with frame on abc.pl) and in newer Firefox version additionally disabling CSS (View -> Page Style -> No Style) stop working because of it.

Checked and confirmed in whole range of Firefox version and operating systems:
Firefox Portable (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3) no extensions, separate default profile. 'No Styles' works.

Firefox Portable (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6) no extensions, separate default profile. 'No Styles' works.

Firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Firefox/2.0.0.13) no extensions, my dev profile shared with some other versions. 'No Style' doe not work and throw the same error with 'Permission denied to call method Location.toString' (twice)

Firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032620 Firefox/3.0b5) no extensions, my dev profile shared with some other versions. 'No Style' doe not work. This time I can see that some of the error are on the site:
1.
Error: Permission denied to call method Location.toString
Source File: http://members.lycos.co.uk/l2walker1/
Line: 4
2. (no file or line number)
Error: Permission denied to call method Location.toString
3.
Error: Permission denied to get property Window.LycosAdFrame
Source File: http://members.lycos.co.uk/l2walker1/
Line: 126
4.
Error: Permission denied to call method Location.toString
Source File: http://ads.tripod.lycos.co.uk/ad/ad.php?cat=computer.computer&mkw=&CC=uk&ord=3483a84a&adpref=
Line: 9

When I want to disable CSS with using 'No Styles' I'm getting:
Error: Permission denied to call method Location.toString
And disabling CSS doe not work.

The same happens on my Ubuntu machine:
Firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.9b5) Gecko/2008032619 Firefox/3.0b5), with some extensions. This time I see first the Error: Permission denied to call method Location.toString without the reference to any file and line number followed by the same kind of error with reference that I've got on my Windows machine. Disabling CSS doe not work.

The same error confirmed on my firends MAC runing OSX10.5 and FF2.0.0.13 with all extension disabled extensions.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set javascript.options.showInConsole to true in about:config
2. Open Error Console
3. Load one of this sites: http://www.l2tools.abc.pl/
http://www.worldofwarcraft.abc.pl/
4. If you have FF >= 2.0.0.13 try disabling CSS by clicking on View -> Page Style -> No Style
Actual Results:
Getting Errors like:
Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to call method Location.toString
Error: Permission denied to call method Location.toString
Source File: http://members.lycos.co.uk/l2walker1/
Line: 4
Error: Permission denied to get property Window.LycosAdFrame
Source File: http://members.lycos.co.uk/l2walker1/
Line: 126

and when trying to disable CSS (in FF >= 2.0.0.13) additional:
Error: Permission denied to call method Location.toString

'No Style' doe not work.

Expected Results:
Disable CSS style regardless of these errors.
