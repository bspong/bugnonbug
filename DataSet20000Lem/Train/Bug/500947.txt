when clicking next page on some web site that show multiple pages, sometimes firefox 3.5 rc 3 show the loading wheel but never load anything. I have to click back button and then forward button again to load content. On www.rocketdock.com when I click to go to next page sometimes (just a frequently a neverending load) it show a blank page and I have to click back then forward to get the page to show. It happens one out of about every six time I try to go to a next page on the deviantart.com and the rocketdock.com website - haven't tried it on other go to next page type sites.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to deviantart.com or rocketdock.com
2.do a general search or browse a category
3.click next page multiple time and eventually you will get unending loading or blank page
Actual Results:
firefox never show a blank page on deviantart.com just the unending loading wheel and nothing come up. It never show the unending loading on rocketdock.com it just pull up a blank white page sometimes.

Expected Results:
The page should load a normal and I know it's not a server issue because I can immediately hit the back button and forward button and page then load quick and normal.

I didn't notice any specific bug report on exactly what this doe when going page to page on website but if there wa one I missed then I apologize for the repeat bug report.
