When I open a new page in a new window, the window doe not come to the front

This problem happens with Firefox 2 or 3. In Tools / Options / Tabs, there are two option for opening new pages: in a new window or in a new tab. The page in question are opened using a clicking on a link found in an e-mail message (Eudora client). I select the "new window" option, which is what I want.

Then, when I click on the link in the e-mail, if Firefox already ha an open window, a new window opens, but it doe not come to the front. I need to click on it icon on the task bar to see the new window.

Is there any way to make the new window come to the front automatically?

When opening the new page in a new tab (the second option), it doe come to the front automatically, so the behavior is inconsistent.

I did not have this problem in Mozilla suite or Seamonkey, where the new tab option wa not available. Apparently the new tab option ha messed up the new window option.

Window should come to the front. That is why you click on a link -- to see it.
