Some website (such a the one I listed in the URL above) have a "search" function for the website itself. (This is NOT the toolbar search for Firefox.) When I use it, it work the first time. On the second and substitute "search", the cursor just sits on the "Go" button and nothing happens. If I use MS IE instead, it work fine. There seems to be something wrong with the way Firefox us a website's own search function.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Enter search term on web page's search function.
2.Click on "Go."
3.Works fine.
4.Enter another term to search for.
5.Click on "Go."
6.Absolutely nothing happens
Actual Results:
See "Steps to Reproduce." Note that it occurs on the second and subsequent use of the site's search function. The first time it's used, it work fine. (Note that this happens on multiple website not just the one I've listed.

Expected Results:
I expect it to work the second and subsequent time just like the first time I've used the page's search function.

It should come up with the result of searching for the term that I entered.
