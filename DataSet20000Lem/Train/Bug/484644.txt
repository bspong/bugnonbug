Hi,
I wa online using an encrytion service to prevent hacker access to my broadband. I found Firefox 3.06 started leaking information from the encryption webpage. When I used Internet Exlorer ver 6, it warned me about the problem. However Firefox 3.06 failed to pick this up and I continued to use it unaware that Firefox disconnected the service.

As I said I could not replicate this with Internet Explorer 6, other than it warned me that something wa amiss.

Firefox will need to build a future browser that will immediately report to the user that any online encryption service like banking etc., ha been compromised just like Internet Explorer did. Firefox should not allow the user to do online business using encrytion service without at least warning same about a security breech.




Reproducible: Sometimes




Firefox should automatically warn the user when doing online business using encryption pages, (particularly when proceeding to the next page) that the user is about to leave a secure page that everyone can see. In my case it failed to do this. As I said above (see details) Internet Explorer 6 did warn me about the issue.

The user should not be expected to set this up manually, Firefox should be designed to do this automatically.

Tanking you.
