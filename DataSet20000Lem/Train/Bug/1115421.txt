Simplify download annotation handling in the Library
The Downloads View in the Library doe not need to listen to download annotation changes. This consideration greatly simplifies the current code.

Currently, all the annotation are read when the view is created, and they are used when the element shell (even inactive) are created. At that point, any change to the annotation may only happen because something happened to a Download object, and we already monitor all these change through the Downloads API.

The fact that everything can work correctly is confirmed by the fact that, despite we apparently listen to nodeAnnotationChanged notifications, they are never fired by Places, even when the call to setPageAnnotation in DownloadsCommon is made. Adding logging to this function show nothing:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/components/downloads/content/allDownloadsViewOverlay.js#1251

I confirmed that nodeInserted notification worked correctly instead.

Maybe, the reason is that these notification are only for bookmarks? It seems they're generated here:

http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/places/nsNavHistoryResult.cpp#3659

Regardless, this isn't an issue for u since we don't need to listen to begin with.

I don't believe any add-on writes download annotation directly, but we shouldn't explicitly handle the case where one does, and doe not use a Download object at the same time.
