A very large webpage containing +24000 row in a single table will fail to
fully render in FireFox. The page that caused this is in total 140,000+ line
long and most of it is a single table. The rendering fail about 2/3 of the way
through. The rest of the page will simply not be there. I am unable to give
you the page that caused this a I am developing a network management tool and
the report that caused this contains potentially sensitive data and I do not
have the spare time to modify the report generation tool to not output live
data at this time. The page is 4818162 byte in length and 140626 line long.
This is not a memory issue a I watched firefox's memory usage and it did not
come near to the working set for my machine. A page about half a long a this
one did not have the problem/
