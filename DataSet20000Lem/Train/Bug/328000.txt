If you are currently viewing a PDF file using Filefox and the focus is on the document itself, a PDF's "Document Properties" dialog will appear when pressing Ctrl+D (if the focus is not on the document, the "Add bookmark" dialog will appear). It is a correct.

But when you are tabbed browsing with a PDF file opened in ANOTHER tab (the current tab is a normal page), after cloing the "Bookmarks Manager", the "Document Properties" dialog (of the first PDF file) will popup when you press Ctrl+D. It should be an "Add bookmark" dialog.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Filefox and open a PDF file.
2. Press Ctrl+T to get a new tab. Open a page (e.g. www.google.com) in the new tab.
3. Open the "Bookmark manager" dialog by Menu [Bookmarks]->[Manager Bookmarks...]. The "Bookmarks Manager" appears.
4. Press ESC to close the "Bookmarks Manager" dialog.
5. Press Ctrl+D to add a bookmark for the current page (www.google.com).


Actual Results:
The "Document Properties" dialog for the PDF file appears. If there are more than one PDF file opened, it is the "Document Properties" dialog for the first PDF file (in the order of tabs).

Workaround:
Use the menu item instead Ctrl+D keystroke.
or
1. Close the "Document Properties" dialog.
2. Click on the document (www.google.com) you are viewing.
3. Press Ctrl+D again.


Expected Results:
The "Add bookmark" dialog appears.

When viewing a PDF file and press Ctrl+D, the following is correct.
1. the "Document Properties" pop up if focus is on the document
2. the "Add bookmark" pop up if focus is on tab, etc.

Please make sure you can see the "Document Properties" dialog with focus on PDF document when reproduce this bug.

The bug only occus after the "Book Manager" is closed. It doe not occus after other dialog (e.g. About, Options) are closed.
