Google Desktop 4.2006.325.1032-en ha a new feature called "Quick Search Box" (QSB), where you can press Ctrl twice to bring forward a search box.

It doesn't work on my system if Firefox is the default browser. I can bring up the box, but if I click preference or the "see all desktop result in a browser" then nothing happens.

I tried using IE by having it check if it wa the default browser but that didn't work either. But when I clicked Control Panel : Internet Options : Programs : Reset Web Settings then the QSB starting working. I then made Firefox the default browser again and QSB promptly stopped working.

I also noticed that by re-setting the web setting then the "WWW" button on my Logitech keyboard starting working again. It then stopped working again when I made Firefox the default browser.

Haven't been able to reproduce this on other system (but they are all WinXP and don't have a Logitech keyboard).


Reproducible: Always
