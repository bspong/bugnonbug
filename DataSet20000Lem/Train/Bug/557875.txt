Video Media Files Cause Apparent Memory Leak

After playing several video file of various type from around the net like youtube.com and bliptv.com, Firefox will suddenly freeze up and start churning system resource to the tune of 25-50% with a quad-fold increase in physical memory usage. I have had the memory footprint jump from around 250MB to over 1.5GB almost instantly when this process starts. After the initial surge Firefox usually either crash or I have to kill the process because the freeze-ups continue with monotonous regularity until I do so. This PC is an Intel Core 2 quad-core PC with 8GB of RAM and ton of HDD space. It is built a a high-end gamer, so it is not a resource or horsepower issue nor is the issue isolated to this particular PC (I have eight high-end PCs like this). This bug occurs on any computer in which I utilize Firefox in this way and it ha done so for several iteration of the browser.

Is there any suggestion regarding tweaks, usage or whatever to alleviate this problem with streaming medium file or is this simply a bug in the way Firefox cache and retrieves this information?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Watch several medium clip within the browser, especially bliptv.com and youtube.com

2. The length of time to reproduce the problem varies, but seems related to whether or not the browser ha been up and running with several tab and/or window open for extended period of time. It is more prone to occur and to do so much sooner of this is the case.

3.
Actual Results:
Firefox eventually begin freezing up and using excessive system resource requiring termination and restarting of the application.

Expected Results:
The browser should not suddenly quadruple it system resource and memory usage footprint resulting in unmanageable application freeze-ups, but it does. The expectation is that it should simply continue to function at the same level and resource usage a it did prior to the freezing process.

It can become severe enough on low resource system to require an actual hard-reboot to regain control of the system because the resulting resource usage becomes so high the system cease to respond at all.
