The screen which responds to finding a flight reservation never completes. I've been doing this weekly since January 15 without troubles. The big difference this time is that FF 3.6 upgrade is in use. Previously it wa using 3.5.4 (I think).

Able to successfully complete the effort—or quickly get an "invalid" message—with SeaMonkey 1.1.18 and Chrome 3.0.195.27.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. https://webselfservice.alaskaair.com/checkinweb/Default.aspx
2. Choose a city (Portland, Oregon (PDX))
3. Choose method of selecting flight: Confirmation code
4. Use any 6 letter confirmation code: XXXXXX
5. Click on *Continue*

Despite it appeal to wait for up to 90 seconds, it will never finish. It doesn't matter if a valid confirmation code is given or not.
Actual Results:
Stays on the "Please Wait" screen a long a you care to wait. Tested up to two hours.

Expected Results:
Proceeds to either an error message saying "The request wa not successful" or brings up flight information.

Possibly Zotero wa added since it last worked a well. http://www.zotero.org/
