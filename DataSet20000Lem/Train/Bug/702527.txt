excessive GC routine cause browser to lag.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:8.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/8.0
Build ID: 20111104165243

Steps to reproduce:

I load my browser and the session which is currently 20 window and 226 tabs, and initially the browsing is smooth.


Actual results:

Then after a while (usually when firefox ram usage is over 750meg), thing like scrolling pages, flash videos, animation on pages, and the gui itself start getting jerky, laggy, this is an old bug that ha existed since firefox 3.


Expected results:

Smooth experience.

In firefox4 the behaviour wa significantly improved, something wa done in that release to reduce jerkyness at high ram usage, however firefox 4 also had extreme memory leak and I suspect extra GC wa added to firefox5 and newer to work around that and the jerkyness is back a a result. I would like to see a debug version of firefox which ha all GC stripped out and to see how well it run out of curiosity, thats the easiest way to see if the GC is the cause of the problem, my belief is that eventually a ram usage go up and up eventually the frequent GC are continously running in a loop and the app slows down. I have filed previous bug report but none have had any response. The large report in ff3.6 which wasnt filed by me wa controlled by the bartab addon which stopped working in firefox4. So a solution to this problem may be to integrate bartab feature into firefox. Which is auto unload idle tab (but keep the tab on gui), allow manual unload of tabs, and have ability to always keep whitelisted tab loaded. Also it worth noting my configuration only load one tab from each window at startup so only 20 tab get loaded and the jerkyness start before 40 get loaded. Never are all 226 tab loaded.
