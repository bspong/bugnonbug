This site requires credit card verification before accepting a new user subscription.

Trying to submit credit card data, you'll be bounced back to homepage, nested into the inner central frame.

This problem appeared during transition from beta7 to beta8 stage and it never occurs with FF 3.6.x

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to provided link.

2. Point to "Click here to sign up" in the mid-left side of the homepage.

3. Fill in the form with your data and the captcha and click Register

4. Fill in the second form with your credit card data and submit
Actual Results:
I've been bounced back to homepage without registering.

Expected Results:
The site should have accessed to Sagepay, the payment processor, and this one should have verified my credit card data and then confirmed my new account.

I had similar issue also with Mastercard and Visa Securecode confirmation page in a couple of web-stores: when I submit the code to confirm credit card transaction, I'm immediately taken out of the SSL session and brought back to the store homepage.
