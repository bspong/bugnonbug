Secondary browser page NEVER display preview Images

I did browse several page of previous error but no one appeared to the same a this one. (Similiar to Bug 582465 - but different)

When I browse from either the Mozilla or basic google web page and click on either video of Images i get blank placeholder displayed instead of the previews. This is totally reproduceable. I un-installed and re-installed firefox and the problem persisted. I loaded firefox in Safe mode with the add ons disabled and the problem still persists.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type www.google.com
2. type "mouse"
3. Click on Images
Actual Results:
The top line which appears to be an ad correct display images.
The remainder of the line approx 16 page or preview image are displayed a blank grey boxes.
- MSN search engine display correctly
- ASK search engine display correctly
This wa preformed in safemode with all the add on and plugins disabled

Expected Results:
Each 'grey box' should have an image from a different website.

Examining the log of various other similiar issue this appears to reoccur to different degrees. Not sure but if the problem is affecting numerous other user at my level this could seriously impact firefox's market position.
