customized toolbars are reset to default because of corrupt localstore.rdf after search plugin update check

Sometimes when I restart Firefox, after extension installation or software
update (for nightly 1.8 Branch), the costumization I did to the toolbars
(removing the go button, adding button from extensions) is not remembered, and
all is set back to what the toolbar look like with a fresh profile.

When I open the Javascript Console the following message is displayed several
times:

Error: duplicate attribute
Source File: file:///<profile location>/localstore.rdf
Line: 244, Column: 20
Source Code:
NS1:LastPingDate="1126176449" />-------------------^

Where <profile location> is the path to my profile folder.
I have set the following prefs to true, but I don't know if the error message
appears when they are set to false:
javascript.options.showInConsole
javascript.options.strict

The entry in localstore.rdf which this error message is talking about look
like this:

<RDF:Description RDF:about="engine://<program
folder>%5Csearchplugins%5Cgoogle.src"
NS1:LastPingDate="1126011710"
NS1:LastPingDate="1126176449" />

where <program folder> is the path to the Firefox program directory.

When I close Firefox and remove the first LastPingDate attribute and value, and
then restart Firefox the toolbars are back again to how I costumized them.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Costumize the toolbars, drag toolbar button from the costumization window to
any of the toolbars.
2. Restart Firefox (I don't know if that's needed; I had costumized the toolbars
several week before this bug hit me)
3. Install an extension or do a software update
4. Restart Firefox

Actual Results:
The toolbars are layed out just a when you install firefox for the first time
with a fresh profile, the icon in the search box show a magnifying glass, and
no other icons/search engine are listed in the drop down menu.
The toolbar button I had put on the toolbar in a previous session are now all
present in the Costumize Toolbar dialog, along with the other icon I had left
there. The buttons/icons added by extension are also present there.
Costumizing the toolbar again help only during the session, after a restart all
is back to default iconset

Expected Results:
Display the toolbars just a they were before Firefox wa restarted.

I have experienced this bug three time now: Two time after installing an
extension, and just now after a software update. All three times, the same entry
in localstore.rdf (about the google search plugin) contained a duplicate
LastPingDate attribute. Removing one of those attribute solved this issue every
time.

So I guess a combination of trying to find an update for the google search
plugin and installing an extension/update or a combination of finding an update
for the google search plugin and restarting Firefox cause the addition of a
LastPingDate attribute, where it should be replaced, in localstore.rdf.
