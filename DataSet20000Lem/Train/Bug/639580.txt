The FF seems to be le and le stable when more and more tab are opened concurrently. Crashes seems to be taking place more often when approx 20+ tab are opened concurrently.

Also, cash seem to happen quite often with lot of graphic (various type of web page image on various tabs) are opened.

Moreover, crash are quite frequent when changing a tab while FF is loading tab just after the start.

All of the above might indicate some general issue with memory allocation and/or memory issue when processing load of image in memory.
