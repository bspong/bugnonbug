I went to cheaptickets.com and searched for some flight (9 passenger
between SJS and SAL).
The query return a long (22 page) result. I typed ^P to print, and
a dialog popped up saying "Preparing print data" or something
similar. It never finished, and Firefox did not respond to
clicking the close window-manager button.
-----------
Printing worked immediately under IE.
-----------
The Firefox hang happened on both Windows-XP and Linux (haven't tried Mac).
On Linux I ran 'top' and saw the the firefox process wa 99% compute-bound.
I let it run about 10 minute before killing the process. Printing
simple web page work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit cheaptickets.com
2.Search for some flights, wait for query to finish with many results.
3.^P

Actual Results:
A dialog box pop up saying something about "preparing print data"
(or similar) [same dialog on Windows & Linux, so I'm certain that
the dialog is either part of Firefox or the web page].

Firefox go compute-bound and never prints, and doe not respond to clicking
the close icon on any window.

Expected Results:
Printing.
