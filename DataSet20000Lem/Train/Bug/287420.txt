Windows version of Firefox doe not respond correctly to REJECT target for iptables.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050223 Firefox/1.0.1

I have two location i use firefox from. Home under linux, and work under win2k.
From home i have been annoyed by flash banner ad and added a iptables rule to
reject all traffic bound for ads.nozonedata.com (the ip, not the name). Firefox
under linux load fine and take the REJECT a a down site or whatever and load
the page without error and stop displaying the "loading" animation a soon a
the primary site image are loaded.

At work i have an IDENTICAL rule in my iptables config to REJECT traffic bound
for this site. Under Win2k (and under a Win2k VMware session from home) i get
the "loading" animation for more than 30 second after the page finish loading.

I obviously prefer the behavior under linux, but consistency would be preferable
between the two versions.

The site in question is www.darkthrone.com, but the banner ad i am blocking
from iptables are all loaded in a frame from http://ads.nozonedata.com/.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Include iptables filter to REJECT all outbound traffic to
ads.nozonedata.com's ip from fw.
2. Go to and log into www.darkthrone.com
3. From win2k watch the loading animation go on forever, under linux note the
page load normally and stop within a couple of second a expected.




What i am experiencing is probably not common, but i would not need to do this
at all if there were a way to block entire site a opposed to simply block
image from site.
