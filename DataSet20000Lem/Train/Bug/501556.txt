Gmail stop loading

In case where a user log in and out of multiple Gmail accounts, Firefox will likely load the first one or two gmail account page without issues--not referring to page within a single account. However, when logging into the third or fourth (or more) gmail account(s) subsequently, the page stop loading. Gmail HTML option or clearing the FireFox cache is the workaround. This is not limited to ver 3.5, but seems to only affect FireFox. This bug will also be reported to Google's Webmasters to correct the CSS.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into a Google Gmail account.
2. Log out and into additional Gmail account (possibly three or more). Two in my case.
3.
Actual Results:
Browser state "Done" in status bar, but page remains blank. the only usable text on the page is Google's way of asking you to switch to HTML if the page doe not load.

Expected Results:
Gmail account page should load normally.

It's possible FireFox ha an issue with caching gmail account when shifting from one Gmail account to another?
