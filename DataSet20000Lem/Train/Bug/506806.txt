Fire Fox 3.5.1 , java install will not complete with 3.5.1 and will not work with older java that worked with other firefox installed browsers.

Next, the Adobe reader will not work or install with 3.5.1 fire fox

Next the reason why i started to use ff3.4. to 3.5. to now 3.5.1 is because the browser would hang app on every site etc;

so i found out if i had used : tweak now reg cleaner and had deleted old registry garbage the FF3.5 would not hang app a much and had stopped hanging up.
but now i deleted my java to upgrade to newer java 1.6 and java 6 to work with fire fox , and it wont even update with the ff 3.5.1 browser.

and the damn adobe reader wont install and update or work with ff 3.5.1 either.

this browser is really nice, BUT it is like unfinished product and wont work properly without the ability to collaberate with java and adobe ...

I cannot check my email with excite .com

try it, it wont work...

I cannot find where the cookie setting will allow me to use excite email.

i am using outpost firewall free firewall, and i think my setting are ok there???

but i am 100% sure it is the FF 3.5.1 browser issue of non compatibility.

please, please, please.....

compensated and fixed the issue is what should have been done.
