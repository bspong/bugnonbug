For any website, trying to open a link to directly open/play a wmv file spawn a never ending cascade of new tabs. Subsequently the video never plays. The only way to stop the cascade is to stop the current page/tab from loading.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Find a link to a .wmv file
2.Click the link
3.Watch the new tab spawn
Actual Results:
Endless cascade of new tab trying to open the .wmv file. Subsequently they never load the movie.

Expected Results:
The movie will play in the current tab, or will open ONE new tab and play the movie there.

I am using Firefox 3.6 Beta 3 and I have Flip4Mac 2.3.0.14 (most current version) installed on a unibody Macbook running Snow Leopard 10.6.2

I realize this could be a Flip4Mac problem but I never noticed the problem until after I updated to 3.6 Beta 3. There hasn't been an updated for the Flip4Mac software in some time. Thus I am inclined to believe it is a problem with the more recent Firefox Betas. Perhaps it ha something to do with the Component Directory Lockdown??
