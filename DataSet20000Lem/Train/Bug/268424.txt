The table list unicode-entities in the first column. On some page
(latin-extended-b.html, greek-and-coptic.html) the first column is extremeley
width, but td width='...' is not defined. Other page created at the same way
are displayed correctly
(http://www.sql-und-xml.de/unicode-database/basic-latin.html,
greek-extended.html), the difference between the page is only the Unicode-Block
which is shown and described.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. See http://www.sql-und-xml.de/unicode-database/latin-extended-b.html
2. Switch to http://www.sql-und-xml.de/unicode-database/greek-extended.html

Actual Results:
Scrolling to the right shows, that the title of the first column is missing, the
other column are shown correct.

Expected Results:
The software should show the table correct, like the other file there.

All page are XHtml1.1-valide. A user cannot use these table because he can't
scroll every time from left to right and back. The very old browser Netscape 3.0
show the table correct (not the Unicode-entities), but a reader can see the
complete table and all the other informations. So 'major' a status.
