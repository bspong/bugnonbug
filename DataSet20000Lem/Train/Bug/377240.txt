I'm using Vista Enterprise and Firefox v2.0.0.3. Firefox ha been working for the last 4 months, but yesterday Firefox refused to open. The process wa running, but the Firefox window would not open. I uninstalled and attempted a reinstall when I got the "Error opening file for writing..." error. I'm an administrator and I also tried to run the setup using "Run As" and the default administrator account with the same results.

I finally got Firefox to reinstall while in WINDOWS safe mode. Firefox open fine in WINDOWS safe mode. However, when I boot into Vista normally, the Firefox window open (also with 'Run As') with no button or menu and inside where webpage are supposed to be rendered is the text:

"<window id="main-window"
^ <menuitem id="menu_HelpPopup_reportertoolmenu"
----^ <menuitem id="menu_HelpPopup_reportPhishingtoolmenu"
----^ <menu id="helpMenu"
----^"

When I open Firefox using Firefox (safe mode), the same occurs a above, but the text reads:

"<dialog id="safeModeDialog"
^"

I've uninstalled and reinstalled several time trying to get past this. I don't want to switch to IE 7. HELP!

Also, firefox.exe -P return this:
