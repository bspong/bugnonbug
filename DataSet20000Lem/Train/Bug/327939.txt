File | Print dialog is too large for the screen when accessibility feature is being used. Vision-impaired people will increace the screen rez, followed by increasing the screen DPI (which make text and GUI element larger). The app should scale properly, but this particular dialog (and others) don't. In the case of File | Print (and all others, for that matter), allowing the dialog to be resized would solve this problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Increace screen rez to max.
2. Increace DPI to 150% or greater (Display Properrties | Settings | Advanced).
3. Load FFX and try to print.

Actual Results:
Print dialog too large. GUI element (buttons, etc.) are off the visible screen area.

Expected Results:
Print dialog would be fully visible and/or resizable to fit the visible display area.

It would be a good best practice to require all Firefox dialog to be resizable. This would help accessibility.
