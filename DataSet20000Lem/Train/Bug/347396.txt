Images in a asp.net 1.1 datalist (table) do not align properly when page is first loaded. However, if I refresh the page then the image align properly. To recreate this problem do the following:
1) go to http://thornwood.com
2) click on image button called "Master Bedroom"
3) you should now see a new page with a list of images. Click on image button called "1900 series American Transitions"
4) You should see a new page with three images. Notice that the first and second image from the left ("Storage bed w/iron accents" and "Queen bedwall") are "squished" together. They overlap each other...
5) Now refresh the page. The image are properly aligned!
