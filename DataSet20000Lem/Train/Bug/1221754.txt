HAR fails to specify encoding for base64-encoded resource
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0
Build ID: 20151104030437

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open the Developer Tools, Network Tool.
2. Visit any page with binary resource (or directly navigate to a binary resource like this image: https://www.bayden.com/images/banner.jpg?12345)
3. Right click in the Network Request list and choose "Copy all a HAR"




Actual results:

HAR text is copied to the clipboard, and the resource is base64 encoded:

"content": {
"mimeType": "image/jpeg",
"size": 6171,
"text": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgD...VKgD//Z"
}

... however the "encoding" attribute indicating that this encoding wa performed is missing from the JSON.



Expected results:


Specifically, the JSON should look like this:

"content": {
"mimeType": "image/jpeg",
"size": 6171,
"text": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgD...VKgD//Z",
"encoding": "base64"
},

From the HAR spec:

text [string, optional] - Response body sent from the server or loaded from the browser cache. This field is populated with textual content only. The text field is either HTTP decoded text or a encoded (e.g. "base64") representation of the response body. Leave out this field if the information is not available.

encoding [string, optional] (new in 1.2) - Encoding used for response text field e.g "base64".
