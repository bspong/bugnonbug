Use a more efficient compression algorithm for official Firefox/Thunderbird/SeaMonkey build for OS X (bz2 instead of gzip)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; de-DE; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041108 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; de-DE; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041108 Firefox/1.0

I suggest using a more efficient compression algorithm, such a bzip2, to
compress the official Mac OS X builds.
This would result in a significantly reduced download size, around 1MB le for
Firefox/Thunderbird, even more for the suite.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. got to the mozilla.org download page using a modem or ISDN
2. start downloading
3. wait for ever

Actual Results:
Download take too long

Expected Results:
Download could be faster with BZIP2 instead of GZIP

I did some research on the support of BZIP2 in MacOS X and found out that the
shipped-with-OSX unpacking application, StuffIt Expander (www.stuffit.com),
support BZIP2 at least since version 6.5, version 9.0 is shipping now.

As this is the one standard tool in MacOS for generation already, there should
not be any problem using BZIP2.

I have been using it for the German package of Fire[bird|fox] and SeaMonkey for
over one year, and there were no complaint about it from the user in that time.
