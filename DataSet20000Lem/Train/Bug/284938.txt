Unable to type into any Text form field after loading HTMLArea 3.0 from Interactive Tools. Happens even after the browser is closed, re-opened and still happens after computer is restarted..

I went to this page above, started typing in the HTML Area Box.. clicked the
ABC icon(spell check). Fixed the word that it suggested. Then, clicked on
the Attach paperclip to the right of the Address Book Button.. clicked Finish.

Now in FireFox on Mac OSX 10.3.7, I can't type in ANY Text Area box on ANY
sites. I tried Google.. I tried logging into bugzilla.mozilla.org. I can't
type into text field now. The text field don't even look like the cursor
go into them.

What is crittical about this bug is that even after FireFox is closed and then
re-opened, No Text form can clicked or typed into. Even after a computer
Re-Start, No Text form can be clicked or typed into.

Apple Safari, doe allow typing into text fields, so it appears to be a FireFox
issue.

This issue doe not happen on the Windows Version of FireFox

Seems, eventually.. I can type into text field again.. after I have browsed
the web a little bit..

One more wierd issue, is when the browser is stuck like that, I can't even type
into the address bar. It won't get focus.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:
Unable to Type into text field on ANY site including the http://www.Google.com
Search box. No Text Bar Cursor is displayed in the text box when they are
clicked.

Expected Results:
The software should have displayed a cursor in the text box when I clicked it
and allowed me to type.

One odd configuration that I'm using on my Mac is I'm using Synergy to re-direct
the PC's mouse to the mac, however, I tested the Keyboard and mouse that are
hooked directly into the Mac and had the same erroneous result.
