Firefox get shut down when closing the downloads window by right-click.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

The problem (explained in third paragraph) I'm going to tell is not new. I have been experiencing this problem since Firefox 3.5. But I didn't report it to you. Because I thought the problem is so acute that someone would have reported it to Firefox developers. And you guy would be working on it to fix it in next update or in Firefox 4.0. With problem persisting and recurring, it seems nothing ha happened according to my anticipation and imagination.

Which ha forced me to file this bug today on this forum. So here it is.

The problem is whenever I close the Firefox download window by right-clicking on it taskbar button, the main window of Firefox get closed down along with it. And no matter how many tab are open in the Firefox, it just get shutdown without any prior warning or sign of crash. I say without any sign of crash because the browser start normally after the sudden shutdown.

One thing more, "multiple tab close warning" is on in my Firefox. But even that doesn't stop it from closing down suddenly. I've also checked the task manager, the Firefox window doesn't disappear to the background. It indeed get shutdown.

(**Note: The sudden shutdown of Firefox happens ONLY when the download window is closed by right-clicking on it taskbar button in XP. This problem doe not happen when the download window is closed by it cross mark(X). I'm using XP SP3 so I don't know this problem happens in Windows Vista and Seven also or not. In case you don't know, this is called task bar http://www.coolnerds.com/XP/Taskbar/xpTaskbar.htm )

I used to experience this problem 10 out of 10 time in Firefox 3.5. With Firefox 4.0 and 4.01, I'm experiencing this problem 7 to 8 time out of 10.

So Firefox guy I've explained my problem clearly in detail. Can you now do
something in this matter? Wonder how you missed such a big bug.
