I went to ebay.com and (not being signed in) clicked on My eBay (same thing happens with: Sign In). At this point, the browser just sits there with "Waiting for secureinclude.ebaystatic.com..." on the left side of the status bar with a "signin.ebay.com" and lock image on the right.

If I go to schlund.com and click on the Login link (right, near the top). On the left side of the status bar I see "Read config.schlund.com" and on the right I see "konfig.schlund.com" and the lock


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:




I have done this checking in Safe Mode (as well a standard). I visit eBay on a daily basis, and this started happening today, just a I returned to Vienna from a trip to New York. I plugged the Win XP Pro laptop in and downloaded update from Microsoft (but did not reboot the machine, per their message, to have the change go into effect). After the problem surfaced, I have cleared out all type of cache information except I kept cooky that did not have "ebay" and "schlund" in them. Both site are fine with IE 6. Apologies for the Component - wasn't sure of the best place for this.
