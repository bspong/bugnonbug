Streaming music in google play creates 100% CPU load and lagging.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.10; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20151014143721

Steps to reproduce:

I have a hardware configuration:
MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2014)
Processor: 2.8 GHz Intel Core i5
Memory: 16 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
Disk Drive: ssd.
Graphics: Intel Iris 1536 MB

As you can see it's a pretty decent configuration.

Then, I start firefox in a separate profile:
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin --safe-mode -P GooglePlay --no-remote --new-instance --new-window "https://play.google.com/"

Then I login into google play, switching to music section. Go to page: https://play.google.com/music/listen#/now and then go to "I'm feeling lucky radio" and press play.

Actual results:

It start to play music. After 30-60 minute the web-browser is hardly responding and music begin to interrupt. It look like there is a memory-leak or something like that.

If you refresh the tab - it start to work again.


Expected results:

It should not behave like that. It should work a normal without lags. I like Firefox and I really want to use it...

Can you help me to debug this problem? What kind of information do you need?
