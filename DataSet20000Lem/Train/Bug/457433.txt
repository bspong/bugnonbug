(1)The thought here is adding a priority level from say 1(low) to 100(high, but not higher than the firefox engine) or related priority system to the plugins to prevent it from consuming too cpu power leaving firefox, or the rest of the system, with a choppy/laggyness.

An example of how it run currently would be a 100... setting a plugin to 50 would throttle it execution by half.

(2) The optional ability to be able to suspend such plugin for example if all firefox window are minimized.

(3) The ability to suspend/resume some/all object on a given page of a given plugin, from a toolbar button, menu, etc.

(4) The ability to limit the number of instances, either on one page or globally, that a given plugin object can be used. (Example here would be loading a site that ha an excessive number of flash object (10+) and being able to limit it to 2 object on that page max.)

Reproducible: Always
