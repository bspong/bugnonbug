Icons in Bookmarks are misplaced (see the picture). Sites that do not provide
small icon (icon that appears in top left of the window bar), hava randomly
asigned icons. (BBC ha wrong icon - see that "i" icon appears many times, also
"linux today" icon appears twice, once where it should, next time to the wrong
site.)

These icon do not change the place.

Details about configuration:
My bookmark were imported from Mozilla 1.7.3 (Win). No icon appeared then in
bookmarks. After some browsing, FF added respective icons. In one moment I
realized they are misplaced/copied to wrong places.
