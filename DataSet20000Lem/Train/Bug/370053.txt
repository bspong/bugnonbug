If you click on a URL shortcut icon eg Google, Firefox will open two instances. The first instance is the webpage of the URL, the second window which now ha focus on top of the first window is whatever you have Firefox set to open to at startup (in my case homepage).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on a URL shortcut icon.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Two instance of Firefox open. The first instance is the URL destination webpage form the shortcut, eg www.google.com. Another instance of Firefox opens(set to whatever is in Options>Main>Startup eg my home page) on top of first window and steal focus from first window.

Expected Results:
Only one instance of Firefox set to the URL specified in the shortcut icon should open.

This bug can be produced in Vista and XP. When I did a format of Vista, there wa an error message stating "Windows cannot find http://www.google.com/. Make sure you typed the name correctly and start again." AND an instance of Firefox also opened at whatever it wa set to start at (I set it to my homepage).
I did not see this bug in the Feb 2 nightly build but see it in the Feb 10 build.
