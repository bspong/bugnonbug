The file download transfer rate is not calculated properly on resume. Currently it is considering the part of the file already downloaded a an instant download chunk, giving transfer rate way beyond sane values. Instead of this behavior, upon resume/start of an existing download, the download manager(s) should start calculating based on amount of data received from the network connection at the moment of resuming, not including the already received data from prior to the resume.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start a large and fast download.
2. Pause download after half of the file is transfered.
3. Wait a while.
4. Resume/start the download again and observe the transfer rate.
Actual Results:
Transfer rate displayed start at an insane value and slowly decrease until the ACTUAL correct rate is shown. This take almost a long a the rest of the download to see an ACCURATE rate displayed, making the measurement useless.

Expected Results:
The transfer rate should always reflect the current data incoming, NOT the data already present + currently incoming data. It should calculate ONLY the active and incoming data, not the entire percentage of the file since originally started.

i don't know what else to say. if that's not clear, email me at dysamoria.accounts at g m a i l dot com.
