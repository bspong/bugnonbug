NOTE: URL Given is an example.

There are two behavior in this issue.

1. Feeds won't load at all - If FF 3.0b2 is installed and us a ~/.mozilla from Firefox 2.0.0.x, live bookmarks/xml feed will not load even if the user prompt FF to reload the live bookmark. Live bookmark imported if .mozilla already exists exhibit the same behavior.

2. Feeds Load, but only manually - If FF 3.02 is installed and us a fresh (does not exist at first run) ~/.mozilla, feed imported from a bookmark file will load, but only manually.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Behavior - Not Functional

a. On a system with Firefox 2.x loaded and XML feed bookmarked, export the bookmarks.
b. Install and run FF 3.0 b2 Note the feed are not loading
c. Import the exported bookmark
d. Attempt to reload the feed

2. Functional with user prompting reload

a. Export bookmark from a previous install of FF 2
b. rm -rf ~/.mozilla or rename it to another name
c. Install and run FF 3.0b2
d. Import the bookmark
e. Attempt to load the feed

NOTE: FF 3.0b2 might need to be restarted
Actual Results:
In the first behavior, I cannot get FF to reload the bookmarks. Old data appears in the XML feed. In the second, I can get FF to reload the bookmark if I ask it too, unlike FF 2 behavior.

Expected Results:
The feed should load regardless of being imported from a file or by virtue of FF 3.0 using the same profile dir. This ha the potential of confusing user that frequently use XML feeds.
