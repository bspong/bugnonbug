I currently using Japanese Window XP and I use firefox 3.0.1 (both English and Japanese version were tried).

Hang up very frequently, CPU usage is 0% and only firefox process is not responding, hang up take about 10-20 second and recover.

Not knowing the exact condition to hang up, but usually when I browse the thumbnail in "speed dial" add-on. And hang up condition is I browse firefox add-on homepage and scroll the page up and down in very fast speed

Not because of add-on a it exist in safe-mode, and not because of Java-javascript a I disabled in option page.

I remember there is no hang up when I first use Firefox 3.0 and Firefox 2, so I re-install old version (firefox 3.0 installer is very hard to find, not exist in official page!!), the hang up not occur again.
