If an audio tag contains the option "controls" and doesn't contain the option "autobuffer", the streaming doesn't work - it stop after a few second and nothing happens. Please see the reference page.

Remarks:
- only with an ogg file tested
- the web server return the mime type "application/ogg"
- if you store the reference page locally and open a a file, both case work
- firefox 3.5 in safe mode is affected too
- firefox 3.6 beta from December 17th is affected too

P.S. in case it work (with autobuffer or locally a a file): if you press pause (during playback) and then press play again - it doesn't work any more, only after a page refresh.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the reference page http://frolo.de/mku/test.html
2. Try the first test case "With autobuffer:" - the playback work
3. Try the second test case "Without autobuffer:" - the playback doesn't work
Actual Results:
a) the playback doesn't work without autobuffer.
b) Play/Pause/Play/... doesn't work (see P.S.)

Expected Results:
a) The playback should work without autobuffer too.
b) Play/Pause/Play/... should work (see P.S.)
