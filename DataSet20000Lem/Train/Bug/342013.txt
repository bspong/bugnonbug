Cached image appear where other image should be

After surfing for awhile, Firefox begin to exhibit weird image caching behavior. I used Google Maps a the URL because it's where I most commonly see it (presumably realted to the large number of image being shuttled in and out). Incorrect image will begin to appear where others should be... a map of New Jersey in the middle of California, etc.-- all image I've seen before. In a few instances, image from other browser window and site have appeared, scaled to the inappropriate size. In most cases, these are obviously image from other site I've been on, so I don't feel this is a problem with Google.

Forgive me if this is a dupe, but I couldn't find it anywhere else -- I've noticed it on my work and home machines, both of which run 1.5.0.3 (one on Win2K, one on WinNT).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to Google Maps after a long browsing session.
2. Move the map around, zoom, etc.
Actual Results:
Incorrect image appear in the place of piece of the map -- sometimes from Google, sometimes not.

Expected Results:
Displayed the correct image (cached or otherwise).

Running some extensions: GMail notifier, Web Developer. I haven't reproduced this on a clean install, but only because the time involved would be significant -- I use a different plugin set at home and see the problem there a well.
