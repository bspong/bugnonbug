Not really sure what to write, never done this before. But ever since I reinstalled Firefox 2.0.0.4 on Windows Vista, Firefox will just randomly crash when I got to a website, or click on a link. Once I reopen though, I can go to the same site without a problem, so it seems to be fairly random a far a I can see. I've copied and pasted the info that display the reason for the crash.
I have also gone about uninstalling ALL Themes and Extensions, and still have the problem.
