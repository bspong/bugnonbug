Firefox restart loses URLs

When closing and restarting Firefox, one ha the option of restoring the previous session (all page open in tab will be reloaded upon restart). There is a bug in the implementation in which the URL of the page doe not appear in the location bar until _after_ the page ha loaded. This ha three consequences:
1) The user cannot bookmark or copy the URL to another location.
2) If the page fails to load, then there is no way to determine which URL wa in the particular tab. The best one could do is grep the History. However, user like me who erase their History upon closing Firefox are SOOL.
3) If Firefox is closed and reopened before the page loads, then the page is lost. Firefox doe not remember which page were loading in tab that did not load before it wa closed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a slow-loading page in Firefox.
2. Close Firefox.
3. Reopen Firefox. Note that the URL is inaccessable to be copied or bookmarked.
4. Close Firefox before the page loads.
5. Reopen Firefox.
6. The tab is blank!
7. ???
8. Profit!!!
Actual Results:
Page URL is lost.

Expected Results:
Access to page URL.
