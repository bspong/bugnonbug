[e10s] sendAsyncMessage() doe not work in content process after loading 'about:' page and then loading normal page

Steps to reproduce:

I am the developer of the 'Zoom Page' add-on. Whilst making change for the next version of Zoom Page, which should avoid the use of CPOW's, I noticed the following problem:

1. Start Nightly 41.0a1.
2. Open a new tab.
3. Load "Google" (or any normal page) into the tab.
4. Then load "about:config" into the same tab.
5. Then load "Google" (or any normal tab) into the same page.
6. sendAsyncMessage() no longer work in the content process!

To demonstrate this, I have built a small addon called 'Demo Bug' (attached) which display message when pageshow, resize, click and DOMMOuseScroll event are fired. For each event, a message is displayed directly in the web page content - and the same message is also sent to the chrome process (using sendAsyncMessage) and displayed in the Bookmark Toolbar.


Actual results:

After completing step 1-5, sendAsyncMessage() no longer work in the content process!

The message displayed by the 'Demo Bug' add-on do not remain synchronized between the content process (in the web page content) and the chrome process (in the Bookmark Toolbar).

After step 5:

- message are still displayed by the content process (in the web page contents), so the event are still being fired, but the message counter ha been reset to zero, probably indicating that the frame script ha been reloaded.

- message are no longer received or displayed by the chrome process (in the Bookmark Toolbar), indicating that sendAsyncMessage() is no longer working.


Expected results:

After completing step 1-5, sendAsyncMessage() should still work in the content process.

The message displayed by the 'Demo Bug' add-on should remain synchronized between the content process (in the web page content) and the chrome process (in the Bookmark Toolbar).
