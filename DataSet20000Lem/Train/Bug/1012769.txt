side-by-side installation don't execute side-by-side
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:32.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/32.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

installed Firefox release and nightly on the same machine (tried on both Win7 & Win8 with the same results)


Actual results:

on Win7, got 2 separate instance of whichever one I opened first, if I closed them all then opened the other one, got delayed by a window about upgrading Firefox. Win8 wa similar but it activated the first instance instead of opening a second one.


Expected results:

Since they're 2 separate apps, with 2 separate install directories, they should work that way! Possibly related is that in AppSettings I could not find the separate folder for Nightly, this indicates the issue is likely with the installer rather than the app. If Nightly is pointing at the same setting and there are breaking changes, it would be the stable/release that breaks. If I'm running an unsupported scenario let me know. I can only assume that the FF devs run each channel in separate VMs? The whole purpose of having Release is in case I run into a bug in Nightly, but since apparently Nightly can break Release that's even worse!
