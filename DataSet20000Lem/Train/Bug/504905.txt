Firefox stop responding and hog massive RAM when tabbing while on Yahoo's mail - meaning if I use tab on a fresh instance of FF, it will stop responding and cause issues: RAM get sucked up by the firefox process @ a rate of about .02-.04GB/s, which bog down my system* (HD go into overtime when this happens). I have to manually shut down Firefox from task manager, which cause RAM resource to be freed. I have a screen shot of the spike in the RAM usage while FF wa crashing, but I can't post it anywhere.

*system: WinXP SP3, CPU T2400@1.83ghz(dual core), 1GB RAM - More than enough.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox after boot or hibernation-restore. (2 out of 10 time it will crash even if the instance is not fresh)
2. Open a new (2nd) tab and attempt to log into Yahoo's mail, or if passed login page, somewhere in the inbox it will crash.

(Note1: no new hardware/software added)
(Note1: screen shot available)
Actual Results:
Firefox crash and suck up major RAM. Solution is killing the process, but result in lost data (composing email for example)

Expected Results:
Not crash while multi-tabbing.
