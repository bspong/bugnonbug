e10s - "tab crashed" making Nightly mostly useless

Steps to reproduce:

Tabs crash very often. When it happens, most of the other tab which were fine are replaced with the "tab crashed" page.

[Using FF33.1.1/Wine to report]


Actual results:

Got:
Tab crashed
Well, this is embarrassing. We tried to display this Web page, but it's not responding.
Try again
Hit Try again; but usually no response. Switching to any other tab: switch occurs; but page just leaf this same error display up -- often no way out except to restart.

On konsole, get LOTS of these:

!!! [Core] updateMenus(): [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsIProperties.get]" nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)" location: "JS frame :: file:///home/pfortin/.mozilla/firefox/iowvrjx2.default-1404854812966/extensions/%7Bb9db16a4-6edc-47ec-a1f4-b86292ed211d%7D/components/dhCore.js :: Core.prototype.updateMenus :: line 498" data: no]

!!! [Core] cleanupEntriesForDocument: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE) [nsIProperties.get]" nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)" location: "JS frame :: file:///home/pfortin/.mozilla/firefox/iowvrjx2.default-1404854812966/extensions/%7Bb9db16a4-6edc-47ec-a1f4-b86292ed211d%7D/components/dhCore.js :: Core.prototype.cleanupEntriesForDocument :: line 336" data: no]



Expected results:

1. Try again didn't
2. switching to other window or tab -- every page ha either "tabs crashed" or the new spinner.
