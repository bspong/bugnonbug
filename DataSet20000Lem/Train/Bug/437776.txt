Navigation toolbar button and text box disappear in every new instance of Firefox 3 RC2

Been using RC2 of firefox 3 since it wa released.

Today, it wa working fine a always, but i closed Firefox and re-opened it because i forgot doing a search on google. When Firefox opened google search text box had disappeared and I wa not able to make it appear again.

I closed firefox and re-opened again. This time Not only google search text box dissapeared but also the URL text box did too.

Not being happy about that, re-opened firefox again, and in navigation toolbar it only left back and forward button and the reload page one. All the rest have dissapeared.

No problem on virus and/or spyware. Restarting OS did not worked. Using Windows XP SP3 English version on a laptop with 512 MB Ram.

No problem until now. Possible failure on "DownthemAll!" add-on, which updated just before anything happened. Maybe failure is on the add-on or maybe on the add-on system.

Notice that I haven't customize the toolbar and that I am the only user of the system the bug happened to.

Feel free to contact me for further information if needed.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
Not possible to reproduce it. Tried restarting firefox, OS and disabling Downthemall! add-on (which could be the failure), but nothing worked. Not even disabling Navigation toolbar and enabling later.
Actual Results:
Nothing special happened, except all button and text box in navigation toolbar disappeared, one by one on each restart of Firefox. Everyone except back and forward buttons, which are still there.

Expected Results:
Navigation toolbar should be like original one.

Theme used: Default theme.

No change made on my system. No new software installed nor even unistalled.

The only change done to Firefox RC2 since I installed it wa the update on DownThemAll! add-on.
