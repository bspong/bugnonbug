Hello.

First of all, I'm using a fresh ~/.phoenix profile directory. I've downloaded
tonight's nightly and extracted it. I customized it in option and then chose
to install a few new theme from the default web site. However, two problem
followed.

(1) When 'Use this theme' checkbox is checked the browser *did not* apply the theme.
(2) When I manually selected a new theme in 'Options' and clicked OK the
dialogue box refused to vanish and the theme wa not applied. However, when I
clicked on the default theme and clicked OK the dialogue box disappeared and the
theme remained on default.

Also, the texturizer theme site popped up a particular dialogue box repeatedly
which said '421 There are too many connection from your internet address' even
though I only went to it once from my IP address.

I'd be grateful if firebird or the theme could be updated to work with one another.

With regards.
