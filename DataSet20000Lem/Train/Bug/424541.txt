Both the mouse and the keyboard may be used to highlight suggestion from the location bar. They both change which suggestion is highlighted. For example, if you mouse to Suggestion A, then press "down", the highlight move to the selection below Suggestion A.

However, only using the keyboard move the suggestion into the location bar. When there is a long list of suggestions, merely seeing that a suggestion is highlighted isn't enough to tell you whether pressing return will load it; you have to remember whether you moused there or keyboarded there, or look up at the URL bar (which often ha a very similar-looking URL in it, if you keyboarded, then moused to a suggestion).

It's very common for me to hover over a suggestion, then type "return" and have firefox attempt to load the URL of the search terms, not the highlighted suggestion.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type bookmark/history search term in the location bar.
2. Mouse over an alternative.
3. Press return
Actual Results:
Attempts to load URL consisting of search term.

Expected Results:
Load URL of highlighted suggestion.
