firefox keep calling any http site "untrusted connection" and requires adding an exception but it doesn't help. The page load blank! Please fix this or I'll need to roll back to an earlier version. Here's an email I tried sending to microsoft but they have no contancrt support email:

I cannot log in to hotmail or access any msn pages. I keep getting
blank page and the following error message in firefox:

"This is an untrusted connection"

I add exception but it doe not help. All msn page load a blank.
In firefox error console, says:

Warning: Unknown property 'text-index'. Declaration dropped.
Source File:

https://secure.wlxrs.com/~Live.SiteContent.ID/~15.3.20/~/~/~/~/css/R3WinLive1033.css
Line: 138

One of the offending script is: www.secure.wlxrs.com
All msn and live.compages are reported a having an unsecure
and/or "untrusted" connection and then load entirely blank. I add
them a exception but doe no good.

And being unable to login, can't use the resource msn/hotmail
provides to blog or troubleshoot about it.

Please look into it, thank you.
