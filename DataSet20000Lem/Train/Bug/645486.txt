There are two type of behavior:

1. When I uncheck the "Menu Bar" option in the context menu, two Firefox button appear. One look like the new Firefox button but the color is black. The other ha the new orange color but it size is too small that it only show the letter "F" with the downward arrow. Both button are adjacent to each other with the orange one on the left. The black Firefox button behaves normally a the new Firefox button should. The orange one however doe two things. If I click on it, it will show up the option just like it should but in addition it show the traditional menu in a ghostlike bar when I hover the mouse over it.

2. If I tick the "Menu Bar" option, the black button disappears but the small orange one remains. But this time it doesn't show the required menu when I click but show only the ghostlike traditional menu when the mouse is hovered over it.

Reproducible: Always

1. Open Firefox with "Menu Bar" disabled to get the first type of behavior.
2. Open Firefox with "Menu Bar" enabled to get the second type of behavior.

Firefox 4 wa difficult to install in Ubuntu 10.04. The i686 file from the site couldn't install. Finally I got it installed a follows:

1. First I removed version 3.6 completely through Synaptic
2. Deleted the ".mozilla" folder from "/home".
3. Added the following in sources.list
- deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/mozillateam/firefox-stable/ubuntu lucid main
- deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/mozillateam/firefox-stable/ubuntu lucid main
4. Ran sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-stable
5. Ran sudo apt-get update
6. Installed version 4 through Ubuntu Software Center.
