DEP is killing FF3 every 5-10 minute (sometimes even le than that) - I'm on a fresh FF3 (final release), fresh profile, with no extensions.

The crash are completely random and even happen when I have no (0) tab open. They happen very frequently for me and it is stopping me from using this browser. I love FireFox and use it daily on my mac, but it is a shame I cannot use it successfully on my desktop.
