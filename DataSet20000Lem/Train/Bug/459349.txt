Whenever I try to attach a file on a webpage (regardless of the file type: jpg, png, whatever) Firefox crashes. When I click on "browse" and window explorer come up, rather I choose a file, or just click the "X" to close it, Firefox crash immediately. I've had this problem since the very start of the FF 3 branch, and it ONLY happens in Firefox, IE doesn't have this problem neither did FF 2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.run Windows Vista
2.goto any website, ANY website that ha a file attachment thingy
3.click on "browse" to choose a file
4.you can choose a file if you want to, or just click the "X" either one will reproduce the issue.
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, completely exits. When you run firefox again, it tell you that it crashed and askes you to restore previous session or start a new session.

Expected Results:
instead of crashing, the path to the filename should show up in the textbox
like for instance
"D:\myfiles\picture1.jpg"
or something along those lines.
