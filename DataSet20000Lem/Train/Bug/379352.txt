Clicking link in Thunderbird often doesn't open window in FireFox
Not sure if this bug is Thunderbird or Firefox. And it is tricky because it is not consistently reproducible.

ABOUT FIREFOX: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

ABOUT THUNDERBIRD: version 1.5.0.10 (20070221)

Start Thunderbird.

Start Firefox.

Receive an email in Thunderbird (even, say, from the bugzilla system!) which ha a clickable link in it.

Click the link.

Link open fine in FireFox.

Continue using the system for a while.

Open the same email.

Click the link.

Nothing happens in FireFox.

Expected behavior: Same link would open in FireFox.

Other information:

Sometimes, over time, the problem go away, and clicking link will again work between Thunderbird and Firefox. If I reboot the system, the problem ALWAYS go away, at least for a short while. Eventually, it always come back.

If I use Windows Mail to read email, seems to have no problem opening link indefinitely in FireFox.

If I use Internet Explorer a browser, and Thunderbird a mail program, there also seems not to be a problem.

Problem seems to exist ONLY between Thunderbird and FireFox.

Caveat: I hate Windows Mail and Internet Explorer, so I haven't pushed them a hard because I don't like using them.
