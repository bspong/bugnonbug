Every time that I open Firefox, I get the following error window:

The window is titled :firefox.exe - Entry Point Not Found

The error message is: The procedure entry point
?SetIsVoid@nsCSubstring@@QAEXH@Z could not be
located in the dynamic link library xpcom.dll

Firefox still open after I hit the "ok" button in the middle of this error.

I noticed this after downloading and installing some extension for Firefox.
