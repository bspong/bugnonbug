Any page that ha redirects (i.e. when clicked on
http://www.blabla.com/redirect1015.php it redirects you to www.somepage.org)) to
other page instead of direct URL's is not beeing loaded while the original page
(the one where you clicked the link) is loading. Direct link work fine.

NOTE #1: This only happens if the URL you clicked on should open in a new window
or if you open it in a new tab (naturally) while the page which ha the link is
still beiing loaded.

NOTE #2: Works on almost all page which use redirects instead or direct URLs
(HTML's _new or javascripted new window) and very few (which use redirects)
don't have this issue.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to anypage which us URL redirects to other pages.
2. Click on the URL while the page is loading (either open it in a new tab or
just click on it).
A nice example of this would be if you go to a gallery page with thumbnail
which us php redirects (or anything other than a direct link) to larger
images/other site and try to open link in either a new tab or a new window
while the page is loading.
Actual Results:
The page you want to access won't load until the original page where you clicked
the URL isn't 100% loaded. If you had clicked before 10 or more pages, the
moment the original page is loaded all link redirect themselves OK.

Expected Results:
Should open a new window/tab _WHILE_ the page is loading and redirect to
whatever page needed and start loading that page.
