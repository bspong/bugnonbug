When you remove the back and forward button from the toolbar, and then put them
back on, you can't use them anymore (they become disabled).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
0. Have back and forward button on the toolbar
1. Browse to several pages, then go back one page, so both back and forward
button are "green"
2. Customize the toolbar. Remove back and forward buttons.
3. Put the back and forward button back on the toolbar
(it make no difference if you do this in the same customize 'session' or if you
first press done and then open customize again)
Actual Results:
Back and forward button are disabled, for all tabs.

Expected Results:
Back and forward button should still be enabled.

- This only affect the back and forward buttons, no others
- The button ha to enabled for the bug to occur. Ie, when forward is gray
because you didn't go back a page, removing and putting back the forward button
doe not make the bug appear.
- After closing and restarting Firebird, the button are working again.
