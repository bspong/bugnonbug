SSLv3 error page is shown even for case where the issue is a mismatch between supported TLS range
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0
Build ID: 20150125222139

Steps to reproduce:

Using Firefox for Ubuntu version 35.0.1, on Ubuntu 12.04.
Cipherfox add-on installed
Following security related config value set:
security.tls.version.min;2
security.ssl3.ecdhe_ecdsa_rc4_128_sha;false
security.ssl3.ecdhe_rsa_rc4_128_sha;false
security.ssl3.rsa_rc4_128_md5;false
security.ssl3.rsa_rc4_128_sha;false
extensions.cipherfox.disable_rc4;true



Actual results:

Every time I visit a page that us TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.0 I get an error message (which is ok, because a above minimum TLS version is set to value 2) but error message says:
"Firefox cannot guarantee the safety of your data on [sitename] because it us SSLv3, a broken security protocol.
Advanced info: ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap"

This error message is wrong because it appears also for site using TLS 1.0 and not just for site using ssl v3.


Expected results:

An error message that say e.g. ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap, (as in previous version of FF) and nothing about ssl v3.

On debian 7.0 with Iceweasel 31.3.0 (no cipherfox) and above security configs the error message is correct saying:
An error occurred during a connection to [sitename]. Cannot communicate securely with peer: no common encryption algorithm(s). (Error code: ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap)
