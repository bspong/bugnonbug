browser_967000_button_sync|tabview.js fails when running a a standalone directory
in bug 992911, we are looking to enable test where we run a fresh browser instance per directory. Usually what happens is that a few test fail because they accidentally depend on the state of the browser from an earlier test.

In a try run:
https://treeherder.mozilla.org/ui/#/jobs?repo=try&revision=6d8041d9592d

you can see that bc1 is orange across the board and for the most part it is the same test failing on each platform:
09:35:02 INFO - 1230 INFO TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_967000_button_sync.js | A promise chain failed to handle a rejection: - at chrome://browser/content/aboutaccounts/aboutaccounts.js:299 - TypeError: window.location is null
09:35:02 INFO - 1234 INFO TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | chrome://mochitests/content/browser/browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_967000_button_tabView.js | A promise chain failed to handle a rejection: - at chrome://browser/content/aboutaccounts/aboutaccounts.js:299 - TypeError: window.location is null

I am able to reproduce this locally while running:
./mach mochitest-browser browser/components/customizableui/test/browser_967000_button_sync.js

The error here are sort of cryptic, is there a chance that this is an easy fix or you could give some guidance to me to fix this problem?
