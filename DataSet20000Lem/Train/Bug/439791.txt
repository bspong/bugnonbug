just by typing this message caused a load percentage of around 15%, normal usage on forum and non-media intencive site cause up to 40% load and youtube site up to 100% granted firefox 2.0 did experience similar load problem but from what lm currently experiencing it pretty much constant from the moment l upgraded to 3.0 l admit my system isnt cutting edge but it should handle thing easy with 2GB ram and an AMD X2 4600+.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load firefox
2. browse some site
3. maybe even visit youtube
Actual Results:
between 15% when typing and 100% CPU usage when browsing or viewing content for long period of time by just haveing the window open

Expected Results:
lm not expecting to see usage go down a such, l know with all these new application and service out there today that computer need to be upgraded all the time to cope with system intensive applications, personally ld like to see a reduction in needed resources, although lm not so bothered about memory ld like to see processor usage plummet to around what it wa when l used firefox 2.0 or maybe even become more resource friendly!

pretty much specified it all within my earlier explanations.
