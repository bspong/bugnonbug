Steps to reproduce:

I attempted to upgrade Adobe Flash Player to the latest version for Windows XP, 32 Bit -- Flash version 11.2.202.228.



Actual results:

Tried to do the upgrade at the Adobe site. The default attempt is live update. Got message saying it failed and must use manual update.

So I downloaded the file (more than once) and tried that (more than once). When I execute the file, nothing happens for a few second then the file disappears -- so if I don't have a backup I have to download it again. Deleted Firefox -- Re-installed latest FF -- Setup new profile. Tried again. Nothing helps.

All other software I've been using on my computer, including FF, show no problems.



Expected results:

I wa only one version old on the Flash Player. I expected the upgrade to the latest version to go smoothly. Now I have no Flash Player at all and I've spent hour trying to fix this.

I run Symantec AntiVirus and Windows Firewall all the time, have no other problems, and tried installation with the all of that ON a well a with all of it OFF. I tired it with my wireless router both ON and OFF also. I have nothing left to turn off or try. And to try anything else -- of which I've no idea -- seems like beating a dead horse.
