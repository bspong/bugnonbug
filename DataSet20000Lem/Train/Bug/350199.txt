When loading live chat from my company's website, customer get the pre-chat survey. Once completed and submit is pressed, they're brought to the chat window (an http applet), given a message with the approximate wait until an operator will be available. On the right side of the chat window is a small section where the image above should display. In all version of firefox from present back to 1.0, trying to load that image cause the chat window to stall or hang. They don't receive any message from the chat operator and can't submit any messages. Loading the image using http work but, you'll get a message to the effect "some element on this page are not secure, do you want to load the non-secure elements?". In IE, either image load without issue, the same if I use firefox and switch the rendering engine to IE, the image load just fine and chat is functional.

I have seen a very few occassions where a user in Firefox ha been able to get into chat. However, we're talking a ratio in the neighborhood of 1:500 and I've never been able to successfully get into chat using firefox, and I've tried all releases.
