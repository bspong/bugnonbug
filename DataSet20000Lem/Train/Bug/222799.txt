Options dialog assumes white background/black text colour

The Firebird option panel inherits the default Windows colour for dialogs.
Usually these include white window background and black window text. For me,
these are dark blue background and white text. This is not a problem for most
things, but the selected and mouseover background colour for the section are
light, and they do *not* force the text to be black, so the selected/mouseover'd
section text is barely readable. Similarly, the selected group of option in the
right panel ha a light yellow background, and doe not force black text, thus
causing the option to be unreadable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set system colour to white text/dark background (either manually or using a
skin that ha them)
2. Start Mozilla and go to the Options dialog
3. Expand an option on the right

Actual Results:
The expanded option were not easily readable, and mousing over an item on the
left caused it to be unreadable.

Expected Results:
If the option dialog is going to force a light background on some things, it
should stop assuming that the background is going to be white and that text is
going to be black and instead force these thing a well (if you're forcing it,
at least force everything! ;-). Alternatively it could use a different *system*
colour to do so, but it should be careful and choose a colour that will never be
unreadable on another.
