Bookmarks menu hang when clicking on the menu bar, and when negotiating into the folder beneath, in an erratic, unpredictable fashion. This wa worse in vs.2.0, but it is still erractically appearing in vs. 2.0.0.6.

I do not have any of the add-on referenced a hanging conflicts.

I find no explanation for this behavior, but I am not a computer geek, (and I doubt many user are.)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on menu bar at "bookmarks"
2. click on "bookmarks" and negotiate to a folder below
3. click on "bookmarks", and negotiate to a subfolder below.
Actual Results:
The browser hangs, with that wonderful spinning beach ball, and will not release without restart.

No other application are affected.

Expected Results:
I should have been able to release the mouse on the bookmark, and gone to that web site URL.

My use of the computer is entirely basic. I have no odds and end add-on software, nor any other software other than the basic Mac OS 10.2.8, and basic applications.

I have not put any unusual thing on my system, in term of any kind of downloaded software, etc.

This problem did not exist prior to the update to vs. 2.0 and later. (I did reinstall vs. 1.5.0.1.2. after the initial problem with vs. 2.0, and I may yet do that again, a it appears this version is also not ready for prime time.)
