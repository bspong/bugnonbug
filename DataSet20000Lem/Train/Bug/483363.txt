Firefox 3.0.7 is not remembering information normally saved in cookies, including entered account information, and forum status information such a removing "new post" notification after post have been access or marked a read, until after the page a been hard-refreshed (CTRL+F5) at least once, if ever. I've cleared all the cookies, and even deleted the cookies.sqlite file in my profile folder, and neither ha done anything to help. Cookies are being created for said sites, but they don't seem to load their information into the browser when page are changed. This isn't just a single site, this ha been every single site where permanent or per-session cooky are usually stored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse to a site that is password protected or otherwise ha per-session cooky to keep track of your navigation
2.Enter password and log in
3.Click a "New Post" notification link and access link location and/or mark forum a read, click OK/Enter/etc.
4.Forum page load in again, with the same "New Post" notification link still in place, at least until you hit CTRL+F5 at least once. Even then, it isn't guaranteed to register the fact that you've visited that link.
5.Log into the page again, because by now, the browser ha forgotten your login information.
Actual Results:
Browser didn't register that "New Post" notification link were already view, or post to the site are not made. Hitting CTRL+F5 sometimes make it register.

Expected Results:
Entering a post should post when you hit enter and New Post Notification link should clear after you've visited the page

Other page are acting strange in Firefox since the upgrade to 3.0.7; page stop loading and show just a blank white page many time
