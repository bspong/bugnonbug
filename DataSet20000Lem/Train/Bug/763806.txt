allow social provider to specify less-intrusive "shrunken sidebars"
Part of our goal in implementing Facebook's sidebar is to allow user to continue their Firefox browsing while being in touch with their social circle. In this way, Facebook is available and scannable, but also ignorable.

Of course, if a user want to focus, they can temporarily hide the Facebook sidebar. But what if they're still having a conversation with a Facebook contact? What if that conversation is part of their browsing task? For instance, say a user wanted to pick a restaurant eat at with a friend. They would want to continue talking to that friend while browsing restaurant websites, but the other information in their social feed would be irrelevant and possibly distracting.

The attached mockup show a smaller, shrunken state of the Facebook sidebar. All but contacts' avatar and active conversation are hidden.

There's other reason than distraction to allow user an option halfway between the full Facebook sidebar and no sidebar at all. Contact name and contact notification represent deeply personal data. Any one contact could be a very private part of a person's life. Any notification could contain private information, profanity, or other data that user may not want to have visible at all times.

By giving user the ability to shrink their bar to just their contacts' faces, we're allowing them to continue browsing with more screen real estate and continue conversation while disengaging from the more frenzied slew of information in their social feed. With name hidden, potentially private data is le likely to be glimpsed by a passer-by. But, functionality isn't highly reduced: user are likely to recognize the contact they converse with. If an avatar is unfamiliar, the user can mouse over it for the contacts' full name.
