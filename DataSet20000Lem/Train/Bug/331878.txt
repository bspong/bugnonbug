Copying and pasting either to or from firefox (or thunderbird) fails unless firefox is running a admin. This is running firefox a a limited user - not a partial admin account that ha nearly every admin privledge, but a properly set limited user aka standard user.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Either log on a a limited user or use the runas command or other mean to launch firefox a another user
2. Attempt to copy and paste anything to/from firefox
3. Fail
Actual Results:
Nothing is read or written to the clipboard.

Expected Results:
Selected item is copied into clipboard, or clipboard item is pasted into firefox/thunderbird.

Exact same problem in Thunderbird 1.5
Internet browser and email client should not require administrator right to function, running internet aware program a a limited user is a very useful mean of mitigating damage done by malware/spyware/trojans/exploits etc etc ad nasuem.
This is the only bug I've found keeping me from implementing limited user browsers/email on a large install base...which could save me looooooots of hair pulling in the future.
IE7 is supposed to have this feature in vista but if program were correctly written to the window file system/security model since NT/2000 this wouldn't be an issue. (yes, even MS wrote IE5 and 6 wrong)
Theres a great writeup here from the march 02 entry: http://www.sysinternals.com/Blog/
