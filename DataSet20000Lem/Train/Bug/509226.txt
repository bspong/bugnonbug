When I access a site that will give me a security warning and drag a bookmark from my bookmark toolbar to the tab bar, the browser freeze and I cannot click any buttons.

I access a site that give me a popup that says:
Although this page is encrypted, the information you have entered is to be sent over an unencrypted connection and could easily be read by a third party.

Are you sure you want to continue sending this information?

Continue Cancel

But if I drag a bookmark to the tab bar before the popup come up, then the browser freezes. I cannot click any button and the only option is to use Task Manager to kill the process.
