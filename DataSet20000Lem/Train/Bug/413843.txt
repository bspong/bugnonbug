When I use JAWS 9.0 and FF 2.0.0.11 and open a Dojo dialog, JAWS will speak the item with focus and then speak "dialog" and the dialog title. In Minefield the dialog information is not spoken by JAWS.

Using MS Inspect32 the role and state information look similar but in Minefield there is an additional element in the ancestor history - a div with no role or state. The dialog content are within a table for layout. The table element do appear in the MS Inspect ancestor hierarchy. There is also a div around the dialog content in addition to the div which ha the dialog role. It seems that the extra div in the a11y hierarchy may be the problem. Not sure if this is a JAWS or Minefield issue but filing here since JAWS doe work correctly in FF 2.0.0.11.
