3.2% increase in Phoenix Ts after bookmark landing
By inspection of the Phoenix tbox (
http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/showbuilds.cgi?tree=MozillaTest )n the bookmark
landing (09/12/02 21:00) ha led Ts to jump from 2090 to 2160ms (3.2%) . Txul
ha also increased by ~1%.

Since I have added/renamed some file here is how the bookmark code is now
organized:

bookmarks.js: library of j routine used to handle bookmark
bookmarksTree.xml: the tree widget
bookmarksToolbar.xml: the personal toolbar widget
bookmarks.css: binding of the widget
bookmarks.properties: property of the bookmarks.

bookmarksManager.js and bookmarksManager.xul: file to display the BM (olderly
bookmarks.js and bookmarks.xul)

The day before the landing (09/12/2002 03:37), I checked in the change in
browser.css that were affecting the toolbar and menu styles. There wa no perf
regression.

Basically, what ha changed in browser.xul is:
- xblification of the personal toolbar folder.
- import of bookmarks.css (binds all phoenix widgets. Before, the tree widget
wa from xpfe)
- import of bookmarks.js (+26K wrt to the old bookmarkOverlay.js)

and in browser.js:
- removal of code now in bookmarks.js and bookmarksToolbar.xml (-23K)

in bookmarksTree.xml:
- removal of 54K of code (olderly bookmarks.xml)

what ha not changed:
- bookmarks.html file reading still defered and in another thread
- bookmark trasaction manager not instantiated at startup.

So, I am a bit perplexed, I did not expect such a regression.
What's your thoughts? I won't have a lot of time to investigate it,
unfortunately. As I already told, I'll be very busy next weeks. I can back out
the change for the time being. I'll have time to dedicate to it after.
