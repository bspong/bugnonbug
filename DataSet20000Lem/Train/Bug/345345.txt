(I've only tested this with GMail so far, but it work every time.)

If FFX crash while logged in to GMail, using Session restore will take me back to GMails main view, bypassing the login.

If I instead quit FFX normally, going back to GMail force me to supply name and password.


This is pretty bad for public computers, where someone could easily access others personal information such in this case emails.

I hope there is a way to disable this feature for public computers, but I'm not sure it will help a admins are human too. It will be easy to forget to turn it off and there'll be victims.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Start FFX and go to http://www.gmail.com/
2) Enter your details, do NOT check "Remember me.."
3) When logged in, use Task Manager to kill FFX
4) Start FFX again, use "Restore session"



Actual Results:
Goes straight into the main list of emails, bypassing the login!

Expected Results:
Going back to login screen, asking for name & password.
