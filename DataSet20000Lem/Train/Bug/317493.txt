Really strange character offset problem when selecting text

I wa browsing Slashdot, and found the following "quote" at the bottom of a page:
"At least they're ___________EXPERIENCED incompetents"

I don't know if everyone will experience the same problem, so I might a well describe it. When selecting text within or to the right of the plus/minus signs, all text to the right of the start of the selection is suddenly displaced equally many pixel to the right a the number of plus/minus sign that are to the left of the end of the selection (regardlessly of whether the plus/minus sign themselves are selected). When selecting the entire text from left to right, this lead to the text being gradually "panned" to the right.

This happens regardlessly of whether text is selected with the mouse or keyboard, gradually or all at once, and regardlessly of font or where the text appears (for example, it happens both on web pages, when rendered in the standard Sans font, and in this very text box that I'm entering this in, which ha a Mono font).

This bug may already be filed, but I thought this would be a good test case regardlessly.

In case it matters, I'm running Gentoo Linux with X.org 6.8.2 (revision r4-0.1.10.2), with the standard Gentoo mozilla-firefox-1.0.7-r2 ebuild (USE flag gnome, ipv6, mozsvg, truetype, xinerama and xprint).
