Autocomplete urlbar affect execution of bookmarklets thru keyword.

I made simple bookmarklet that is supposed to open an URL address in new tab via window.open() function. This bookmarklet wa saved to my bookmark and in bookmark property I set a keyword - say 'go'. In the bookmarklet is also used Firefox's parameter '%s'.
Now if you type 'go something' the bookmarklet will be and should be executed. The problem is that not always the bookmarklet is executed the same way/the right way. Let's say you typed 'go jfdkafjdas'. It is ofcourse nonsense, but urlbar autocomplete function will start to search in history, bookmarks, tag etc. If you press enter during this searching the bookmarklet will be executed BUT there won't be executed the window.open() function! If you disable urlbar autocomplete feature OR you would wait until urlbar stop searching in history, bookmark and tag the bookmarklet would be executed correctly and also all window.open() function (as expected).

In one sentence: If you execute bookmarklet thru keyword while urlbar is autocompleting no window.open() function in bookmarklet will be executed, although all other function will work just fine.

Reproducibility: Happens sometimes, but not always. Sometimes urlbar is autocompleting too short time to reproduce this. So you have to type 'go someLongNonsenseToGetUrlbarBusy' and press enter. However this won't guarantee you to see this bug. You have to try it.

Way to fix this: If you disable urlbar autocompleting I never got this bug - notwithstanding I wa trying hard. To do this go to "about:config" -> browser.urlbar.autocomplete.enabled = false.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make new bookmark with this properties:
a. title = anything
b. address = javascript:s="%s";window.open("http://www.google.com");void(0);
c. keyword = go

2. go to this URL = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ (or any other complex webpage)

3. Click to urlbar OR press "alt+d" and type "go fdjsljfdajfdskajfdksal". Wait for 1 or 2 second - you have to see that urlbar ha started autocompleting your query - and press ENTER.

4. If no new window/tab wa opened you have just successfully reproduced the bug. If there were opened new window/tab with http://www.google.com you should try this again - don't forget to check:
a. you have enabled autocompleting for your urlbar
b. that urlbar started autocompleting - may require some history and bookmark to get long enough time to reproduce the bug
Actual Results:
Bookmarklet wa executed but there wasn't called window.open() function a I would expect. Therefore no new window/tab wa opened (with http://www.google.com).

Note: to test that bookmarklet wa really executed you can use alert() function that is not affected by this bug.

Expected Results:
According this javascript code
"javascript:s="%s";window.open("http://www.google.com");void(0);"
I would expect firefox to open new tab at http://www.google.com.

Explanation: javascript:s="%s";window.open("http://www.google.com");void(0);
- s="%s" -> doe absolutely nothing. The reason for this, is possibility to type something behind keyword - "go somethingLongToGetUrlbarBusy"
- window.open() -> affected function, that should open new tab at www.google.com
- void(0); -> this is not crucial, but it prevents actual webpage from disappearing or reloading (in this example it is http://www.bbc.co.uk/

Other info: This bug is also in Firefox 3.0.10 and I expect this in all firefox version where is this new autocomplete function.
