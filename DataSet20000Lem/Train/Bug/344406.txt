This bug applies to Bon Echo.

If you surf to a page that trigger a blocked popup (like http://www.cnn.com) a notification appears across the top of the browser content area. The "Options" button within the notification doesn't respond to any selector (as far a I can tell, having tried several) other than a CSS rule in button.css that selects all button everywhere.

This button ha neither a DOM element id nor element class, contributing to the problem.

To make this button selectable, add an DOM element id or class such a ".messageOptionsButton".

current DOM structure

notification
hbox.notification-inner .outset
hbox
image.messageImage
description.messageText
...
spacer
button

toolbarbutton.messageCloseButton

proposed DOM structure

notification
hbox.notification-inner .outset
hbox
image.messageImage
description.messageText
...
spacer
button.messageOptionsButton
...
toolbarbutton.messageCloseButton
browser
...

My particular goal is to change the button border color to darker for higher contrast. So far everything I've tried ha failed EXCEPT setting it within button.css with the following rule:

button {
border-color: red !important;
border: 1px solid red !important;
}


which of course is bad because it selects all button everywhere, when I only want to select this one.

These selector don't work:

.notification-inner button {
border-color: red !important;
border: 1px solid red !important;
}

description.messageText + spacer + button {
color: red !important;
border: 1px solid red !important;
}

I can select the text that's next to it with this rule:

description.messageText {
color: red !important;
border: 1px solid red !important;
}


Reproducible: Always
