When downloading multiple file (say, in the range of 10-20 or more, usually simultaneously, with the majority of them being started before all the prior file have completed) at a settings, Firefox will suddenly fail during downloads, claiming insufficient right to modify content of the download target folder.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start a lot of file downloads, all to the same directory.
2.Keep starting more file downloads, all to the previously specified directory.
3.Keep starting even more file downloads, all to the previously specified directory.
Actual Results:
At some point, the downloads will begin to fail, claiming insufficient right to change the content of the directory.

Expected Results:
Saved the bloody files.

The problem with the report Firefox give about not having access right are:

1) The directory is one to which I have full access.

2) The directory is the same one to which prior downloads (in the same session) have been successfully saved.

3) The first file to report this error is in fact partially saved to this directory.

Additionally, this problem appears in Flock 2 (which is based on FF3) but doe ***not*** appear in FF2 nor Flock 1 (which is based on FF2).
