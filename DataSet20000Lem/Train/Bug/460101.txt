For the Comcast TV Planner website, if you enter any lowercase character with descender (g, y, etc.), the descender part is cut off in the "Find a Show" search text input field. This only started with Firefox version 3. In all previous version of Firefox, this text size / text cut off problem did not exist. So far, this is the only website where I have seen this.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to URL: http://tvplanner.comcast.net/#initView=grid,1224098704328 (this is my zip code for TV shows, but problem will work with any zip code for TV listings).
2. Enter lowercase text, with descenders, such a "y" or "g" etc. -- into the "Find a Show:" search box near the top of the page.

Actual Results:
You will see that all lowercase character with descender have the descender cut off in this input field.

Expected Results:
The entire text character, with descender or not, should appear and be readable in the text input field (not cut off). This only started occurring in Firefox 3 -- wa not a problem in previous Firefox versions.
