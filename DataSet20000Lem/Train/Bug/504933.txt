I found that after installing 'Silverlight' on my Firefox browser that my PC would lockup for sometimes a long a five minutes. I wa using Silverlight to stream audio from a radio station I enjoy. My cursor would move but mouse click did nothing and ctrl/alt/delete wouldn't even bring up the Windows Task Manager for an extended amount of time. Then, it seemed that Silverlight would finally release operation back to me. It took me quite some time to find the 'culprit' because I wa disabling various add ons to find which one wa 'guilty'. So, if YOU are experiencing a symptom similar to mine, try disabling 'Silverlight' first and see if Firefox close quickly without forcing you to wait.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to www.kfog.com
2.click to listen will launch a streaming player
3.Player recommends 'Silverlight' but computer will lockup when using that add on.
Actual Results:
PC will lockup for an extended amount of time. Finally the computer is released to standard operation.

Expected Results:
Naturally when closing Firefox I expect to have standard operation immediately.

After disabling add ons one at a time and still having the problem each time it took quite awhile to find that Silverlight wa the cause.
Silverlight doe NOT affect internet Explorer...naturally....
