CPU usage spike by firefox.exe make streaming video unwatchable, delay web page scrolling

Steps to reproduce:

This problem started happening in Firefox 18, continues in Firefox 19. There are two related problem involving CPU usage spikes.

1. Streaming video have become unwatchable: the video stall then suddenly catch up while the audio continues to play without problem. This is independent of which web site I'm watching the video from.

2. While attempting to scroll up and down web pages, the page stall and then suddenly scroll an unpredictable distance. This happens no matter whether I'm using my mouse's scroll wheel or the web page's scroll bar.

I'm running a quad-core CPU, 64-bit Windows 7, 8 GB RAM, 4 GB video RAM, on a high capacity broadband connection.


Actual results:

Usage in the CPU core (1 of 4) running Firefox spike to near 100% and total CPU usage by firefox.exe spike to ~25% when the video stalls, then drop below 10% and the video resumes. This is NOT a buffering problem. The same video run without problem in Google Chrome.

The same thing happens when page scrolling hang up. Once usage drop below 10%, the page scroll again.

Once this start happening--it's intermittent--it keep happening repeatedly. CPU usage will spike for ~5 seconds, then drop, then spike again, then drop again. The only solution is to shut down Firefox and restart it. This only work for a while, then the problem recurs.


Expected results:

Streaming video should play smoothly, web page scrolling should be smooth and continuous. This is unacceptable performance and may force me to make Chrome my default browser after year of using Firefox a my default.
