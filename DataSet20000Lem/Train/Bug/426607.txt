Firefox/Win mouse coordinate are incorrectly handled in IFRAME

Here is what I have in my page:

A DIV element which take the entire page (left=0, top=0, width=100% and height=100%)
This DIV also contains the Flash outputted by the attached Flex project
The z-index of this element is 10
The Flash ha wmode=transparent


Another DIV, which ha the left=0, top=90px, width=100% and height=100%
This DIV contains an IFRAME (which load a web page e.g. http://www.google.com)
The z-index of this element is 5


The problem with this setup is that on WIN Firefox 2/3 the mouse coordinate sent from Firefox to Flash are not the right ones. Normally, the mouse coordinate Flash expects are relative to the top-left corner of the browser view port. But when the mouse get over the IFRAME (even if the Flash take up the entire page so you are still hovering the Flash component, not the IFRAME), the Firefox sends back to the Flash the mouse coordinate relative to the top-left corner of the IFRAME and not of the browser view-port.



The result is that when expanding the color picker in the attached example, when hovering the color from the first row (you are still hovering the Flash, and not the IFRAME) the highlighted color is the one just under your mouse pointer). But when going downwards a you start hovering the IFRAME, the X coordinate of the mouse is correct while the Y coordinate is reported a being 90px upper (90px is the same a the top property of the IFRAME). Also, the right click is displayed upper in the page when clicked over the IFRAME:
