Build Identifier: It's back in 3.6 with a vengeance, after being fixed from at least 2.0.0.11 through at least 3.0.17. After a 1MB bookmarks.html file ha been imported, activating the Bookmarks menu the first time in every session produce the spinning beachball of death and 100% CPU utilization for some number of minutes. (Subsequent time in the same session do not do this.) Also, while the menu appears immediately, the favicons do not appear until it is done. Again, it only affect the Bookmarks menu, not the Bookmarks Sidebar. Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.4; en-US; rv:1.9.2) Gecko/20100115 Firefox/3.6
