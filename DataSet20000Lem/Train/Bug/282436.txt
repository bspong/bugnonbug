Firefox doesn't render page after unistall and re-installing
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0

I had Firefox 0.9.2 before. I recently tried to upgrade to version 1.0. While
doing so I just downloaded and installed it over the previous version. This
created 3 shortcut on my desktop (which is a known bug in the database). I
then uninstalled firefox using Windows "add or remove programs" interface.
While uninstalling I got a msg like "All component are not found, do you want
to delete C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox" directory. I said "yes" and
uninstall wa completed. Then I installed Firefox 1.0. Installation went
smoothly. When I tried to start the browser, the window will be opened but it
will not render any pages. Some of the page I tried are "google.com"
and "yahoo.com". The status bar say "done" but the page is not shown. There
are no connectivity/network problem a I am able to access these page at the
same time using IE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install Firefox 1.0
2. Uninstall using Windows "Add or remove programs". During this
delete "C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox" directory.
3. Re-install Firfox 1.0. Choose standard installation
4. Start the browser and access "www.google.com"

Actual Results:
The page is not rendered. The window stay blank and status bar say "Done".
Also tried with "yahoo.com"

Expected Results:
It should have shown the page.
