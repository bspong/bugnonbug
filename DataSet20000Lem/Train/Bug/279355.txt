I use an automatic proxy URL to get my proxy settings. The .pac file is
protected by an .htaccess. So when I start my firefox, the first thing that
happens is, that it ask for my master password in order to get the login and
password information for the .htaccess and to retrieve the proxy information.

At the point of time the master password request pop up, my firefox us >170MB
of REALMEM. By now nothing could have been loaded. No window is open, the proxy
setting are not loaded and I removed all my extension a long time before.

When I turn of the proxy URL and turn it to direct connect, so no master
password popup come up, the REALMEM (not VMEM) usage is about 30 MB.

This is reproducable every time I switch between the proxy settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Activate master password
2. Enter proxy URL, which must be protected by an HTACCESS
3. Restart firefox

Actual Results:
memory consumption >170MB

Expected Results:
not consume more the 40MB of memory
