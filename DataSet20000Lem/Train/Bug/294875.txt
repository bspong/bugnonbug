Tested on remote XUL application.
Each time an instance of the new application window is opened, a certain amount of
memory is allocated, however, it is not released when the window is closed.
If you keep opening and closing new windows, you can watch the memory
allocated to 'firefox-bin' keep growing and growing.
If you disable all cache, the amount of used memory is bigger.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new xul application window
2. Close opened window
3. Check memory allocated to the firefox process before and after


Actual Results:
Memory kept growing, but never releasing each time I closed opened application
window.


Expected Results:
Memory allocated to the new window should have released each time it wa closed.
