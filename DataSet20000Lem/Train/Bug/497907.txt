You won't be able to see the problem because it's in a staff area, but I think I can explain it.

on our website, we run a bulletin board called vBulletin. It's a PHP/MySQL Based bulletin board, and FireFox wa the preferred browser until lately. There ha been le and le compatibility with every update of FireFox, and now, we can't operate our staff chat function with FireFox. There are applet tab on the side of each chat entry, and those tab allow u to sticky a chat in place, if we need to, and they worked great until about 2 update ago. There are many other choice in the applet tabs, but that is one example.

What happens is, it quickly flip up a screen that we need to enter a chat statement, which is not right... If you have a person that can be trusted in an administrative capacity, I'll give them access to the site staff area and they can see what I'm talking about...
