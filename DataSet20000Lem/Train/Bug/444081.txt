Can't uninstall Firefox version 3 using Control Panel/Add & Remove Programs

Have tried this a lot, even after restarting window XP, can't uninstall Firefox 3.0 using remove button. Had a sneaky look in uninstall folder in C:/Program Files/Mozilla Firefox/Uninstall and there's no Uninstall program, but a helper file.

I upgraded from version 2 thinking that this version would be quicker, but quickly discovered that it didn't work with a lot of the website that I use regularly. I wanted to uninstall it and have decided to go back to IE7, which also ha some bugs, but seems to work better for me, or try to reinstall version 2 of Firefox.

Help me remove this Firefox version 3 from my pc.
