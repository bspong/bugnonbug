I have a local HTML page which I use a my home page for Fox.

If I add a single home page to the tab list, that first Home page will not have a location [it remains blank]. Subsequent tab added have the same defect.

However, if I manually select an earlier tab, or if I delete one of the tabs, the URL show up on all the tabs.

This occurs if I delete all pages, too, and bring on the first tab a my home page, adding additional tab thereafter.

For a brief, split second, it appears a if the the [or some] URL is painted into the Location bar, but then is overwritten a blank.

This behavior doe not occur with non-local URLs.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. at some point, back in time, set home page to a local HTML page
1. Open a new tab [which is defaulting to my local HTML home page]. The location bar is blank to that appended tab
2. Open additional tabs, which default to the local home page. These, too, have blank in the location bar
3. Move to any tab, other than the one displayed, or delete one, and the location bar show the proper URL for the local home page
Actual Results:
A blank in the URL/location bar

Expected Results:
A non blank, with the URL showing such a this:
file:///C:/.../.../_local_home.htm
