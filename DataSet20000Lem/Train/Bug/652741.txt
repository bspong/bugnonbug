Firefox no longer work with the Ritz LifePics uploader. It fails to recognizer Java is installed and updated.

Firefox 4.0 doesn't recognize that I have an updated version of Java when I attempt to upload image to my LifePics albums. It keep asking me to to download and install Java, which is already there. One of the Tech Support folk for Ritz spent a good deal of time with me today and finally gave up. I had to access their site and upload with Safari (which work just dandy). I prefer to use Firefox so this is a pain.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. register with and then sign on to a personal account at ritzpix.com
2. click "add photos"
3. you'll see the problem

Actual Results:
• Instead of the upload window appearing, you see a big gray window with a sign in the middle saying "Click to download plugin:"
• When you "click" you get a pop up window that say "No suitable plugins were found."

Expected Results:
When I use Safari and click on "add photos" I immediately see the upload window, no problem. This ha always worked with previous version of Firefox a well. Not this one.

I'd love to send you some screen shots, but it don't see any way of doing it.
