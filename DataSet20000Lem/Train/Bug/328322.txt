Please add a new option in Tools->Options...->Advanced->Tabbed Browsing->"Open link from other application in":

o a new tab in a dedicated window

When I click on link in emails, I want each of them to open in a new tab in the same, dedicated window, ie there is *one* specific window in which, when I click on a link in an email, a new tab is opened for that link. The current option are insufficient: I don't want a new window for each new link; I don't want a new tab in a "random" window; I don't want to lose any of my existing open pages.

Clearly, if the dedicated window doe not already exist it should be created.

This behaviour is very similar to that for IE (with the addition of making use of the tab functionality in Firefox). Given the current set of options, this functionality should be absolutely trivial to implement and arguably should probably be the default option for new installations.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Eg. click on a link in an email.
2.
3.
