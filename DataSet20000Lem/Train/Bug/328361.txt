Intel SpeedStep confuses Firefox (and Tb) timer

I have a new Dell Precision M70 laptop with Intel SpeedStep technology. When the processor is throttled (running below max speed) some internal timer in Firefox slows down. This is apparent in two symptoms:
- Cursor caret blink very slowly (in the address bar, google bar, or any web page forms)
- The extension install delay take approximately 15 second (i.e. 3 time the 5 second countdown)

The same problem is seen in Thunderbird

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Run Firefox or Thunderbird
2.Change processor speed by increasing processor usage (i.e. run a mathematical simulation) or through some third-party tool such a SpeedSwitchXP
3.Confirm that the processor speed is changing through the use of the window performance monitor
4.Watch Fx and Tb get confused.

Actual Results:
When the performance monitor show that the processor is throttled the cursor caret blink slowly and the extension timer is long.

When the performance monitor show that the processor is not throttled (i.e. full speed) Fx and Tb timing is normal.


I have only seen this happen in the Precision M70. I had an older Dell Latitude D610 which also ha SpeedStep but did not experience this problem (I think, I no longer have the laptop to confirm).


Workaround for the cursor display (which can be very annoying a the cursor will dissapear for long period of time) is to use the following config setting:
ui.caretBlinkTime = 45

No workaround for the extension timer, other than turning the timer off (i.e. by using the "Disable XPI Install Delay" extension)
