i looked for an existing bug, and nothing wa quite like this. i experience it
very frequently and do not know a way to even work around it.

it happens on a fresh profile with no extensions.

most of the time, however, i use a profile with configuration mania and tab mix.
i also use a proxy and the connection is very slow. fwiw. if the connection
is faster it seems to happen less, but i don't know how important that is. i
use kde.

if i have tab a b c, and navigate page using pgup pgdn spc, and navigate tab
using ctrl-pgup ctrl-pgdn ctrl-w ctrl-r, quite frequently a PARTICULAR focused
tab will lose keyboard focus. e.g. pgup pgdn do not work.

sometimes that focus go to the url bar. sometimes it go to the tab to the
left of the tab that is showing. i.e. if tab b is showing, and i press pgdn,
then ctrl-pgup, ff will show tab a and the content of tab a will have scrolled
down.

it is persistent. if i go to tab a, it will work. if i go to tab c, it will
work. but tab b never works. this is true whether it is in url bar mode or
left tab mode. either way the scrolled thing is whatever wa the scrolled thing
the previous time. and if it is focus-set-to-jupiter mode (i.e. nowhere
obvious) then that is persistent also.

it doe not seem to depend on the web page.

it might depend on thing taking a long time to load. it might be a problem
with the assumption that ff make when it doe multithreading. or maybe not.
it might have to do with what combination of key is pressed, but there is no
obvious repeatability so far. it is very frequent.

pressing f6 between once and 3 time sometimes restores keyboard focus, but
usually no number of press of f6 fix it. usually the only way to fix it is
to use the mouse.

i consider this to be an accessibility problem. not everybody can use the mouse
a frequently a ff want user to. therefore i consider it to be major.

i apologize for not being able to locate the problem more narrowly or fix the code.
but i wanted the bug to be notated so there is a common place to talk about it.

note that there are similar bugs, but they refer to other windows, not tabs.

thanks.
