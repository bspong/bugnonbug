The window is not refreshing the view and don't react to any action
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:5.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/5.0.1
Build ID: 20110707182747

Steps to reproduce:

I upgraded Firefox to version 5.
I'm using two window with multiple tab in them on regular basis. This bug happens 5 to 20 time a day and I have to restart the browser. I don't have any specific of how this behavior can be replicated.


Actual results:

The content of the Firefox window is being frozen. Clicking on the Firefox tab or on link inside the page, or simply scrolling the page is doing nothing. But if I switch to another program (with command+tab for example) and then return to Firefox, the view is being refreshed and display the result of an action I made before switching the windows. But it continue to act this way on. Sometimes just leaving Firefox open for some time will resolve the issue by itself. But in most case I have to close and reopen the program. It happens 5 to 20 time a day, depending on the usage.
When it happens I don't see any significant load on the system, nor Firefox take any additional CPU usage.


Expected results:

It should display the page correctly and switch tab when one is clicked.
