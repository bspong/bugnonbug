Java script fail to load web page when using ES Proxy server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; ru; rv:1.8.1b2) Gecko/20060821 Firefox/2.0b2

I am using ES Proxy server for Internet access.
Some Java script load respective web page into the browser. There are such script that fail to load page using ES Proxy server. When a certain Java script try to load a specific page, the browser window get clear and then the loading stops. Some page can be loaded hereafter by pressing Enter or F5 key but other page require data from the correspondent Java script and can't be loaded.
When accessing Internet directly (without proxy), all these Java script load the page without problem. These script also load the page successfully when using MS Internet Explorer with ES Proxy Server and when using Firefox with AnalogX Proxy server.
The problem appears when using Firefox with ES Proxy server. I think, Gecko/20060821 need to be corrected.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the file http://ln.com.ua/~vendor/progs/ESPSRV.EXE;
2. Install ES Proxy server running the command line "ESPSRV.EXE INSTALL" (when needed, detailed instruction in Russian are available at http://www.esproxy.org.ua/);
3. Run ES Proxy server using Windows Services manager;
4. Configure Firefox to use ES Proxy server (its port is 3128 by default);
5. Load the following page to the Firefox browser: http://software.canon-europe.com/Printers/Laser_Beam_Printers/LaserShot_LBP1120524.asp
6. Select a certain operating system and language in the correspondent combo box (my example: Operating system: Windows; Language: Russian);
7. Activate "Submit" button (status bar shows: "javascript:filterSoftware();").
Actual Results:
The page get clear, then the loading stops, and the page remains clear.

Expected Results:
The page ha to get clear and then to show the list of driver for Windows OS and with Russian user interface.

This problem also appears when using Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; ru-RU; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060706 K-Meleon/1.0 with ES Proxy server, therefore I think that it is caused by Gecko engine.
