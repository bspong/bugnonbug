When going to add a new bookmark, I click on the arrow which show the expanded, dropdown menu for bookmark folders, and it will not show no matter how many time I click the dropdown arrow. In addition, the arrow (usually pointing down) point up. It is at first pointing down a usual, but the first time I click it to get the expanded menu, it turn upside down and I cannot get any type of response. I have hundred of bookmarks, perhaps a thousand, so it could be because I have so many bookmarks. It wa not reproduced on my friend's computer (he doe not have that many bookmarks). I have Windows XP running the latest version of Firefox. It happens every time I attempt to add a new bookmark to a folder not in the top five menu in the last few days.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click bookmark
2.click "bookmark this page"
3.Click dropdown arrow on the bookmark window that pop up

Actual Results:
Arrow will turn upside down and expanded menu will not show up. It will do nothing.

Expected Results:
Same exact outcome, not being able to add a bookmark to anything except the most recent folders.

The arrow should remain pointing down. The expanded menu should come up, allowing me to choose a less-popular folder to add the bookmark to my bookmark collection.
