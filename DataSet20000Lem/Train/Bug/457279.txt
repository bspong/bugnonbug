Pressing ctrl-L usually move the cursor to the awesome bar and allows all the neat feature it includes. However, when using full-screen mode, ctrl-L open up a different dialog.
This dialog doe search through the history/bookmarks a the awesome bar but show the result differently, without the site title and highlighting of the searched terms.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. When not in full-screen mode, press ctrl-L
2. Enter some search terms.
3. When in full-screen, press ctrl-L
4. Enter some search terms.
Actual Results:
In the regular mode, the bar showed the result nicely with site title and highlighting.
In the full-screen mode, the combo-box showed only the urls, without title or highlighting.

Expected Results:
The full screen mode should open a bar similar to the one when not full screened.
Possibly, one that is docked to the top of the screen instead of a dialog, resembling the standard awesome bar.
