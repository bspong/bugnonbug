Firefox 3.6 doe not reload the most recently opened tab when it is
reopened after it crashes. Neither version 3.6 nor 3.61 properly recall
the most recently opened browser tabs, when it is reopened following a
browser crash. Instead it recall tab that were open several iteration
from an earlier history of open tabs. Most earlier version of Firefox
were very effective and accurate at reopening the last set of browser
tab that were open prior to the browser crash.
