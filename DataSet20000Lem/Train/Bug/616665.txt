Firefox lock and freeze and then need to be force shut down to work again when multiple tab are opened Other major issue is that Firefox quits often when go into print web page mode a well-again often varying and different web pages. Seems to happen when have more than say 6 tab open at a time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.link from email to web page to multi tab
2.especially more than 6 tab
3.freezes and cant move between tab and becomes slow to load tab
Actual Results:
Had to force quit Firefox When reopen to restore session always get this is embarrassing page

Expected Results:
Firefox restarted but then often refroze unless I shut down a few pages. This happens on any web page so I cant pinpoint any particular website that are main culprit I have reopened these website again individually and are fine and also in other browser and are fine

I am getting sick of Firefox crashing and freezing and not sure if my version is bugged or a it doe have add ons these are corrupt and maybe should go back to "clean" version I always update the add ons when info is asked to update and are approved add ons only
