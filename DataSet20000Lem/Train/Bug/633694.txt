Normally u can drap and drop a file from Windows Explorer onto the Firefox Bookmarks menu. However the sensitivity is too great. When Firefox is in the background, the menu open when an active drag even momentarily cross the word Bookmarks. What's more is that the menu doe not close when the drag is kept away, other window are brought forward, or the drag is released on another window. The Firefox window itself ha to be brought up and clicked on to make the Bookmarks menu close. This is a huge problem when the menu obscures the point where u want to drop the dragged file.
