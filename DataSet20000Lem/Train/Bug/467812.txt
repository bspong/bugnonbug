When I am moving back and forth from one program to another, Firefox seems to take up to 2 minute doing something either the program main cache or distributing memory before I can actually use the program. Before 3 update ago, it didn't do this, but since this new generation, it doe it all the time. In comparison, Safari doesn't do this and can be used in a matter of second not minutes. Have you changed how the program us memory or cache itself before operation?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Have a couple of program open. I have Indesign and Adobe Reader
2. Switch from program to program and try to do anything.
3. One of the website I wa on wa istockphotos.com and doing search for image
Actual Results:
Slow performance and usability. Must wait minute until browser is ready for use.

Expected Results:
Switching from program to Firefox, although I realize shouldn't be instantaneous, but should be ready to go at least in 10 to 20 seconds. Safari is faster.
