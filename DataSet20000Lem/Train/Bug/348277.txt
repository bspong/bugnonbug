When you click the first "See this store's listing of blowout items" link in the Comp USA page (http://www.compusa.com/locations/store.asp?type=&state=pr) the browser crash all together and output to the terminal the following error:

/usr/local/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 131: 5913 Segmentation fault "$prog" ${1+"$@"}

Note: If you copy the link from the hyper link to the clipboard and paste it on the address bar it will take you to the page without crashing. It ONLY crash when you CLICK on the link from the website I provided.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://www.compusa.com/locations/store.asp?type=&state=pr
2. Click on the first link that read "See this store's listing of blowout items"
3. Viola! It crashed!

Actual Results:
/usr/local/firefox/run-mozilla.sh: line 131: 5913 Segmentation fault "$prog" ${1+"$@"}

Expected Results:
Gone to the link directly, which it doe if you copy the link to address bar manually.

Just a couple of point that you might need:

1. I'm running Firefox from the /usr/local directory
2. I have Firefox 1.5 and Swiftfox installed a well
3. I'm running Kubuntu 6.06
