Any Firefox extension that add a <menupopup> child element to Firefox's context menu cause the context menu to appear horizontally with up and down arrow that need to be hovered over in order to scroll. This is very undesirable and the normal vertical menu is much preferable. Part of the reason is that the scrolling need to be judged exactly and if an arrow is hovered over for an instant too long the menu will scroll to the wrong page. The other reason is aesthetic - the horizontal context menu look and feel awful.
