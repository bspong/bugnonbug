Mouse focus get lost if a dialog open (such a a cookie acceptance) prompt -- essentially the second half (the release) of a mouse click on the scrollbar get lost if another focus event occurs, leaving the mouse focus on the scrollbar thumb in the same mode a if the left-mouse button wa down, but after it is released.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on "ask me every time" regarding cooky & clear cookie cache
2. Browse to a long (ie; with scroll bar) page with several links, in which one of the link go to a page that will incur several cookie-request event
3. Click on a link to open the cookie-laden page in a new tab, and continue scrolling (be sure that the mouse-button is down and the scroll-bar is engaged).
4. When the cookie is requested by the newly-opened page, click (press and release) the mouse button on Accept (or Deny, it doesn't matter); the cookie dialog will close.
5. At this point, though the mouse button is released, the scroll bar state is such that it think the button is still down (the up-button event wa missed), so any mouse motion will cause the screen to scroll. Click-and-release again will then reset the state.
Actual Results:
Crazy scrolling after clicking on a cookie dialog.

Expected Results:
I expected the scroll bar to be in "released" state; essentially, I expected the
button release (that probably actually got sent to the cookie dialog) to be propagated to the scroll bar too, so that when the cookie popup closed, that the scroll-bar apparent state would match the button actual state (ie; released)
