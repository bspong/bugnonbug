Hello. The site in question us both Java and Javascript. It should produce a live scrolling waterfall showing active signal on each band and allow selecting frequency to listen to. It work fine using Firefox on Windows Vista and Linux Ubuntu and SUSE, it also work fine using Safari on OSX. But Firefox doe not display the graphic or the sound at all on OSX. There are zillion of entry in the Tools -> Error Console, many, but not all, related to a Javascript function called soundapplet.isActive, but they scroll by so fast it's hard to read the others. I am running Firefox 3.6.10 on OS X 10.5.8. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to any of the site listed at http://www.websdr.org
2. scroll down to the black bar showing frequency
3. you should see a waterfall above each bar and be able to select frequency to hear.
Actual Results:
All I see are the black bars, no waterfall and no way to select the sound to hear. Or to see it in action properly, just go to any of the page using Vista or Linux and it will work fine, it just doesn't work on OS X. Note it also work fine using Safari on OS X.

Expected Results:
you should see a waterfall above each bar and be able to select frequency to hear.
