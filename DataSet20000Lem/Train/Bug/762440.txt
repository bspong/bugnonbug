Tab bar hang when waking from standby

Steps to reproduce:

This happens when my (windows XP) machine wake from standby. This happens when waking from standby on both my laptops. It doe not happen every time (probably about 50%). It ha happened at least 50 time now, although I still can't work out exactly what trigger it. I usually have around 3 or 4 tab open when it happens.

It doe not happen on older version of firefox, although I cannot say when exactly it first started happening. It definitely doe not happen on firefox 3.6. I do not remember it happening on firefox 11.


Actual results:

The tab bar becomes completely unresponsive. Clicking on tab doe nothing, but they do highlight when the mouse hovers over them.

Pressing Ctrl+T will open a new tab but the tab bar won't update or display that it exists. Pressing Ctrl+tab will cycle through the tab a expected but the tab bar doesn't show which tab is active.

The keyboard can no longer be used to scroll page - pressing up/down or pageup/pagedown stop working.

Pressing Ctrl+W will close the tab, but the tab bar will continue to display a blank tab (no text, no favicon, no X to close) where it was.

This happens even in safe mode. Closing and reopening firefox fix it.

If I leave it, after a few minute it will 'jump' back to normal, suddenly displaying the new tab I've opened and the currently active tab will change to the tab that wa furthest right when the tab bar hanged. Pages then respond to pageup/pagedown a normal.


Expected results:

The tab bar should respond to clicking, and show new tabs.
