Sorry for the visible pixel - an image of the bugged cursor

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

Using arch linux and openbox a window manager;

Open the 'Customize Firefox' page - click the 'Open Menu' button and then '[+] Customize'

Click and drag any icon from the right side of the screen - the menu - to the left side of the screen, the 'Additional Tools and Features' section.



Actual results:

The mouse cursor becomes a squashed double image. The lower third of the icon grabbed, and the icon's label, appear persistently underneath the double image.

Everything follows the mouse, and the double image change with any cursor change - for example, when moving the mouse over a text box, the double image becomes two squashed text cursors. When moving back to a non-text area, the double image once again becomes two squashed mouse cursors.

The top left image is the 'real' cursor, everything else is simply displayed and not functional.

The computer/session must be restarted to fix this.


Expected results:

None of the 'actual results'. The mouse cursor should have remained unchanged - not squashed and not duplicated. There should also not be part of an icon and it label stuck under the mouse cursor.
