This report ha close relation to bug #347230, however I wasn't able to find solution reading the bug history. The problem is manifested when a file type is not recognized
(f.ex. a .doc file with Content-Type: application/octet-stream ), and only minimal dialog
is presented, where "save file" and "cancel" are the only two option (there's no grayed "open with" button).

I'd expect the dialog where there would be non-grayed "open with" option, so file with certain extension (not mime types) could be associated or at least opened with user-defined application. If this bug wa discussed and fixed before, please point me to the solution, a I myself cannot find it. Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=232436&action=view
2. see minimal save dialog


Expected Results:
expected full dialog with three options, "open with", "save", and "cancel"

tried with all add-on disabled
