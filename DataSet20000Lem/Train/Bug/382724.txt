Since upgrading from '.03' to '.04' today, I can no longer display my homepage or the "Click to Donnate" page correctly, which make navigation difficult. You have to look for the link you want in the text in order to go to the page(s) desired. The only page which seem to display correctly on this site (that I've used, anyway) are the mail pages.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the upgrade from Firefox 2.00.03 to Firefox 2.00.04
2. Load homepage (www.care2.com)
3. Check display for mail notification or link to email, "click to donate"
Actual Results:
Display is not correct. Links appear according to browser color, but not in correct positions, intermixed with HTML language, spaces, etc. There are no frame or columns, no major tabs, etc. Display is many screen long.

Expected Results:
Framed display with easy to read notifications, tab and link should display within 2 screen "pages."
