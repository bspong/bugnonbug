Sometimes Firefox will choke on a page at NYTimes.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.9.1

From time to time (1 in 3, maybe 1 in 5) Firefox will choke will loading a
page from one of the area section at NYT.com (like International, or
Business, etc.). When it doe this the page that choke will stop downloading
any more asset (images, icons, more page elements, etc.) and just kind of
halt all load progress. The page that had the problem and all other open
window can still be scrolled, but any attempt to navigate beyond them or do
anything further will cause them to freeze and die.

The issue requires a direct termination of the entire program to recover, so
it affect the entire browser regardless of how it localized or incited.

I think it ha something to do with the advertisement shown on NYT.com, but
I'm not really sure. It seems to happen at the point in loading when ad
would normally load (pop-up windows, Java windows, etc.).

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable ad blocker (just in case it the cause
2. Go to nyt.com
3. Cruise around some of the area page
3. Allow them to fully load

Actual Results:
See detail section. Page froze, browser became inoperative.

Expected Results:
Generated an error or loaded the page properly.

Internet Explorer handle the page just fine, though at time when it loading
certain ad on nyt.com IE doe seem to freeze or hiccup briefly a it work
the material through.

Unlike Firefox it doesn't die though.
