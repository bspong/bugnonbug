Steps to reproduce:

I wanted to bookmark multiple tabs, and so first used the keyboard shortcut for it (control + shift + D) and a new bookmarking interface menu popped up. I named the folder for the bookmarks, and went to select the place I wanted it to be saved.


Actual results:

In the drop-down menu where I could select the place I wanted the bookmark to be saved, there were only icons, with no sort of description of any type on them. I clicked the one that looked like the bookmark menu button, and then went down and clicked the "Add Bookmarks" button. When I checked the menu to tweak some of the bookmarks, I noticed that the folder I named wasn't there. I checked the bookmark toolbar, menu, and the unsorted bookmarks, but it wasn't in those place either.


Expected results:

Normally, before today, I could bookmark multiple tab easily. The standard bookmark interface for multiple tab would pop up, and I'd enter the folder name and select the location. After hitting "Add Bookmarks," it would have saved. All good.
