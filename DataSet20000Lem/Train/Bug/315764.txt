Browser read CSS file but fails to follow font color instruction eg
table {
font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
font-size: 0.90em;
font-weight: bold;
color: darkgreen;
}
color portion of the above instruction are ignored.

In fact other font color instruction ignored a well.

Font color instruction unlike other font related instruction dont have prefix font eg: font-size, but just color, which is by default relates to fonts. May be this is a reason.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create CSS (stylesheet) file with the content described
2. Create HTML document with the link to CSS stylesheet and a table with some text in it
3.

Actual Results:
Table font remain black. It's not good for the site with black background

Expected Results:
Table font should be automatically changed to darkgreen

I have tried different instruction for the font color using hexadecimal and RGB, same result. It is not only table font are affected, but all other CSS element which contain color instruction eg body, link etc say in the following CSS instruction color: brown will be ignored and the link by default remains blue
A:link {
text-decoration: none;
color: brown;
}
