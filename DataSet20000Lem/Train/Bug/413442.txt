It would be nice if the link to the main page in live bookmark were moved to the top of the r list instead of the bottom. scrolling over a large list of r title is a lot more inconvenient than mousing over the site link to get to the first feed update. I think seeing the update and having access to the site link at the top are more important than having the newest feed item at the top.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a live bookmark from an r feed on the bookmark toolbar.
2.Try to use the live bookmark to go to the main page.
3.Scroll through a potentially long list of RSS item before reaching the link.
Actual Results:
I have to do a lot of scrolling to load the r main page.

Expected Results:
Being able to more quickly get to the r main page by either moving the link to the main page from the bottom of the feed item or make it so I can double click the live bookmark to use it a a regular bookmark.
