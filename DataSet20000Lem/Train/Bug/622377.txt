Firefox's tracking cooky cannot be detected by security software unless it is closed.

Running security scan repeatedly do not detect tracking cooky in Firefox. This happened with Spyware Doctor with AntiVirus and now with Norton Internet Security,despite knowing they're their in the cooly folder. When Firefox is completely closed Norton detects them normally and remove them. But if Firefox remains open, no detection at all. This doe not happen with IE8 - tracking cooky are detected whether it's open or closed. The same thing happened when I wa troubleshooting this issue originally with Spyware Doctor. Reinstalling the software doe nothing. The problem clearly is with Firefox. This mean that Firefox cannot be used at all during a full scan and this is very inconvenient.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Browse internet normally, creating normal tracking cookies.
2.Run a security scan with Norton Internet Security or Spyware Doctor with AntiVirus but leave Firefox open (as you might often do during a lengthy full scan).
3.Close Firefox without doing any more browsing and run another scan.
Actual Results:
With Firefox remaining open, Norton won't detect any tracking cooky and report there are no threats. Opening the Firefox cooky folder,however,proves the tracking cooky are still their. (I'm not referring to the first party cooky - I know the difference). This will happen repeatedly until you close Firefox, then Norton will detect the tracking cooky every time. But again, this is inconvenient to have to close Firefox and not be able to use it during a full scan. The problem is specifically the lack of detection of the tracking cookies, otherwise Firefox can be used normally even during the scans, but unless you're aware of this problem you might think their are no tracking cooky tracking you at all because the scan come up supposedly clean.

Note: Norton inexplicably will detect the cooky on one or two initial scan after installation, but subsequent scan exhibit the problem, and then it happens every single time.

Expected Results:
The security software should be allowed to routinely detect tracking cooky in Firefox whether it is open or closed, just like Internet Explorer. Causing top security software to give a false result in scan is a potentially serious issue, and even though I certainly know that tracking cooky are generally harmless, they still are tracking and many people consider that a privacy issue. Even case manager at Norton didn't have a clue about this.
