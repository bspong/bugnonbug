After launching the web version of MSN, ie web msn, firefox creates a single framed window with no adress bar, button etc.

Tabs can be created inside of this window, normally by pressing a link inside of the webmsn application window.

When tab are created and subsequently closed, memory is not released, and in turn firefox begin to chew memory without releasing it.

I have recreated this effect numerous times, with the last result, the firefox application grew to 200mb of memory use, having only the web msn window running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch web msn (http://webmessenger.msn.com/)
2.Launch tab inside of the msn window. Normally by pressing the email button or any existing link on the page
3. Close down the additional tab and leave only web msn.
4. Memory is not released and is bloated far beyond the need of just the web msn application.
Actual Results:
Memory is not released.

Expected Results:
Memeory leak

Release the memory after the tab have been closed.
