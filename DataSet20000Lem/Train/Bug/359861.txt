Firefox doe not open a window sometimes when I tell it to run. And freeze on random pages.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

For the first part, sometimes when I doubleclick on firefox to tell it to run, it will show me the thinking mouse, then go back to the normal mouse, without opening a browser window. If I try to click it again, it still won't open a window. However, when I go into my task manager, it will show that firefox is running, and show the other window a running too. If I tell the program to stop, and try running firefox again, it usually works. I've reinstalled Firefox a few times, and it still doe this from time to time. It never did this on the older version.


The second problem is that randomly firefox will freeze and crash. There is no specific website it will do this on, it appears to be on website that take a little long to load though. When it crashes, it asks if I want to send an error report to Microsoft, so I do. And Microsoft tell me to get the latest version, which I have. I've reinstalled firefox a couple of times, and it still doe this. It never did It on the old version.
