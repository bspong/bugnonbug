Javascript execution cause Visual "flash" under certain circumstance

On the example page, when you give focus (click) on the "Date:" field, the upper-left most portion of the brown bar at the top flash white for a moment right before the date picker box is animated. The flashed area is larger the second time the box gain focus. (See also the Additional Information section)

We do NOT see the flash on Win32 Firefox *pre-3.6*, Firefox 3.6 for Mac, IE 7, IE8, Chrome, or Safari.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.bio.purdue.edu/bug/datepick_fails.php
2. Click on the date field (a small visual flash occurs)
3. Click white space
4. Click on the date field (a large visual flash occurs)



jquery library version 1.4.1 (http://jquery.com/)

This behavior is only seen when the range of the date available in the JQuery Date Picker is set to show a certain date range. Specifically a starting year of 1990 or earlier AND an end date of the current year or higher. For example, this link will work normally: http://www.bio.purdue.edu/bug/datepick_works.php But set your system clock to 2009 and it will flash the screen.
