Steps to reproduce:

Problem recurs occasionally, but I do not yet have minimum set of reproducing steps.

(Rather than a script, it would be better if you tell me now to produce a corefile for you the next time this happens.)


Actual results:

Tab bar freeze or hang a well a the URL bar. The entire window becomes unusable, but the visible page seems operational. It's just that only one tab work and the others are unreachable. It is not possible to switch tab using group view either. Although it is possible to go to the group view and select another tab, it show only the old tab bar and the one page that works. Other window from the same FF session are not affected and work fine.

See the attache screenshot. It show the tab bar from an affected window. See several unreachable new tab on the right, which is just one more symptom of the same problem.

This is a long standing problem, but ha been happening more frequently of late. I believe it is the same a bug 344416 that never got fixed, but I don't know how to reopen a closed bug.


Expected results:

The affected window ha some rendering bug that need to be located and fixed.
