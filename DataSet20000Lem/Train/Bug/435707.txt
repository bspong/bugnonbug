I open a new window and press a button to write a text string to it using Javascript. The text string contains link and target anchor which should allow me to jump around in the child window. However, when I try one of the links, the child window content are replaced with those of the parent. If I wa trying to go to target named X in the child window and the parent window happens to have an anchor named X, the link will take me to X in the parent window. If the parent window doesn't have a target named X (i.e. it doesn't have a target with a name that match the href attribute in the child window's link), the link take me to the top of the parent window.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the sample code below. The link in the first window work fine; pressing the button open a child window which ha link that should behave the same (enabling you to move around in the child window) but the link don't work properly; they load the child window with the content of the parent.
<html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
function linksInNewWindow()
{
var aStr = "<html>\
<head>\
</head>\
<body>\
<h2 id=\"top2\">Second Window</h2>\
<a href=\"#bottom2\">Go to bottom of -this- window</a>\
<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>\
<a name=\"bottom2\" href=\"#top2\">Back to top of Second Window</a>\
</body>\
</html>";

aWindow = window.open('', 'win', 'width=600,height=100,menubar=1,resizable=1,scrollbars=1');
aWindow.document.write( aStr );
aWindow.document.close();
aWindow.focus();
}
</script>
</head>

<body>
<h2 id="top">First Window</h2>
<a href="#bottom">Go to bottom</a>
<br/>
<input type="button" value="Try similar link in new window" onClick="linksInNewWindow()" />
<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>.<br/>
<a name = "bottom" href="#top">Back to Top</a>
</body>
</html>

Actual Results:
Described above.

Expected Results:
The link in the child should move you around in the child window; the behaviour is a expected in Internet Explorer.

I put together the sample code to demonstrate the problem I found in my real project, which is to dynamically create a Table of Contents for the result of a database search. In my real project, I've checked the DOM and the ToC link href value match the anchor target name but Firefox just won't match the value when the link are activated. I've spent at least two full day trying every combination of call and parameter and searching for a solution on the web but I couldn't find anything.

I consider the bug major because it is preventing me from implementing a large number of feature and there's no workaround that I can find.
