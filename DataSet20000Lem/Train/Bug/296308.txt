This is so for a long time and it is the same on a friend pc. I suspect it is
due to something in window XP tablet editon, but I'm not sure. It is no problem
at all on non-WinXP operating systems.

The problem is: when I shut down firefox, it remains in the memory. And it take
lot of space there. It is also boring when trying to shut down normally. You
can see in the URL (which is a picture) what the exact problem is. Note that
firefox is not running at the moment of the print screen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open window XP (tablet edition?)
2. Start mozilla firefox, open some page, shut it down. Repeat this step enough
times.
3. After closing all windows, use task manager to see how many of them are still
in the memory.

Actual Results:
Well... http://www.magic4you.nu/forum2/untitled.JPG a I posted for a url. That
is the problem.

Expected Results:
Ha, going out of my memory of course ;) like all my other program do.

I'm using a completely standard version of firefox, latest release, everything
normal a it came with the installation.
