After adding a bookmark to a folder, any attempt to select a different folder from the 'recent folders' list for subsequent addition just cause it to select the original folder from the first one added. I have to go into the full folder list and select the one I want there, bypassing the recent folder list completely. This ha happened in both beta version (2 and 3) of FF3 I have tried.

It's worth noting that I can "reset" the list and be able to pick any one in it, by closing and restarting the browser. Of course I can only pick one folder from the list, and the problem resurfaces until the next time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add a bookmark to a folder under recent folder list.
2. Try adding another bookmark to some different page, to a different folder under the recent folder list.
3. Profit!!
Actual Results:
See detail

Expected Results:
Expected result would be that I can pick any folder I choose from the recent folder list, after any number of bookmark added already.
