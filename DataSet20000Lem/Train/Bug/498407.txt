When I right click a search field and select "add a keyword for this search" doesn't work a expected on many site (dictionary.com, pcworld.com, bing.com)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://dictionary.reference.com/ (or http://www.pcworld.com/ or http://www.bing.com/) - those are the site I tested.
2. Right-click the search field at the top and select "Add a Keyword for this Search..."
Actual Results:
Opens a titlebar that say "New Bookmark" You have to resize the bar to reveal the whole "New Bookmark" window, which ha many fields: Name, Location, Feed location, Site location, Folder, Tags, Keyword, Description, and a "Load this bookmark in the sidebar" checkbox.
The "Folder" field doesn't let me select any of my folders. I added a name and keyword, then clicked save; but the keyword didn't work when I tried to type it into the Awesome bar. I couldn't find my keyword bookmark in the organize bookmark window either.

Expected Results:
I work correctly on http://www.google.com/ (opens a "New Bookmark" dialog box with 3 fields: Name, Folder, and Keyword; let me select one of my folders, the keyword works).

Adding a search keyword for all the site I tested work fine in Firefox 3.0.11, so this must be a bug in Firefox 3.5.
These are the addons I have installed: Gmail Notifier, Google Reader Watcher, and Personas for Firefox v. 1.2.
