I thought it wa just because I wa scrolling through my Yahoo! e-mail that Firefox constantly crash about 10 time a day, but that is not true. I can be away from my computer for a while and come back and get a notice that Firefox stopped working. Today, I wa doing an e-mail when it crashed, and I lost some of my data, so I had to type some of it over. Even when it crashes, it ha problem submitting the crash report most of the time. I wish you would fix this software. I am an online, university student, and I cannot have Firefox crashing during a timed test. It take several minute for Firefox to restore the session. This is valuable time lost during a timed test. Another thing, there are a couple of website that teach you to get rich, and they have voice pitch and music to them; and eventhough I close those windows, they are brought back up in the "restore previous session" mode, and they play at the same time. I look for the window that they should be in, and many times, I cannot find the window to close them again, so I do not have to hear their pitch and music every time I restore the previous session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I start scrolling through my Yahoo! e-mail, and Firefox crash immediately.
2. Even when I am away from my computer, Firefox crash 10 time a day.
3. Pulls up music and pitch during "restore previous session" on window I have previously closed.
Actual Results:
Firefox crash 10 time a day!! Firefox surely crash when I am scrolling through my Yahoo! e-mail. It crash even when I am away from my computer. The crash report doe not submit the report about 98% of the time. I always have to listen to the same salesman pitch and music every time I restore my previous session. Most of the time, I cannot find how to turn them off.

Expected Results:
The same a I wrote down in "Actual Results".

I cannot use my Internet Exlorer 8 either, so I am forced to use Mozilla Firefox. Data Execution Prevention will not let me use Internet Explorer. Since I am enrolled in an online university, I am desperate for Firefox to work without crashing!!! Please fix the problem right away!!! Thank you very much!!!
