When using VMware vSphere 4 Web Client and Firefox 3.5.6 If Chinese is added to the list of language in Options, all the page in vSphere Web Client display in Chinese even if English is set a the default language. This happens only with Firefox and only when viewing vSphere Web Client. Everything else (Opera, Chrome, IE) work fine with vSphere 4.

As soon a Chinese (or other double byte languages) are removed from the list and the browser is restarted, normal behavior resumes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Connect to a VMware vSphere 4 Web Client session.
2.Click Tools>Options>Languages>Choose and select Chinese [zh] from the dropdown.
3.Click Add. It appears at the bottom of the list.
4.Click OK. Click OK again.
5. Refresh the page. Your page is now in Chinese.


Actual Results:
If you remove Chinese from the list and refresh the page some of the Chinese is gone and some stay until the browser is shut down and restarted. I spoke with VMware support at length this morning and they say it is a browser issue not a vSphere issue a the browser handle the language presentation not vSphere which is English only.

Expected Results:
With English a the default language and the website in English only the display should be in English.

We are, a a workaround, removing all double byte language from Firefox and only adding one in a needed for QA testing but this is slowing thing down for our QA department a we have system all over the world and each of our release and bug fix must be tested in all language that we support. We can work with it a IE work OK in handling language, but we prefer to use Firefox.
