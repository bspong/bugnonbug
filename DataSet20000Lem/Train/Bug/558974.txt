When editing with the html editor, editor in browser stall and freezes. opening shared content within the program and saving edited window fails.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open editing box to select a shared content or online web building feature at WT.
2.select desired function, like opening a shared content.
3.Wait forever.
Actual Results:
Editor freeze and doesn't carry on with the editing. It ha to resend and say so-repeat after it repeat into freeze, and then resend info over and then over again, never getting any where. I usually end up using Internet Explorer to do the work. FF use to work with website tonight until this update 3.6.3.

Expected Results:
HTML editor to function flawlessly, instead of fighting it.

I opened a ticket with godaddy, but their normal response is clear the cooky and cache. I've uninstalled FF, and reinstalled, same deal. Ran in safe mode, same deal.
