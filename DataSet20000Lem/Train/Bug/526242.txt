Toolbar absent after "restart Firefox"

When I restart Firefox (not close and reopen, but the "Restart Firefox" button after changing an add-on), button in custom toolbars (added by extensions) are absent, although the toolbar itself appears (empty). Manually closing and opening Firefox (instead of a restart or after) cause thing to work a expected again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Googlebar Lite or some other extension that add a toolbar to Firefox.
2. Add, remove, or disable some other add-on, click "Restart Firefox" when prompted. (Note that if you quit and restart manually after changing the add-on, you don't get this problem.)
3. New toolbar is present after restart, but missing all buttons.
4. Quit Firefox and reopen it normally and all is back to normal.
Actual Results:
New toolbar missing all button after quick restart (but not after subsequent close and reopen).

Expected Results:
Toolbar should render properly with all button after quick restart.

The extension I'm having trouble with specifically is Googlebar Lite, but I think this is a Firefox bug, not an extension bug (unless there's something specific extension writer have to do for quick restarts?).

I installed that in place of the Google Toolbar, which broke horribly when I upgraded to Firefox 3.5 (search bar doesn't appear in the toolbar at all, resetting to default setting doesn't work properly, layout doesn't change properly). Not sure any of those problem are related to this bug, though.
