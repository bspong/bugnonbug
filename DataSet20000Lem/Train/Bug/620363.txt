Firefox 3.6.13 corrupts Windows Clipboard (inverse BW)

I have Firefox 3.6.13 (and a few other versions). I use TabMix+ and currently have over 120 Tabs open.

When I do BRs it is sometimes helpful to do a PRINT-SCR. This (the Clipboard) always worked a few month ago, even with over 300 Tabs open and other Programs running too. I did get message from time to time that I did not have enough memory and to close something; upon doing so the Clipboard would be back in action.

The problem now (since the last couple of weeks?) is that with the few (over 100) Tabs I have open now if I hit the PRINT-SCR key then I get a corrupted copy in the Clipboard.

A reasonable description of the corruption is that the screen image is changed to "Black and White" (2 color a opposed to 16M) and then the image is negated (or inverse).


A handy Utility to observe this issue live is actually built into WinXP, see here: http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/learnmore/tips/nebeker1.mspx


1. Run your "ClipBook Viewer" C:\WINDOWS\system32\clipbrd.exe and leave at least part of the Window visible.

2. Start FF 3.6.13 (or any of the other recent versions, they all seem to have the same Bug).

3. Use TabMix+ ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122/ Note: I use the NEWEST from http://tmp.garyr.net/ ) and load up over 150 Tabs.

4. Hit the PRINT-SCR key and look at the "ClipBook Viewer" Window (clipbrd.exe). Notice that the image is corrupted. (See nothing in the Viewer? use the Menu Command [Window] and then click the checked "1").

5. Select some text and hit CTRL-C then look at the "ClipBook Viewer" Window; notice that there is enough memory for a bit of text to be copied.

6. Use a 'Graphics Image Viewer Utility' (mspaint or IrfanView are fine) and open a tiny image (an Icon would be great). Select the iamge and use the Menu to copy it; if it is tiny enough you should have enough memory to see the image instantly appear in the "ClipBook Viewer".



Blame u or blame Microsoft; we need the functionality we had a month ago or making screenshots is going to be tough when memory is low. I hope this is not caused by Firefox having memory leak or allocating memory wastefully. There ha been an enormous decrease in the number of Tabs I can open and still have thing working reasonably.


PS: Yes, I have over a 4G Swap file and also 4G of RAM. I have lot of memory available.


Thanks,
