When I launch Firefox in the latest build (since about b3), I get a spinning pinwheel, and Leopard report that the browser is not responding. This go away after 20-30 seconds. It is probably more likely to occur with multiple tab open on launch, however I do not have very many tab open, and the problem continues even after all tab have long since loaded. I get a similar hang when I first try to type a location into the location bar, although that one usually just result in extremely poor performance rather than a spinning pinwheel.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a window or two, with a few tab open.
2. Close Firefox.
3. Launch Firefox.
4. Get spinning pinwheel. Can't interact with Firefox until the pinwheel go away. Sometimes, get hang in bookmark bar.
Actual Results:
Get spinning pinwheel. Can't interact with Firefox until the pinwheel go away. Sometimes, get hang in bookmark bar.

Expected Results:
Shouldn't get browser hang or pinwheels.

This ha occurred in most recent build of b3 (perhaps all of them?) It did not occur before b3 if I remember correctly.
