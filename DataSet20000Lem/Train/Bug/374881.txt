The problem IS definitely caused by the way Google ha the cursor automatically inserted into the text box. The Google Firefox start page is default in Firefox. After starting the browser and visiting any site after, the navigation key do not work at all. Visiting Google from your bookmark ha the same result, so it doe not have to be set a the default start page to reproduce this, but it must be in the bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add www.google.com to your bookmark
2. Add www.broadbandreports.com to your bookmark
(Note: The address must be added to bookmarks; typing in location/address bar will fail to reproduce this issue)
3. Close Firefox
4. Start Firefox
5. Click on www.google.com from your bookmark
6. DO NOT type in the Google search box or click anywhere
7. Click on www.broadbandreports.com from your bookmark
8. Try Up, Down, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End key

This would also be reproducible by having Google (or Firefox start page) a your default start page. Start the browser, then simply click on Broadband Reports in the bookmark and this will also reproduce just the same. It doe not have to be Broadband Reports site either, it can be ANY site that ha the vertical scroll bar.
Actual Results:
The navigation key mentioned above do not work on any other site.

Expected Results:
The navigation key should still work. The Google text box somehow steal focus. This ha always worked perfectly with Firefox 2.0.0.1 and previous versions, but ha not worked since 2.0.0.2.

- The Google text box somehow steal focus. Typically when focus ha been taken this way, you would be able to click on the background of the web page to bring focus back and allow the navigation key to work a per normal. However, that is not the case with this. The only work-around is to click in the text box, then click on the background or by typing something into the text box.

- Another work-around in this scenario is by going to Google, then to Broadband Reports and clicking in the Username, Password or Search box at the top of their site, then clicking on the background of the site. The key will then start working again.

- This is definitely an issue caused by Google's automatic insertion of the cursor into their search text box.
