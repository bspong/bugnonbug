When I load any webpage I cannot click on any of the content until I have minimized Firefox or used ctrl+alt+tab to navigate to another open window. When I switch back to Firefox the website will be active and all link and content can be used. This happens when a website is initial loaded or reloaded.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to any website
2. Click on any link
Actual Results:
Couldn't click on any link to external content or use any feature of Firefox available through the toolbar.

Expected Results:
It seems like Firefox is not recognizing links. After logging into gmail I cannot click on the "inbox," "compose mail", or any of the navigation item in the left hand side of the page. Additionally at that time I am not able to navigate back using the back arrow or navigate home using the home button. I cannot click to type inside of search fields. This happens at all websites.
