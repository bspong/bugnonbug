Signed onto http://webmail.aol.com/ with an AOL screen name, popup dialog
including those that appear when reporting and unreporting spam cause the page
to stop responding to any left-clicking. Right-clicking still work and give
all the correct information, and the problem can be worked around by just
reloading the page.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get a (shiver) AOL screen name
2. Go to http://webmail.aol.com/ and sign on
3. Select a piece of mail and click "Reporm Spam" button
4. The dialog will appear
5. If hanged, click Reload on the browser
6. To repeat, open the Spam folder, click "This Is Not Spam" for a piece of
mail, then go back to #3

Actual Results:
In Firefox, the dialog *appears*, meaning everything is (almost) working right,
but clicking the OK button, the X button, outside the dialog, and anywhere else
in the page brings no response.

Expected Results:
In Mozilla and Internet Explorer, the dialog will respond properly to the OK
button and X button.

The bug wa found immediately after a fresh installation of Firefox 0.9.
