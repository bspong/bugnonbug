Firefox crash with FireBug and the following HTML file
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.0.4) Gecko/2008102920 Firefox/3.0.4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

I have Firefox 3.0.4 with FireBug 1.2.1 and no other plugins (I uninstalled all other plugins when trying to pinpoint the problem and generate the testcase)

When testf.htm is loaded into firefox, FireBug show the following error
"Permission denied to get property XULElement.popupOpen".
Now click "Continue (F8)" or refresh the page, and firefox crashes.

The error appears to have been raised from the dispatchEvent call
(this is also apparent when debugging the script in FireBug)

It also appears that the focus() call is critical for the crash to occur.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FireBug 1.2.1 on Firefox 3.0.4, with no other plugins
2. Save the testf.htm and test.htm file (attached)
3. Load testf.htm in FireFox (either a local file, or through your favorite web server)
4. After the 1-second delay, FireBug show the error
"Permission denied to get property XULElement.popupOpen"
5. Click "Continue" or refresh the page, or do mostly anything else - and Firefox will crash.
Actual Results:
Firefox crash

Expected Results:
One of:
1. No error in Firebug, and no crash
2. Error appears in firebug, but firefox doe not crash
