cmd-left in a contenteditable should go to the start of the line in OSX

Steps to reproduce:

Here's a test case: http://codepen.io/lerouxb/pen/DCElm

Open that URL in Firefox on OSX.

Make sure you followed the link there so that there is a previous page to go back to. Maybe browse to the detail screen from the editor so there is a previous page.

Type some text in the text input field. Hit cmd-left arrow and the cursor will move to the start of the text input field just like it should.

Now focus the contenteditable div below that text input. Hit cmd-left arrow again.


Actual results:

Firefox will browse to the previous page instead of moving the cursor to the start of the line.




Expected results:

The standard OSX behavior is documented here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343

(For Windows and Linux folks: Mac keyboard don't have HOME and END keys. You get the same behavior by hitting cmd-left or cmd-right. This is akin to mapping the HOME and END key to browse back and forward.)

The text input cursor should be moved to the start of the line. cmd-left should NOT browse to the previous page, especially not while something that's capable of receiving text input is focused.

Other browser get this right and Firefox get this right for other type of text input fields. Just not contenteditable.

My current workaround is to just suppress those key in contenteditables which mean there are no keyboard shortcut to jump around in text. This make text editing infuriating, but at least not a bad a browsing to the previous page and either losing all your work or getting a popup confirmation dialog.
