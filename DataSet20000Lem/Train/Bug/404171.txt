Recently I've compressed my Firefox history using mozStorage Explorer executing some SQL query on places.sqlite database.

The most common wa

DELETE FROM moz_places WHERE url LIKE "%somesite.com%";

After that I cannot manage my bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add some bookmark
2. Actively visit many page from the above bookmarked site
3. Clean your history by executing SQL query against places.sqlite.moz_places table

Actual Results:
"Organize bookmarks" spill many error and almost doesn't work.

ASSERT: empty URL spec
Stack Trace:
o:PU__uri(null)
1:PTV_getCellText(10,[object TreeColumn])

Expected Results:
Working bookmarks.

Deleting history entry is NOT an option 'cause Firefox deletes entry one by one thus trash your HDD.

In the case I've presented I manually deleted around 7000 history entry based on their url.

It's plain impossible to do that via history browser.
