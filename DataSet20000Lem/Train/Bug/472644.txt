ff repeatly hang while browsing http://grails.org using a nvidia dual head setup, cpu usage of Xorg is 100%.
- this happens a while now (since 2.x IIRC)
- bug is valid for x86 or x86_64 a i recently switched to 64
- bug doesnt happen on my other single screen machine (notebook #1: intrepid x86, ATI / notebook #2: macos tiger 64bit, nvidia)
- if page is tabbed in the background performance is normal
- switching to a completely loaded grail page in a tab will hang ff for about 6 second
- switching desktop to one with an open ff with the grail page will pause redraw for about 6 second
- disabling JS, flash change nothing

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use dual screen setup (nvidia in my case)
2. surf to http://grails.org
3. move the ff window for example, switch desktops, tab/untab it to foreground
Actual Results:
ff/X redraw hang for about 6 second every time.

Expected Results:
should not hang ofc.
