While using google talk through gmail in firefox 2.0, attempting to scroll upward through previous message work only a long a the scrollbar is held in place; when the mouse is released, it jump to the bottom, the most recent messages.
This did not happen in firefox 1.5.7, and a downgrade ha confirmed that the site still work a expected in ff1.5.7, thus this seems only to be a problem with 2.0
