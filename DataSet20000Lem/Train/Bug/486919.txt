On Win2KPro SP4 FireFox any version 3 and up, some page with FLASH make 1.5GHz P4 machine run worse than a 486! The mouse hardly move whiel flash loading and the entire PC is slow to respond to mouse clicks. This happens on my other machine running Win2KPro SP4 aswell. It doesn't happen in Linux and it certainly doesn't happen in Internet Explorer. I'm a big FireFox fan but I'm ready to throw it out and not consider it for Win2K installs anymore with flash being common place now on most sites.

www.orcon.net.nz while loading mouse can hardly move. This ha happened on a few adobe flash latest release on me. As soon a I switch tab to a non-flash site FireFox run like a charm again.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Win2K Pro SP4
2. Load www.orcon.net.nz
3. Wiggle mouse try and do ANYTHING with the flash page on screen laoding... CPU go through the roof.
Actual Results:
Grind teeth to the gum and switch to Internet Explorer to visit same page with same version of flash.


Loaded a fast a it doe in Internet Explorer, extremely quick, and can move the mouse and click on thing while page is loading without gridlock on the CPU and system.
