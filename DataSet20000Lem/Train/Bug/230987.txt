This one's been around at least since 0.7. On certain page in Hotmail, the
browser crashes. I can't find a pattern to this. It sometimes happens while
loading the Inbox, somtimes for the Junk Mail page, or while searching for mail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This might not happen for others.
1. Open www.hotmail.com
2. Log in
3. Browse around a bit, possibly search in you mailbox

Actual Results:
Browser crashed - segmentation fault

Expected Results:
Load the page without crashing

I ran it with --debug, and got the following report in gdb, while it wa getting
the result of a search of my mailbox. Sorry I can't give you a link, since it
only happens when I'm logged in.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
