Build Identifier: Firefox 3.0.2

After the instalation of update 3.0.2(handled automaticaly), Firefox doesn't seem to access anything on the internet. All page give a "Address Not Found" error. Check for updates, from the "help" menu, gives: "AUS: Update XML File Malformed (200)".
It wa working fine before the instalation.
I have tried to reinstall, delete personal setting when uninstaling, installing version 3.0.1 and deleting registry entries, but nothing changed. (and I have no intention to reinstall window right now)


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.No idea, since I can't undo it
2.
3.
Actual Results:
well... firefox open allright, but won't access anything on the internet

Expected Results:
access stuff on the internet

I use ZoneAlarm for a firewall. In theory it asks for permission everytime a new program try to access the internet and also when a program that ha changed (usualy by an update) try to access the internet. Well.... it doe nothing when I try to get firefox to access some wep page, a if the program is not even trying to access the internet. I also deleted previous access setting for firefox from ZoneAlarm, but still no change.
