I usually initiate a web browsing session by searching for something. Historically, I've done this by clicking on the search tool bar and searching on Google or similar.

Of course, the new FF homepage make the extra click to the toolbar unnecessary. However, I noticed that if I click on the toolbar, "Google" get selected (the text) yet the input focus is still on the search box in the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox "fresh" (3.0 beta 1), ensuring the default homepage load
2.Click on the search toolbar: instead of clearing the grey Google text, it is selected
3.Type something
Actual Results:
Text entered go in the home page search box, rather than in the toolbar search box which wa the most recently clicked-on thing (it should have input focus). Furthermore, "Google" is selected, when it typically should clear out and let you type.

Expected Results:
Text entered should go into search toolbar, and Google text should vanish rather than being selected.
