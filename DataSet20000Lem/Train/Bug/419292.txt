Resizer / Grippy / Grippie present on maximized window
The 'Restore Down/Maximize' button I refer to is the one that appears in the middle of the three icon at the top right of any Windows window, between the [_] (minimize) and the [x] (close) buttons.

1. Make sure your desktop ha no open window on it, and nothing docked to any side of your desktop.
2. New profile, start Firefox
3a. If Firefox start maximized, press the 'Restore Down/Maximize' button at the top right of the window twice.
3b. If Firefox doe not start maximized, press the 'Restore Down/Maximize' button at the top right of the window three times.
4. Firefox should now be maximized. Observe the bottom right of the firefox window.

Expected:
- No resizer grippy should be present because the window is maximized.

Actual:
- Resizer grippy present
