Didn't found a bugreport that really match this behaviour. It started.. some week ago, sorry, I don't really remember when. I first thought of a mouse problem, but today I wa going mad with Firefox.
I always open a lot of window with a lot of tab on it - and I really really miss a "re-arrange all windows" button... Because if I moved a window a bit, any new open window will open over the next in order and not at the end of that window-line. I almost never find the "right" position again, but I at least try to move that window back to where it was. But that is now more like a game: The window will snap to a random grid, commonly to a window behind, either over it or to a virtual line on the left side. Not only the next in order, sometimes more than 100 pixel to the left. I often need over 10 or more time to get the window to where I want it (I use a 1920x1600 resolution). I can even drop the window more than 200 pixel away - it will often snap back to that virtual grid. The effect is random and happened once a day, but since a few day it's getting worse and worse. It doesn't matter what content is shown, happens with complete different content shown in the window that got moved or moved over.
This behaviour is very simular to drawing program with "snap to grid" enabled.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a lot of window (>8)
2.Move one out of that "order"
3.Try to move it back
4.Repeat step 2+3 for some time, the effect is random.
Actual Results:
Window often/sometimes snap to other window left side and sometimes exactly over another one behind.

Expected Results:
Window should stay where I moved it with the mouse.

Default theme Firefox 2.0, but I have some add-on installed:
ASnumber 1.0-Beta-8
Chatzilla 0.9.75
DOM Inspector 1.8.1.3
Greasemonkey 0.6.6.20061017.0
Linkification 1.2.4
Talkback 2.0.0.3
User Agent Switcher 0.6.9
Some have updates, will try that later.
OS X 10.4.9/PPC

I found at least one blogg-entry that descripes a simular behaviour I guess:
