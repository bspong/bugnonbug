If I wana make a scroll on one webpage the middleclick occurs when over an link,
when you just wana make a scroll and a new tab open without my consens.
If middle click will have no funtion then even if you just wana make a scroll
and missclick on middleclick button you will not have to close tab that open
rapidly, and it is more easy to rightclick on an opened tab to close it instead
of middleclick.
