When Firefox installs it offer to import setting from Internet Explorer, including proxy settings. However, some proxy setting which IE support are not supported by Firefox. Specifically, IE allows entry of the form "foo*" (trailing asterisks) in the "no proxy for" list. Firefox allows asterisk only at the beginning, not at the end, of host names. (See Bug 260883.) However, it happily import the "foo*"-style entries, and then later misbehaves by trying to use the proxy server when accessing, say, <http://foo123/>.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set up Internet Explorer to use a proxy server, and specify "foo*" in the list of host to be excluded from proxy connections.
2. Install Firefox and accept it suggestion to import setting from IE.
3. Try to visit a URL which match an entry in the proxy exclusion list.
Actual Results:
4. Firefox try to access the site through the proxy.

Expected Results:
2a. Firefox should have raised a warning dialog at this point indicating that it wa unable to import some or all of the proxy setting from IE, and that the proxy setting should be checked or imported manually.
