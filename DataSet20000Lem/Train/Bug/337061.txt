I use middlemouse.contentLoadURL quite frequently during my browsing. Therefore, I have the option turned on. Ever since Firefox 1.5 every time I upgrade then start the new Firefox version this preference ha been changed to "false." None of my other preference have been mysteriously reset to default, just this one. Why is this behavior treated differently? It is a real pain to reset this option in about:config every time, and go against the smooth update concept by forcing user to reset their preference each time they upgrade.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set middlemouse.contentLoadURL to true, exit Firefox
2. Upgrade installed version of Firefox (even minor upgrades)
3. Start Firefox

Actual Results:
middlemouse.contentLoadURL ha been reset to false and clicking the middle mouse button no longer achieves the desired result.

Expected Results:
The user's preference should not be changed during an update, unless specific circumstance require a change.
