Introduction:
The new feature "full-page-zoom" introduced in FF 3 is really nice. Fx. regarding a site like http://www.rebubbled.com/ . That site won't let you play the game in fullscreen on the hotpage url ( http://games.mochiads.com/c/g/bubble-struggle-2/_publish.swf )(go to 'View Page Info' to find the url or press CTRL+I if you have 'Page Info' extension installed). If you try to do it, you get this message: http://img174.imageshack.us/img174/9386/annoyingbubs2developerfb0.png = developer don't want you to play in fullscreen without ads. Therefore it wa fantastic with the new "full-page-zoom" feature. That allows you to do it anyway, though the developer doesn't like it (just zoom in): http://img512.imageshack.us/img512/4453/adobeflashzi4.png
So... thats cool. That wa zooming a Adobe Flash object...

The Problem:
Now to shockwave. Saying you want to play this game: http://www.candystand.com/play.do?id=18290 in fullscreen. First here are how it look on default: http://img389.imageshack.us/img389/4729/defaultns2.png
Then when you have zoomed in: http://img393.imageshack.us/img393/7520/zoomedkz5.png <-- = The Macromedia Shockwave object ha not been made bigger, although the feature is called "full-page-zoom". It doe work very nice with Adobe Flash, but not with Macromedia Shockwave.
Could this please be fixed?
Hmm one could be in doubt if this wa a feature request or a bug. But a the name of the function is "full-page-zoom" I think it is a bug...
