The Bookmark manager should offer a functionality to keep bookmark in order. -
To offer tool to place them in folders, add separator etc is just finde, but
not enough (imho). Why not to let ist assist the user by auto-ordering bookmark
that relate to each other?

A functionality that would place bookmark from one site/domain to one folder
would be a starting point. That woul take a lot of work from the user to keep
his/her bookmark in order.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Hm, this is a wish. Should i have put it somewhere else?

Well, if you want to reproduce it at all, then:

1. In sequence go to a set of web page
2. add their address to the bookmark collection

Actual Results:
3. look at that collection: the bookmark won't be auto-ordered. You'll have to
do that by yourself.


Um, i tried firefox last week and removed again; if your bookmark manager doe
this service yet, then sorry for the entry here.

Expected Results:
Bookmarks manager should order the bookmark automatically in a senseful way
