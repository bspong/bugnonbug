With 200 tab open, Firefox crash due to bad OOM handling or oomkiller

In normal usage over about a week (a few hours/day, accumulating about 200 tabs), Firefox slowly grows to fill *lots* of memory. At some point, it will suddenly crash, without warning. I have the memory monitor taskbar applet running constantly in KDE, and I can see FF using all my RAM, but I still have about half of my 4 GB of swap unused. Other apps run fine.

What I think is happening is that firefox is trying to allocate RAM over the 4GB/process limit, and the kernel then kill it (either the oomkiller, or it segfaults). At any rate, there's no easy way to predict when FF is about to crash, nor is there any error message.

I'm currently using Ubuntu Feisty on x86, with 2GB physical RAM, and 4GB of swap. I'm upgrading to a 64-bit machine soon - and one of the advantage will be to allow FF to address 16GB of swap without crashing.

I have the following extension installed: Adblock+FiltersetG, Webdeveloper, ImageZoom, TabMixPlus, HTML Validator. The only plugins installed are Java, Flash, and mplayer.

I'm becoming rather too well acquainted with the session restore feature!

There are several thing going wrong here, I think.

1)*Why* doe FF need so much memory?

2)If FF is about to try to allocate RAM over the 32-bit limit, a warning or error message would be nice!

3)I use the web too much ;-) Maybe FF is trying to tell me something!

If there are any test I can do that would provide useful information to fix this, please let me know.
