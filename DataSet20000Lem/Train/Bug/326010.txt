lockPref instruction in mozilla.cfg file not functional.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.8.0.1) Gecko/20060111 Firefox/1.5.0.1

At start-up, Firefox read
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/greprefs/all.js
which contains a link to
/Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/mozilla.cfg
(ROT-13 'encrypted', and starting with //).
Firefox then read mozilla.cfg (I'm sure) and subsequently ignores every line in it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
Set up config file a instructed in (for instance)
http://ilias.ca/blog/2005/03/locking-mozilla-firefox-settings.html ,
in
http://mit.edu/~firefox/www/maintainers/autoconfig.html (steps 2, 3),
or in
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=2003856&highlight=lockpref#2003856

2. Start Firefox.



Actual Results:
Indicated preference setting are not greyed out.
Preferences are not locked a requested (such as, for instance, a preset Home page).


Expected Results:
Indicated preference should be set and locked a requested.

This bug seems identical to Mozilla bug 213310.

As Mozilla browser on OS-X are able to bypass the system firewall and connect directly to the 'net, the preference lock functionality is the only mean an administrator ha to add some security and parental content filtering to the browser.
