Bug #324164 removed the distinction between opening a link with target="_blank" and some JavaScript open call (preference browser.link.open_newwindow) and an URL opened by an external application (preference browser.link.open_external).

This change ha made a lot of people unhappy, judging from the comment in bug #324164 a well a several bug report (bug #469082, bug #477746 and their dups) for the specific case of open_newwindow=1, i.e. opening link in the same tab instead of a new tab or window.

I'm opening this bug here to give people who simply want the old behaviour back a place to vote. Those who read this and agree, please do vote!

Also there is little input from developer to the discussion on bug #324164, so it seems likely that devs aren't even listening, a bug #324164 comment #55 claims. Maybe a new bug report will get better attention than an ongoing discussion on a closed one.

As for the issue addressed by bug #324164: bug #324164 comment #36 doe propose a solution to help avoid those issue without loosing functionality. It ha been completely ignored. So before this report here get closed a WONTFIX, some discussion a to why removing the functionality is necessary should take place, or a pointer to such a discussion in some other place should be posted here.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click link in one tab
2. Run "firefox http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/"

Actual Results:
Both case treated the same, depending on open_newwindow.

Expected Results:
Cases treated differently if the user configured them to behave differently.
E.g. open internal link in new tab, external in new window.
Or open internal link in same tab, external in new tab.
