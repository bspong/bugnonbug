From time to time (meaning there doe not seem to be any factor directly causing this) the address bar doe not react to the enter key anymore and the go-button doe not react to a click. I can still type text into the address input field and autocomplete/places still work, but I cannot actually go to any new address.

When this problem occurs, it affect all tab in the current window. Opening a new window fix the problem for the new window, but not for the existing one.

This happens about once per day (with heavy Firefox use).

This problem also occurred with Firefox 2. I completely uninstalled Firefox more than once (keeping my profile directory though) and the problem persists.
