When I visit one of the two website listed above, I usually visit the Forums first. To log into the forums, it us a Java applet to log in, but there are time where these applet plainly just do not work at all. I can successfully load the game and everything, but I cannot visit the Forums, message center etc. This problem never occurred in Firefox 2, and I certainly didn't expect it to happen in Firefox 3. When I load the forum or any other part of the website and attempt to log in, about 35% of the time, I see a small red "x" and the message, "Loading Java applet failed" or "Java applet notinitied" at the bottom left of the browser. This problem doe not occurs in Internet Explorer.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.One way could be pressing Community, and then trying to log into the forum
2. Another way could be pressing Account, and then trying to read your message
3.
Actual Results:
About 35% of the time, I see a small red "x" and the message, "Loading Java applet failed" or "Java applet notinitied" at the bottom left of the browser.

Expected Results:
The applet should have loaded and then see a user name and password bar. There should be a picture of a big lock with the company owner name, and lastly, the enter button.
