It may be a choice, in which case it is probably one of the worst choice ever, but anyway I'm quite sure other people than me will one day try to report it or wonder what ha happened, so it's worth reporting it a a bug.

The default installation ha no home button in the navigation toolbar, it ha been moved (hidden ?) to the bookmark toolbar. IMO far most people use the navigation toolbar than the bookmark toolbar, so it shouldn't.

Moreover, the step to correct it are not so obvious : you need to activate the bookmark toolbar if disabled, then open View > Toolbars > Customize, then drag the home icon from the bookmark toolbar to the customize window, and finally drag the home icon from the customize window to the navigation toolbar ! (Direct drag from one toolbar to another won't work).
