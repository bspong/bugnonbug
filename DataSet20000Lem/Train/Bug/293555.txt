When trying to enter material in a Bulletin Board-style Web page, I am unable to
highlight an area of text and drag it to a new location. The same is true of
the text entry area of this form. This is a serious disadvantage for those of
u trying to transfer to Firefox from IE. We are used to this feature, and it
should be available.

I have tried it, and I could not get higlight/drag copy to work, a well. These
are standard Windows editing function that are sorely missed by those of u who
depend on using the mouse to do editing functions. I suggest and request that
these two function be added to Firefox and any other Mozilla product that do
not have them, a soon a possible.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a Firefox window and open a Web page that contains a text entry space.
2. Enter some text into the text entry space.
3. Highlight a character or character in the text entry space.
4. Attempt to use the left mouse button to drag the highlighted text to another
location in the text entry area, or to another text entry area.

Actual Results:
The I-beam cursor for text entry doe not change to a pointer when it is located
over selected text. This disables the sue of the drag function to move text.
It also disables the function of dragging to copy.

Expected Results:
The software should respond in the same way that Internet Explorer does.
