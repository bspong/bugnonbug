Removing Bookmark Toolbar is hard/unintuitive

To maximise useful window area I wanted to remove the bookmark toolbar. I knew this wa possible because I've done it before, but it took me a long time to find out how to do it. This bug is to suggest improving the context menu to make this easier.

It seems that the context menu on part of the navigation toolbar includes option to enable/disable both the navigation toolbar and the bookmark toolbar. Right-clicking on the navigation toolbar is not the intuitive thing to do when you want to remove the bookmark toolbar. Right clicking on the bookmark toolbar itself show a menu that is entirely related to bookmark and doesn't have a "remove" option.

I'd like to suggest that the option to enable/disable the bookmark toolbar is either moved from the navigation toolbar to the bookmark toolbar, or is shown on both context menus. (There is an obvious issue about how to get a toolbar back once you have removed it...)

Cheers, Phil.
