Loses newly added bookmark when closing browser.

When I add new bookmarks, they no longer appear after closing down and reopening firefox. Also, something ate up about 2/3 of my icon on my toolbar, and they are no longer listed in my bookmark folder either.


I did a search of the problem, and have disabled colorful tabs, although that wa not listed a a problem, but I did not have any of the other thing listed.
I want to go back to Firefox 2, but I see that you won't be doing any security update for that.... alas, woe is me.... Can anybody help?

Thanks!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a website
2. Drag icon to the toolbar
3. Look in Bookmarks Toolbar folder to see if the link is listed there... it is.
4. Close down Firefox.
5. Reopen Firefox.
6. None of the icons/bookmarks I've added :(


Expected Results:
My icons/bookmarks should still be present.

I had a theme, and all wa well. I changed themes, and had a problem. I changed theme again, and same problem. I changed theme back again, and still a problem.
