Firefox end up at the wrong position in the page when opening a link which contains an in-page positioning (don't know how to call these), like http:aa.bb/cc.html#inpage

This only happens:
1) The first time. When re-visiting teh exact same link, positioning is correct
2) When the page contains picture that take up a significant amount of space.

I *think* that Firefox is actually positioning at the position where it should go _without_ the pictures.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the example link I entered (http://www2.opendtect.org/rel/html/x1892.htm#LINK-SURFACE.FILE.MAN)
2. Open another link
3. Open the example link again. Now you see where the display should have been the first time.
Actual Results:
The first time, firefox doesn't end up in the right place on the page.

Expected Results:
End up in the right place the first time.

I've categorised it a 'normal' rather than 'minor', because it cause people to think that good link are bad links.
