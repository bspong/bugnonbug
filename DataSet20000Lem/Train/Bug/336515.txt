My Minefield nightly politely told me that it ha updated itself, and would like to restart, if i would just care to click the restart button.

Unfortunately, my browser window had multiple tab open, and wa minimized. It had popped up a dialog asking to confirm that I wanted to close, but didn't restore itself first.

I repeatedly clicked Restart, and then when i finally found my minimized window, i had to navigate a twisty maze of Confirm close dialogs.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install an old nightly
2. open multiple tab
3. minimize window
4. wait for the update check to run
5. click restart
Actual Results:
apparently nothing (although really firefox popped up a bunch of dialog which are hidden from me)

Expected Results:
either firefox restarts, or it restores it window before confirming the close

i'm using metacity 2.12.0 without the gnome taskbar applet. i suppose maybe that would have blinked or something, i'm not sure.
