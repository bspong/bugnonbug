Core Dump / System Freeze on SaveImageAs
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20070220 Firefox/2.0.0.2

If I right click on an pure image tab/window and select SaveImageAs, the Save As dialog opens. It sometimes take about 1 sec to fill the "default location" in the ComboBox. When I hit "Save" Button before the location is filled, Firefox crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open some application (for me it Skype, Thunderbird, an IDE) and Firefox. I think it just about giving some load to the machine.
2. Open some large images. Just the images, no surounding HTML.
For me it app. three pic about 500kb (Goolgle for large image is fine)
3. Hit the right mouse button and select SaveImageAs
4. The Save Image dialog open - for a short time without a "Save in folder" location
5. Hit the Save Button BEFORE the "Save in Folder"field is set
6. "Aborted (core dumped)"

Actual Results:
Core dumped. I could provide coredump file upon request.

Expected Results:
Saved image on disc :-)

Firefox crash and/or freeze the complete system (no mouse input, no SysEmergency, no CapsLock on/off).

The above mentioned version is my actual version.
I tested on several machine (all running Ubuntu Edgy) with different Firefox versions:
- Firefox 2.0.0.1 Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/200061208 Firefox/2.0.0.1
- Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de; rv:1.8.1.2) Gecko/20060601 Firefox/2.0.0.2 (Ubuntu-edgy)
- Latest 3er version

The system freeze wa ONLY on one machine with 2.0.0.1(1|2) Version !
Firefox crash wa on all other machines.
