When going to a page with a certificate signed by an untrusted CA, Firefox
previously would prompt you to decide what to do with the unverified certificate
it wa receiving. If you then simply accepted it forever it would be fine.
However the pop-up dialog to prompt you to "accept forever", "accept for this
session only"... etc.... never show up. Without that dialog, you are
effectively "stuck". Firefox is unresponsive to any other input, since it's
waiting for you to make a decision on the dialog that isn't there. Only way to
close it is to "End Task" through task manager.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to https://webpop.gsfc.nasa.gov
2.It should prompt you to choose what to do with the certiificate, but it doesn't
3.you're stuck, have to close firefox with Task Manager

Actual Results:
Browser becomes unresponsive.

Expected Results:
It should prompt you to choose what to do with the certificate.
