I have a problem loading page of a certain website using Firefox.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

There is a message board that I visit, www.northsidebaseball.com and I have recently started having problem loading some of the pages. Sometimes when I click to load a certain part of the page, the browser doesn't load the page and instead just show a blank page with the word "Done" at the bottom a if the page is loaded. For some of the forum on the website it doe the same thing so I can't see the topics. I found a way around this. If I click on the Forum (it doesn't load), close Firefox, start it up again, go up to 'History' on the toolbar and go down to that Forum, it will load it up. But if I reload that page, it doe the same thing and give me a blank page. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox but to no avail. The website work fine if I use Internet Explorer on my computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.northsidebaseball.com
2. On the left side of the page, I click on 'Message Board'.
3. Then I try to click on some of the forum (Baseball Discussion, Game Threads, Transactions) and the page doesn't load and just show 'Done' at the bottom.
Actual Results:
After I perform the step above, the page doesn't load.

Expected Results:
It should have loaded the forum and showed the topic in the forums.
