execCommand is not working on Minefield/3.0a8pre

I wrote following HTML and script. After starting the editing, execCommand didn't do anything.
------------------------------
<html>
<head>
<script language="JavaScript"><!--
function test(){
document.execCommand("bold", false, true);
}

function edit(){
para1.contentEditable = true;
}

-->
</script>
</head>
<body>
<p id="para1">test</p>
<a href="javascript:edit();">edit</a>
<a href="javascript:test();">exec</a>
</body>
</html>
------------------------------

I also tried various setting such as,

document.execCommand("Bold", false, true);
document.execCommand("bold", false, true);
document.execCommand('bold', false, true);
document.execCommand("CreateLink");

but no luck. I also tried below too.

[editablecontent_name].execCommand("....");

I checked error console but no error, no warning. This mean that "document.execCommand" exists and it is called but it is not working. Above code are working well on IE 6.0, by the way.

I don't know it relates or not, but I realized that "document.getSelection" also doe not work under "contentEditable" mode.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click "edit"
2. select "test"
3. click exec
Actual Results:
nothing happened.
