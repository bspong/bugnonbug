Session hang with a Java "Warning-Security" window that is not visible when trying to start Java Ap with firefox 3.0.3. Worked yesterday before new firefox update.Sometimes will lose all text in menu and prompt box but can still navigate. Menu text and prompt don't reappear until firefox is closed and restarted.

Check the Sun website and they are reporting that my Java is installed and working correctly. The only change to system in the last 24 hour were your latest update and the latest XP SP2 updates.

Have consistently had this problem when trying to run solitaire game at www.lexulous.com and the "Warning-security" pop up come up consistently when using photo album uploader at facebook. Think this may be 2 distinct problem but I can't see enough text on my screen to tell. The lexulous site seems to be a more serious crash of the browser. I can recover from the facebook java security warning.

Can't do what I want to do, or read the warning, but I can close out and recover. :)

BTW you don't suck! Love your product!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. log into facebook and go to one of my photo album
2. try to add photo
3.
Actual Results:
the java ap "coffee cup" come up and then I see a tab for the security warning and half my screen in the browser is blank.
