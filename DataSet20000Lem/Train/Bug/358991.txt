I'd been having problem connecting to my ISP and the technician who had set up our home network (my wife ha a laptop wireless connection) and wa reconfiguring the modem using the URL http://10.1.1.1/cgi-bin/webcm. In the Wireless section he entered the PSK string and having applied that the next screen requires a save and reboot of the modem. This step totally fails (frequently retried!).

Fortunately it worked perfectly using IE6!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I have tried to explain the step a above
2.
3.

Actual Results:
The Modem doe not reboot and the changed detail are not saved.
When the same page are accessed, the PSK string field is blank and the network is left unsecured.
This previously wa successful in the previous version of Firefox

Expected Results:
The Modem should have saved the information entered and rebooted given my PC Intenet access and my wife's laptop secure wireless access

Having resolved the problem via IE6, Firefox is fine for both computer and I hope we don't have to repeat the procedure in the future.
