Some page from Google search are not displayed under the special condition that the search consists of one quoted set of terms, and that no page are found having that search term

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up main Google search page.
2. Enter search term "Funky Chicken Utilities" (with quotes).
3. Search.
4. Google return page stating that they did not find any page with the specified search term _including quotes_ but that they _did_ find the following page searching _without_ quotes. They show 8 or more page of search results.

5. Click on any one of the page number in the line of page number at bottom of display.

Actual Results:
Clicking on a page number other than 1 produce the same page 1 display. Clicking on Next produce the same page 1 display. i.e. no way to produce page 2, 3 .... of results.

Expected Results:
Clicking on a page number should display that page of search results.
Clicking on Next should display the next higher page number of result .

Investigation so far: Same procedure work properly in Internet Explorer (as bundled with XP Pro), so it probably not a bug at Google . . . .

Workaround is to resubmit search a Funky Chicken Utilities (without quotes)
