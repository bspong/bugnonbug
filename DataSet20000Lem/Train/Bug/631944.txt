color schemes:

Note that the button now have a line drawn through them,
a though the text ha been struck-through.

I've seen something similar with mail.yahoo.com.

This is a fresh profile, with no other customizations.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new firefox profile.

2. Go to gmail.com and log-in.

3. Edit-Preferences-Content-Colors
Change text to light green
Change background to black
Change link to light purple
Change followed link to light maroon

4. Uncheck the "Let site choose their own colors" box.

Actual Results:
Immediately, without re-loading the page the problem with the
"strike-through" horizontal line should appear.


Expected Results:
Text color should change, button color (probably) should change, but no horizontal line should appear written through the button text.
