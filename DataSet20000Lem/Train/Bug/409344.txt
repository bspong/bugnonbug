In any outgoing mail operation where you are presented with a To: field, clicking the To: correctly brings up the first page of Yahoo Mail's address book. Sliding the mouse over the horizontal page selection text menu item (i.e. the delimiters for the alpha character on each page) the status bar show the correct javascript function call. If, for example, page 1 of the address book contains name beginning with a-ci, and page 2 contains name from cj-le, and page 3 contains name from li-pi, then rolling over the first 3 menu item yield Javascript:BktLst('1'); ... javascript:BktLst('2');.... javascript:BkLst('3');... respectively in the status bar at the bottom of the address book pop-up window. Left clicking on the item doe nothing.

This function worked correctly this morning and nothing else ha changed. I rebooted the PC and the probelm wa still ther. I then uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled it and the problem is still here. Internet Explorer work correctly.

So, mu conclusion is that somehow the pointer association of the bariable in the javascript call function is lost. Once lost, it is never recovered.
