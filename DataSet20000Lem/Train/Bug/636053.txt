Firefox should update saved session state when a window close

Firefox regularly fails trying to restore previous session for me (which is covered in another bug). Recently the following sequence occurred:

Starting with two window with multiple tabs, I closed the tab in one browser window, closed that window, closed the tab in a second browser window, closed the second browser window, then closed two other program and then shut down my computer. (Running Ubuntu 10.10.) My system wa not busy -- no program were consuming any significant amount of CPU and all the program fit in memory. I didn't measure the time between closing the last Minefield window and clicking the "shut down" button on the "really shut down" prompt but it wa several seconds.

When I restarted the computer and restarted Firefox I wa greeted with:
This is embarrassing... can't restore...
Window 1
about:blank
Window 2
about:blank

Something triggered Firefox to think it needed to restore the session. But once that happened, it restored a state that never existed -- I never had two window opened with blank tabs.

Once first window closed with only a blank tab (and Firefox wa still working), the session save/restore code should have realized there wa nothing to restore from the closed window and updated the saved state to only contain information about the one window.

Reproducible: Didn't try
