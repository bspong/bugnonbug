Memory dump of Firefox reveals sensitive information, including authentication credential
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Mozilla Firefox store sensitive data, such a usernames and passwords, in clear
text in memory. By performing a memory dump of firefox.exe, it is possible to
gather the sensitive information.

This vulnerability would be most likely exploited in the following situations:

1. An environment in which multiple people share a Windows XP computer with
"Fast User Switching" enabled.

Example:
User "A" log into Windows, and start firefox. He then log into a website.
Later, leaving Firefox running, he click on "Start", "Log Off", then "Switch User".

User "B" log into Windows, and open Task Manager. He locates the Process ID
(PID) associated with user "A" firefox.exe. By running PMDump(1), user "B" can
dump the memory of user "A" firefox.exe to a file. He can then open the file in
a text editor (such a WordPad), and would be able to locate the authentication
credential that user A used to sign into the website.

2. An environment in which multiple people connect to a PC running Terminal
Services/Remote Desktop Connection, in which Mozilla Firefox is installed. The
process of gathering the sensitive data would be the same way used in the above
Example 1; by using PMDump(1).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
The step to reproduce are described in the "Details" section of this bug report.

Actual Results:
I wa able to retrieve authentication credential from the memory dump of Firefox.

Expected Results:
The software should encode/encrypt/disguise sensitive data (such a usernames
and password used in HTTP authentication).
