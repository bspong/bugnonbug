I've been using Firefox 3 Beta 2 for over a week now, and it seems to me that the popup blocked icon in the lower right portion of the status bar is reporting blocked popups way too freqently, and often for site that do not have any popups (e.g. my personal blog or even Bugzilla). Once it show up, it doesn't go away, but for whatever site I go to, it update it option so that the current site's URL show up in the option (e.g. "Allow popups for bugzilla.mozilla.org").

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox
2. Visit several website
3. Notice the popup blocked icon appear in the status bar for a site with no popups
4. Notice that the popup blocked icon doe not appear to go away after initially showing up


Expected Results:
The popup blocked icon should only show up for site where a popup wa legitimately blocked, and should go away when the user navigates to a different page or URL where there is no popup.

I'm using a pretty vanilla install, with ChatZilla and Gmail Notifier being my only installed extensions.
