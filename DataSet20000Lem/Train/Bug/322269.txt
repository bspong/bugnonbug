HI,

first i want to say that is bad that i must wrote a problem in english, above all, it's a real german language problem.

The Problem: somtimes on many site german umlaut are not shown correctly. i hope you have installed an german character set - if not, this will be, sorry for my words, for the ass.
for example: sometimes ה צ   will be shown a an ? in a rhombus (i will be wrote (?) for this sign). but it could be, that a row ה צ  or  will be shown a (?)הההההההההההה(?) (?)צצצצצצצצצצ(?)... . if the page wrote in w3c-conform method (&auml; &ouml; &uuml; &sz...;) it shown ok. and the problem ist not "page a yes" and "page b no" today it could be so, but tomorrow?
i have this Problem on all three PC i use (At work, shop, and at home).
all charctersettings in firefox ar correct (ISO-8859-1) and will take no effect.

if you search in google for "firefox stellt umlaute falsch dar" you will find many article for it. it's not an ulf-problem

so long
