I have the "Bookmarks Toolbar" activated by default. Upon opening the browser,
the "Bookmarks Toolbar Folder" content do not appear on the "Bookmarks Toolbar"
until the "Manage Bookmarks" menu item in the "Bookmarks" menu is selected. The
bookmark do not appear a well until "Manage Bookmarks" is selected. Once the
"Manage Bookmarks" item is selected, the bookmark folder appear, but upon
clicking a bookmark within the folder, nothing happens (the URL is not loaded in
the active window).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a Bookmark Toolbar Folder, populated with link
2.Active Bookmark Toolbar (View - Toolbars - Bookmarks Toolbar)
3.Close and re-open Firebird
4.Bookmark Toolbar will be activated, but no folder appear
5.Click on Bookmarks - Manage Bookmarks
6.The folder(s) on the Bookmarks Toolbar will appear
7.Try clicking on the bookmark in the folder -- the URL is not loaded

Actual Results:
The bookmark folder appeared, but the link within them are non-functional.

Expected Results:
The bookmark toolbar folder should appear when the browser is opened (with the
Bookmarks Toolbar Folder activated), and the link within the folder should
take the user to the bookmark URL.
