Hi, I have been using firefox for a long time now, and for like 6 month now, firefox ha started being a little buggy. On Microsoft Windows 7 it work properly, very smooth and fast, but when it come to mac osx, I work on the two platform everyday and it just such a buggy browser now. When I open up the browser, it doe not take focus, it just open in the back and I never know when is open, unless I do expose or just switch application back and forth. That is the one main problem that started like 6 month ago and you guy haven't fix it yet. I figured it might have been my operating system, since I upgrade from leopard to snow leopard without doing a clean install, but it isn't because I did a clean install of snow leopard afterwards and it still had the issue. Another thing is when there is a flash element on a website, sometimes it just chokes, either for just like a second or 10 second max, and sometimes the actual flash element doesn't detect clicking from the mouse. I hope this is the right email address who I should be sending bug reports.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on the firefox icon on the mac osx dock
2. Don't do anything, just wait for it to open.
3. Once it open up, the browser doe not take focus, the browser open in the back
Actual Results:
The browser open up, but doe not take focus

Expected Results:
The browser open up, but doe not take focus

If you have more application open when you open up the browser you could notice the problem quicker.
