Clipboard intermittently not working
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0
Build ID: 20141013104125

Steps to reproduce:

Problem Symptom :
---------------------------
When Firefox (64 bit version - 36.0a1 (2014-10-13)) and Firefox (32 bit version - 32.0.3) are installed in a Windows 7 machine, the following problem are observed :

1.) Copy (Ctrl +C) some HTML page from browser and then pasting it (Ctrl + V) in Windows Word / Outlook doe not paste images.
2.) Right click doe not work.
3.) Adding security exception for some website doe not work.

I opened the same website in Internet Explorer browser, and no such problem are observed.

Workaround :
-------------------
1.) Uninstall both 64bit and 32 bit firefox completely by following instruction here.
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/uninstall-firefox-from-your-computer
Note: Firefox folder found under 'Roaming\Mozilla' folder must be deleted.

2.) Then install 64 bit version only.

Root Cause :
-----------------
1.) Seems both version share the same local application directory, '%APPDATA%\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox', thing got confused.

May be separate folder should be created for different mode (32 bit / 64 bit) of Firefox.




Actual results:

Copy, Paste of image from firefox browser is not happening.


Expected results:

Copy, paste should work normally.
