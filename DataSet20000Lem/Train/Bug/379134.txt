Using JavaScript and Ajax, following problem happens: if in a webform a button with onclick event is pressed, which cause a call to a chain of function starting with function1 (function1 make some calculation and call function2 function2 doe some action and call function3, function3 sends a xmlhttprequest, function 4 handle the request) function3 is without any reason called twice. The result is
Component returned failure code: 0x804b000f [nsIXMLHttpRequest.setRequestHeader]" nsresult: "0x804b000f
mainly due to the fact, that the second xmlhttprequest dsiturbes the communication channel. The crash may be prevented by using true instead of false when opening the request. The result of the action is by the second request anyhow destroyed.
