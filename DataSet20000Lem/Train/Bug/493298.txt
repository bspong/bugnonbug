Site us SSL cert not recognized by Firefox. I click through to add the site a a permanent exception. Makes me go through this two more time for this site. Then it brings up the page error screen with "sec_error_unknown_issuer" so I again try to add it a an exception. When I "get certificate" I get a message that say "no need to get a certificate, but Firefox still won't let me through to the site (IE6 doe without a hitch).

Actual Results:
Steps contain full details.

Expected Results:
Step #12 above should have taken me to a page where I could submit my resume (already in the Army's database) for the job.

The only way to get past step #13 is to crash Firefox by using the Task Manager and killing the firefox.exe process. When you bring Firefox back up, it will again allow you through to step #12.
