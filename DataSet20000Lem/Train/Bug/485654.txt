This is an internet-based e-mail retrieval program. Firefox doe not properly detect the type of attachments. It characterizes MS Word and Adobe pdf document a Firefox documents. Consequently, attachment do not open properly. I could not even find MS Word in the list of program to use (in Browse) to open an MS Word document. I gave up and accessed the e-mail through IE8, which worked properly.

3.Try to open the attachment.

which is a Firefox document
from http://ssomail.charter.net

When I saved the attachment, it saved a a Word document, and I wa able to open it. However, I get many e-mail with attachments, so I am being driven back to Internet Explorer.
