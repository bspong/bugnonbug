I often have firefox running with multiple tab open (20 or more). This make Firefox unstable and it frequently freezes, especially if an additional window-- for example, if I try to attach a file for a gmail message, the "browse" window to locate the file result in firefox freezing. It also happened when I opened up the download window to open a download. The opening of the download window caused firefox to freeze (again this only happens when a large number of tab are open).

I used to run multiple tabbed window in earlier version of Firefox (since the tabbed wa first released), and did not have this problem. There seems to be a bug causing Firefox to freeze because a large number of open tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open firefox with 30 tab (this also happens if you multiple tab and a new browser window (i.e., control-N and multiple tabs)
2. go to a web page where you need to perform a "browse file" to open an attachment-- for example, go to gmail, compose an email, and try to attach a file to the email
3. This should cause firefox to become unstable and freeze.
Actual Results:
firefox froze

Expected Results:
not become frozen

I run vista 64-bit
