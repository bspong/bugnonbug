Firefox 3.0, begin to use all available memory until it ha gained all available memory resources, at which point the computer freeze and must be restarted a no program will function. I have been forced to uninstall Firefox 3 and reinstall Firefox 2 in order to render this report. My system ha 1 GB or RAM and is using Windows XP pro, service pack 2 with all available update EXCEPT service pack 3, which dis "funny" thing to my system. Trying to close firefox before it freeze the system often result with the process (firefox.exe) refusing to release the memory and shut down even though the visible browser window may shut down. I apologize if this report is not specific enough. This is the first time I have ever reported a bug, mainly because it is severe enough to cause me to abandon Firefox if Firefox 2 becomes to "dated" or insecure security wise. I am willing to work on this problem, or to submit more detailed or specific report if someone will tell me what should be done. It hurt to see what I think of a the best browser on the market to actually end up preforming worst then the worst browser on the market (IMHO), MSIE.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch browser and use. the longer it is open and used, the quicker it "steals" RAM
2.
3.
Actual Results:
System (and all programs) freeze after not enough RAM is available to the OS, other programs, or (apparently) Firefox 3. I wa able to determine unusually high memory usage by the process firefox.exe every time I tried using the browser - on several occasion over half a megabyte.


The software should limit how much total memory is used, and should release unused RAM. I thought FF3 had some type of memory manager. I never had this problem with Firefox 2!!!
