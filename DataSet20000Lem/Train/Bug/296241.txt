if you use the "block popup window" feature a panel is displayed immediately
below the menu and buttons.
This affect the coordinate system of the main window where the web page is
displayed.


For example a Flash application with a map doe not show the right information
with mouse over when the block popup window is showing.
I assume the Flash plug-in doe not get the new coordinate system of the page.

Check it on this French web-site showing the result of the election (Referendum

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.mouse over an area of the Flash plug-in
2.the text doe not correspond to the area of the map
3. remove the popup block banner
4. now the floating text correspond to the area of the map

Actual Results:
you get the wrong information!
that defeat the purpose of the browser that is giving you access to information.

Expected Results:
provide the new coordinate system to the Flash plug-in?
