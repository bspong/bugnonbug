== My request ==

One of the Safe Mode startup screen checkboxes say "Reset bookmark to Firefox defaults". Please change it to instead say "Erase all bookmark except for backups".

== Why I chose the wording that I chose ==

* The word "erase" is very important. It make it clear to inexperienced user that the bookmark will be erased. This help stop them from accidentally losing them.

* The word "except for backups" are to help user who have already used the checkbox and erased their bookmarks, and now want them back. It tell them that their bookmark are not really lost. It point them towards the next step towards getting back their bookmarks.

* You don't need to spend word to say the Firefox default bookmark will be installed. Just install them without telling user you're going to. But if you insist, then feel free to make the dialog box wider, the string longer, and tell user you're going to install them.
