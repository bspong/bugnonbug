when reaching french free webmail access page, FF becomes frozen : animated advertising are frozen and I can not close FF program anymore, except through the window task manager.
The odd is that when moving the mouse or typing character on keyboard, the advert get animated again, but I never get the next page (after having typed login and password)
Note that FF is using 99% of CPU ressources on this page (Internet Explorer a well, but animation are not frozen with it)
I do not have any problem with any other internet page, and do not have this problem with IE.
Note a well that it seems that problem is linked to advert on the right of the page, since advert at the bottom of the page is first displayed and animated, until 2nd advert is displayed
