Building a CubeCart store on my PC. The store Documents do not work in Firefox.

I'm building an E-commerce web store using CubeCart. I'm also using MySQL, PHP5, Apache 2 working through WAMP5. We have not gone online yet and are still putting in products.

CubeCart ha a Documents section and I have a Contact page, Privacy page, Policy page etc. Everything is fine in IE7 but when clicking on a Document in Firefox 2 (and my older Firefox), I get "That document doesn't exist" in it's place.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just run our website.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Same


This could mean that every CubeCart in operation (over 1,000,000 by their count) ha the same problem. Their document won't show up. Remember I said it work perfectly in IE7 and not Firefox 2 or my last one, Firefox 1.5 soemthing.

Or, it mean it doe not work with my WAMP5, a program which allows my webpage to work without being online. My store address on the WAMP5 is http://localhost/index.php.

Sounds to me like it's Firefox.
