If Google is configured a "open result page in new window" and Firefox is configured to open new window in new tab and you have multiple Firefox window already open, result page are loaded in a new tab in an unexpected window.

Furthermore, the (apparently random) chosen window is not signalized on the Taskbar (e.g. by flashing it correspondent task button) and user have to poll all Firefox window to see where the new tab wa loaded in.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Assure Firefox is configured to "open new page in a new tab"
1. Open few (3) Firefox window
2. Open google in one of them (the last one)
3. Configure google to display result in new window
4. Search something in google and click on a result.
5. New tab will open in a different window than the active one. If not retry the google search in another pre-opened window and the newly created tab will not be created there.
Actual Results:
New window opened in a new tab, but not in the active window. No indication on the taskbar in which of the window the new tab opened.

Expected Results:
New window open in a tab in the active Firefox window. If not possible, at least the elected Firefox window flash on the taskbar to indicate where the new tab ended.
