With the latest upgrade of firefox each time I do anything, more often than not, I get something like URL not found (eBay.com, for instance), TRY AGAIN. After hitting the "try again" many many times, I might get the page I want. Sometimes it go right there.

This is probably related to a recent XP upgrade, a MS Interner Explorer (IE) also ha trouble, but Explorer handle it much better - it offer to fix the connection to the Internet, which usually work for a while at least.

During the past 2 or 3 days, I have been forced to retreat to the latest version of Internet Explorer, a it work and Firefox fails at almost every change of window.

While I believe the problem is caused by an XP upgrade, unfortunately, IE is far better equipped to cope than Firefox. Do you suppose that is coincidance, or conspiracy?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to ANY URL - chance are it won't go there until several retry attempts.
2. go to any other page on the website. Some page come up after a few retrys, some never come up
3.Give up and go use IE
Actual Results:
common website can't be found - TRY AGAIN (and again and again)

Expected Results:
Should go almost instantly from site to site, page to page, etc.

I would like to say this is all XP's fault, but unfortunately they can screw up and everyone else is required to work around them!

I am using an Eee notebook - a couple month old - using XP home that came installed on the computer. It appears likely that a "daily XP upgrade" from MS caused the problem, but it occurred on the same day MS upgraded me to IE 8 (an automatic upgrade). As soon a IE8 upgrade wa installed, even though I had not used it, Firefox started giving me trouble.
