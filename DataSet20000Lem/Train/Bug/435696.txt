This is fairly complex, but when playing a yahoo game (I typically play spades) and an alert window pop up, firefox lock up. It behaves very much like a semaphore ha been grabbed but not released. I do not see this problem on IE, but have not tried it on other browsers. FF also had this problem in the 2.x versions. The easiest way to reproduce this is to start a game and then get booted it. This seems to lock it up at greater than 80%. A yahoo account is required to play a game. Two id and two machine would be required for the first to boot the second after creating a table. I've wondered if the problem could be in Java a I'm sure the yahoo game use Java, but all FF window lock up. I have not tried on Linux, that would be worth trying.



Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Two user with yahoo ids. 1st start sade game so the s/he is owner of game.
2.Second come to table.
3.First boot second, must be owner of game.

Actual Results:
FF window for second lock up.

Expected Results:
Locked up FF windows, not responsive.
