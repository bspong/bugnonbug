Page Down not active in new tab opened from external link after Firefox window maximized then mininmized
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

If a maximized Firefox window is mimimized and then a new tab opened by clicking
a link in another application, Page Down seems to be dead, but I think it is
actually associated with a previously opened, now background tab.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox.
2. Make Firefox the default browser
3. Set the Tabbed Browsing option "Open link from other application in:" to "a
new tab in the most recent window.
4. Close Firefox.
5. Open Firefox to any web page. The default start page will do.
6. If Firefox is maximized, restore it.
7. Maximize Firefox window.
8. Minimize Firefox window.
9. Click link in another application (in my case the link is in an email in
the Eudora email application).

Actual Results:
Firefox window come to foreground maximized and open page corresponding to
link in email in a new tab. Page Down doesn't have any effect in the newly
opened tab.
It appears to be affecting the previously opened tab in the background.

Expected Results:
Page Down should page forward in the newly opened tab.

I am forced to report this against the 1.0 release because the recent build I've
downloaded don't run at all on my system. The most recent one I tried doesn't
even open a window when I try to run it, but that's the subject of this report.
