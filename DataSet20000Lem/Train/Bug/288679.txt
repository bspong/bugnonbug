In the past, this ha been an intermittent bug, although it is currently
occuring constantly. If I move my mouse cursor into the area of the pulldown
menu or the tab area of the Firefox window, the mouse cursor switch from the
default pointer icon to an hour glass icon for no apparent reason. As soon a I
move it back into any other location on the Firefox window or for that matter,
anywhere else on the desktop, the mouse cursor change back to the pointer icon.

I am using a Logitech mouse and Mouseware driver ver. 9.791, but the same
problem occurs with previous version of the driver a well a the standard
Windows mouse driver.

The problem doe NOT occur within Internet Explorer.

I have tried to isolate the problem, but have not been succesful at doing so.

I am using an nVidia-based video card running the latest nVidia driver and
their desktop management software.

I am also using a Logitech wireless iTouch keyboard and mouse using their latest
software and driver for both.
