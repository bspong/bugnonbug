i have been having a few problem with firefox,namely redirects.if i put any link into the addy bar or even click on a link i will be sent to a random page & have to hit the back button numerous time to get to the intended page.sometimes i have to close the window altogether.i have both spyware and anti virus running a well a anti rootkit.im dont know if this may be a issue caused by xp sp3 which i installed recently,but i can not uninstall the service pack to do so.i also get random unexplained error why firefox need to close or a random file ha failed and caused it to close.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start firefox
2.try going to a few webpage
3.within 10 minute it will happen
Actual Results:
happens constantly with regular use,just goin to any website

Expected Results:
it should send me to the correct site,however i get sent "a few page ahead" and have to click back several times.it seems a is the pop uip blocker may have something to do with it.pop ups occur withh site that do not have permission to do so.however the one that do can not.whenever the small message come up saying firefox prevented a pop up,it redirects to a random website,sometime over and over

everytime i have experienced a firefox crash or error i try to report it if possible,if the dialog box for that function appears
