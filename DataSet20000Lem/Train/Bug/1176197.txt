Navigating two tab with file:// URL hang when e10s is enabled.
STR:

1. Download https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/40949268/Bugs/e10s_navigation_hang/e10s_navigation_hang.zip and unzip to local filesystem.
2. Navigate to file:///C:/where/you/unzipped/MathGeoLib.html
3. Wait for the page to load and print out the last two line

Done. 1 test run. 1 passed, of which 0 succeeded with warnings. 0 failed.
0

4. Don't close the finished tab, but at the top of the browser tab row, click on the plus sign to open a new tab, and in the new tab, navigate again to the URL file:///C:/where/you/unzipped/MathGeoLib.html

Observed: The page will not load, but the green circle will keep spinning indefinitely. The browser is now hung, and it is not possible to navigate to any other page in other tabs, but those will also keep spinning the Connecting... animation. Closing the offending second file:// tab that never finished loading doesn't recover the browser either, but new page cannot be loaded.

Expected: The page should load normally and not hang the browser.

Noticed that opening a new non e10s window and redoing the step avoids the issue, and the page is able to load correctly, so this look like e10s related.
