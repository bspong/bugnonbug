Cannot load URL from address bar, typed or clicked via Awesomebar

The address bar stop working several time a day for me. I can type an address, but when I hit enter or click to load it, nothing happens. Same thing if I start to type a familiar address and click it in the Awesomebar drop down. I can still load page by clicking bookmarks, though. If I close and restart Firefox, the problem go away.

Here are the Add-ons I have active:

Adblock Plus
Delicious Bookmarks
Download Statusbar
FireFTP
Google Notebook
Greasemonkey

I haven't tried disabling thing to see if it corrects the problem. That is my next step. This happens several time a day, and when it does, it also will not load thing I click on in the Awesomebar.

One other note: I'm using Tiddlywiki quite frequently at work to log calls. It is a self-contained program/html file that I believe run solely on Javascript. My file ha gotten to be 1.1 MB these day - quite large for an html file, and saving wa getting very slow under Firefox 2. FF3 speed it up quite a bit, but I wonder if this is related to the problem?

I am not using any themes. I do have a few other add-on that are disabled due to incompatibility or current disuse.
