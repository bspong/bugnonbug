While viewing video file at Gamespot.com, the audio and video proceed for a little bit before cutting out. The video continues, while the audio stops. This doe not occur while viewing MOV and MPG file on other web pages, but video through Gamespot have this problem. It may be how they handle the embedding, or it may be that the file I'm trying to view are WMV file (which I think is what's going on.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on one of the link to a video file at the site I've given you the URL to. (It look like a little bit of film strip)
2. Let the video load.
3. Watch it.

Actual Results:
The video buffered and loaded (note, don't expect to see the control at the bottom of the screen, that's not how it show up on Gamespot in Firefox), and played. However, after a few second (4-7) the audio cut out entirely, while the video continues.

Expected Results:
The software should have done everything it did, except the audio should have continued playing, in sync with the video.
