text in menu and web page not rendering for firefox, thunderbird, and mozilla suite
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050922 Firefox/1.0.7 (Debian package 1.0.7-1)

I have a machine that recently stopped rendering text. Examples can be found at

http://files.horvath.com/firefox/

Note, this happens on Firefox, Thunderbird, and the Mozilla Suite, and on various version of those.

I have tried the following:

- new video driver
- differnet video card
- different monitor
- reloading XP from scratch
- memtest

The fact that it occurs on multiple software (ff,tb,moz, etc.), suggests a hardware problem, but I have tried to eliminate that and other than the motherboard and CPU, there is not much else to check. Also, I would think hardware problem would more likely cause crashes, and/or exhibit themselves in other apps. It seems consistent with the Moz family, but nothing else (Quicken, Open Office, Ecco, etc.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Reload XP
2.Download Firefox
3.Start Firefox

Actual Results:
Text doe not render (see http://files.horvath.com/firefox/)

Expected Results:
Normal operation.

This is an emachines T2692. I have been running with the onboard video chip (Intel I think) and tried a evga Nvidia card.
