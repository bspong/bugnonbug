So far a I can tell, this is related to bug 189044 and bug 84242, but isn't
quite either.

I'm ftping to bar (local machine @ work, behind a firewall that I don't control,
sorry) a foo, and it put me into /home/users/foo. I want to be in /baz. My
first thought wa to enter ftp://foo@bar/../../../baz which worked fine, but
when I clicked file qux in baz, it told me that there wa no such file a
/home/users/foo/baz/qux. I can type ftp://foo@bar/../../../baz/qux and get the
file, but every link just ignores the initial ..s.

I have a workaround in typing ftp://foo@bar//www but that wouldn't work if I
couldn't read the root dir...

I wouldn't have been all that surprised if ftp://foo@bar/../ simply didn't work,
but when it did I wa very surprised that it wouldn't give me the file listed
in the directory.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. ftp to a machine a a user with a non root home dir
2. enter ftp://foo@bar/../
3. click on any file listed

Actual Results:
I wa told that the file /home/users/foo/file didn't exist

Expected Results:
given me /home/users/foo/../file (equiv to /home/users/file)
