When you have your mousedown on a div's scrollbar and the page focus suddenly
change (due, in this case to a page anchor being specified but not being
rendered yet), it is no longer possible to use the main scrollbar to scroll over
the page.

If you use the keyboard or the mousewheel to get the original div back on
screen, you can click on the scrollbar and get it back.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the page http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/#prefbar, or any other page
that ha a scrollbarred div at the top and a long length
2. While the page is still rendering (focus ha not yet jumped to the anchor),
use the scrollbar by mouse-downing on the bar and moving it up/down (don't
release the button).


Actual Results:
The page's scrollbar wa non-functional.

Expected Results:
Released the mousedown on the div's scrollbar, or alternatively it could refuse
to change focus to an anchor after a mousedown ha occured.
