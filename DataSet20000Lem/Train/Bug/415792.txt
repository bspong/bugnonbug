Clicking on link to email in webmail app (https) periodically return blank page eventho the program work fine 98% of the time. Once a blank page is returned, paging back to the source page and clicking link to new page return blank page even for link that just worked. In addition, paging back sometimes return a blank page. View source show NORMAL html code for these pages! So, why doe firefox return blanks? Quitting doe not help. Rebooting sometimes helps. Letting the cookie expire may be important. At any rate, the next day, the system work fine. The same web mail (or other https) source work 100% with thunderbird or safari. Addons include "noscript" - but it is turned off for these pages. Again, viewsource show http code that firefox is not rendering, periodically. Please fix or advise if a known fix exists. Thanks, AL
