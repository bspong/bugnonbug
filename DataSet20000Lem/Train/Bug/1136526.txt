These are silhouetted version of the Firefox logo, which mean they're covered under trademark. As such, they need to not be part of the build unless --official-branding is enabled. If that isn't enabled, we need to use image that do not contain a version of the Firefox logo.

So those image need moved into /browser/branding/official

I suggest that we add image to the other branding option in browser/branding, using a similar silhouetted version of the relevant logo.

While we're at it, we should do an inventory to ensure there are no other such image in the tree that are similarly affected.
