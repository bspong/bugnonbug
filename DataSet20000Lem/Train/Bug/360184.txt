The accessible row and column of a table should be 0-based value that accurately reflect the row and column of a table cell. The row and column headers, if present, should also be obtainable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load the attached URL in Firefox and enable caret browsing
2. Run the attached app
3. Arrow through the table cell and pay attention to the output

Actual Results:
The row/col for each of the table cell is something like this:

Col 0: Col 1: Col 2:
Row 0: 0/1 0/2 1/0
Row 1: 1/1 1/2 2/0
Row 2: 2/1 2/2 3/0
Row 3: 3/1 3/2 4/0

In addition, the column header exists in HTML, but doesn't seem to be able to be found via the AT-SPI.

Expected Results:
The row/col for each of the table cell is something like this:

Col 0: Col 1: Col 2:
Row 0: 0/0 0/1 0/2
Row 1: 1/0 1/1 1/2
Row 2: 2/0 2/1 2/2
Row 3: 3/0 3/1 3/2

In addition, the column header should be able to be discovered.

The relevant code in the test app look like this:

index = event.source.getIndexInParent()
row = table.getRowAtIndex(index)
col = table.getColumnAtIndex(index)
rowHeader = table.getRowDescription(row)
colHeader = table.getColumnDescription(col)
print "row=%d, col=%d rowHeader='%s', colHeader='%s'" \
% (row, col, rowHeader, colHeader)
