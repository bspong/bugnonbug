Start on any website, say www.yahoo.com. Then navigate to http://sudoku.sourceforge.net/ on the same tab. To see the bug fully, navigate AGAIN to www.yahoo.com. When you click the back button on the browser or on your mouse to go back and forth from Yahoo and Sudoku site, there is a noticeable screen flash. Sometimes the whole window go black and ha a small grey rectangular area before redrawing the Yahoo page from Sudoku page. This issue doe not occur with Internet Explorer 9 and I THINK the Sudoku grid us JavaScript based on the website source code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to any website, say www.yahoo.com.
2. Next, go to http://sudoku.sourceforge.net/ in the SAME tab.
3. To see the bug fully, SAME tab, now navigate again to www.yahoo.com. (So, you have three site open in the same tab that you can go back and forth from = Yahoo --> Sudoku --> Yahoo). When you go back and forth from any site to Sudoku one, Minefield flash and sometimes the whole window go black with a small grey rectangle area.
Actual Results:
Noticeable screen flashing when going back and forth in same tab between above problem site and any other. I think the Sudoku site us JavaScript, and there are still quite a few bug with Java that have not been resolved yet for Firefox / Minefield (a BIG ONE = when scrolling Java applet they move or do not redraw content correctly, but work just fine in Internet Explorer 8 and 9 Beta).

Expected Results:
Firefox / Minefield should not flash when loading a website that is already in memory (since it wa already loaded and you are just navigating back and forth).
