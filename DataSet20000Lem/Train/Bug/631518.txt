Attempting to select submenu item under compiz after lengthy gnome-screensaver lock close a menu. Fixed by focusing another app
I've run into this bug repeatedly on two different laptops.
Both are running Ubuntu Linux 10.10 x86_64 and Firefox 4 nightly.

One wa running Hide Menubar and the other, Compact Menu 2, to achieve a similar
compactness of space a under Windows / OSX needed on laptop with limited vertical area.

I'm fairly certain I've reproduced this in my clean test profile too, though, with only NoScript installed (which offer a context menu sub menu).

At any rate, on both machines, Firefox would work fine for a while, then suddenly all sub menu would be unselectable.

That mean if I right clicked on the context menu, and attempted to access the NoScript submenu, the context menu would immediately close on attempting to mouse over into that submenu. Or, in Hide Menubar, if I clicked on the Minefield button and hovered over Help or Preferences to get those sub menus, the Minefield button menu would close. Same thing with Compact Menu.

Sub menu aren't too common in Firefox without addons which may be why I've never had any luck in finding other reported bug on this.

Anyway. Restarting Firefox fix thing for a while, but it is annoying.
