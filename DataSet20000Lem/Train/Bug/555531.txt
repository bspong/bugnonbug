On the bookmark toolbar, i have one folder named "SA-MP". In this folder i have many sites. I wanted to create in the "SA-MP" folder, a new folder, so i can put some site there, from the "SA-MP" folder. I created a new folder named "Scripts". When i put the first site in this folder, "Toolbar Bookmarks/SA-MP/Scripts" this site just disappeared and the folder "Scripts" wa Empty. I went to the Bookmarks/Organize bookmarks/Toolbar Bookmarks/SA-MP/Scripts and the site wa there, but i couldnt see it from the Toolbar, only from the Organize. When i restarted the firefox, i could see it, so it fixed.
