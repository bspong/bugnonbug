+++ This bug wa initially created a a clone of Bug #932781 +++

When bug 920978 start with "uncaught exception - NS_ERROR_FAILURE: Component returned failure code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIZipReader.open] at chrome://mochikit/content/chrome-harness.js:271" that mean we're OOM.

When the stuff we're piling onto bug 935419 say "Ran out of memory while building cycle collector graph" that pretty clearly mean we're OOM.

Yesterday, we backed out bug 936143 and bug 933882 and the rest of the stuff in https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Inbound&rev=ae6f2151610f for ASan OOM failures, though there were also non-ASan OOM failure while it wa in.

Today it relanded in https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Mozilla-Inbound&rev=9f3212effb9f, seemed sort of okayish, and we merged it to mozilla-central (though not yet on to fx-team and b2g-inbound).

We're hitting lot of both bug 920978 starting with OOM nsIZipReader.open, and bug 935419 again.

We can say yet again that it's all shu's fault, back him out, and go back to frequently hitting those two OOM failures, but maybe not so frequently that we have to notice, or we can fix the underlying fact that we're constantly on the edge of OOM even when we don't go over.

mozilla-inbound, mozilla-central and fx-team are closed.
