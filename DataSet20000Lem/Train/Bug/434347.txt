image on html-formatted web-mail (gmail) page overlap text and extends beyond top margin. This in ffox 2 and in 3 bet (and when retreived in Thunderbird)
In comparison, rendering is correct with IE, i.e.: text wrapping is properly honored.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. View gmail from a particular sender whenever image is included.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
text doe not honor image size/position and image can overrun top of page

Expected Results:
subsequent text should start below image, image should start below previous line of text.

I can send screen capture from ffox view (bad) and IE (good).
The web page owner (not me) report that the author of the html code says:
"There's no real magic here. It's a simple HTML with a couple of formatting command that Firefox may not understand.

I found firefox wa not able to handle some of the newer command when I wa coding your webpage. That's not really a Microsoft problem a they are the lead dog. If Firefox want to compete, they have to stay current with the W3 Consortium and IE. The command are not hidden and functionality is published. I'm not taking side of IE over Firefox or vice-versa, but if you are going to stay in the running you have to at least match if not beat the leader."
