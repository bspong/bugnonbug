Unclear error message when importing bookmark with bad permission

<background> I use Google Browser Sync to sync my bookmarks.. I installed a new laptop thanks to my hard drive dying.. I installed FF2, ran the GBS and downloaded my bookmarks, thne I upgraded to FF3 RC1 (which you can't install GBS onto)
Next I realised I created my user account with the wrong name, so I created a new account, then I wa stuck with FF3, and no GBS, therefore no bookmark (darn!), so I exported the bookmark from UserOld to the root of the hard drive. Firefox CORRECTLY (I think) created this with my own user permission (only readable by UserOld). so I logged in to UserNew, </background>

<bug bit>and used the import bookmark file. Firefox reported "Error processing bookmark file", which I thought wa odd, since the same copy of firefox had exported them.. The problem wa that the PERMISSIONS were wrong...



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.export bookmark file
2. Make non-readable to the current user (chmod bookmark 000 should do it)
3.try and import this file
Actual Results:
Firefox reported "error processing bookmark file"

Expected Results:
Firefox should report "could not open bookmark file", or even better asked for authentication like program such a Smultron do.
The above message implies that the file is corrupt.. Had I been le able to look around the system (thinking someone's granny), I would possibly think that bookmark export / import wa broken.

Not a show stopper I know, but anything that lower barrier to adoption is nice right??
