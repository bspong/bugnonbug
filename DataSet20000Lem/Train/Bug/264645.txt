When I play a window medium player file, the plugin doe not actually play the
file. At http://media.pc.ign.com/media/682/682732/vids_1.html?ui=gamefinder , it
just sits there, and whenever I click on play, nothing happens. At
http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/montgomery_gentry/artist.jhtml , it say that I
don't even have the plugin installed. I checked to make sure that I had the
plugin enabled. I even reinstalled the plugin from the Windows Media site and
then reinstalled WMP 10. It still doesn't work.
