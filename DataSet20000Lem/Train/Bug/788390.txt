Yahoo Profiles won't load

Steps to reproduce:

I have Yahoo Messenger (11.5.0.228-us) for which I use mainly to chat. When I'm in a chat-room, there is an option to right click on someone's name & then select the option to view profile. This option will take you to this person's yahoo profile.


Actual results:

When you do this, the person's profile will not always load. I don't think this is a Yahoo problem because I never had this problem when using the view profile option when IE wa my primary browser. I also sometimes have to repeatedly need to click the refresh button to get FireFox to attempt to send the command to attempt to retrieve the person's profile. (This issue ha occurred in older version of Yahoo Messenger & Firefox). However, I did want to point out that this is a sporadic issue - sometimes clicking on the view profile will direct you to the person's profile page in FireFox and the profile will load without issue.


Expected results:

Selecting the view profile option should open an FireFox page (or another tab) and load the person's profile or at least a yahoo profile page telling you that no profile exists.
