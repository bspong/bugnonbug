The Browser is displaying text layered over other text in the same line. it appaers only on the first visit of a site, if you press reload the browser aligns the text correct. moreover fixed table and cell width with a specific amount of pixel are ignored. the overflowing text is not displayed in the next line, instead it is floating over the cell next to it. again, it disappears after reloading and never occurs again, while you stay in the same session. the problem can be seen on nearly every site in our forum, like the overview, the postingtable, or others. revisit the page, and/or delete any cooky to reproduce the first visit.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. click on the link
2. the browser should directly show you a messed page
3. click on any topic, or other pages, to see the problem in a different location
4. press reload and the problem disappears
5. revisit the page and/or delete any cooky to reproduce your first visit and the problem
Actual Results:
The problem always happen again. Every user with the latest Firefox version is affected, no matter what system they have.

The text should be aligned normally
