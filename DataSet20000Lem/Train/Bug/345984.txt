If you browsw on a asp site that can add product in a shopping basket and you add artikle 12345 the result will be that you add it twice. The browser open 2 time http://www.lala.com/addtobasket.asp?art=12345 thus ad 2 time te same artikle. Ones this same url is used and you add another 12345 to the basket the browser correctly add only 1. But if you add 23456 the problem reocurs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Call gideon to start the server +31 6 50 65 28 49
2.surf on www.splurk.nl
3.choose B ekabeling in the menu
4.Enter Xboxx in the searchfield
5.press cursor right (you will see that te page load 2 time and thus the cursor move 2 place to the right.
6.press cursor left (again the site will be fetched 2 times)
7.press cursor right (now the cursor move only 1 place thus the site is
fetched only one time.
tip. I programmed a counter that inc's by 1 every time the site is opened in a session (your session)
8. Empty the cache and you can try it again.



Expected Results:
The software must NEVER reopen the same url twice because now i have to program
a lot of shit in my webshop because of your browser.
