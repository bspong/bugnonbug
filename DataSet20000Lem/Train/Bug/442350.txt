When I double click on a cell that contains a formula the highlight box flash twice and I am unable to access my existing formula. This only happens on frozen rows. I am forced to click on the Formulas tab, click on formula just below the tab, and then I can edit. This behaviour is only seen in Firefox 3.0. This wa functioning fine in both IE 7 and Firefox 2.0. Currently I'm using IE 7 a it's more convenient for editing Google Spreadsheets.

How to reproduce:



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create new Google spreadsheet
2. Ensure Row 1 and 2 is frozen by moving the Freeze Pane bar between Row 1 and 2
3. Enter 1 in cell A2
4. Enter 2 in cell A3
5. Enter 3 in cell A4
6. Enter =sum(A2:A4) in cell A1 (result will be 6)
7. Try to edit cell A1 by double clicking (cell highlight will flash twice)
8. Click Formula tab
9. Click on cell A1
10. Click on formula string below Google tab "A1 = sum(A3:A5)"
11. Cell A1's result content are replaced with the formula
12. Edit formula "=max(A3:A5)" (result will be 3)
Actual Results:
Results are listed in repoduction steps.

Expected Results:
Try this in both Firefox 2.0 and IE 7. The result will differ at step 7. When double clicking on the cell the result content are replaced with the formula (this is the expected result).
