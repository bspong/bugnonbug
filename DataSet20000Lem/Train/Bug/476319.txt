I wa testing out Suckerfish dropdowns from the article on AListApart (http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dropdowns). I am using the Yahoo! base markup and CSS foundation for this test. Specifically, reset-fonts-grids.css and base-min.css (or base.css).

One of the thing you (always) do for menu is to remove the margins, padding, and list styles. When I use the base.css or base-min.css, the list marker on the unordered list are not removed when I specify "list-style:none" a in the article. If I do not include the base.css it work fine.

I'm not sure what is different or strange about the base.css. It doesn't validate at W3.org, but only because it's feeding different width to to IE6. I've used my local copy and the one on yahoo's servers. Neither works.

Now, I know you're going to say this is a Yahoo! problem, but it work correctly in Opera 9 and IE6. (that's not a typo)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create and (X)HTML file with nested list
2.Add link to Yahoo! reset-font-grids.css and base-min.css
3.Add cs for Suckerfish dropdowns from AListApart
Actual Results:
List maker on unordered list are displayed

Expected Results:
List marker on unordered list should not be displayed.
