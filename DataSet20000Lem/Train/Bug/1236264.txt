please allow to disable spyware functionality
Hi.

AFAIU and a far a it's documented by Mozilla itself, Google Safebrowsing, respectively "Phishing and Maleware Proectiong" us downloaded lists, but also sends information to "Mozilla and it Partners".
Also, according to your whitepapers, the tracking protection ("Polaris initiative") is also built upon this.

It seems like a bad joke, that Mozilla advertises FF to make browsing safe and private, when it's own functionality are basically the worst spyware of all, and all that based in a country which is notoriously known for mass surveillance.
From https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work ... safebrowsing, FF may transmit the visited URLs and hashsums of downloaded file to Mozilla and it partner (does that include the NSA? ^^)

Having had an extensive look at your whitepapers, the barely existing documentation to the browser.safebrowsing option (which, a far a available and not obviously outdated, claim different incompatible things) it seems that one cannot have just the list-based protection without the send Mozilla/Google/NSA/etc. based "protection".

Even if just hash sum of file would be transmitted, than this would be a security risk a the remote side could then track which file I wa downloading, given they have access to these files.


Therefore, FF should provide a kill switch, which disables any such spyware functionality.
It's okay to have any list downloaded locally and to have FF check against these *local* lists, this doesn't allow any surveillance,... but it's not okay to send such information (including but not limited to: URIs, part of URIs, IP addresses, hash sum of any data, files, websites, etc.) remotely.


Cheers,
Chris
