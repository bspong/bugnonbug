This RFE may provide a solution to allow user to navigate forward and backwards by many page at a time without making the actual menu too large. It is in response to bug 287277, bug 282988, and bug 62010, but hopefully provides a better solution that will satisfy argument for and against those other bugs.

The situation posted by Jesse Ruderman in bug 282988 is similar to what I've run into enough time to seek out an improvement:

The overall issue being that the menu on the Back button only list the most recent 15 pages, so if I've viewed more than 15 images/comics/pages and want to go back to where I wa before, I have to go to the last item in the menu multiple time to get back to what I want.

A solution that I thought of that could help this particular part
of the problem (seems like it's one of the very common case in which the
session history would get that long at all) is to develop some sort of grouping
strategy for history entries, based on thing like closeness in time viewed,
similarity of URL, and similarity of page title. In Jesse's example and other
one I've run into (specifically today, photo shared on Facebook), all of the
image page have the same page title.

As a user, I'll often want to go back one image, go back to the first image (as
in Jesse's case), or back to the page just before the first image. If I've looked at 30 image and they all have the same page title, it's unlikely that I'll want to go back to the 18th most recent image (because I won't even remember which one that is). But wanting to go back to the oldest image or the most recent non-image both seem pretty natural.

Perhaps the menu could show the fifteen most recent item like it doe now, but
then if those 15 item are all similar enough to be grouped (by time, URL,
title, etc.), then show a separator or a '...' or something to indicate that
entry are being skipped, and then show the very first (oldest) element of the
group and the page right before that (the most recent page not in the group).
Or, if there are only 16 or 17 image in the group, just expand the normal menu
to cover those couple additional entries.

Another way to handle the group of similar page that might be even more elegant would be to place them all in a submenu, the way that bookmark folder appear in the bookmark menu. Then the back menu show a folder for all the similar page a the first element, and the most recent different page a the second element, making it easy to get to the second element (but not quite a easy to get to the oldest page of the group).

This certainly take more code than just changing the size of the menu, but may
serve everyone's purpose, allowing user to quickly get back to the page they
want to get back to, and preventing the menu from becoming unsightly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse >15 similar page
2. Click the down arrow next to the back button
Actual Results:
See only the most recent 15 page

Expected Results:
Be able to go back more than 15 result easily
