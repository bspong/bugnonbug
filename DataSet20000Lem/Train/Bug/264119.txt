Cannot cancel loading of a link across an iframe and address bar

When viewing a page with an iframe if you click and hold a link without letting
go of the link and you drag it over the iframe on the page or across the
addressbar on the browser it becomes impossible to cancel the loading of the
link, even if it is dragged back over the main frame (where the link is located)
and released, the link will load on the main frame

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click and hold on a link
2. Drag across an iframe or the addressbar
3. drag back to main frame and release

Actual Results:
The link held and moved across an iframe/addressbar will load in the main frame

Expected Results:
The link should not be loaded, just like a if it had not been dragged across
the address bar or an iframe. I expected to see the 'cancel' icon rather than
the 'load/create shortcut' icon, and for the page to not cancel

Go to https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox and click and
hold on the link at the top that say 'Netscape's feedback forms' then drag it
off the link text and when you release nothing will happen.
Now click and hold on the link again and drag it over the iframe with the list
of bug or the address bar, then bring your cursor back to the main frame (where
the link is located), while still holding the mouse button down and release off
the link text and the link will load.
