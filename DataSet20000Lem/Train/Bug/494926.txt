Merged WebHelp requires reload to view table of content

When I open a merged WebHelp project created with Adobe RoboHelp 7, the table of content is not displayed until I reload the page. In addition, the page and the table of content are not synchronized and breadcrumb are not displayed in the page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a merged WebHelp project based on the step at http://grainge.org/pages/authoring/merging_webhelp/merging_method_rh7.htm.
2. Generate the output per instruction at same location.
3. Open the index.htm page.
Actual Results:
The page open with the expected content, but breadcrumb are not shown in the page. The table of content area is blank. Pressing F5 will cause the table of content to be displayed, but all "books" will be closed. If you then navigate within the table of content to the page that is shown in the content panel, the page will reload and breadcrumb will be shown.

Expected Results:
When the index.htm page is opened, the table of content should appear in the navigation panel on the left. The relevant "book" in the table of content should be open and the page that is displayed in the content panel should be selected in the table of contents. Breadcrumbs should appear in the page.

This ha been reproduced on multiple machines. I am uncertain if the problem lie with Firefox or with RoboHelp, so I have filed a bug report with Adobe, too. I will attach a zip archive that contains generated output so that you do not have to follow the (rather extensive) step at grainge.org to create a merged WebHelp project to view the problem. The file to open is index.htm, located in the "generate" folder in the zipped directory. Please feel free to contact me if anything is unclear.
