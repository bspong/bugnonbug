Firefox became too aggressive with web page caching recently.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092510 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092510 Ubuntu/8.04 (hardy) Firefox/3.0.3

Since 3.0.2 or 3.0.3 Firefox became too aggressive when it come to caching.

1) At one place I have Firefox 3.0 (now 3.0.2) under Windows which should walk via ISA Server, which is caching proxy. Surely proxy add headache with over-caching some changeable page like forums. But before 3.0.2 it wa possible to hit ctrl+R and Firefox then fetched fresh page version overriding proxy cache. Now this no longer works, Ctrl+R not request fresh page but rather still return cached page (like F5 reload always did).So, "hard reload" seems to be partially broken.

2) At home I have Firefox 3.0.3. And there is no proxies, so I expect to see web page a is. Without headache. However while browsing some site (for example, www.maemo.org - Downloads - Fresh) I found that I'm getting outdated cached version of pages. If I will use another device to look on site I can see much more up to date page versions. So, Firefox seems to overcache chengeable page now.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Generally you should check how page caching works. Since 3.0.2 or 3.0.3 it seems to be a way too aggressive than it wa before.
2. Also check what happened to "hard reload" (Ctrl+R) shortcut that it now rather resembles "soft reload" (F5) especially through proxy.
Actual Results:
In 3.0.3 and 3.0.2 I'm being hit by overzealous caching in Firefox. It is PITA to browse stale and outdated WWW.

Expected Results:
Caching worked OK in 3.0.0 and earlier versions. I will be fine if it's behavior will be just rolled back to state a it wa in 3.0.0
