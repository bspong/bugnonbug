On Newegg.com, I set it to display internal hard disks, size 1TB and higher. On the display page (URL-for-now above), I told it to sort by lowest price, and set "View" to 100 items. The result wa a list of 45 hard disks. When I chose "Print Preview", it showed 3 page only: an intro page which wa mostly whitespace, then a single page showing 7 hard disks, then an outro page which wa mostly whitespace.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Newegg.com.
2. Choose Computer Hardware -> Hard Drives.
3. Click "Internal Hard Drives".
4. Click "1TB and higher".
5. Set the "View" popup to 100.
6. Count the number of item in the list. There are 45 a of right now.
7. File -> Print Preview.
8. Note that only 3 page are prepared, showing only 7 hard disk instead of 45.
Actual Results:
Only a part of the web page is shown in Print Preview. 7 hard disk were shown, rather than 45.

Expected Results:
I would have expected the entire web page to make it to the Print Preview, and particularly would have expected all 45 hard disk to have made it.
