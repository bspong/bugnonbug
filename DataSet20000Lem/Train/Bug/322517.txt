Corrupt Registry Disables Hyperlinks in Outlook
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

After upgrading to Firefox 1.5 all link in 3rd party apps that would otherwise open firefox now reported, "This operation ha been cancelled due to restriction in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator." Specifically link from MS Office 2003. This error is described in MSKB http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310049/en-us. However, their workaround did not resolve the problem

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get an e-mail with a hyperlink
2. Click on Hyperlink
3. Read the error message
Actual Results:
The problem is actually due to registry corruption. I assume that my registry wa corrupt before the upgrade and the move to 1.5 only exacerbated the problem.


I wa able to resolve the problem with the following steps:
1. Uninstall Firefox 1.5
2. Reset browser setting to default following MS's instruction
3. Re-install Firefox 1.5

Perhaps Firefox should include a similar "browser reset" feature to help Microsoft with their "problems". ;P
