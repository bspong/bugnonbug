I believe this started with auto upgrade.
These irritating mini box and the annoying cascading mini box feature and extra unnecessary keystroke ha to go. I want to down grade. I need to get rid of these !*@ Features. I don't ever want to see them again. I don't know what these annoyance are called. I want my program back. Can someone please help me.
These Beasts from hell come when there is a restore session. Aside from being an extremely visual nightmare they provide extra keystrokes. There is nothing I hate more than unnecessary keystrokes. How do I get rid of this BUG?
