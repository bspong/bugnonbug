Consistency bug: link mouseover work for all browser except for Firefox 5
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18 GTB7.1
Build ID: 20110614230723

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to a site created with eSite Builder (many fulfilled by AT&T and SuperPages)
ex.1 http://blueeagleroofing.onyellowpages.com
ex.2 http://bw3pg.onyellowpages.com
2. click on one of the navigation button located at top (the link show correctly)


Actual results:

Nothing, the page doe not load.


Expected results:

When clicking on the navigation button, it should load
(as it doe with previous version of FF and other popular browsers).

Notes:
- This happens only in Firefox 5.
- I've tried the page on FF3.6, FF4, IE8, IE9, Safari 5 and Chrome12, and the link work a expected.
- While troubleshooting, I restarted in safe mode with all add-on disabled and set my preference back to default. This did not correct the problem.
- After a lot of trial and error, it come down to this line at the bottom of the page that's causing problem
<a id="TGLink" style="display:none;" href="#">lnk</a>
While looking through the javascript, I found various function using TGLink. I think something in Firefox 5 is not interpreting the javascript associated with link using TG_doLink (what's used in mouseovers) the same way a other browser do.
