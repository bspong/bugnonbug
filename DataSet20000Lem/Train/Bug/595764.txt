At the link provided, the following used to work with the release just
prior to 3.6.9:

1. Upload graphic file (Clicking "Insert Picture" icon on the website)
2. Adding an emoticon (clicking the "Emoticons" icon on the website)

The behavior changed with 3.6.9 such that both the action result in a broken link icon being inserted into the user's post.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to USAToday's forum
2. Go to the URL listed above
3. Click the "Insert Picture" or "Emoticons" icon
4. select a graphic or emoticon

Actual Results:
For the "Emoticon" icon, a text description of the emoticon is now inserted instead of the action emoticon (see qo's post on the thread).

For the "Insert Picture" icon, a broken link graphic is inserted instead of the actual graphic the user ha selected from their hard drive.

Expected Results:
The behavior in the release just prior to 3.6.9 wa that both of these Pluck Forum tool worked.
