On the same machine with Windows XP (SP2) and following browser, I have noticed
the same performance :
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050915
Firefox/1.0.7

However, this webpage show up correctly once viewed with IE.Even installing new font stated in the source didnot result anything differant with Firefox.I have tried changing Character encoding to Autodetect but could not really determine which one to select. In IE I dont have to select anything other than Selecting Encoding -> Auto-Select. I think this may be introduced in the Firefox browser.
