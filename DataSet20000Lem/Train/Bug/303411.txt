I have had this problem since upgrading to Firefox 1.0.6, but only on Windows
2000. The version I have running on Windows XP is working properly. At numerous
website (www.redwingshoe.com, www.acehardware.com, www.gaiam.com, and sometimes
at www.rei.com) the graphic showing product do not load with the text part of
the webpage. Main page graphic do load; it's just the product photo that don't
show up. I did not have this problem before "upgrading" from the previous
version of Firefox and do not see it on the XP platform.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to any of the website above (except REI, which is inconsistent, but won't
properly load the left hand menu bar colors)
2.Do a search for some type of product that will give multiple hit (ex: "fans"
at www.acehardware.com)
3.Preview image do not appear with search result

Actual Results:
Search result appeared without pictures.

Expected Results:
It should have loaded the photos.
