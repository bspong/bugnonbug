Downloads window change sequence of downloads, when I visit downloaded url

I added that many step to prevent you from doing something wrong. Steps saying "wait 1 minute"
and exotic filename were added, because I wanted downloads item to display different time.
If you already understand the bug, you can skip those step and/or save image with normal names.

>>>
STR_1:
0.(not necessary) wait until 19:05 in your time zone
1. Open url [1] in the 1st tab. Open url [2] in the 2nd tab. Open url [3] in the 3rd tab.
2. Switch to 1st tab, save image with name "1 test.png"
3. Wait 1 minute
4. Switch to 2nd tab, save image with name "2 code.png"
5. Wait 1 minute
6. Switch to 3rd tab, save image with name "3 localize.png"
7. Open new tab. Restart the browser
8. Wait 1 minute
9. Open new window, open new tab, paste url [2] in urlbar, press Enter
10. Open downloads (Ctrl+J)

AR: 2nd download item is at the top of the list, 3rd download item is in the middle of the list:
2 code.png - 19:06
3 localize.png - 19:07
1 test.png - 19:05

ER: Either X or Y or Z
X) Downloads window doe remember the time! It should display downloads in chronological order:
3 localize.png - 19:07
2 code.png - 19:06
1 test.png - 19:05

Y) Okay, let's imagine that downloads window doe the right thing when it display download item in
sequence defined by "Most Recent Visit" in History (this is what downloads window currently does).
In this case, it should somehow explain to user why it display very old downloads near downloads
made yesterday (or during last week). At the very least it could display the actual time. Example:
2 code.png - Last visited 19:08
3 localize.png - Last visited 19:07
1 test.png - Last visited 19:05

Z) Any other way to fix described inconsistency, suggested by Firefox developers.
