Steps to reproduce:

Apologies if this is a duplicate. I tried searching for a similar bug but couldn't find one.

This feature request is for macOS only a the functionality already exists in the Windows and Linux platforms.

On macOS, tried to bring up the context menu from a keyboard shortcut (ex SHIFT-F10) to correct spelling on a misspelled word or to invoke the context menu on a page.


Actual results:

SHIFT-F10 nor any other keyboard shortcut brings up the context menu on macOS.


Expected results:

Firefox should provide a keyboard shortcut, either SHIFT-F10 or something else, to bring up the right-click context menu.

The Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEs provide this functionality on macOS. Hitting SHIFT-F10 (or overridden shortcut) will invoke the right-click context menu associated with either the text cursor within an editor tab or a highlighted file in the package manager.

Firefox should introduce similar functionality on macOS.

The overriding use case for this feature is spell checking from within a text area. It is woefully inefficient to reach for a mouse or trackpad to spellcheck while typing with one's hand on the keyboard. On Windows or Linux, one need simply navigate to misspelled word with arrow key and either type the apps key or SHIFT-F10 to bring up the context menu.

Other use case that are le important involve invoking the right-click context menu on a page to either navigate back and forward or to view a page's source, but keyboard-friendly alternative workflow already exist for these use cases. They do not exist for the spellchecking case.
