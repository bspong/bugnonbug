I use many tabs, usually. When I'm on a page, I look up to find the tab of the page I'm on, but it doe not stand out in 3.01. This is due to the fact that you have the tab blending in with the toolbar, rather than the page. This is confusing, doe not stand out.

In reality, tab are logically each associated to a page, and not to the toolbar. Why would you, code them to be attached to the toolbar? Please put the tab back to where it associate directly with a page, blend into it, and stand out a obviously the tab for the page being viewed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Use a few tabs.

Expected Results:
The tab for the page being viewed appears to hang down from, be a part of, the toolbar, and is completely disconnected from the page. Although it is a slightly different color than the other tabs, it is not easy to spot. This is an illogical presentation.

I expect the tab to appear to be a part of it page, so it clearly stand out.
