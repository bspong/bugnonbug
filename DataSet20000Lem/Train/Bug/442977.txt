Cookies marked a secure over https, which expire at end of session are not deleted when the browser is closed. You can reopen browser and your session is resumed.

This is an extreme security risk for people that use public machine and don't know enough to manually delete the cookie.

Firefox 2, when last tested, doe not exhibit this behavior.

Default firefox 3 install on Windows XP 32 bit. All plugins disabled.

This worked correctly in latest version of firefox 2 which I tested.

Ideally, while the web application should unset any session cooky when the user reach site, most don't, since spec say the browser should not hold on to them.

Relying on client to do this is dangerous since they can be tampered with.
