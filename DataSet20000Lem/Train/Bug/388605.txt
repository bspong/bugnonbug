I just updated from Firefox 2.0.0.4 to Firefox 2.0.0.5
I logged in a local admin on my XPSP2 box to do so
Now I've logged back in a my regular user

The first time I invoke Firefox 2.0.0.5, I get this message box:

"Firefox is not currently set a your default browser. Would you like
to make it your default browser?"


It wa set a my default browser before I upgraded, so apparently
the upgrade broke/lost that setting.


Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set web browser a default on a machine with Firefox 2.0.0.4
2. Upgrade using firefox builtin upgrade to 2.0.0.5
3. Test
Actual Results:

Expected Results:
