Want tweak to feed preference code to better support the new prefwindow
The current preference don't map well to the new UI, and patch which implement it now must go to great effort to correctly handle and save the represented preference settings. (Such patch are also likely to be broken, a I discovered attachment 228386 wa when I wa not under pressure to make a b1 deadline within the day :-\ .) The new UI (see also bug 340677) contains:

- a menulist listing all the user's web reader and client reader
- a three-option radiogroup titled "When I click on a web feed:" with the options:
- "Ask me what to use"
- "Always subscribe with a Live Bookmark"
- "Always subscribe using the Feed Reader"

This doesn't map well to the current prefs, where the option are not-present ("ask"), "bookmarks" (live bookmark), and "client" and "web" (feed reader). Representing "ask" a not-present is particularly problematic given how the preference binding work.

The patch I will post shortly make the following changes:

- add a fourth value to browser.feeds.handler, "ask"
- add a preference used to store a non-default reader choice (e.g., when "ask"
is set and the user make a for-this-time-only reader choice), with possible
value "web", "client", and "bookmarks"

The "ask" value will be exposed in UI a the inverse of a new checkbox "use this a default reader" in the subscription dialog and a "ask every time" (or not-bookmarks and not-reader) in the prefwindow. The second preference is for internal use only for communicating the selected reader between the selection dialog and the code which process the subscription request after the user accepts the dialog.
