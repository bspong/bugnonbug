Hi,

re: Mozilla Firefox v3

Emailing about What seems to be very odd to

me:

Under C:\Program Files, there have appeared

TWO entry for Firefox.

Folder #1 is called "Mozilla Firefox. It ha

"Firefox.exe" in it.

Folder #2 is called "Mozilla Firefox(2)." It

doe NOT have "Firefox.exe" in it. But it

"uninstall.log" contains these 2 file at

the top of the contents:
File: \AccessibleMarshal.dll
File: \application.ini

Is this normal? (The first "Mozilla Firefox"

"uninstall.log" doe NOT have it.)

Firefox ALWAYS report it is NOT my default

browser, even immediately after I make it

so!

Earlier in the day, I wa mis-directed to an

unrelated website.

Seems like I have a virus...

Do you want to see the files? No, I am not

looking for technical support. Just trying

to be helpful.

Please reply either way asap. I will be

deleting these and re-installing in a day or

two.

Sincerely,
John Johnson
