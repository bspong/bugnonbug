Bug: Firefox display horizontal line in my picture
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042316 Firefox/3.0.10 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

When I "web export" an image with the color "a0c73a" with Photoshop on quality setting 60 I see horizontal line when I view it in Firefox.

- I don't see them in IE, Opera, Safari
- I don't see them if I export with quality lower than 50 or higher than 80
- Tried on different computer, still see the line in FF

I could just export picture on quality 50 or 80, but this is silly, other browser render it just fine? This make it a Firefox bug, not a Photoshop bug.

optional but no difference a far a I see: don't optomize, don't convert to srgb, not progressive
Actual Results:
Image display horizontal line (very subtle, can hardly see)

Expected Results:
Shouldn't display lines, it's an image with 1 color
