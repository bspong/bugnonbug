I use firefox on multiple computers. I would like to find the same interface
(including bookmark and settings) on all of my systems, and if i change a
setting on any system, it applies to all other system also. This would be easy
to do if firefox could be told to store and use a bookmarks/settings file
located on a writable network share that all system can access.

i guess thing could get complicated if the network share became unavailable,
but this could be handled by storing a local version of bookmarks/settings and
consolidating change when the share becomes available again. if the file
becomes unavailable, and the user triest to make modification to
settings/bookmarks, it may be necessary to present a warning that say "updates
to settings/bookmarks unavailable because setting file is currently
unavailable. please ensure that network share are mounted and configuration is
set correctly." that message would need to be le cryptic for the standard
user to understand.

this option would need to be set separately from all other program option
(because the all other option should be saved in the setting file), so i
suggest that it be added a "Tools -> Configuration Location." of course there
should be a "default" option that would use the default "application data" or
".firefox" directory depending on platform.

firefox would also need to "listen" for change to the bookmarks/settings file
made by other instance of firefox so that the interface is consistent instantly
when update are made anywhere.
