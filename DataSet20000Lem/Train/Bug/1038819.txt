FF/Linux/KDE: File input field of a form doe not react after a 2nd file selection or cancel
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 2014060900

Steps to reproduce:

I run FF in it latest version 30 under Opensuse Linux KDE 4.13.2. Whenever I use form with <input type="file" ...> I experience severe problem when clicking the input element several time :

The KDE file selection dialog open the first time - I can choose a file. OK. I click once again on the input field (without any submit) - the KDE file selection dialog open again - I choose "cancel" now. Afterwards a third or fourth click on the input field doe not open the file selection dialog any more. It seems that the input field is not reacting to any event any more.

The same problem occurs when I choose a new and different file after the second click in the reopened file selection dialog.



Actual results:

After the second click and a "Cancel" or selection of a new file in KDE's reopened file selection dialog the input field doe not react to mouse click or keyboard events.


Expected results:

The file selection dialog should open again - independent of what exactly you did the 2nd/3rd,... time in the file selection dialog. As it doe in Opera, Chrome, Chromium, etc.. under exactly the same conditions.
One can reproduce this every time with a most simple HTML file containing one simple form with a filreinput field.
