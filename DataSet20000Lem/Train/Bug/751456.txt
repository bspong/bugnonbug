Steps to reproduce:

Firefox 12 won't load deviantart.com properly. Every time I go to the site for the first time, or even , a an example do a search and look through the site at the search results, many time when I click next, or on an image to look at, the site also doesn't load correct and I have to constantly keep reloading it over...

Here's a screen shot of what it's typically like;

With Craigslist I noticed starting with version 11 that the option you can click on to make a post, the circle that you click on, they use to show when you clicked them, they showed a black dot in them, now they don't show anything on version 11 & 12...

Here's a screen shot of these option to show you;

Thanks and I hope Mozilla can get this fixed for the next update, whatever is causing these problems....
