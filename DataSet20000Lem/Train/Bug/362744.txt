When i open the firefox application, everything is fine. So the first firefox window that open ha no problems. I can then open a many new firefox window a i like, and everything will work fine. I then close the window (or all the window if there were more than one) and leave firefox running in the background in the usual way. I then open a new firefox window. The toolbar icon do not appear where they ought to, they have shifted into the address bar (screenshot link provided below), and if i click on any of them, they disappear behind the address bar. I have three icon in that toolbar, home, fire ftp, and refresh. If i scroll over the location that the "home" icon ought to appear at, it suddenly appears. Ditto the "refresh". The "fire ftp" icon doe not appear, but, if i click on the empty space where it ought to be, then the ftp program doe come up fully functioning.<br><br>http://www.jonathanriley.net/fire_bug.html
