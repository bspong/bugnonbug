Firefox close down every time I try to open an article (any article) from wsj.com.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2b2) Gecko/20091108 Firefox/3.6b2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2b2) Gecko/20091108 Firefox/3.6b2 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The problem, I believe is when Firefox try to show the new type of ad that wsj.com started to use for the last 10 day (before everything worked fine).
The same problem happens when opening an article from theatlantic.com
For example,
http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/11/jeffrey_sachs_on_obamas_inadequacy.php

These ad have a special feature "rollover to discover" which expands the ad and change it once the mouse roll over them.

The problem is extremely annoying I guess for all the Firefox reader of these two periodical (and perhaps of other sites).
The only current solution to read them is through Explorer :-(



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.log on wsj.com
2.click on any article
3.the page will open fine until the add on the right is loaded at which moment the Firefox close itself automatically
Actual Results:
Firefox close down completely.

Expected Results:
Should open the page normally and continue to work

PS: the problem existed with Forefox 3.0 and 3.5, and persisted even if all the extension were blocked.
I also updated all the medium s/w I have to the latest version available: nothing helped.
