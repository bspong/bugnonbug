after installing flash7player firebird turned into simple mozilla with disabled most feature
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1) Gecko/20030728
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1) Gecko/20030728

i have downloaded newest firebird 0.6.1, unpacked and used for a month.
Everything wa OK. I downloaded quicktime plugin and a few another, and had to
add some registry setting (for proper identification - some plugins weren't
able to identify Firebird without these entries).
and today i downloaded new flash 7, because quick time ha some error in
playing flash swf files. It properly identified Firebird browser, but after
first installation nothing happened (webpages with flash still weren't
playable). I have run installer second time (some plugins "like" it), and then
my well known Firebird turned into simple Mozilla, but:
- i cannot use "back" or "forward" button
- when i type address into address bar and hit enter, hothing happens, but i
can use link from other page
- some thing in menu don't work.

apparently, Firebird turned into Mozilla completely, with Mozilla's menus,
options, button and everything.

OK, that's all.

simple - winXP Pro PL (but english, standard Firebird, NOT polish), without any
modification in Mozilla Firebird'd directory.
