User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1

This doe not seem to be specific to certain web pages. The main symptom appears to be if firefox is open in one user account and then is also opened in another user account. Starts running very slowly and turn mouse arrow into spinning colour wheel. I also get a lot of unresponsive script message after this occurs in both user accounts. Messages are generally referring to different scripts. Have had to use 'Control - Click' on task bar icon and force quit to restore machine to useable state.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start firefox in one user account and go to any webpage
2. Start firefox in another user account and go to any webpage
3. Wait.

Actual Results:
I get the symptom described above and slow response from all other open applications.

Expected Results:
Previous version never seemed to slow the machine down or fail to respond when open in multiple user account simultaneously.
I know I have never seen an unresponsive script message before.
