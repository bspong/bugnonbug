Let's say you have a <select> with 4 options. The first option is selected by default. If you click on the dropdown to bring up all the options, mouseover one of the options, and then move your mouse away, the highlighted option is the value that get returned! I found this through Javascript while doing some mouseover effect based on the value in a <select>.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
(See http://www.jsfiddle.net/WccFF/ for a working setup)
1. Create a select with a few option (be sure to give them values)
2. Create a div or some other element you can mouse over.
3. Using Javascript, add an event listener to the div that log the value of the dropdown to the console.
4. Open (click on) the dropdown
5. Mouseover any non-selected option so that it is highlighted
6. Without clicking, move your mouse over the div with the event listener attached
7. View incorrect result
Actual Results:
The value of the highlighted and abandoned option is returned

Expected Results:
The value of the actual selected value should be returned
