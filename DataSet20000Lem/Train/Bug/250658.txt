autocomplete pop-up generates mouse out event, even though mouse doesn't move

When autocomplete pop up suggestion to fill in a text field in a webpage, it
generates an onmouseout event for whatever HTML element the mouse is currently over.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.opensky.ca/~jdhildeb/firefox_autocomplete_bug.html
2. Bring up the pop-up menu by floating over the link.
3. Enter "test" into the search field, and click search (the page will reload).
4. Start entering the word "test" again.


Actual Results:
After entering "te", autocomplete will pop up and the search box will disappear.

Expected Results:
Autocomplete should work, but should not send an onmouseout event (which cause
the menu to disappear).


Whether or not the menu disappears seems to be related to the position of the
mouse pointer -- however the menu often disappears even when the pointer is
nowhere near the autocomplete popup.

This may be related to bug #244857, but from the description doesn't appear to
be the same bug.
