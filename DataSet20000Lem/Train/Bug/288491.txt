The wikipedia site load painfully slow 'sometimes' in firefox. I have used
apple's spin control tool to see what is happening. It seems that the following
function take about 6 second to complete. I have loaded the wikipedia site
manytimes with the window version of firefox and it never take quite a long
a on the mac. This seems to happen on linux too but not a severe a on the mac.

nsBlockFrame::Reflow(nsPresContext*, nsHTMLReflowMetrics&, nsHTMLReflowState
const&, unsigned int&)

nsBlockFrame::ReflowDirtyLines(nsBlockReflowState&, int)

nsBlockFrame::ReflowLine(nsBlockReflowState&, nsLineList_iterator, int*, int)

nsBlockReflowContext::ReflowBlock(nsRect const&, int, nsCollapsingMargin&, int,
int, nsMargin&, nsHTMLReflowState&, unsigned int&)

nsBlockFrame::ReflowBlockFrame(nsBlockReflowState&, nsLineList_iterator, int*)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.start with a clean profile
2.load wikipedia english site
3.watch the spinning beach ball

Actual Results:
The spinning beachball appears for few second then the page load

Expected Results:
The page should appear instantly (providing you have broadband) like it doe
with the window version of firefox, and apple's safari.
