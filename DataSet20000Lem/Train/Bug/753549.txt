I just updated to FF 12.0 but it is slow and sluggish and won't load the email I want to check in the preview panel.
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.0; Trident/5.0; SLCC1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; Media Center PC 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; .NET4.0E; OfficeLiveConnector.1.5; OfficeLivePatch.1.3; InfoPath.3; .NET4.0C; WWTClient2; eMusic DLM/4; Zune 4.7; BRI/2; AskTB5.6; Creative AutoUpdate v1.41.03)

Steps to reproduce:

well right after I updated and rebooted from another update and tried to go back into FF


Actual results:

It went wacko gave me a quick blue screen of death and kicked the computer off. When my puter came back and I got back to ff it wa slow and sluggish. Not to mention it took (but it always has) 3 click of the mouse to get it to load. Once I got my Yahoo mail loaded it wouldn't show email in the preview panel so I took ff off of default browser.


Expected results:

It should have loaded after the first click and the email should show in preview panel without any hassel. This is the third time I started to use ff but each time a fatal flaw(for my use) happened. I liked ff w/yahoo because I can use one key to mark email a read ON VERSION 12 only the others didn't work so well now the browser is sluggish and email don't load right. Get these fixed and I will be back.
