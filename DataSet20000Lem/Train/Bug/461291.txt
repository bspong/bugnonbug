After hiding the toolbar in a browser window, the gradient in the titlebar is not updated, and doe not blend well with the rest of the interface.

Opening a new window without a toolbar render a correct gradient, but also render a thin separator line that should not be there, except maybe in the default theme when the toolbar is hidden and the bookmark bar is visible (because it ha it own gradient; doe not apply to other toolbars, afaict). Adding the toolbar to said new window correctly redraws the titlebar gradient, however.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new window with the navigation toolbar.
2a. Hide the navigation toolbar.
-OR-
2b. Press the toolbar toggle button to the right of the window.
(it probably ha a proper name)
Actual Results:
Ugly unfinished gradient.

Expected Results:
The titlebar should feature a full gradient, blending well with whatever other toolbars are below it.

This is the full list of behavior I could find:

* Hiding nav toolbar in a window: unfinished gradient, no separator.
* New window without nav toolbar: correct gradient, unnecessary separator.
* Toolbar toggle button (with nav toolbar): unfinished gradient, unnecessary separator (should blend with the tab bar).
* Toolbar toggle button (without nav toolbar): gradient stay correct, separator pop out of nothing, possibly creating a double separator effect.
