I have been using Firefox for over a year now and the print function worked fine. A few week ago I installed the new version of Windows Live Hotmail, now the print function doe not work properly. Only the first page of a multi-page e-mail prints. This morning I upgraded to the newest version of Firefox and tried it again, still not working. I then went looking for a way of reporting this problem and found where I am now. The first thing I did wa to create a new profile following the instruction given, still doesn't work. I switched my browser to IE and tried to print the same multi-page e-mail and got the number of page I should have. Consequently I have come to the conclusion that Firefox ha not been updated to handle whatever Microsoft changed in the new version of Hotmail.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Sign-on to a Hotmail account that us the new Windows Live.
2. Select an e-mail what ha multiple pages.
3. Print it by either using the Print function within the File menu of Firefox or
click on the print icon within the e-mail.
Actual Results:
You get only the first page. At the bottom of the printed page it actually say '1 of 1'.

Expected Results:
It should have printed(in my case 5 pages)all the page of the e-mail.

My guess is that this isn't really a bug per se but a change in the function of how Hotmail now work under Windows Live and the developer of Firefox are just not aware of it.
I also tried it under the latest version of Netscape and it doesn't work properly there either.
