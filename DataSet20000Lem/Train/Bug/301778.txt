will no longer load since the I downloaded the newest update for mozilla and my extension
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; {BF1D478C-603A-4210-827D-DA3F411CD3C8}; SV1)
Build Identifier: mozilla 1.0.6

The whole area where mozilla ha functionality, like the file menu, the
location bar, and the big empty space where webpage are supposed to be
doesn't work at all. I can't click on it, I can't use keyboard shortcuts, it
start and the internet doesn't work. Foxytunes still works. Minimize,
restore, close, still works. Colorzilla still works, but may be the source of
the problem. It ha added itself to the menu that appears when you right
click. BTW, right clicking anywhere still brings up that menu, though none of
the button do anything anymore. When I deleted the colorzilla folder and
tried again, my homepage loaded. Then I restored colorizilla and it didn't
work again. Then I deleted colorzilla again, but it still didn't work. I
can't make anything inactive through mozilla because it completely
unresponsive.
