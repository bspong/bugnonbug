Console should show XMLHttpRequests
Currently, the "Net" filter with it option of "Errors," "Warnings," "Log," and "Log Request and Response Bodies" doe not offer any way to distinguish synchronous from asynchronous requests. When turning net logging on in the console, you'll receive a full dump of every request and response made, but typically the only request information one want to see, alongside their regular console logging calls, are asynchronous requests. After year of using third party tool like Firebug, or Chrome's developer tools, it's taken for granted that these request will be seen in the console in their own right--in some uncluttered state. I very much like the ability to see all request and response in the Console. I just think there should be toggle in place to emulate that more traditional expectation.

Perhaps instead of "Log Request and Response Bodies," it can be divided into two other options, like "Log XHR requests," and "Log all synchronous requests." Having both of them enabled will effectively be the same a "Log Request and Response Bodies," but individually they will divide up the request for better clarity.

In order to see asynchronous request under the current system, one would have to enter the "Network" tab and filter out the "XHR" responses, which is fine, but when debugging, it's nice to see just the asynchronous request and whatever debugging output one is logging--together--instead of having to switch tabs.

What do you think about this?
