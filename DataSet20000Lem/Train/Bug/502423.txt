I try to sort bookmark by selecting "organize bookmarks" in the bookmark menu. I am going to call the window that pop up when you select "organize bookmarks" the "bookmarks window". The bookmark window ha "name" at the top of it. I click on this and the bookmark are sorted by name. However, when I close the bookmark window, the bookmark are not sorted in the browser window when you click on the "bookmarks" menu to see the bookmarks. The bookmark are not sorted when the browser is restarted, either. The bookmark are also not sorted when "sort" is selected in the bookmark window (this is selected by clicking on the button with horizontal line on it). Finally, the bookmark are not even sorted in the bookmark window the next time you open it.

This bug ha existed since Firefox wa at some stage in the 2.X level, perhaps 2.5. I suspect that the bug might not exist in the Windows version of Firefox because I doubt that user would have put up with it for so long. I did a search for a previous report of the bug, but I could not find it. Perhaps the bug is even more limited, such a to particular system configuration. I have dual 1.8 GHz G5 processor with 2 GB of RAM that run on Mac OS 10.5.7. I have all of the update for both Firefox and my operating system. Finally, I have run diagnostic software on my computer and have done the routine maintenance it needs.
