Firefox 3 doesn't respond to all redraw event when UltraVNC's video hook driver is installed. When restoring a minimized window, for instance, or switching tabs, you only see what wa there before doing that. When restoring from minimized, you get a the window title bar and border, and whatever wa already drawn in that portion of the screen before.

To force redraw, you can wipe across the browser by dragging another window around in front of it. Also interacting with part of the interface in a way that cause redrawing doe so. Hovering over a link make them appear. Highlighting text make it appear, but not the space between line of text. Moving the mouse over or selecting button and menu cause them to appear.

This only happened after installing FF3.0. Everything wa fine in FF2.*. Reverted back to 2.*, worked again. Only FF3 is affected, no other applications.

Disabling the video hook driver in Window's Device Manager cause FF3 to redraw itself properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install UltraVNC making sure to enable the optional video hook driver.
2. Run Firefox 3.0, minimize it, then restore the window
3. Observe redrawing problem
Actual Results:
Firefox fails to properly redraw itself.

Expected Results:
Full redraw of restored window, it menu and contents.
