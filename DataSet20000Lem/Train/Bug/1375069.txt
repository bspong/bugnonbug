Can't disable privacy-violating "Search for X with <engines>" location bar behaviour
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:55.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/55.0

Steps to reproduce:

After upgrade to FF55 beta 2, typing anything in the location bar result in the normal result of looking in history, bookmarks, and open tab URLs, but also includes a toolbar-like "Search for <term> with" toolbar below with the various search engine icons.

Steps:

1. type in location bar
2. note that below the normal history, bookmarks, and open tab search result there is now a toolbar full of icon for search engine labelled "Search for <term> with" that will send your location bar text to any of these search engine if accidentally clicked or keypress-activated.

I have always turned off all search engine activity from the location bar a it's a violation of my privacy, but I cannot find an option (either in the UI, or in about:config) to disable this toolbar. I have already accidentally activated it when I scrolled down one item too far in the search result before hitting enter, sending a sensitive location bar term to some random search engine.

I need to be able to completely disable this new search toolbar. My location bar need to offer me the search of bookmarks, history, and open tabs, AND NOTHING ELSE. *No* mouse click or keypress should accidentally send my location bar text to some search engine without my explicit approval.


Actual results:

Firefox sent my private location bar term to some random search engine and violated my privacy.


Expected results:

Firefox should let me turn off this new privacy-violating feature completely. This toolbar should be completely disabled if I choose so.
