dead iframe block proper drawing of page

When I visit www.versiontracker.com via my Mac (OS X 10.3.5) and then visit any
page linked under the "Today's Mac OS X Updates:" list there, I get a
significant sized rectangular 'empty' area near the top left of the page.
Initially it blank, but when I scroll down the page (it scroll out of sight)
and then back up to the top... then it got a duplicate of some other part of
the page in it area. Switching to another 'tab', and then back, leaf a chunk
of the other frame overlayed on it.
Refreshing the page doesn't help. Disabling Adblock doesn't help. I don't see
this behavior with any other browser (including latest Mozilla), and I didn't
see it with earlier version of FireFox either. Restarting FireFox doesn't help.
Restarting the computer doesn't help.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit www.versiontracker.com
2. Click on any link in the "Today's Mac OS X Updates:"
3. On the new page, scroll around or switch to another tab and back. See problem.

Actual Results:
A dead iframe near the top left of the page retains whatever wa displayed their
previously via scrolling or tab switching.... rather than what should be there.

Expected Results:
The dead iframe should not be there, obscuring what is supposed to be under it.

reproduced it on Firefox, and that it doesn't occur with Mozilla proper.
