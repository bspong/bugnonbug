sessionstore.js swell to huge size, then cause browser to crash when loading the sessionstore
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20131205075310

Steps to reproduce:

usual web browsing. Unsure which site is causing the problem. I will try to pin it down.


Actual results:

During usual web browsing sessionstore.js get bigger and bigger until it reach between 25 and 80 MB in size. At this point the browser start crashing periodically and can restore session up to a point. At that point, highlighting the about:sessionrestore tab (including when it is highlghted a the only tab when firefox restarts) cause browser to crash. Only option at this point is to remove sessionstore.js and sessionstore.bak and start fresh. The process then start again. The new on get larger and larger until the same thing happens.

I suspect but cannot confirm that Google Maps "My Places" (where you draw maps) is causing the bloating of sessionstore.js . May be related to accumulation of closed tabs. Unable to load sessionstore.js in notepad++ with JSON plugin - cause application to lock up or crash - I cannot see what is filling it up.

Cannot tell how many recursive session are in the sessionstore.js files, but most recent one should not have more than one recursion.

I code a bit but I am NOT a developer so please bear that in mind.


Expected results:

sessionstore should not get this big. Last time I only had about 7 window open with about 5 tab each and it reached 47 MB.

There should be some way of purging the excess data from sessionstore.js.

I can provide additional sessonstore.js files.
