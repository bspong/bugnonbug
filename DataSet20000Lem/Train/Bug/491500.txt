Redirect Loop

Firefox ha detected that the server is redirecting the request for this address in a way that will never complete.

The browser ha stopped trying to retrieve the requested item. The site is redirecting the request in a way that will never complete.

* Have you disabled or blocked cooky required by this site?
* NOTE: If accepting the site's cooky doe not resolve the problem, it is likely a server configuration issue and not your computer.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to calendar.google.com (redirects to https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=cl&passive=true&nui=1&continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar%2Frender&followup=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar%2Frender&ltmpl=suggest)
2. Login using a non-google email account (e.g., myname@myemail.com) and the password for that Google account
3. Click the sign in button
Actual Results:
go to a blank page (https://www.google.com/accounts/CheckCookie?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar%2Frender&followup=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar%2Frender&service=cl&ltmpl=suggest&chtml=LoginDoneHtml) then to the redirect loop error page.

Expected Results:
Should go to the calendar home page for that account.

When on the redirect loop page, going to the gmail login, and logging in with the account take me to the page to set up a gmail account, but show me signed in with the non-gmail account. If I try to go to the calendar page from there, it go back to the redirect loop page. If I sign out from the page, I can do it all over again, with the same results. :)

I checked the cookie setting in Firefox. They are set to accept cookies, accept third party cookies, and keep them until they expire.

This is a new Firefox install.
