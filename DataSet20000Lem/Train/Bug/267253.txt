odd glitch with the Forward button

Here it goes: whenever you visit a page with a form on it, that will essentially
redirect Firefox when data is submitted, the forward button can be odd.

Go to the URL given. When you go there, follow the (crappy >_>) instruction on
what to do: you are to copy the link shown (actually, any site would do), go
there, and then hit the back button, to return to the form. Then, submit the
form (with at least 1 character in it), and you'll see the Forward button will
remain, after the data is submitted and Firefox essentially visit two page
after the form submittal:

Upon the data submittal, the php file called in the form action will send
Firefox a Location header, which will redirect Firefox back to the form page.
Note that it is not using any variation of the javascript "history.back" or
whatever it is, it is just redirecting Firefox back to the page.

Firefox is sent to dst.php, which then redirects Firefox to form.php, not
sending it back, but moving it forward, like any normal redirect would do.

This only occurs if the redirect is to the form page; any other page result in
the Forward button, correctly working, not being clickable.
