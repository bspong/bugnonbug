The progress listener handler are independent of each other and should be isolated so that
a) they don't interfere with normal tabbed browsing operation
b) they don't interfere with each other

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install (pathological) extension (to follow)
2. Browse normally
3.
Actual Results:
Some unusual behaviour - for instance
o the window title doesn't update.
o the tabbar doesn't position properly when overflowing

Expected Results:
No noticable change.

Normally these effect will be fairly random but I do I have one, real life, extension that can reproducibly exhibit this problem but I don't particularly want to go into specific for this bug.

There is a tendency to dismiss all bug if they disappear when replicated in a clean profile however, in this case, I feel that the tabbrowser ha some responsibility in maintaining normal operation. I would propose that the dispatcher should be changed to something like this:

if (p)
+ try {
p.onFooChange(....);
+ } catch (e) {
+ // don't inhibit other listener
+ // XXX log exception to console?
+ }
