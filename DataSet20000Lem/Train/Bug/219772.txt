if you use multiple profile but use 1 bookmark file,
ex ~/.phoenix/default/xxxxxxx.slt us bookmark file ~/.phoenix/bookmark.html
~/.phoenix/default2/xxxxxxx.slt us bookmark file ~/.phoenix/bookmark.html

by setting in prefs.js in both profile prefs.js files:
user_prefs("browser.bookmarks.file", "~/.phoenix/bookmark.html");

then you create a bookmark in profile default2 and close default2 firebird, then
close default firebird the bookmark you created in default2 are lost. But if
you create bookmark in default2 firebird then close default firebird then close
default2 firebird it work the way expected...but if you create booksmarks in
both profile you are kinda screwed...

i would assume the cause is the browser isnt saving the bookmark until exiting
but this kinda cause a problem because it will overwrite the other profile
changes...tabs are great but sometimes a new browser is nice too.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.configure 2 profile of firebird to use same bookmark file
2.create bookmark in both profile ... and exit all firebird
3.you lose which ever firebird exit first bookmark

Actual Results:
which ever profile i close first loos the new bookmark i created

Expected Results:
save both profiles' bookmark

it pretty simple ... you are having the browser save upon exiting but by doing
this you will over right the change made by the first profile that exits. you
should save to the bookmark.html file when a bookmark is added not when exiting.

even cooler would be if the bookmark access button would actively check the
bookmark file for changes, but this might cause a slow down and having to exit
to reload the bookmark isnt a big deal. of course i also check my mail every
5min and that doesnt seem to cause a slow down.
