If you have two FF window and you select File -> Quit, you'll get a confirmation dialog for each window that ha more than one tab. Now, if you those window are in different workspaces, sometimes (most of the time?) the first confirmation dialog will be attached to the window that is *not* on the current workspace one is seeing. Maybe the dialog are put up onwindows repsecting the order in which the window were created or something like that.

IMHO, the way to fix this is to have exactlly *one* confirmation dialog pop up on the Quit command, with a message reading something along the line of "you have 13 window open. are you sure you want to quit?" Note that I'm counting window and not tab here---and I'm even counting window with one tab in them.
I would not show the confirmation dialog if there is exactly one window. (The rationale being the same a the one that make it logical to not confirm closing a window when there is only one tab: the user is in view of the whole thing)

If that change is too copernican, then maybe the confirmation dialog can be reordered so that the first one to pop up is attached to the window in which the Quit menu item got run?

This is not an enhancement: it is a bug ;-)

Reproducible: Always
