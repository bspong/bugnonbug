In the page at http://www.matthew-good.com/Program/TWS/TWS_Videos.htm it
sometimes crash when it try to load a video. It could be because it's
literally trying to convert a DNS address into an I.P. address, or it could be
just that Quicktime screw up from buffer mode into play mode. Or maybe it's
the pop-up window with a plugin inside that's causing it. (???) Happens not on
the first try, but after watching 3-5 different videos. Could be pop-up window
related.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Play different videos.
2. Close the pop-up window down when it's not finishing downloading but still
playing the video.
3. Try to reopen same video.
4. Quicktime never keep a cache of the *.mov you partially downloaded before
Actual Results:
Firefox closed and generated an error. Unfortunately, I didn't click on detail
to find out. So, I uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and included the Quality
Feedback agent so if it happens again, I'm prepared.

Expected Results:
The quicktime plugin shouldn't have crashed firefox. I believe plugins should
be totally independant of the browser's kernel for there is no interaction
between the browser's kernel and the plugin. So, if the plugin crashes, it
shouldn't crash the entire browser, only the component. An analogy: a car
stereo crashing should not stop the car engine just because the car stereo is
built in the car.

Please make future plugins of firefox independent of the browser's kernel.
Plugins should never crash the entire browser.
