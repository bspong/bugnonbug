Crash - Quicktime - also prevents left click on form field to fill out BR

On page http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-ATI2 there is an URL link to http://fah-web.stanford.edu/movies/gpu2-viewer.avi that cause the 'Plug-in Crash' page to be displayed. Quicktime worked last week, though I have never been to that particular page previously.

When I load that URL my Firewall prompt to allow the Plug-in_container.exe .


On _my_ System, when I load that URL I get a 'Quicktime Pop-up' that say it must fetch a Codec to play the video. I downloaded and saved that ".avi", then I loaded it into 'GSpot"; it need an XVID Codec and report that I have "XviD 1.1.2 Final" already installed.

I can play the video (without Firefox) without using any downloaded Codecs in VirtualDub (which us the System's XVID Codec) but if I use my installed Quicktime it too say it need the plug-in but then take me to the Mac-OS download Page :( .



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Xvid -- http://www.xvid.org/Downloads.15.0.html
2. Install Quicktime -- http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
3. Visit http://fah-web.stanford.edu/movies/gpu2-viewer.avi


Actual Results:
The Quicktime Player Plug-in activates our 'Plug-in Crash' page.

I send the report and retry the URL.


After the Quicktime Crash, when I come to __this__ Website I can NOT left-click on a "Form Field" to enter a 'Search Term' or type info into a Bug Report. I must restart Namoroka to enter the BR.



Expected Results:
_NO_ Plug-in should take anything with it when it crashes. It is ?weird? that this Crash cause Form Fields to be inaccessible, it seems an "odd leak" of one Bug into another portion of the Program that cause an effect that is not easily noticed (you would need to click on a Field).



I did read https://developer.mozilla.org/En/How_to_get_a_stacktrace_with_windbg and did the Installation but I am unsure about how I would go about getting the "Plug-in_container.exe" to load into the Debugger since it is called from Firefox (the loading of FF into the Debugger (while complex) seems within my abilities).
