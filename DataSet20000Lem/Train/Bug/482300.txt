Firefox will not display the back button or allow user to post bookmarks. We maintain a network home environment. We have an Active Directory environment with SMB homes. Our Macs are joined using Thursby's ADmitMac client. some user are fine, but others (many/most??) have this problem.

We have created ~/.MacOSX folder for each user in an attempt to work through this problem. That ha helped for some, but user could still be left with "places.*" file after app exit -which mean at next launch they're faced with a "broken app" (from their perspective).

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. launch application
2. quit application
3. launch application
Actual Results:
you might not get back buttons, etc. right away, or you might have to quit and re-launch the app more then once during the same console session to get corrupted places.* file

Expected Results:
back button that work and bookmark that can be saved.
