While reading a huge document it is extremely useful if we can navigate
to any part of the document visited earlier with just a touch @ sidebar.
An example will be:

Location 1:

The packet ha format described in Appendix E.

[Then the user mark the current location and go to appendix E]

Location 2:

Appendix E: Packet format:

[user look @ it, mark it and go back to the original location (Loca
tion 1)].

After some time the user want to come back to Appendix E again. This ti
me, the user just mouse-touches @ the mark made earlier.

Besides coming back to the location will save a lot of mouse-rolls even
if the user just want to go to some offset from the marked location...

If this feature is already there just shoot me. I've proved that I'm horr
ible in searching..

Thanks
