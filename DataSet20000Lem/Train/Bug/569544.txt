We are working with bringing some of our server code client side to help with the drain on the systems. (The application is a text chat window)

This ha worked well, in some older machine the user would be typing a message to an agent and the key stokes might get a one second delay before they appear on the text chat message creation window. In fire fox however this one second delay would cause these key stokes to be lost.

For Example, We have a Message "hi how are you".
Now let’s say some PHP code run on the client to get the most up-to-date chat history, this kick in when the user is still typing the above message.
Now let’s say it kick in when the user is typing the "are you" part of the message.

In IE, it would appear a "hi how are you". With "are" appear instantly - key stokes queued while PHP is executed.

In fire fox it would appear a "hi how you". With "are" being lost while the PHP is being executed - no key stroke queued
