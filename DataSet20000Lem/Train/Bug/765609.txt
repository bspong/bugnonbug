Restart with add-on disabled should have an option to disable all add-on & plugins in one click & start in normal mode[Redesign safe mode dialog with another(3rd) option like FF10-13]
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:4.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0
Build ID: 20120614114901

Steps to reproduce:

clicked restart with add-on disabled



Actual results:

Got two option
1) start in safe mode
2) reset profile


Expected results:

like in FF13 & earlier there should be an option like

3) disable all Add-ons & plugin's and start in normal mode

Resetting doe not help sometimes (say just want to reset tool-bars or
bookmark & nothing else with minimal fuss & surely that the user will not mess
up!)

when using approx 20+ extension & plugins, when we find some problem we just
disable all addons in a go(try disabling even 10 extension one by one you will
see)
& then one by one check each addon to find the problem(leaks or bugs/website
problem)


> * Reset toolbars and control
> ** Delete localstore.rdf from the profile

As a Power user ok but What about the general people/non-power users?(adds
unnecessary extra step plus a risk)
plus while helping them creates extra steps(say when simply restarting &
resetting search-box doe the trick without any sort of risk)

Same As ABOVE!

These are the option which commonly solved users' problem and is better than
resetting Firefox , just add a button to keep the old way too by keeping the
old code( & add a 3rd button) to start the old box(many people find it easy)

(instead of going to the profile & deleting stuff a it is not easy for the casual/home user)
