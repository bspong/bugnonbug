Steps to reproduce:

'm trying to write a wysiwyg editor using a contentEditable div, and am having trouble in Firefox when dealing with bold (and italic).



Actual results:


When all text in the div is selected, execCommand('bold') work in the div, but when I try to grab the HTML of that content, the HTML doe not reveal any formatting.
To see what I mean, please try running the attached HTML code in Firefox 5.

Please try the following:

- Select the word "Some" only. Click the Bold button. This will make the text bold, a expected. The HTML output us <span style="font-weight:bold;"> to bold the word, which is somewhat unfortunate (it's <b> in Safari, Chrome), but nonetheless doe the job.
- Select the entire phrase "Some editable text" (either manually or using CTRL-A). Click the Bold button. While the contentEditable text is bold, a expected, the HTML output doe not have the bold formatting applied.



Expected results:

The HTML output should have the bold formatting applied.
