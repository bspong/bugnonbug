Steps to reproduce:

Load page, open inspector, look at content; you'll see the data about the element in the browser side, reload the page and view the data of en element.

I am unable to replicate the bug on other websites; but bug will replicate 100% of time after first reload of page.

HTML file and CSS pass W3C validation with no error or warning; thus the document should not cause an issue.

I have tried stripping the CSS from the file a well, error persist.

I have tried Firefox restarting Firefox without any modules, error persist.

I have used the repair function of Firefox, error persist.

I have remove Base64 WOFF file from page; error is gone.

The file doe not cause any other issue than this display issue nor doe it seem to cause issue with other pages.


Actual results:

Inspector show no data about an element after a page reload. This seems to happen solely on this specific HTML file.


Expected results:

Data about element should still show on reload, view attachement for details.
