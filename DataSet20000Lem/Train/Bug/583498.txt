Hi I love Mozilla and i wa more than happy using it until 2 day ago when it automatically updated. Since the update, when i click on a link to be opened in a new page the navigation/address bar display "search bookmark and history" until the page start to load. Meaning i can now only see which page is loading only after the page ha started to load. I visit a lot of creepy site for experimenting which have weird links. I could click on them and immidietly see where the browser wa headed. so i could stop it page before loading if i knew from the address bar that that wa not the page that i wa looking to open. now i can not see the address and i can not take a risk of letting the page open so i have to use google chrome, and i'm not very excited to use that... it is very resource hungry.
Thanks..
