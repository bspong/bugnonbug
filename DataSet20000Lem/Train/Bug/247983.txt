If I press and hold the middle mouse button in order to autoscroll down then
move the cursor out of the active FFx 0.9 window, when I release the middle
button the auto-scroll isn't stopped.

In FFx 0.8, even if my mouse cursor had strayed out of the active window, when I
release the button the page stop scrolling.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page which scroll vertically
2. Press and hold middle button while moving mouse down to start a slow autoscroll
3. Move mouse cursor out of the window (on any side) and release the middle button

Actual Results:
Page continues scrolling until you click/middle click back in the active FFx window.

Expected Results:
Page stop scrolling at the point the button is released, whether or not the
cursor is inside the active FFx window.

Unsure whether this is a bug or not, but I vastly prefer the original behaviour
a it seems more natural to me :-)

I've reproduced this "bug" on both my work and home PC's.
