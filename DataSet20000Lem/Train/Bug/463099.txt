Firefox - object background not transparent for audio/mpeg controller, show white

The core problem is that different OSs, using different audio controller (Totem, Quicktime, WMedia) require different height for their controller. Thus there will be unused space for the thin one - like quicktime - if the tall one - like WindowsMedia - are going to show fully. This leaf an ungly white or black box, either around or above the thinner controller, UNLESS THE BACKGROUND IS TRANSPARENT. Which it unfortunately isn't.

See the example URL above, which is bare-stripped HTML code to demonstrate.

I've viewed this from Mac and Intel hardware, and through Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu OS, in serveral combination (Firefox, IE, Chrome).

Only Safari on Mac doe it correctly - it allows the background to show through the extra vertical space that the controller doe not use.

On my home machine, Firefox, using Quicktime, show white bar above and below the Quicktime controller.

(Chrome did the same thing, on a Toshiba running XP.)

IE using WindowsMedia also fails, but differently: it show black instead of white, and put the controller at the bottom.

Firefox on Ubuntu 8 doe the same, except using the Totem player.

(Firefox on Windows XP ha another separate problem - it doesn't show a controller at all.)

I've tried all combination of parameter for the object that I can find, including wmode transparent, but nothing corrects it.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set up valid object tag for audio/mpeg. Code can be a in my example above:

####CSS:
body { background-color: blue; }
####HTML:
<body>
<object type="audio/mpeg" data="../Poems-recs/She_comes-vA1.mp3" width="140" height="70">
<param name="src" value="../Poems-recs/She_comes-vA1.mp3">
<param name="autoplay" value="false" >
<param name="autostart" value="0">
</object>
</body>

2. View page through Firefox, Safari, Explorer, Chrome
3. If height in HTML, or in CSS, is taller than the controller chosen by the OS to render the audio/mpeg object, then white will show above and below for Quicktime, and black will show above for others. They should be transparent, or at least there should be a way to make them transparent.
Actual Results:
white border, black border

Expected Results:
background should be transparent
