Clicking start shirekoto in profile manager cause the profilemanager to crash.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open profilemanager(firefox -ProfileManager in terminal)
2.Change the current profile or even simply click start shirekoto
Actual Results:
The following text appears in the terminal and profilemanager crashes.
The program 'firefox-3.5' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
(Details: serial 891 error_code 3 request_code 20 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X error are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)


Expected Results:
The firefox window ha to open with the selected profile
