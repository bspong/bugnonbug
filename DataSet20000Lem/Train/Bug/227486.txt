MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()' return incorrect value if thunderbird is running
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.5) Gecko/20031007 Firebird/0.7

It seems that the -remote functionality doe not operate correctly (or atleast
a expected) in an enviroment where Thunderbird is running. It seems to interact
with Thunderbird, rather than correctly (or a expected) indicating that
firebird is not running.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
------ If neither are running ------
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()'
No running window found.
[adam@persephone adam]$ echo $?
2

------ If just thunderbird is running ------
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/thunderbird/thunderbird &
[1] 26290
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()'
[adam@persephone adam]$ echo $?
0


------ After thunderbird exit ------
[1]+ Done /usr/local/thunderbird/thunderbird
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()'
No running window found.
[adam@persephone adam]$ echo $?
2

------ With Firebird running ------
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird &
[1] 26328
[adam@persephone adam]$ /usr/local/firebird/MozillaFirebird -remote 'Ping()'
[adam@persephone adam]$ echo $?
0
Actual Results:
-remote 'Ping()' indicated firebird wa running when in fact it wa not, instead
Thunderbird wa running.

Expected Results:
-remote 'Ping()' should not indicate Firebird is running when Thunderbird is
running, only when firebird itself is running.

This bug appears to be somewhat related to 170609. I'm sure they have the same
root cause (though that bug discus it in the context of Mozilla and Firebird).
