bookmark subfolders should be expanded automatically for selection

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Ctrl-D to open the "Add Bookmarks" Dialog
2.
3.

Actual Results:
When bookmarking a page and the "Add Bookmark" dialog appears, the window automatically show the parent "Bookmark" folder a well a the last used bookmark subfolders in which a bookmark wa saved.

Expected Results:
From a usability perspective, it should not be a multiple-step process to view and select subfolders of the parent "Bookmarks", in which you would like to save a bookmark. Currently, you have to push the drop-down button to see all available subfolders of the parent "Bookmarks". In my opinion, all parent folder should be listed and you should be able to select any subfolder by pausing the mouse upon it parent and having that folder automatically expanded for selection

This enhancement is similiar to the functionality of the main Firefox menubar where the submenu are expanded automatically if the mouse is paused upon it parent menu.
