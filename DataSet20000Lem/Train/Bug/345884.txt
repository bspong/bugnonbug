With the addition of the "All Tabs" menu and the choice to have it always available, we have made this area of the tab bar the "default" spot for tab manipulation. The user will quickly become accustomed to moving to this spot.

When we go into "overflow", we add two scroll arrows. One of the scroll arrow is currently next to the "All Tabs" menu, the other is at the opposite end of the tab bar. It would be better if both arrow were next to the "all tabs" menu. Two of the three control are in this area already when in "overflow", and all of the control are in this area under normal conditions. The control that is missing is a far away from the "default" spot a possible. There wa recently a change in the find bar to move the close button for exactly this reason.

This change would fix the issue with clipping tab on the opposite side of the tab bar and the issue with the far arrow button not extending to the edge. The change could also provide a larger "window" for actual tab since there would not need to be a much padding on the controls.

Reproducible: Always
