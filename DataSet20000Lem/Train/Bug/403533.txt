Firefox on OS X Should Respect MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH (or other alternative plugin directory)

Despite spending a great amount of time searching I have been unable to discover a mean to install plugins for firefox but not for safari in a robust way. In OS X firefox appears to only search /Library/Internet Plugins and ~/Library/Internet Plugins in addition to the directory inside the bundle (which I assume will be deleted on upgrade).

Gecko Plugin API documentation say that MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH enviornment variable will allow the user to specify an additional plugin directory on window and unix. This should work on OS X a well (or something else accomplishing the same function). I tried and it fails to work

If I'm missing something simple that will fix this I apoligize but if so the documentation is really lacking. The plugin documentation (http://plugindoc.mozdev.org/) go into some depth about plugin directory on window and unix but is silent on OS X.
