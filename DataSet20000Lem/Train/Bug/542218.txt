The text cursor take the color of the inverse color of the background. Example: White background = black cursor.

When background is gray (#808080), cursor is gray, so the cursor is transparent and we loose it.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make a web page with this code:
<table bgcolor="#808080"><tr><td>TEST TEST TEST</td></tr></table>
2. Move the cursor into the text to see the "cursor:text".
Actual Results:
Cursor is transparent because it take the same color that is the inverse of the gray. The problem occur with cursor "text" and "col-resize" for example.

Expected Results:
On Mac, Firefox and other browser don't reproduce this problem. Instead of a transparent cursor, it's always a black cursor with a white border.

On Windows: Only Chrome and Firefox can reproduce this problem. With Internet Explorer, it's a black cursor with a white border.

I have given an easy way to reproduce the problem. But in fact, I'm trying to make a grid with resizable column, and I can't see the cursor with Firefox because it's transparent
