If a menu item is disabled (greyed out), because it is not applicable for instance, it is still can be reached using access letters. This is a bit confusing because:
1) if the same access letter is used more than once, pressing it cycle between all the command including unavailable ones; if the command are two (one that is available/applicable and one that is not) it would be expected that pressing the access key will execute the available command, but instead it cycles;
2) if the letter is used once only the menu hide (as if the command wa carried out), and it would be better if the menu doe not react to this (as if you are pressing non existing access key).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press Ctrl+B to open the bookmark in the sidebar
2. Rigt-click a Livemark.
3. Press 'R' on the keyboard a may time a you wish.
Actual Results:
The selection cycle between 'Reload Live Bookmark' and 'Sort By Name' regardless of the fact the 'Sort By Name' is greyed out (may be it is N/A to livemarks, I do not know).

Expected Results:
'Reload Live Bookmark' should be executed just like 'Properties' doe if you press 'I' on the keyboard.
