Steps to reproduce:

Configure a 1280x1024 monitor on an "original Intel" Mac Mini upgraded to OS 10.6, with the digital video cable used, not the VGA adapter, and in "portrait" mode so it can be set on it side, giving a 1024x1280 display.

Go to a number of different website and be annoyed by the need to scroll horizontally, even though 1024 is plenty of horizontal resolution.


Actual results:

A small amount of horizontal scrolling is needed on many websites.

forum.xda-developers.com is one example where this issue just came up.


Expected results:

Expected result would be to not have to scroll horizontally. Ever. That's a real pain in the rear end for reading anything!

An option should be available in configuration, perhaps in about:config, to limit reported vertical resolution to the same as, or smaller than, the horizontal resolution. If left on, this may cause some website to assume a monitor is only 1024x1024, but this is far le damaging to usability than a website that assumes a too-high horizontal resolution and then force scrollbars.

The prevalence of this problem is expected to get worse a mobile device with screen zooming become more and more popular; a it often reasonable to expect mobile device reader to just zoom out a little - I do that all the time on a phone.
