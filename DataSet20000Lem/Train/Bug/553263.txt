Always when I try to log in to Yahoo Mail by that link, Firefox 3.6 crash and the dialogue "Mozilla Crash Reporter" appears: "We 're sorry Firefox had a problem and crashed. We'll try to restore your tab and window when it restarts. To help u diagnose and fix the problem, you can send u a crash report" (which I did) The crash report content are:

Somewhere within the Firefox support webpage I found an article "Firefox crash when using Yahoo Mail" and it suggests to delete the file npYState.dll which is found under C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\shared. I have search my whole computer, but there is no file npYState.dll which I could delete.

Because this constant crashing when opening the link K:\Program Files\YahooEtc\SignInPage\Welcome to Yahoo! Mail.htm happens only when I use Firefox 3.6 but NOT when I use Firefox 3.5 I am wondering what did you change (to the bad) when you made the new version Firefox 3.6 out of the older version Firefox 3.5 ?
I would like to use Firefox 3.6, but under these circumstance I cannot. I hope you can fix this problem soon !
Do you need any other information from me ?

Hedwig

Reproducible: Always
