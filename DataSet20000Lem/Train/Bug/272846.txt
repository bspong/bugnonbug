In the linked test case, clicking an X will remove the associated
table row and recalculate the total price of all the items. This seems to be a
simple task, but it doe not execute consistently or correctly. I've observed
the following behavior:

- When the table row removal function is called normally, an item's price input
get stuck although it row ha gone.
- Sometimes a form input get duplicated when it parent row is removed.
- Inserting delay (for example, alerting the ID of the input being added to the
total) increase the likelihood that the code will execute properly, but it
doesn't always work.

This script work a expected in IE 6. To the best of my knowledge, I am not
using any nonstandard methods.

(If the test case seems like an overly complex mean of handling the task at
hand, keep in mind that it's a simplified version of an interface that I'm
working on.)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type numerical value in the box next to the products.
2. Press the Calculate Total button.
3. Click an X next to a product.

Actual Results:
The JavaScript calculates a new total, which is virtually always incorrect
because the form field are not removed properly when the table row are deleted.

Expected Results:
It should have removed any form field inside the element deleted via removeChild.
