X protocol error when running through lbxproxy kill browser
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux sparc64; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050907 Firefox/1.0.6

At times, when opening multiple tabs, clicking on a link in the various tabs,
and resizing font via control-alt-<keypad-+>, the browser will die with what
look like a gdk error, but not sure:

inevitable/defeat:inevitable: The program 'Gecko' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadLength (poly request too large or internal Xlib length erro'.
(Details: serial 131628 error_code 16 request_code 72 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X error are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

I tried running it via firefox -g --sync, but gdb puked and said it hit an
internal error, so can't get a reliable backtrace.

Debian/stable for both host and client, host is sun4u, client is i686, built
from 1.0.6 tarball via the following ~/.mozconfig:

MOZ_PHOENIX=1
export MOZ_PHOENIX
. $topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig
ac_add_options --disable-debug
ac_add_options --enable-optimize=-O2
ac_add_options --disable-freetype2
ac_add_options --enable-view-source
ac_add_options --enable-default-toolkit=gtk2
ac_add_options --enable-crypto
ac_add_options --disable-oji
#ac_add_options --enable-strip
ac_add_options --disable-strip
ac_add_options --disable-shared
