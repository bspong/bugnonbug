Whenever I restart Firefox, I cannot log in to any website that require cookies. After a little hunting I found that the option 'Accept cooky from site' turn itself off whenever I shut Firefox down. There is no crash report from Firefox, so I assume it is closing correctly. This ha only started happening since upgrading to Firefox 3.0.9

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up Firefox and try to log in to any site which requires cooky (e.g. www.reddit.com). This will fail and redirect me to the homepage again to log it.
2. Check Preferences > Privacy > Cookies and 'Accept cooky from sites' is turned off.
3. Turn on above option and restart Firefox.
Actual Results:
'Accept cooky from sites' option is off again after restarting Firefox.

Expected Results:
'Accept cooky from sites' option should remain selected between restarts.
