ASCII control character stripped from address bar
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

I typed an URL like this in the address bar:

http://somedomain.com/%1A/PageName

and I hit enter on it.


Actual results:

My input wa changed to:

http://somedomain.com//PageName

The ASCII control character that is non-printable wa removed. It left an URL which is not correct for the requested resource. Further more for example:

http://somedomain.com/somename%1A/PageName

would turn to:

http://somedomain.com/somename/PageName

which might be a completely different resource on the server and confuse the user.




Expected results:

ASCII control character that are non-printable should remain in the address bar with their URL encoding. This ha nothing to do with localization (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105909) a there is not another standardized representation for them in any locale.

Useful information is lost from the address bar by stripping them and even possible a conflict created where the displayed URL is for another resource than the displayed page.

I have not tested this with other versions, but this should be easy and quick to test for people using those versions.
