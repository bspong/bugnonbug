Google notebook add-on version tested a broken: 1.0.0.18/19



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.click on the notebook icon on status bar
2.OR click on "Note this" item in context menu

Actual Results:
In "1": a new Firefox window (e.g., instance) come out with the notebook popped up in the new instance
In "2": same a in "1", plus the page is not added into Google notebook


Expected Results:
For "1": Notebook should pop out just above the Notebook icon in the same Firefox window
For "2": Notebook should pop out and the page (or the selected page contents) should be added into Google notebook

- a new Firefox instance is generated even with Tab Mix Plus's single window mode
- I've tried clean profile with the same problems. However, this DOES NOT happen to Firefox 4 preliminary trunks. (And of course not to Firefox 2)

The third link to mozillazine forum topic started by me. There, rjonna pointed out:
>The problem is not with the Google Notebook.They use a cs style attribute >"position:fixed" in their popup. It is not rendering properly in Firefox 3.0. It work in FF 2.0 perfectly.
>Check out the link below which exactly show the problem.
