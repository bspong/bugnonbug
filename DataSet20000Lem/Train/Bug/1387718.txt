Steps to reproduce:

Open Firefox with many tabs. Pick a middle/center tab to drag so that there are many tab to the right and left of the tab strip, tab that are not visible on the screen.
Drag the tab to the left of the tab strip, to make it the first tab.
Drag the tab to the right of the tab strip, to make it the last tab. When dragging right move your mouse to the right of the right arrow on the tab strip, to hover over where the new tab icon (+) is or where the tab dropdown list arrow is.



Actual results:

When dragging right, moving the mouse to the right of the right arrow, the tab stop moving and you can't move it past that position or to be the last tab

When dragging right, moving the mouse so that it hovers over the right arrow, but not to the right of it, or when dragging to the left :
The tab doesn't stop moving, but move very slowly, too slow. The tab strip keep moving/scrolling very slowly, but the tab doesn't change it position relative to the other tab . Reaching the first or last tab with that speed will take ages.


Expected results:

When the tab is dragged, tab movement should not stop, and should not move slowly, but move faster in a relatively fast constant speed, or accelerate with time.
