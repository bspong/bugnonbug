HTML/Javascript problem with xulrunner >= 1.9.0
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9) Gecko/2008062908 Firefox/2.0.0.11 (Debian-3.0~rc2-2)

My system is x86_64, Debian testing (Lenny) with xurunner 1.9~rc2 and Iceweasel/Fireox 3.0~rc2. At www.windfinder.com/xulrunner_bug_test_page.htm Firefox/Iceweasel display a navigation bar with 5 entry on this page: "Advertisers", "Campaigns", "Groups", "Setup", "Logout". This navigation bar come from the HTML-frontend of a popular ad server (www.adcycle.com). With xulrunner 1.9~rc2/Fireox 3.0~rc2 when you click on one of the entry you are linked to the correct page. With xulrunner 1.9.0/Fireox 3.0.3 no matter which box is clicked, always the "Logout"-link is used. The Problem seems to be the same on Windows 2000 with Firefox 3.0.3 but I don't know which version of xurunner is running there.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Got to www.windfinder.com/xulrunner_bug_test_page.htm
2. Click on one of the entry in the nvaigation bar
3. Check where the clicked link directs you
Actual Results:
With xurunner 1.9.0 the clicked link point to thr wrong target (logout)

Expected Results:
Clicked linked should point to the correct target

Clicked linked should point to the correct target
