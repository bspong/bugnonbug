Immediate FF application crash when attempting to render this page.
I have the following extensions: Adblock v.5 d2 Nightly 39
Flashblock 1.2.9 / BugMeNot 0.7 / FlatStyle 0.9.2.1 / TabBrowser Preferences 1.2.8.5
However, problem occurs in FF Safe Mode too, suggesting that extension are not
the cause.
The page us moderately complex Javascript - I wonder if that is the trigger
for the crash?
This occurs on two separate PC system on my home LAN - hardware summary below.
