Invalid Treeview in bookmark menu via star pane

WTF Treeview screenshot

I must have hit some timing sync with treeview work in bookmarks. This is kinda hard to repro, but it had to do with editing subfolders in Library window, and then going back and bookmarking a site and moving it to a newly created subgroup.

See screenshot. It just get worse and worse a you collapse/expand treeview.

Repro: (as best a i can)
1) install`Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.3a4pre) Gecko/20100331 Minefield/3.7a4pre
2) create a library bookmark structure with sublevel bookmark under Bookmarks Menu (eg. Bookmarks Menu > Mozilla > Labs > Weave
3) open a site, and use star pane to bookmark to the site to your sublevel (eg. > Labs > Weave)
4) Now open Library, and create a new folder under the last top level. (eg. > Labs > Weave2)
5) go to the same url, open star pane, remove bookmark, and add bookmark again, this time; choosing the new folder through the menu item
6) Notice the treeview structure get into a funky state (see screenshot)

Expected:
- making edit/changes to Library with subfolders and sublevels, should allow user to expand/collapse/edit the same subfolders and sublevels within the star pane

Actual:
- Treeview confusion.
