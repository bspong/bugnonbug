http://freeweb.siol.net/danej/riverIQGame.swf

Clicking on both of the above link prompt me for action instead of opening those file with the respective plugins.

Note the following:

- The plugins are correctly installed and configured when checking about:plugins and Download Actions. The shockwave flash work if it's embedded flash content.

- All thing such a clean installation (with complete registry wipes) and new profile have been tried. Different version and clean installaions of Acrobat Reader have been tried. It is not an issue with Acrobat.

- The problem doe NOT occur with either Firefox 1.0.7 or Bon Echo Alpha on the same system.

- I tested it yesterday with FF 1.5 Beta, and the problem wa there too.

- What's worse, I have worked on other Win98 machine with Firefox 1.5 which did not exhibit this problem. Therefore I'm having trouble narrowing down the possible cause or scenario where this would be happening. Posting in forum ha not given any new insight.
