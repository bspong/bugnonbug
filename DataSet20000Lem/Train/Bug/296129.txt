Firefox crash when a Quicktime pop-up appears when logging into www.mail.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I have an email account at www.mail.com. Frequently, but not always, when I log
in to get my email, a screen with the Quicktime "Q" appears, blink rapidly for
a short time, then fill the screen. When I close it, it also close Firefox,
regardless of how many tab are open.

Note that this happens only with Firefox and only at www.mail.com. I suspect
you will have to create your own email address to duplicate the problem. I use
"usa.com."

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create an email address at www.mail.com, selecting usa.com for your domain
2.login in several time until Quicktime "goes nuts" on your screen
3.Close the full screen Quicktime

Actual Results:
Firefox close

Expected Results:
Firefox should not have let Quicktime take over. Or at worst, not terminate
when closing a rogue Quicktime.

Feel free to contact me with any help I can give. In the meantime, I guess I'll
use (Gag me with a spoon) IE
