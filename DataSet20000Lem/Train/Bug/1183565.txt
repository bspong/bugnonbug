[e10s] RemoteWebNavigation now accepts postdata, but need to accept CPOW postdata a well
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150630154324

Steps to reproduce:

* Install Reload Plus add-on in Nightly where bug 1129957 is fixed

* Open Add-ons Manager, click through to Reload Plus' option

* Change value for "Auto-Retry Delay" to 5

* Open http://blackwind.org/temp/bugzilla-500-post-test.php

* Page sends a 500 response, Reload Plus engages it auto-retry functionality and add a countdown badge to the tab

* Press the "Post!" button

* Page is POSTed normally, Reload Plus restarts the countdown after asking for confirmation

* When countdown expires this time, Reload Plus try to re-POST using RemoteWebNavigation and fails


Actual results:

JavaScript error: resource://gre/modules/NetUtil.jsm, line 456: NS_ERROR_XPC_CANT_PASS_CPOW_TO_NATIVE: It's illegal to pas a CPOW to native code arg 0 [nsIScriptableInputStream.init]


Expected results:

Reload Plus should re-POST the document and continue auto-retrying until it doesn't encounter a 500 response.

My understanding here (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that, because the postdata I'm passing ha to come from tab.linkedBrowser.webNavigation and there's no way to access webNavigation from a content script, the postdata can only come in the form of a CPOW, so the interface need to accept CPOWs.
