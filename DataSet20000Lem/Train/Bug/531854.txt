I attempted to print a page to "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" (one of the two printer choice given in the dialog box). Once I clicked OK to start the printing, I got a dialog box:


Printing (Not Responding) [x]

Title: Join our exciting new club
Progress: Preparing... [Cancel]

I had two Firefox window open; both showed a "Not Responding". Microsoft generated the detail when I tried closing the dialog box (see Additional Information).

1. Go to a web page
2. Click File->Print
3. Choose "Microsoft XPS Document Writer", click OK
Actual Results:
Firefox hung.

Expected Results:
The page should have been sent to Microsoft XPS Document Writer for printing, or an error.
