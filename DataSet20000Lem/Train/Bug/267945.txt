When clicking link in Linux build of firefox, using Mandrake with KDE 3.2 and
custom 2.6 kernel (for ATi graphic drivers, mostly) the mouse cursor will jump
to the right hand side of the link moving about an inch. If the mouse is still
over the link after it's moved, the click will be counted, if not, it won't
(unless the movement move the cursor over another link, in which case it will
navigate to the new link, not the original one.)

This ha happened since I wa using 0.7 and ha been a problem with all
nightlies I've used and official release since then. Have tried with clean
profile on latest RC2 build. But still happens. For current build info, see the
included build dates, but only occurs in Linux (as I'm reporting on Windows machine)

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a page with hyperlink or button that redirect you to another page.
2.Click the link or button.

Actual Results:
Mouse cursor 'jumps' about an inch to the right hand side of the link,
sometimes, resulting in the link not activating.

Expected Results:
Should have navigated to the location suggested by the link and the mouse cursor
should stay still.
