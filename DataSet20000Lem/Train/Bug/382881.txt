Is a specific error when is needed to refresh all the element of the page you are seeing, after a question to a seller is submitted. This site ha close relationship with eBay and do the same things. The procedure is this: you see one article, and then need to make a question about it to the seller, using the ASK A QUESTION button. It open a new small window where you submit whatever you want to tell o ask to that seller. Then, after the OK, this window confirms you that ask a question process wa succesfull, and when you finally close this window, and back to the previous window (where is the page with the article you wa seeing) this page normally refreshes and show your question at the top of the question list. With Firefox it doesn't show your question, unless you press the F5 or Refresh Button. In Microsoft's Internet Explorer normally work well.
