Resizing the window-width lead to the navigation header overlapping when the window get too small making it hard to read the word and impossible to click some of the links. The right-hand section of the header continues to be tied to the side of the window until the minimum window size of the rest of the Google Calendar interface is reached. This did not occur on other site I visited (Amazon, for example). The rest of the Google Calendar page resizes correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open somebody's Google Calendar Account
2. Resize the window width (horizontally) until it get very narrow.
Actual Results:
The text and link in the top navigation header (problem tied to the upper right-hand section) overlap so that you cannot read them or appropriately follow the links.

Expected Results:
The text on the right should stop moving with the resize when it is a pre-determined distance (perhaps a tab's width) from the left hand text and the rest of the window should continue resizing accordingly (See the upper header on amazon.com for an example)

My computer is in standard XP configuration.
