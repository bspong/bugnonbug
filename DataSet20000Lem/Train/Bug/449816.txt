While testing locale-specific webpages, Firefox appears to leak memory on each page load, then once it hit about 150MB, it stop being able to paint the window correctly - the new page doe not appear, mousing over button make them lose their text, the window doe not update correctly, and it's impossible to close FF in any way other than killing the process (since closing the window normally pop up a dialog, which ha no button when this happens).

Restarting FF and loading the next page in the sequence resolve the issue, but after about 10-15 page load the same issue present itself.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page with a different locale/charset.
2. Load another page with a different locale/charset.
3. Repeat 10-15 times.
Actual Results:
Firefox stop drawing any widget or text, and must be killed and restarted.

Expected Results:
Pages should load correctly.
