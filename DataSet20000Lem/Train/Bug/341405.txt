accept ? %s a a command-line parameter that launch browser and run a search
From Sean Lyndersay of the Windows Vista team:

As you may or may not know, Vista ha local search capability
built-in. Many of those entry-points have a way to send the search
query to a web search engine. For a picture of what this entry-
point might look like, see the picture of the start menu on this page:

http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/foreveryone/
searchorg.mspx

As you can see, at the bottom of the start menu, there is an option
to "Search Internet" using the search term the user ha typed (in
this case "ca"). The way this feature is implemented is that the
user's default browser is launched with the string "? Searchterm"
a a parameter (i.e., a question mark followed by the string the
user ha typed so far).

What we do is pretty much the equivalent of appending "? <search term>"
to the browser's command line (which today simply doe an "I'm feeling
lucky" search in FF).

So it would be:
firefox.exe "? foo"

Technically we're using ShellExecuteEX to open the program registered
for the http protocol and then we pas "? <search term>" a the
lpParameters argument, where <search term> is replaced with the term the
user wanted to query for.

This behavior is in the latest public Vista Beta, so it should be easy
to check out (To try it out you can select "search the internet" from
Vista's Start menu, then spawn a search from there while FF is the
default browser).
