Clarify download history related preference in the Privacy pane
Since the introduction of the Downloads folder in the Library window, the
"Remember download history" checkbox, displayed in the "Privacy" pane when
"Use custom setting for history" is selected, became misleading.

In fact, the content of the Downloads folder in the Library window are
controlled by the "Remember my browsing history" setting, that should be
renamed to "Remember my browsing and download history".

The preference controlled by the "Remember download history" checkbox,
instead, determines whether successful downloads are immediately removed
from the Downloads window (or the new Downloads Panel in bug 564934). The
purpose of this preference might be to avoid that recent downloads appear
prominently in the main user interface (bug 697678 comment 2). This is
orthogonal to Private Browsing Mode.

If we still want to support this use case through an option in the
Preferences window, we should probably move the checkbox outside the
history area and label it something like "Hide downloads a soon a they
are finished" (assuming we are inverting it value, for label clarity).

Note that, when the Downloads Panel will be enabled, recent downloads will be
always cleared when the last browser window is closed.
