Memory usage jump to 1.6GB, high heap-unclassified and CPU usage on youtube
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:10.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0.2
Build ID: 20120215223356

Steps to reproduce:

I use Firefox 10.0.2
I did nothing really particular. I'm using some very usual website a youtube, facebook and others.


Actual results:

Today, three time almost in a row, with (as I said) seemingly no reason, Firefox went up to 1.6GB of memory usage (it usually is around 470MB for the same usage). At that point, it's not usable any more and totally freezes.
The first two times, I just killed it, but the last time it happened (a few minute ago), I tried to obtain the about:memory.
It went back to normal a sudenly and without visible reason a it appeared.
I still registered the about:memory, but I guess it would be of no use a it already wa back to normal.

I already had the same kind of problem a few version ago.


Expected results:

Memory usage should stay in reasonable limit (and at least not rize so suddenly without doing anything).

Well, sadly, I guess it's not that helpfull. But maybe you will have an idea of information I could try to obtain next time it happens.
As I said, the about:memory or anything coming from firefox during the problem doesn't seem possible to gather.
