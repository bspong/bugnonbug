Cross Scripting between signed and unsigned Web Pages broke

Hi,

We have developed an XPCOM Add-On which is being used by many of our customer for some while now.
This Add-On is controlled by using JavaScript in a signed HTML file and the object of this same HTML file are driven themselves by some JavaScript of an unsigned dynamically-generated web page (ASPX). We chose this solution because it is NOT possible for u to sign the dynamically-generated web pages; this would be much too complex, a we use a lot of cross scripting. Of course, we do NOT make use of cross site scripting (XSS) which we know is forbidden.
This work perfectly well in Firefox 2, but we recently discovered that this seems to be forbidden in Firefox 3. Even the usage of “unsigned” object from “signed” JavaScript seems to be prohibited.
We understand that this might involve a security issue, but this wa for u a major feature which is now broken.
How can we control an Add-On using dynamically-generated web pages? Is there another solution?

Thanks for your help.
