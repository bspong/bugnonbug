In option > setting for clearing history. After I remove tick mark under cooky it will revert to being check marked again after firefox close and open back up removing all cooky . I want all history removed except cookies. but it will not stay unchecked when i close firefox.

in fact nothing in history setting will remain unchecked

when firefox open all are tickmarked again

happened after upgrade t 3.5.2

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.go to options.
2.tickmark "clear history when firefox closes"
3.go to "settings"
4.uncheckmark "cookies".
5.close firefox
6.open firefox
7.go to "settings" "cookies" are re check marked with no user input
which is causing cooky to be removed every time ff close
Actual Results:
cooky being removed every time ff close

Expected Results:
all history being removed when firefox close "except cookies"

I have no other add-on theme
