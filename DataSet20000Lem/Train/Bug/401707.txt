I have two adminitrative account on my computer: one in English and one in Hebrew. Since they are both administrative accounts, they are on the same accessibility level and power. I downloaded firefox on the original (English) account and it work perfect fine with it.

The problem arises when I access my Hebrew account and try to access Firefox; it won't open the program. Even if I reinstall it on that account a opposed to opening it through the program file folder, it won't work at all. I temporarily converted the Hebrew account back to an English account (Vista Ultimate ha downloadable MUIs that we can switch back and fourth with) and there there wa no luck there either. It won't even work in English! The language excuse is no longer valid from my perspective; something is definitely locked within the application.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a second ADMINISTRATOR user account on Windows Vista Ultimate.
2. Either in English, Hebrew, or another language, try to open Firefox from the second Administrator account you just created.
3. It won't run, period.
