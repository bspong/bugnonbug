Aurora: Tab-related issue upon update, requires reinstall every time
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20130805 Firefox/24.0 (Nightly/Aurora)
Build ID: 20130805004006

Steps to reproduce:

The browser automatically update to the latest version (25) on launch, which seems to cause several tab-related problems.


Actual results:

When the browser launches, despite option being set to 'remember browsing history', I get a blank new tab instead of my previously open tabs. When the option is changed to open the homepage it seems to work correctly, but setting it to remember tab history fails.

Furthermore, new tab CANNOT BE CLOSED. Any new tab opened will not close when the X is clicked nor from choosing 'close' from the context menu. The only solution is to close the browser and launch it again because, of course, tab history is not remembered and thus all open tab are closed automatically.


Expected results:

I should have retained my browsing history upon launching the browser, and I should be able to close any new opened tabs. The only solution I have found is to go into my Mozilla folder and delete the Aurora folder, then reinstall. Because I have FireFox Sync enabled, after reinstalling I get my browsing history, add-ons, updated bookmark and everything back a though nothing had happened, but then the minute I close the browser and launch it again the issue repeat and I have to reinstall the product each time to continue browsing normally.
