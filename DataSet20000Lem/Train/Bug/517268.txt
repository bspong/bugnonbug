I have FireFox configured to pop up ProfileManager automatically when I start up FireFox. That creates a small 20MB (as per Windows Task Manager) process. I then select my profile and start it, which creates another FireFox.exe process that is clearly handling my browsing. The original ProfileManager firefox.exe process doe not go away and doe not go away when I quit the browser windows. I can start FireFox again with one of these invisible FireFox.exe process still running, and a new FireFox.exe ProfileManager process begin and asks me for a profile. I can start a profile, which start a browser firefox.exe process, but that second ProfileManager.exe process stick around. It will stick around even after I shut down the browser window (and the browser firefox.exe process ends). I can keep on accumulating invisible 20MB FireFox.exe processes. -- Rebooting doesn't change the behavior. Killing process doesn't stop it. Changing what profile I start doesn't alter the behavior. -- The problem doe go away if I tell profile manager not to start automatically when firefox starts. -- I only noticed this problem recently. I don't know how long I've had it. I know I had it for 3.5.1 a well a my current 3.5.2. It might have started a few day ago after an odd crash of Firefox when it said I should tell it what page not to load. It might have started when I recently installed Thunderbird or it might have been around for months. -- I'd be happy to run test code, but I can't devote time to debugging Firefox source code.
