Note: This didn't used to happen.
1st. Clicking on a link to send an email. I get redirected to my google account to send email, page status display done and will not load the page.

2nd. Google page creator, Click on a page to edit from the manager window the page attempt to load and once again status read done and will not load the page.

As I said it FireFox never used to do this, I love Firefox please see what you can do.

Also, how come there are now pop ups appearing from all over the place "advertising by DCAdds", this also never used to happen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Ensure Google is the default email manager in FF
2.Click on a link on any website to send an email (Contact u etc.)
3.FireFox should then redirect to the google create email page with the specified email address in the CC bar.
Actual Results:
once clicked on the "Contact Us" link FF is redirected. The page title is "loading...", and the status bar read "done.". The page will then not load.

(This also happens now when trying to edit page in GoglePages, the page stop loading)

Expected Results:
Google's on-line email page should be displayed allowing me to type an email and simply send it.
