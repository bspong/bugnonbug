Serious refresh/reload-page error when DNS-info changes.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; nl; rv:1.8.0.4) Gecko/20060508 Firefox/1.5.0.4

Firefox is not refreshing/reloading page or website correctly. Unfortunately this is only reproducable for people who visited that site before. The facts:
After some trouble with my registrar they put the domain on hold so it wa not reachable anymore.
After a discussion they agreed to temporarely redirecting the domain to it's real IP-address untill our dispute wa solved and normal DNS-info could be restored. However, clicking the "Refresh/Reload"-button, Firefox afterwards kept showing the registrar "error-page". In Internet Explorer all worked well and the site wa accessible again.
Only after I deleted all coockies and history it worked fine again. As of this dispute with my domain-registrar I notice a drastic decrease in visitors, probably caused because previous visitor are using Firefox and still get the stupid registrar-error message.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Not so easy reproducable because it only happens when DNS-info change



Expected Results:
Firefox should do a real refresh or reload and not rely on just coockies, cache or changed content. The best way to my humble opinion is to create an additional option which give you a possibility to choose between a complete reload of the site or just a check what ha changed since last visit.
