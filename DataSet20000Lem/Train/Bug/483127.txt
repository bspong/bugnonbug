hi,

when doing web development, the page view is diff from what deploy on Internet or the one use the ip address (substitute http://localhost:8080/somepage.htm with http://you machine ip address:8080/somepage.htm).

the font appear to be smaller, and word in <Strong> tag can't show.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a html page.
2. put in webserver.
3. retrieve it with localhost.
Actual Results:
the page show. but font size and alignment is running out. (it become smaller) try use google chrome, and u can see chrome display the localhost result correctly.

Expected Results:
the font size and alignment should be same when view in localhost or ip address (substitute http://localhost:8080/somepage.htm with http://you machine ip address:8080/somepage.htm).

if this problem can solve, would be a great help for developer (i need to switch the localhost to chrome for view the correct aligment and font size for css).
