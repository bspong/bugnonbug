Try to save a file with an underscore in the file name and either it doesn't work at all and treat the file like a folder such that it put a slash after the file name, or it try to save it a an octet-stream.
Pretty reproducible.
The same link in internet explorer work fine.
If I get rid of the underscore in the file name, it also work fine.
Compare these links, with the same file with and without and underscore in the title. The file are in the same directory on the server. Everything else is the same except the file name.

ftp://firefox:bugreport@nima.myftp.org:1357/render_final.zip
ftp://firefox:bugreport@nima.myftp.org:1357/renderfinal.zip

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Try to follow a ftp link to a file that ha an underscore in the title, I'm not sure if the login information need to be in the link to reproduce this bug.
2.
3.
Actual Results:
File treated a a directory, or firefox save it a an octet-stream

Expected Results:
To save the target file

Same link work in IE, so the problem is likely with firefox and not with the server.
