The only way to get UTF8 coded Chinese page to display properly in Firefox is to choose a Chinese font (Simsun, mssong) a the default font in Firefox. Otherwise half the entry are not seen. This is not a case of character outside the range of unicode - these are common characters. Using Arial, Times New Roman, or another unicode font should display all of the characters.

This make coding a dual language page very difficult. Font definition must be changed each time a Chinese character is entered. In my case, I simply remove the font face and allow default.

Somehow that other browser solved the problem - it can use Arial and Times New Roman to display Chinese in UTF8 - so that those people who do not have their web browser properly set to display Chinese using Chinese font can still see it. It also seems to work better if the entire page is coded in html a one of the Western unicode fonts. Then I don't have to switch font coding on and off.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. change font for Chinese under option to Arial, Times New Roman
2. look at Chinese UTF8 web page
3. now look at IE doing the same thing
Actual Results:
Chinese character disappear
