RFE:

I call this an RFE since I would prefer existing (and likely working for most people) operation of the Browser to be altered, otherwise this would be a Bug. ;)


* I suggest we need to capture the "click-on-link" in the Acrobat Plug-in to use Firefox (and NOT IE, even if that is default for the Target or the URL) to open the link.


Why:

I use Windows, that Operating System and many program work better if you set Internet Explorer a the "Default Browser" (even if you use Firefox a your "preferred Browser"). Firefox would need to be 100% identical to IE (Bugs and all) to resolve that issue.


If you have the Acrobat Plug-in for Firefox (Namoroka) installed, open an URL to a .PDF file and click on a link in the PDF then Internet Explorer will open the URL (assuming it is your Default Browser).

This mode of operation _differs_ from what one would expect had they clicked on a link in any other Tab (that you would go to that URL, (or if 'Javascripted' (etc.), that a New Window would open)).


One might argue this is a Bug, that for Accessibility reason we _must_ provide either:

1. Some mean for (visually impaired) people to know that they are on a Tab that is a PDF file and thus any link clicked on will open in a different program (unexpected ?).

2. Force link in PDFs to simply open in a new Tab (or the same Tab) in the same manner a if a link were clicked on any other Tab - do not make the HMI different for the PDF Plug-in.


Thanks,
Rob


Reproducible: Always
