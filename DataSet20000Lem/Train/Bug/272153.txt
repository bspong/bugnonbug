Bugs with Firefox when the DOM is manipulated in "onmouseup" code

OK, this bug is tricky to reproduce/notice sometimes, but it's definately there
- I've tested this in Opera and IE6 and neither have these side effects.
Here's the situation. I'm creating a JS drop-down-menu with WebDDM (my software,
found at the URL above). The submenu is supposed to open when you click on the
parent item. So I click on it, and move over a subitem - but nothing happens
when I move over. It's almost like it's "stuck" in the "clicked" position, and
you have to click on the document AGAIN before ANY event ANYWHERE will fire.

Please note in recreating this issue that this bug seems to relate to the bug I
just reported here: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=272148

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL listed above
2. Click ON THE TEXT OR IMAGE (this is important!) of the "More Info" item.
3. Move over the subitem.
4. Nothing happens!
5. Click on the subitem and move around; the onmouseover code fires, the item's
background changes, etc.

6. Click on the document a few times, move off all the menus, or just refresh
the page.
7. Click on the "More Info" item, OFF the text or images.
8. Move over the subitem
9. No side-effects!
Actual Results:
The onmouseup code ha weird side-effects.


The bug is not a problem if only "onclick" code is executed, not "onmouseup" code.

The bug is only a problem if the WebDDM.showMenu function is called from
onmouseup; the showMenu code mess with the DOM (creates some elements, make
them visible, etc)

So, it seems to me that somethings go awry when the DOM is changed while
onmouseup code is executing??
