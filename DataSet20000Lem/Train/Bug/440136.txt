A rather odd bug that I've noted on my machine, irrespective of platform (64-bit Ubuntu Hardy,32-bit Windows XP or Vista is that I find myself unable to copy an address from the address bar by highlighting it, right-clicking, and choosing «Copy» from the menu that opens. A copy can, however, be made successfully by using the «Ctrl+C» keyboard shortcut. Once such a copy ha been made it can be pasted into, e g, a text editor by the usual methods, i e, either right-clicking and choosing «Paste» or typing «Ctrl+V». Aside from the special situation of the address bar, right-clicking to copy work perfectly well ; I can, for example, copy this text to a text editor by this mean without any difficulty at all. Could this odd behaviour on the part of the address bar possibly be related to the «awesome» function ?...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Highlight an address in the addressbar and right-click.
2.Choose «Copy» from the menu that opens.
3.Right-click in an empty space in a text editor and choose «Paste».
Actual Results:
The address is *not* copied to the test editor.

Expected Results:
The address is copied to the text editor.

I'm using the respective default Firefox 3 theme in each of the setup (64-bit Ubuntu Hardy, 32-bit Windows XP and Vista) on my triple-boot machine. I do not remember having observed this problem previously, neither in the Firefox 2.x nor in the Firefox beta and release candidate builds....
