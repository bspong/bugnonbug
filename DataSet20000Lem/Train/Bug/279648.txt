Firefox open randomly new tabs, what lead the system to hand and a new window
'netscapedispatchwnd' popping up

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce




i will try to give you a description:
-it happens on load-up of firefox and during work with it.
-it seems to happen randomly, thus i found it hard to reproduce it
-it seems! to happen only on my user account (never happened on my father account)
-the course of event from my memories:
1. a new tab is opened; the site accessed changes, but they are all untrustworthy
2.a new (blank) window labeled "netscapedispatchwnd" is opened
3. the system 'hangs' (clicking anywhere on the screen(including the taskbar)
lead to no reaction)
-you might want to take alook at the attached image

i'm working on a w2k-system with firefox 1.0, all security update from
microsoft, a virus-scanner (antivir), ad-aware with ad-watch. additionally i
regulary run spybot search & destroy.
firefox's extension are adblock, tabbrowserpreferences, downthemall! and
disable target for download.

an easy workaround is to open the taskmanager via ctrl-alt-del and select
firefox from there. it work fine. however there is some
harddrive activity(coincident?), so i'd recommend closing firefox or the window
'netscapedis...' via the taskmanager ->same result.

maybe you want to google for 'netscapedispatchwnd'. there are a few who semmed
to have that bug,too.

If you have further questions, just ask :)
