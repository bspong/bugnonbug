Steps to reproduce:

I opened the Network Inspector > Clicked on the "Responsive Design Mode" button > Clicked "No throttling" > in the drop-down menu i selected "Regular 4G / LTE".

With both the Network Inspector open and the Responsive Design mode / Network Throttling set to throttle at "Regular 4G / LTE" speed, I then proceeded to open the webpage: https://www.bonnieradvocaten.nl/



Actual results:

The web-page https://www.bonnieradvocaten.nl loaded, but, according to the Network Inspector, every element of the page (HTML, CSS, JS Images etc...) including the initial HTML wa shown to be loaded twice.

I checked the server log for https://www.bonnieradvocaten.nl/ and the browser doe not actually request / fetch the element (files) for the website twice.

So Network Inspectors show everything being loaded twice when it's not being fetched/loaded twice but just once.

I'm including a screenshot of the Network Inspector so you can see what i'm writing about.


Expected results:

When Network Throttling is used and the Network Inspector is simultaneously used to measure performance. Every element of the web-page that is loaded once should correctly appear a only loaded once (and not two times).
