Using keyboard shortcuts, pressing alt-b then "B" or "M" doe not currently work
because "B" automatically open the "Add Bookmark" dialog, and "M" open "Manage
Bookmarks". Note, it should only scroll if there are other bookmark option
available with that letter, otherwise it's perfectly accectable to have the Add
Bookmarks dialog open when alt-b then b is pressed.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Add a few book mark and/or folder that start with the letter "b" and "m"
2. Close boomark addition or manangement dialog
3. Press alt-b then "b"
4. Pressing the second "b" doe not scroll through the "b" bookmarks, but
rather open the "add bookmark" dialog that is set to have "b" a it's shortcut key.

Actual Results:
The add bookmark dialog appeared.

Expected Results:
It should have scrolled through the "b" list on the bookmark menu of "add
bookmarks" (because short cut key is b for this menu item), then "baking",
"banking online", and "bar tending".

I'm not suggesting that any of the shorcut key for menu item under the
bookmark menu be changed to something other than what they are now. I am
requesting that the bookmark menu have the logic to scroll through all option
of any given character, regardless of any predefined, program-driven, menu items.

thanks keep up the great work!
