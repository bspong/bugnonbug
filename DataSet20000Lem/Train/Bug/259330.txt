Home Page (blank) prompt an HTTP-Auth dialog box
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.8

I set my Home Page a "Use Blank page". This work fine only, if I exit Firefox
(both 0.9 and 0.9.3 are doing this) while browsing a site that asks for
HTTP-Auth, once I re-open Firefox, even if I set the Home Page to "Use Blank
page", the HTTP-Auth for that site will prompt. However I enter the right or the
wrong username/password, the page will remain blank. I think Firefox is keeping
the "last visited" page and may be resuming my session to that site. Since it
request for HTTP-Auth, the Auth dialog is prompted but the Home Page still
remains blank.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set your Home Page a Blank Page
2. Access a site that request for HTTP-Auth
3. Quit Firefox once you accessed the site
4. Re-open Firefox. The HTTP-Auth box from (password protected) last-visited
site should prompt.

Actual Results:
Well, nothing harmful, only it is disturbing. This is not what I expected to get
when opening Firefox.

Expected Results:
Simply display a blank page, a I specified in my Prefs.

I'm using Firefox 0.9.3 with theme Qute 2.1.1. I didn't encounter this issue in
Mozilla (1.7.2 - same OS settings).
