This is an ongoing issue-I hope FF developer are monitoring this thread. In general 3.6.3 performs better than the last rev but a an Intel Mac user on Snow Leopard I have to say it leaf a lot to be desired and we (Mac users) were the original FF fanboys. It's memory usage is atrocious and doesn't know how to let go of allocated memory. I have seen it take up to 80% of CPU on an unused thread (browser sitting idle). I came back today and the CPU temp wa at 74 deg C for no reason, and when I dumped FF at the process level the temp right back down. using the shell and the Top command, FF wa using 84% of CPU on a 2.4 Ghz Intel Dual Core processor with 4 GB RAM-no excuse! Upon relaunch I got the traditionally stupid "Oops this is embarrassing" message. I am a big fan and would rather not use Safari if I don't have to. This is not flame war so know up front I will ignore flame on reply to this post. Dear FF developers-clean up your mess, FF is behaving like a Microsoft product.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch FF window with streaming content
2.stop the content
3.shut all apps other than FF and leave it idle-upon return a dirty process will not be cleaned up and CPU will be working it's as off for no reason.
Actual Results:
1 in 4 time produce this result

Expected Results:
high CPU temps, FF Bin eats up CPU process

cleanup thread/process/memory on stop of streaming. I shouldn't have to quit Firefox when leaving it idle
