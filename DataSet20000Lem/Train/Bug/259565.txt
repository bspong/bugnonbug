Firefox crash when viewing email (composed in Incredimail ) through Mediacom Webmail
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

When using Mediacom's webmail at https://commcenter.mchsi.com/, Firefox crash
when attempting to open any email composed with non-premium version of program:
Incedimail.

Non-premium version of Incredimail include external link to image such a
"http://www2.incredimail.com/contents/stamps/clapnuts.gif" at bottom of messages.

When doing same in Internet Explorer, clicking on email produce two identical
Security Information dialog box that ask: "This page contains both secure and
nonsecure items. Do you want to display the nonsecure items?" After clicking
yes to both boxes, message is displayed a expected.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Incredimail email program from www.incredimail.com
2.Send email to Mediacom (name@mchsi.com) email address using Incredimail
3.Attempt to view email in Mediacom Webmail at https://commcenter.mchsi.com/

Actual Results:
Firefox close abruptly and without warning. (Having multiple tab open doe
not affect Firefox's closing.)

Expected Results:
Firefox should have displayed webpage (of webmail's email message) without
crashing. Security dialog about page containing both secure and not secure
item would also be expected if browser were to not crash.

I'm willing to provide a temporary Mediacom email addres to devs who would like
it for testing purposes.
