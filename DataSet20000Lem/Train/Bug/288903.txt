mailcap nametemplate is respected in download manager, but not with helper app
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041111 Firefox/1.0

The URL above may require registration to exhibit the problem. The deal is that
the response content type is audio/x-mpegurl
In my /etc/mailcap I try to have it saved with an ".m3u" extension so that xmms
can interpret it a an mp3 url:

audio/x-mpegurl; xmms %s; nametemplate=%s.m3u

The nametemplate is not respected. I can see the file in /tmp with the name
"m3u.html" a would be a reasonable default guess from Firefox based on the URL.
It would be nice if .m3u wa appended to the filename.

The interesting aspect is that if I right click on the link and select "save
target As..." the nametemplate is respected and the dialog box correctly
suggests m3u.html.m3u a file name. However if I left click on the link and get
the dialog box that asks me whether I want to open it using some application or
save to disk, and then go for the save option, the suggested filename doe not
have the nametemplateapplied.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See detail section
Actual Results:
the file get saved with the wrong extension and xmms cannot interpret is a an
m3u file.

Expected Results:
The nametemplate in /etc/mailcap should be consistently respected for all
downloads, including for helper applications. Not just in the download manager.
