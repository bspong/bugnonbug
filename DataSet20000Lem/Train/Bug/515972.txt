I use Firefox tethered quite a bit and it go into the "work offline" mode during certain time of the day like lunch which is undoubtedly a Carrier problem.

When it doe this I can click on a button and Firefox hangs. The window that's supposed to show up "Firefox is working in offline mode" doesn't. If I right click and "Open in a new window", I get the right response where the window is brought to the front.

There are other place where the window is not brought to the front when it's opened elsewhere. Just not sure where they are and under what condition they happen.

As an enhancement, is it possible that the URL bar have a different background colr or maybe shown in italic when working offline?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Connect using a tethering program (probably ny connection will work)
2.Pull plug
3.Cause Firefox to work offline
4 I used yahoo mail and clicked on a button. If I'm luckly I'll get a response from the tethering program.
5. Firefox go in Offline mode WITHOUT any notices.
6. If I click with the option "Open in new window", I get the right response.
Actual Results:
No response

Expected Results:
Firefox brings the "Working in Offline mode" window to the front.

Firefox should indicate immediately when it go into offline mode with something: Color, Icon in address bar, italic in the address bar. Something.
