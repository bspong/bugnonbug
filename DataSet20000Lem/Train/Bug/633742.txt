User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13

(Long) Alert notice start with "Could not inialize the application's security component. The most likely cause is problem with file in your application's profile directory.....

Also, could not connect with Symantec for remote diagnostic tools, a when their Connect Me message came up with File Save, the message box disappeared when the icon wa clicked, instead of launching the remote connection. This doe not happen with the Safari browser, which I tried a a backup, so the Firefox browser is acting in a peculiar fashion. Also, when I tried to run the Norton Power eraser from their website, the download did not work because again the message box disappeared when the File Save icon wa clicked, instead of downloadinug the antivirus software.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch the Firefox browser by double clicking on the bottom left hand corner
2.
3.
Actual Results:
Behind the Alert Notice, a Firefox message come up, stating "This is Embarassing, your tab were not found" (or something close to that. After clicking OK on the alert notice panel, one can either choose "Start New Session" or "Restore", either of the option do work.

Expected Results:
When one click on "Quit and Save", it is expected that the saved tab come up when the Firefox browser is launched.

After many hour of testing for viruses, running diagnostics such a CHKDSK, Norton technician could not find anything wrong, and cocnluded that something is wrong with the browser itself (as the alert notice implies).
