Created attachment 8643666
***ACTIVE EXPLOIT*** Will send your data to Ukraine if run

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:39.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/39.0
Build ID: 20150629114049

Steps to reproduce:

Summary:

I wa visiting a news website when some ad script ran and injected an iframe that used PDF.JS's viewer.js to access file on my system (Possible Same Origin Policy bypass?). It triggered an error in view.js that I could view in the Firefox Developer Tools:

"An error occurred while loading the PDF.
PDF.js v1.1.24 (build: f6a8110)
Message: undefined" viewer.js:6023:5

The exploit script ha been attached!

Steps to reproduce (at the time of writing):

1. Visited: http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/duma-considers-anti-terrorism-bill-for-online-payments/492780.html
2. 'Ad' wa loaded in the background: http://185.86.77.48/ads.php
3. Which loaded: http://185.86.77.48/counter.php (File ha been attached to report)
4. Counter.php contained script which created an iframe and started accessing system file (/.ssh/id_rsa, known_hosts etc.), sending the content in a POST payload to: http://185.86.77.48/banner.php (with some GET parameters). It look like the script is also configured to exploit the same bug on Windows so different file may be accessed with that OS. The file that are targeted can be found in plain-text in the script.

System details:
Browser: Firefox 39.0, Mozilla Firefox for Ubuntu canonical - 1.0
OS: Ubuntu 15.04
