With Every update, Nightly becomes Slower and Less Useful
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140226030202

Steps to reproduce:

1) start Nightly (central)
2) Navigate to Any page with medium (images, ads, video, any)
3) open more than one tab or window
4) right click on anything (image, page etc) save as, properties, any function.
5) there is No real process to get to failure point other than use firefox a browser.


Actual results:

1) Firefox is increasingly Slower to a point were it becomes unusable.
2) Forget using any other app along side FF
3) begin to Push Xorg process to high 40's low 50% of CPU
4) Firefox us between high 30's to high 50% CPU
5) page scroll, eventually
6) changing tab may happen, eventually. from 10 to 90 second
7) clicking on menus, context, bookmark can take 2-3 minutes.


Expected results:

1) firefox should work a quick or quicker that it historically has.
2) firefox should be 'Better' than it wa after All these Years of working on it.
3) Firefox should work flawlessly, but it appears FF and or Mozilla have surendered to useless 'designers', theorists, office type and decided that if doesn't work right, perhaps it's better to just 'look good'...
4) Sad thing is it Neither Works or 'Looks Good'...
5) Australis Sucks! the 'menu button' is Neither a button or a menu. It's Moronic in function, placement, looks,,, in Every Way.
6) Perhaps you should have built a separate distro for 'smart phone' user and left Firefox to the workers, engineers, researcher that still use Desktops.
