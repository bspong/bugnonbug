I work in a game testing company that lock internet from it's tester so we don't play around all day. We have basic access to Mozilla website and Google. We are able to download the latest Firefox release, but not the Firefox Beta.

Once on the page (which we see only in text, no images) http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/ I can see the Download Firefox 4 link, but clicking it only load the next page, where the download will not start. Right-clicking on this link and saving the link save a link to download Firefox 3.6 instead of the proper beta.

Would it be possible to have a link within Firefox's stable release which would let u download the Beta directly, something that could bypass the Internet Lock a all site with mozilla in them do work.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. On a computer with locked internet access (Access only to Google for search and Mozilla websites)
2. Go to http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/beta/.
3. Click the Download Firefox 4 Beta link.
4. Wait at the next page.
5. Notice that the page doesn't download the beta.
Actual Results:
The beta cannot be downloaded.

Expected Results:
The beta should be more easily available through the current Firefox release.

We had to switch to Google Chrome on a certain game's database a Firefox wouldn't handle attaching the bug correctly. I'm pretty sure Firefox 4 would have handled it well, I use it at home and it's one hell of a browser. I would love if it wa more easily available to anyone already on the latest Firefox release.

Thanks for all your hard work!
