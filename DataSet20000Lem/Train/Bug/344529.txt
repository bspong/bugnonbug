This seems like a big problem, but I couldn't find it already reported. I have several bookmark folders. Lately when I click on one and then drag my mouse off the pulldown without clicking a bookmark, the pulldown and Firefox freeze indefinitely. When I bring up Task Manager, there often are multiple occurances of the same Firefox window and when I try to end the process, nothing happens. I can only go to Firefox.exe under process and select "End Process" or "End Process Tree" - and even then it take 1-2 minute before the window close (all at once). Tried rebooting, and installed 2.0 beta to try that too (same result).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click a bookmark folder until the pulldown appears.
2. Drag cursor off pulldown without selecting item.


Actual Results:
Pulldown and Firefox freeze indefinitely. When I bring up Task Manager, there often are multiple occurances of the same Firefox window.

Expected Results:
Pulldown should disappear normally.
