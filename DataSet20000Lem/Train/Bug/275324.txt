Page load of weather radar loop requires 100% CPU, much time
Upon clicking "Loop" from National Weather Service (Pittsburgh, PA) to receive a
series of 10 .GIF image of local radar, FF 1.0 peg the CPU until all 10 image
are downloaded. CPU then drop to normal and the animation play a expected.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results: CPU peg at 100% for the roughly 90 second required to load 10
images.

Expected Results: CPU peg at 100% for 10 or fewer seconds, a in Moz 1.7.3 and IE6.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Windows Task Manager
2. Start Firefox 1.0
3. Go to National Weather Service-Pittsburgh page showing local radar, a single
GIF file: http://www.erh.noaa.gov/radar/latest/DS.p19r0/si.kpbz.shtml
4. Note the time and CPU utilization to load this one image, typically 30
second for the first access, 10 second for a refresh.
5. In left pane, under "Base Reflectivity", next to "Short Range", click on
"Loop"; URL is http://weather.noaa.gov/radar/loop/DS.p19r0/si.kpbz.shtml
6. Note the time and CPU utilization to load the 10 images, typically 90 to 100
seconds.

While the elapsed time can be expected to be 100 seconds, the CPU should not be
pegged at 100% for that time. In both Moz 1.7.3 and IE6, elapsed load time
were comparably 90 to 100 seconds, but 100% CPU lasted only about 10 seconds.

I compared the load time with Mozilla 1.7.3 and I.E. 6.0. CPU peg for much
longer, and elapsed time is also much longer. [Soon-To-Be] Attached are screen
