Hello,
I am having the following problem. Today I downloaded Mozilla 1.0.7 and
installed it (Dutch version). I started it, it started to load the start page
(which is http://start.mozilla.org/firefox?client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:nl-
NL:official) and then, it happend. A dialog pop up which says: Het verbinding
maken met www.google.com werd geweigerd. Transluated it would be: Making
connection with www.google.com ha been dennied (but, if it is possible, get
someone else to translate it for you, because maybe, there is a better
translation possible).

I like using Mozilla Firefox very very much, so could you figure out what the
problem is?

Yours sincerly,
Roy van Hees
