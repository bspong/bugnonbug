While using drag and drop to sort my bookmark in a folder 3 level deep the drop indicator (little black line that show where your bookmark will land) show up in the second level sub folder.

Sorting still happens correctly according to where the mouse is placed.
For example I add a link to the folder Bookmarks->Break->Comics. Then go into the folder and click and drag to sort it. The little black line will show up in the Break folder even though the mouse is over the Comics folder. When I drop the new link it will drop correctly, it's just the visual indicator that's out of place.

Of note it doe this to me in my folder for news and comics. Without letting the bookmark menu close and reopen it will work correctly in my Games and Shows folder (all folder mentioned are 3 level deep).

All these bookmark folder have been around for a long time and seen many a firefox upgrade.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bookmark folder 3 level deep
2. Assign bookmark to the first second and third level
3. Attempt to drag and drop item around and watch the indicator
Actual Results:
Works for some folders, but not for others...
Folders it gave abnormal behavior for were named Break->Comics and Break->News.
Folders it worked correctly for were Break->Shows and Break->Games.

Expected Results:
Line should've shown up between the item that my mouse wa hovering between.

I'm using AdBlock, FlashBlock, and ScriptBlock.
This is a set of bookmark that's been around for year and seen many import exports, user account swap and many firefox upgrades.
Good luck with tracking this down, and sorry I couldn't provide a 100% test case.
