Mozilla crash on random dialog box (i.e. http authorization prompts,
find/findnext prompts, warning prompts) - the only warning that this will occur,
is a loss of url autocomplete functionality.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch mozilla
2. Visit some web site
3. keep visiting website
4. eventually, autocomplete for url stop working, then the next dialog box that
pop up will freeze/crash the browser.

Actual Results:
After url autocomplete stop working, Buttons in the dialog box stop working.
The dialog box will not close/minimize. If the dialog box is freefloating
(find/findnext), it can be dragged offscreen and the browser still used. If
the dialog box is achored to the browser window, the browser is fully unusable.

Expected Results:
Allowed me to click on buttons.
