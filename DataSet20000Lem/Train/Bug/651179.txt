In the process of bookmarking new pages, bogus entry are inserted into the "most recently used" list. It's not clear whether the name of these bogus entry correspond to Windows file system folder of Firefox bookmark folders. Regardless they were not been selected in the process of saving any bookmark thus they should not be displacing existing valid entry in the already pathetically inadequately short "most recently used" list.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Happens frequently but it's not clear what trigger it. Perhaps selecting a bookmark folder from the long list of folder also cause the bogus entry to be inserted.

3.

This problem immediately emerged when I updated from 3.5.3 to 3.6.12. I thought for sure that when I updated to 3.6.16 that something a obvious a this would go away but clearly I expect too much considering the rate at which you folk create new bug and the rate at which you fix old ones.

It's too bad you folk are so committed to relegating Firefox to the browser scrap heap by the poor support you give to fixing bugs. I guess it's just not glamorous enough to fix existing bug when you can have the glory of creating new one instead in the process of adding unnecessary bell and whistles.
