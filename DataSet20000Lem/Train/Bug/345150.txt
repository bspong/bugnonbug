Middle clicking item in "Recently Closed Tabs" close the menu but take no action. This force the user to start again.

Other menu item which have no middle-click action don't close the menu.

Either an action should be taken (such a opening the item in a new tab) or the menu should remain open. This is for consistency with the behaviour of other menu items.

For example:
- Menu item which point to bookmark or history item load in new tab when middle clicked
- Other menu item such a those in the file or edit menu do nothing when middle clicked. The menu stay open. This provides clear feedback to the user that middle click ha no purpose here, but doesn't irritate the user by forcing them to start over.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close one or more tabs.
2. Middle-click an item in History -> Recently Closed Tabs


Actual Results:
Menu disappears and no new tab are opened

Expected Results:
A new tab should be opened containing the item the user middle-clicked on. If for some reason we decide we don't want user to be able to middle-click those items, then the menu should remain open.

This is very similar to enhancement #344140, although this bug point out that the menu closes, forcing the user to start again.
