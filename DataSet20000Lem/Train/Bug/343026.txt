Trying to change the property of a DIV tag fails because "xxx ha no properties". It ha property defined by a "class=" item for a CSS definition.
Firefox is the only browser where this fails to work.
This work in IE 6, Netscape 8.1 and Opera 9.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Select a radio button choice.
2.Click the Judge button to submit the form. The answer is marked with an image made visible by changing the property of the DIV tag to indicate if the answer is correct or wrong. The error occurs when trying to change the property.
3.

Actual Results:
No image is displayed.
The form is not submitted.
The only indication of a problem appears in the JavaScript Console window.
This is used in a training application and the student cannot submit result of a test and therefore cannot continue with the training. All test answer are lost

Expected Results:
The image showing the image for either a right or wrong answer is revealed.

It should work a other browser do.
Because this is used in an online-training application, the student cannot possibly use Firefox for the course. They can never submit answer to a test to pas a training module.
This problem is only critical if your employer only allows the use of Firefox with no other web browser available.
