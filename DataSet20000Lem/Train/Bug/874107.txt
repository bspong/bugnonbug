Steps to reproduce:

Hi. I am a web designer and I just upgraded from XP to 8 and first overall problem I had wa ClearType in the entire OS. So I disabled ClearType in the Windows 8 Control Panel setting and I also deselected 'Smooth edge of screen fonts' from Visual Effects tab and noticed that the later one disables antialiasing/smoothing/ClearType for web font on Firefox. Which mean it render all fonts, default and web font without any smoothing/antialiasing effect, which is bad. Default font should be rendered a sharp font and web font should be rendered a they supposed to be (with antialiasing effect). I cannot enable that setting in the Windows option just for that, because it enables smooth effect on the entire OS and it kill me. Windows XP doesn't have that ClearType crap and it all work fine, why can't they do the same with 8?

Also my about:config setting gfx.font_rendering.cleartype.use_for_downloadable_fonts is set to true which I suppose mean that it should render web font with antialiasing cleartype effect.

I am using Firefox 21.0 with Windows 8 Pro x64.


Actual results:

ClearType do not work for web fonts. Windows setting override Firefox.


Expected results:

Web font should be rendered with ClearType a set in the about:config options.
