I created this website very recently. The particular flash comic on that page is set to a vertical size of 200%. IE is able to expand the size to twice the size of the user's browser (200%) to make it readable like a comic. Firefox doe not allow me to expand it to over 100%.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Embed flash movie with percentile value over 100% vertical size instead of pixel values.
2. Upload page.
3. View page in Firefox.
Actual Results:
The flash movie doe not go beyond 100% vertical size.

Expected Results:
It should display the flash video at 200% the user vertical size causing the user to scroll down to see the rest.

The tag is written:

<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E..." width="95%" height="200%">
<param name="movie" value="../53.swf" />
<param name="quality" value="high" />
<embed src="../53.swf" width="95%" height="200%"></embed>
</object>

If needed you can look at some of the other page that are linked from the mentioned page in IE and firefox to see the difference in display sizes.
