firefox is caching after being disabled
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I have disabled caching using about:config several ways, [browser. cache. disk.
enable to false] [browser. cache. memory. capacity to 0] [browser. cache.
memory. enable to false] and finally adding C:\Program Files\Mozilla
Firefox\defaults\profile\user.js file to read
user_pref("browser.cache.memory.enable", false);
The user.js file "did" stop the caching for 2 weeks, even though disablig cache
using about:config did not?. It is imparitive that this machine doe not cache
due to financial software it runs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Problem ha returned on it own
2. Removing user.js file prior to the problem coming back
3.

Actual Results:
I have done everything I have been able to find regarding this issue. The user
ha to clear cache using Tools > Options > Privacy > Clear Cache to use the
financial software, else Firefox fill in field from cache. Clearing the cache
clear the fields.

Expected Results:
No caching at all.

Using default theme. Default install, default theme on update each time. No
additional software used in conjunction with Firefox on office machines.
