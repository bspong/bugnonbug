SSL element (or other) being cached when browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl = false

When loging into http://www.scotiaonline.com it allows first time without
incident. If the browser is closed and re-opened and a second attempt is made
to login to the site it fails looping back to the start page with no error. To
solve this I must go to another website, close scotiaonline.com and use clear
all in privacy options. Note: tried doing clear cache only and doe not work.
Once clear all ha been used loging in is possible once again. This can be
easily reproduced, however may be difficult to solve a it is a bank's website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to scotiaonline.com
2. Close browser
3. Re-open browser
4. Login to scotiaonline.com again

Actual Results:
Fails, loop back to initial login page, no error message.

Expected Results:
Logged into site.

Notes: I believe this to be a problem with the code recognizing a previous
version of the site or some of it session information still being stored in the
browser memory, because this is a problem with a highly secured site and may
relate to SSL being cashed I upped the severity, other than that it is easily
correctable and only result in minor loss of function.
