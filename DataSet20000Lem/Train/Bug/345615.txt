Can't log in to yahoo using Firefox (but IE works)
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: firefox 1.5.0.4

I love Firefox and always been using it. Suddenly since last week, I cannot log into Yahoo thru Firefox. All other website which ask for username/password are working fine except for Yahoo in Firefox. I uninstalled firefox and downloaded the latest version, it didnt help. Found no problem logging into Yahoo in IE. So, uninstalled the latest Firefox and tried installing the earlier version of Firefox 1.0.1, 1.0.3, 1.0.7. This didnt help either. Tried contacting Yahoo for help, got answer that problem is with Firefox.

Please do something about this bug. With different Yahoo account at hand, I tried all with no success to check my email, to play games, or to see my pic online. For time being Internet Explorer is the rescue.
