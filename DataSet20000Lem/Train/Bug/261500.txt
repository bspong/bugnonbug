Javascript will not run while page is stuck loading bad ad server slowly.

This is not a crash. Just an annoyance I've found on site with ad banners.
Firefox will not excecute JavaScript until all ad-banners are loaded. Sometimes
these banner are on slow servers, and it's unpleasant to wait for it to let me
click a link.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to newgrounds.com, or any other side with many ad-server connection
2. click on a movie.
3. click on the "Play this movie" button before it finish loading the annoying
ad-banners.

Actual Results:
The javascript command to create a new window doe not run, and the page hang
in loading pretty bad.

Expected Results:
In Internet Explorer, the javascript will run and create the movie window, even
when the page is only partially loaded. SP2's update make it block popups, but
not this one that wa requested by a mouse click.

Firefox doe not do a good a job at connecting to multiple server at once on
the same page a Internet Explorer does. Because of this, it is often difficult
to use javascripted button on site with many ad banners. Javascripts should
be read and active when the html format is read, rather than waiting until all
image are loaded. It is improving, though. In earlier versions, image would
only load in order, and ad-banners could potentially slow down everything.
