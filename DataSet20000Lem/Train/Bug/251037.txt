Consistently prompted to install Google toolbar for IE whenever linking to third-party site from Outlook
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

Apologies if this is listed elsewhere, but I looked for more than an hour using
a variety of keywords and didn't see it.

I'm using Firefox 0.9.2. I also have IE 6.0.2800 with the Google toolbar installed.

When I'm in Firefox, with or without IE being open, whenever I link to a URL
from a message Outlook or to a third party link from any web site, I get a
dialog box "Google Toolbar Installer for Windows NT/2000/XP - (English 2.0.110
big/en)" prompting me to install the Google toolbar for IE.

It's not a critical bug, but it sure is annoying and I can't figure out how to
stop it. Please advise.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have IE with Google toolbar
2. Open Firefox
3. Set Firefox a default browser
4. Open Outlook or any web page
5. Click a link to a third party site (not an internal link)


Actual Results:
Dialog box window appears prompting installation of Google toolbar for IE

Expected Results:
Nothing except take me to the third-party link.

None.
