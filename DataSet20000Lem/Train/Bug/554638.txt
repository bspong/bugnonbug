Hi,

If you're in a hurry: open firefox twice from the quickstart area of window xp and see for yourself ;) otherwise read below...

I launch two time firefox inside the registry 'RUN' regkey of window xp (Startup Launch).

Since i've upgraded to this new version, one of the window doesn't open the way it should (tabbed/minimised on the desktop + not displaying the website requested a a parameter (or homepage)).

The same issue appears when you have firefox in window quick start taskbar. You click twice to open firefox, two window open but one is deficient.

Have a good day.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox twice (doubleclick quickstart area twice)
2.OR add firefox with a parameter (webpage) twice (or more) in window startup registry key.
3.

Expected Results:
One window open fine, the other is deficient... read above
