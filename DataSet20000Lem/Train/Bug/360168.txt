Firefox 1.5.0.8 or 2.0 running on a Mandriva 2006.0 Linux server
displayed to a remote screen over a putty
ssh tunnel to a Starnet Xwin 4.0.1 X11 server on Windows XP.

The various slider bar in the program work a expected EXCEPT for
the one in the File->Open File... dialog. Over this connection pathway
that one slider bar won't budge for any mouse click or drag on it. If the
desired file is present in the scrolling region it can be selected and opened,
but if it is off the bottom, there is no way to scroll to it. I tested
all button on the mouse (click and drag) and clicked on the up and down
arrows. However this slider work fine for a similar pathway, which is

firefox (linux) <- ssh tunnel (openssh)-> X11 server linux.

xev show the expected event over the same pathway were firefox's
Open File... scroll bar fails.

Note, the scroll bar look normal. The size of the bar change with the number
of file which exist in the scroll list (the more the smaller the scroll bar).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Xwin 4.0.1 on Windows XP
2. ssh connection XP -> Mandriva 2006 linux box, enable ssh tunnel
3. bash shell (probably irrelevant)
4. rxvt & (probably irrelevant)
6. firefox, then file -> Open file... and try to scroll in the file system.



Actual Results:
Result, scroll bar won't budge.

Expected Results:
Scroll bar should have scrolled, revealing more files.

Nothing special done to firefox, the only plugins are java, acrobat
reader, and flash. The theme is whatever the default is.
