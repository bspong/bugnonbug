In Firefox 1.5 the Virtools display area could gain focus (similar to a Flash or Shockwave game). In 2.0 it doesn't seem to happen.

The problem that arises from this is game that use the arrow keys. The keypress event are captured by the game and everything work correctly. However, they are also captured by the browser. If the browser isn't maximized the arrow key control the vertical and horizontal scroll bar making the game virtually unplayable.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch the URL in Firefox 2.0
2. Install the Virtools plugin (restart Firefox if necessary, then navigate back to URL)
3. Launch the GT Racing game and make sure the browser is not maximized (vertical or horizontal scroll bar should be visible)
4. Start a race and press up, down, left, or right.

Actual Results:
The scroll bar also capture the keypress event and make the game hard (almost impossible in some cases) to follow.

Expected Results:
The game window should have focus a do Flash / Shockwave games, preventing the keypess event from being captured by the browser.

This ha been reproducible on every Firefox 2.0 installation I have tested on.
