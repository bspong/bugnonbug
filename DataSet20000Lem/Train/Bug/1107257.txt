Steps to reproduce:

At the web site of the bank ING-DiBa.de using Firefox I generated a 2 page PDF file to transfer some company share to this bank. The completed file wa then displayed in a new Firefox window using the Firefox internal browser.



Actual results:

1st error: Where in the text of the PDF file 'tt' occured, instead of this letter I saw a blank space at the display.
2nd error:
Using the 'print' option of this Firefox browser, a lot of letter and other sign are not printed. For example instead of 'ft' a part of a word a rectangle.
But there occured a lot of rectangle also instead of other sign like 'm', 'll', ...
So a lot of sentence of the document are not readable.
I stored the file.
But a part of the content is strictly confidential.
I displayed it then with the Adobe Reader: all is perfect!
And it ist also printed perfectly.
(If wished, I could try to generate a new file with random number and names.)


Expected results:

The Firefox PDF reader should display the PDF file correctly and also print it so.
