Firefox disappearing window elements.png

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140212131424

Steps to reproduce:

On Windows 7 Enterprise w/ Service Pack 1 (Dell laptop, Intel core i7-3740QM @ 2.7 Ghz, 8GM RAM) using Firefox 27.0.1, I open multiple window and switch between them a I do my work. I have just 2 add-ons:
1) LastPass 3.x add-on installed and active
2) Adobe Acrobat - Create PDF 1.2 is installed but disabled


Actual results:

On a regular basis (after 20 to 60 minutes) I'll notice that some window loose most of their upper title bar a well a the close, minimize, and maximize buttons. While I can grab the "invisible" top of the window to move the window around and even resize it, the close, minimize, and maximize button do not function even if I click where they should be. When resizing the window the button and window bar will appear briefly in a fluttering fashion but quickly disappear when dragging stops. Generally not all Firefox window are like this all at the same time but several become this way after behaving normally at first. While this happens very regularly on my machine I have not yet figured out the precise sequence that cause this to occur. The fluttering appearance only happens when I drag the top window edge down (not up) and the bottom window edge up (not down). Resizing by the left and right edge in either direction cause similar but different fluttering appearance behaviors.

In the attached file, the purple area are the part of the window that have turned 100% invisible.


Expected results:

Window bar and button should remain visible and function.
