I attended the University of Missouri-Columbia, they use "Microsoft Outlook Web
Access" "Provided by Microsoft Exchange Server 2003". The error is can be
reproduced. The error is when I write respond to an email, then add an
attachment, while the attachment window is open and I try to open a new process
of Firefox, I can enter in addresses, open menu such a file, edit, bookmarks,
etc. but the page I type in or click on bookmark do not open. The browser
just sits there.

cannot browse any other pages.

Cannot browse any other pages, bookmark toolbar doesn't load, I type in a web
