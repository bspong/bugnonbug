Create two custom Try build for User Diary Study
We are conducting a user research diary study from 9/2 to 9/4, with followup interview afterward. The primary objective are to 1. Compare the "A" list to the "B" list, and 2. see whether user find the new PBM (with TP) to be an improvement on the old.

We will need 2 custom Try build to provide to study participants.
1. One build will have the existing blocklist, the "A" list (the standard Disconnect list, which doe not include Content category)
2. One build will have the "B" list (the full Disconnect list including Content category)

For each of the two build above, we also need:
* The entity whitelist working on both.
* To manually turn on the UI tour in both builds. This is accomplished by (comment 2) in bug 1190447. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1190447#c2
* Each test build must create a new user profile. The participant will be existing Fx users. We need to make sure they don't have interfering add-on (i.e. adblockers) running, and we also don't want to interfere with their existing profiles.
* We need to test all of the above for both build (A/B): each ha the correct blocklist, working entity whitelisting, the UI tour activated, and that it creates a clean profile.
