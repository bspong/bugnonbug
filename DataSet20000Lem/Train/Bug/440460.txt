The following property of the revised bookmark menu are bothering me:

Folders in the right pane do not have the "+" handle attached anymore (which is a state-of-the-art feature of a folder icon).
So to open them, you have to double-click (which implies increased
wrist pain; double click should not be enforced in frequent user interaction).

The "Bookmarks Menu" in the left pane is moved one hierarchy level down with no good reason, which mean there is le space in this pane which is quite narrow anyway in default and most peoples' setting. It's just a waste of space. Bad UI design.

And finally, when revamping the bookmark window, the feature of labelled separator (via Properties) wa forgotten to be maintained.
See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=381767#c2, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=404983#c9, https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=404990
It is absolutely incomprehensible that an established feature which is valuable for many user is discarded and complaint are constantly ignored with the excuse that some developer happen not to be interested in it.

I hope these deficiency will be revised before final release; especially for the last item I consider this at least major.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
For item 1: look at bookmark window, right pane, folders.
For item 2: look at bookmark window, left pane, left blank gap·
For item 3: import a Firefox 2 bookmark separator with a "Properties" name attached - information is lost!
Actual Results:
User interface is worse than it was.

Expected Results:
User interface should improve, not get worse.
