When clicking to the left of a div with styling applied such that it ha overflow set to hidden and which contains only child with "FLOAT" style applied to them (for example, all child are float:left) will select all of the text and image within that parent div.

A positive left margin help the repro by giving more area to click next to but is not necessary. Additionally this seems to repro with overflow set to pretty much anything other than "visible" (auto, scroll, etc).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a container div with style {overflow:hidden; margin-left:20px;}
2. Create a child div within the first div with some text content and style {float:left}
3. Click to the left of that div
Actual Results:
The text entered in the child div is highlighted/selected. This is true no matter how many child divs are inside the parent div or what the float styling of any element within those first level child divs are.

Expected Results:
Text and content should not highlight (as is the case when clicking to the right).
