'Reload Page' button (below video window) work on IE 6.0 but give 'Server Error' on Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20061010 Firefox/2.0

On the right of this page about 2/3 down is a video window showing traffic conditions. Below that video window is a 'Reload Page' button (not the browser reload button). Clicking this 'Reload Page' button in IE 6.0 reloads the entire page a it should. But clicking this 'Reload Page' button in Firefox give a "Server Error in '/' Application." and "The resource cannot be found." error page.

I can reproduce this problem consistently with IE and Firefox side by side.

This work fine using IE 6.0.

Clicking the Firefox 'Reload current page' button work fine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Goto http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Traffic/seattle/video/i405_sr169.htm#cam
2. Below the video window (on right and about 2/3 down this page) click the 'Reload Page' button below the video window (not the browser 'Reload current page' button).
3.

Actual Results:
The page is not reloaded. Instead there is a page with the following text:

Server Error in '/' Application.

The resource cannot be found.

Description: HTTP 404. The resource you are looking for (or one of it dependencies) could have been removed, had it name changed, or is temporarily unavailable. Please review the following URL and make sure that it is spelled correctly.

Requested URL: /Traffic/seattle/video/SeattleMapandVideo-lowcam.aspx
