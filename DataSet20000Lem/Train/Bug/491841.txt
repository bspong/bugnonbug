Problem displaying Flickr page on some Windows XP system

On some Windows system (XP and Vista, 32- and 64-bit) it ha been observed that the following web page:
http://www.jurjevic.org.uk/photography/flickr/fliter/1.htm

doe not display properly (not a single thumbnail is displayed) when viewing with Firefox 3.0.8, 3.0.9, 3.0.10 or 3.1 Beta 3 (listed only version which were tested). The system which suffer from this problem also show problem displaying other Flickr pages, say this one (most of the image are not displayed):
http://www.flickr.com/photos/13816725@N04/

It is likely a bug in Firefox, a say IE 8 doe not show the problem. I failed to find out what is the cause (disabling all of my add-on did not help). Firefox 2.0.0.20 doe not show the problem. There are Windows XP system where this problem doe not show (failed to figure out in what way these system are different from the one where I am having the problem).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. try to load or refresh the http://www.jurjevic.org.uk/photography/flickr/fliter/1.htm in Firefox 3.0.8, 3.0.9, 3.0.10 or 3.1 Beta 3 and if no thumbnail appears you have reproduced the problem

Actual Results:
no or most image are not displayed on the web page

Expected Results:
all of the image are expected top be displayed on the web page

I marked Severity to be "Major: A major feature is broken" a http://www.flickr.com/ is rather popular and important service on the Internet, and some people (including me) may consider stop using Firefox because of that (switching to some other web browser, say IE 8 doe not show the problem)
