After installing Minefield 3.7a4pre (Build 20100321), Windows XP SP3 refused to work correctly after restarting the system, and only did when the browser wa uninstalled completely.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Minefield 3.7a4pre (Build 20103021) on Windows XP SP3
2. Restart the system
3. Try to do what you would normally do in Windows XP SP3

Actual Results:
Trying to access the display property via the desktop (Right-click/Properties) wouldn't work at all.

The Start button would wouldn't work at all.

Trying to access any program by clicking on it shortcut completely wouldn't work.

Trying to do a Ctrl-Alt-Delete just froze the computer.

Expected Results:
Everything on Windows XP SP3 should work the way it supposed to.

When I installed Minefield 3.7a4pre (Build 20103021) via a ZIP file, I found that going into safe mode, deleting the folder that I extracted the content of the ZIP file to, and restarting got everything back to normal. If the program wa installed via an EXE file, though, I found that uninstalling Minefield wasn't enough, and that I had to do a system restore, on top of that, to get everything working again.
