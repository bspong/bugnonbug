I created a php function (see additional information) and everytime the page loads, the function is recalled 5 times. Everytime I swap tab between another page and the page with the function on it, the function is recalled again, eventhough the page itself is not reloaded. Although tested with Internet Explorer 6 the page only recall the function 1 time and thing work perfect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See additional information for an example function.
Actual Results:
The session start with 0.
The session is increased by 5 the first time you load the page, or when you hit refresh.
The session is increased by 1 everytime you swap tab with another page (i.e. a tab with google.com).

Expected Results:
The function should only be recalled once in the entire pageload, and never when swapping between tabs.
In our case we where creating a visitor counter and we ran into this problem.

Function used:

<?php
session_start();
function counterTest(){
$_SESSION['counter'] = $_SESSION['counter'] + 1;
echo $_SESSION['counter'];
}
counterTest();
?>
