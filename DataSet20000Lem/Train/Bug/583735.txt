Dragging link to between tab no longer open link in new tab between those tab
Up to Firefox 3.6, it wa possible to duplicate the active tab by dragging the favicon from the Awesomebar to a space between tab or to the end of the tabstrips. In Firefox 4, dragging to between tab no longer ha the desired effect (it will instead replace the content of one of the tab the mouse is between with the content of the active tab). Dragging to the end of the tab bar still works, but the ability to duplicate a tab to a specific place on the tab bar is lost.

The same problem applies to dragging bookmark from the Bookmarks toolbar, menu, or side panel to the tab bar, and more importantly; when dragging link from an open page to the tab bar. The blue arrow for creating a new tab only show up when dragging to the very end of the tab bar, so a new tab can only be created with the wanted context at the end of the bar. I used this feature (especially the ability to drag link to the tab bar and open a new tab from them at that specific location) a lot, so it absence is quite annoying now.

Steps to reproduce (1):
1. Open 2 tabs.
2. In one tab, load a page that contains a link.
3. Drag the link to the tab bar, between the 2 existing tabs.

Steps to reproduce (2):
1. Open 2 tabs.
2. Load a page in one tab.
3. Drag the favicon from the location bar to the area between the 2 tabs.

Steps to reproduce (3):
1. Open 2 tabs.
2. Drag a bookmark from the Bookmarks menu or the Bookmarks Toolbar to the space between the 2 tabs.

Expected results:
A new tab is opened between the 2 existing tabs, containing the target of the link (1), a copy of the active page (2), or the target of a bookmark (3).

Actual results:
Rather than creating a new tab, one of the 2 tab will be overwritten with the content that should appear in the new tab.
