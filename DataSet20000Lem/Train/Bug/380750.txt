When I customize the Google toolbar and add separator to it, everything seems fine. But when I open a new window, all of the separator appear right after the first one placed. I've tried customizing and then immediately quitting Firefox to see if that would solve the problem, but it doesn't. I also tried changing the view from icon (which is what I am using for viewing) and text to see if that would help Firefox remember where the separator go, but this didn't help, either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open new page
2.Pull down Toolbars/Customize from View menu.
3.Place separator between icon in the Google toolbar.
4.Click "Done."
5.Open new browser window.
6.Notice separator are in the wrong place and gnash teeth.
7.Pray that some kind soul will manage to fix the problem because you love Firefox and the really cool thing like multiple toolbars and adding separator that the program designer have decided to include in the best browser on the planet.
Actual Results:
The separators, alas, are all lined up neatly one after the other.

Expected Results:
The separator should be separating bookseller icons, other shopping icons, reference icons, and tool icons.

Even if this doesn't get fixed for a while, I am in love with Firefox's creators. Any chance one of the male designer would consider a marriage proposal? (kidding)
