wide text block that end near the right side of the window overflow the window by a few characters. If I widen the window the text block widens too. It's a if someone specified width=105%.

It happens for me even on this bug form with some of the long lines. The renderer seems to notice this and creates a scroll bar at the bottom of the window.

BTW I'm talking about simple English too.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. almost any page that flow to the right edge of the window
2. Mostly not on page that have been heavily crafted
3.
Actual Results:
The text block that go to the right edge of the screen wrap but with a few letter too long for the screen. To read I often have to scroll to the left and right. Changing the window width doesn't help. The text rewaraps to some imaginery 105% each time.

Expected Results:
The text is all visible in the window.

I couldn't find a similar bug report but it's such a hard thing to describe perhaps it is described differently.

I can send a small screen dump a an example.
