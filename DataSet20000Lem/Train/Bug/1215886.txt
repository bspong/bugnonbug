Styling `select > option` with many option may hang or crash browser
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/47.0.2526.16 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Applied CSS to `select > option` like say a background-color and a border.
Created a select element with many option in a form like say, a list of all country on Earth.
Opened the page in Firefox and clicked on the drop down element.


Actual results:

The browser would freeze and hang indefinitely and need to be forcibly quit or crash depending on available per process host memory. Small menu with 3-4 element appear to be fine and the style are applied to correctly. No testing ha been done, if this is exploitable to run arbitrary code not exposed via the JavaScript VM or retrieve information from the browser process that would otherwise be inaccessible. The issue present on all major platform the desktop browser will run on. No testing on mobile browser ha been done. If multiple tab are open, they will become inaccessible or terminated with the main browser process. It is possible for a man-in-the-middle device to inject code into a browser which cause this behavior, say via unsecured Wi-Fi, or direct people to a webpage with such code on it.


Expected results:

The drop down menu should have opened in under one second and the option show with a scroll bar, if they are too plentiful to fit on screen.
