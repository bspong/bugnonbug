(May be related to Bug 344569 ). I have a link to a local .htm file in my personal toolbar. If I rightclick this link and "open in new window", a new window opens, with two tabs. The first tab contains (untitled) blank. The second tab take longer (DNS request delay) and result in a "Server not found" error message: "Firefox can't find the server at www.yahmail.htm." The local file doe not load. The link to the local file = file:///c|/yahmail.htm

If I select "open in new tab", the local file open without a hitch. The link also work perfectly with a single navigation click (opening in existing window.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start Firefox.
2.Rightclick on link in Personal Toolbar Folder to local file.
3.Select "Open in new window."

Actual Results:
A new window opens, with two tabs. The first tab contains (untitled) blank. The second tab take longer (DNS request delay) and result in a "Server not found" error message: "Firefox can't find the server at www.yahmail.htm." The local file doe not load.

Expected Results:
The local file should open, in a single new window (no tabs).

This error ha persisted through all Firfox update to date. Clicking on the link again (in the 2nd tab, with error message) open the local file without a hitch. Removing one of the slash in the link (link = file://c|/yahmail.htm ) doe not change results.
