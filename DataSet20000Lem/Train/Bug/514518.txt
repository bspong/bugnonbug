email contact won't highlight when using "create a group email"

As soon a Firefox upgraded to 3.5.2, I could no longer manipulate the "Create a Group" function in my email contact list. When clicking on a name to transfer into a group email box, it will not highlight. Or when I wanted to remove a name from a group, it will not highlight. A technician suggested a "downgrade" to 3.5.1 to fix the problem. It didn't work either. Another technician at my email provider suggested I downgrade even more to 3.0.10 which we just did. It works! However...I'm no longer upgraded with Firefox. Can you fix your upgrade?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Log into email "Contacts"
2.Click on "create a group" or onto an existing group.
3.Click a name to add to a group or to remove from a group. The name WILL NOT HIGHLIGHT.
Actual Results:
The contact name will not highlight.

Expected Results:
I expect the name to highlight so that I can move it to the appropriate location.

How do I know that this is a Mozilla Firefox problem???
Because...the "group" function work perfectly on Safari and on Internet Explorer!!

I prefer to use Firefox on my computer. Please fix. Thank you.
