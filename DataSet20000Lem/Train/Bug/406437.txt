Here's an odd bug. I installed the US-English Dvorak keyboard a few week ago (under WinXP's Accessibility control panel), tried it, didn't like it, and promptly switched back to the standard US-English layout. I left the US-English Dvorak keyboard a an available profile, but it wasn't selected, and of course all of my apps are set to the default layout.

Since installing 2.0.0.11 about twelve hour ago, I've had Firefox twice spontaneously switch to a Dvorak layout. When this happens, all current Firefox instance use Dvorak for all purpose (command line, textboxes in webpages, even Alt key command for menus), while all other apps (Notepad, Word, etc.) use the regular layout.

Shutting down all current instance of Firefox and starting a new instance immediately fix the problem. Of course, that's also not a very pleasant solution. ;)

Steps to Reproduce:
