Firefox asks a confirmation message when trying to close just one tab: "You are about to close 1 tab. Are you sure you want to continue?"
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Usually when the user try to close a series of tabs, user is warned a "You are about to close x tabs. Are you sure you want to continue?"
Bottom of the message you can see "Warn me when I attempt to close multiple tabs".
This message is supposed to be only when closing multiple tabs. But there is a minor bug where it give a warning when you try to close 1 tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox browser and keep 2 tab open.

2. Right click on one tab and click "Close other tabs".
Actual Results:
User get a message saying "You are about to close 1 tab. Are you sure you want to continue?" On the bottom of the message still you can see "Warn me when I attempt to close multiple tabs" check box already checked.

Expected Results:
Got a message saying "You are about to close 1 tab. Are you sure you want to continue?" On the bottom of the message still you can see "Warn me when I attempt to close multiple tabs" check box already checked.

Either:
The message stating "You are about to close 1 tab" should not be displayed,

OR

There should not be a checkbox at the bottom of the message saying "Warn me when I try to close multiple tabs" since it doe not match with the user's action of closing one tab.
