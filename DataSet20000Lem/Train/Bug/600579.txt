slow start up and slow to close down

I am having issue with old (initially) installs slowing down a newer update were installed. Also having issue with the part of the EXE file not completely shutting itself down when closing Firefox, i.e. still getting warning that Firefox is already running, and finding it still running when accessed with task manager. Getting the warning of already running is not consistent, however.
Since I am the Tech Support for a small University I have had a situation where Firefox would grab over 90% of the resource causing the machine to almost grind to a halt.
In both situations, I finally completely did a complete uninstall and re-install of the browser. Checking the \common files\Mozilla folder and the \Program Files\Mozilla folder and deleting them if necessary.
I don't delete the file in the personal folder a this contains the history, bookmarks, and saved passwords.

If there is anything I should check before I "fix" my next install, I would be delighted to help.
