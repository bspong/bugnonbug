Close Other Tabs is unintuitive and dangerous. It doesn't belong in the context
menu for a tab, or anywhere else for that matter. The time saved by the menu
option is in my experience not worth the frustration caused by hitting it
accidentally all the time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Decide that a particular unfocussed tab in unimportant.
2. Rather than clicking it and then hitting the X button on the tab bar, use the
handy "close tab" context menu item.
3. Miss by three pixel and hit "close other tabs" by mistake.
Actual Results:
All of my other tab (i.e. the one I wa actually interested in) close.

Expected Results:
Expected Results:
Not closed all the wrong tabs. (in an ideal world I might have accidentally hit
bug 254021 but that's currently still broken.)

Accidentally transposed the term "close other tabs" and "undo close tab" in
previous report, to the detriment of bug usefulness. Apologies.
