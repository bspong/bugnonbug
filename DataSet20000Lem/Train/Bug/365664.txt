hotmail.com reading pane width *in 'right' mode* and height *in 'bottom' mode* can not be adjusted in firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.8.1.1) Gecko/20061220 Firefox/2.0.0.1 (Swiftfox)

I notice that reading pane width *in 'right' mode* and height *in 'bottom' mode* can not be adjusted when using firefox browser but it can be adjusted when using IE. This way I have a very limited view of my message in both mode when using firefox. Since, the platform that I use doesn't have IE installed in it, I have no way of usefully accessing my hotmail. I doubt I would use IE to avoid this annoyance only.

I actually filed a bug with live.com and MS had the standard reply that the problem wa with firefox browser. Now, I don't know where the problem is because I can't figure the code in firefox or on the pages. Please make a technical recommendation so I can follow up with MS support if it really a 'bad' website example, which us IE only code.
