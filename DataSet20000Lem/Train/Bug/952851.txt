Firefox stop loading new content, freeze
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:26.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/26.0 (Beta/Release)

Steps to reproduce:

After browsing websites, Firefox stop loading new content. Websites include Facebook and Youtube. Difficult to reproduce exactly, but after a some time browsing these sites, eventually the browser just stop loading content.

Issue started at around the FF24 update.


Actual results:

For example:

When I click on the newsfeed of Facebook, it just hang and won't load anything. If I click on my YouTube home, it won't go anywhere. If I highlight text and hit "Search Google for...", it will bring up the new tab, but will not load anything. It give me the spinning circle instead.

When I close the browser and launch it again, everything load just fine for a brief period of time until the issue come up again.

Here's what I've tried to resolve the issue:
Set up a new profile
Reset Firefox
Uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled a clean version
Uninstalled add-on
Blocked Flash (set it to "Ask to Activate")
Uninstalled and re-installed Flash
Run multiple malware check (in Safe Mode) - Malware Bytes, MSE, Microsoft Safety Scanner, SpyBot.
Run Firefox in Safe Mode
Made sure all of my plug-in and add-on are up-to-date
Added Firefox to Windows Firewall
Disabled Hardware Acceleration
Dumped the cache (set cache to clear every time Firefox closes, too)
Updated my graphic card and network card driver


Expected results:

Websites load correctly when I visit them.
