Spinning pinwheel(busy icon), which temporarily freeze Firefox.

I don't see any topic on this issue but I am having the most annoying time trying to use Firefox 3.6, because ever since I downloaded it, I get this freeze that occurs where I can't do anything in Firefox. A scenario go like this:

I will be browsing the internet looking at my mail, the news, etc. and all of a sudden I get a spinning pinwheel (which is Mac's version of Microsoft's hourglass for a busy signal), and the spinning pinwheel will last for about 20-30 seconds. During this time I can't do anything but stare at my frozen Firefox because I can't click on any tabs, pages, etc. Then after the 20 second or so it will unfreeze and I can begin using Firefox again, but only for so long. After a minute or two of no freezing, it will start again and freeze for another 20 second or so. It will do this off and on and off and on. (This problem also occurs if I just look at a web page in Firefox and not do anything, it will start to freeze.)

I tried reinstalling the 3.6 version and disable a couple Add-ons, only to find that Firefox 3.6 still had the same problem. So I wa fed up with messing with the problem so I reverted back to 3.5.7, which seems to be doing amazingly well. I have had no problem before using Firefox and think it is a great browser, I am just disappointed with 3.6 and can't use it. Any help would be great!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close Firefox and open it up again only to discover the problem is still there.
2. I don't have to do anything but wait every minute or so till I watch Firefox freeze.

Actual Results:
Nothing. I reverted back to 3.5.7 and the problem wa fixed. That is how I am able to fill these box in with all this information is because 3.5.7 is not freezing on me every minute.

Expected Results:
Worked correctly? I mean I don't think a browser is supposed to freeze constantly. I understand if your opening a page or something that take time to load, but not to the degree that I am experiencing. Especially when I am not doing anything with Firefox and it freezes.

Don't think there is any extra information I can give.
