When downloading file with the same filename they may overwrite each other

When two file with the same filename are downloaded by Alt-clicking on links, Firefox will usually append (#) to the end of the second one to avoid filename conflicts, for example:

file.ext
and
file(2).ext

However, if many file with the same name are downloaded from a server that only allows a few file to be downloaded at a time, some file may not have started to download yet when the other link are clicked, and firefox doe not recognize the filename conflict between these queued files. They are given the same filename and once they download, the resulting file will either be one of the two intended files, or simply corrupted.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Bring up a page that ha link to many file with the same name. The server must only allow a few simultaneous file transfers.
2. Alt-click many link quickly enough that some are clicked while another file with the same name is queueing.
3. The file will be queued with the same name a the other queued file, and they will not download properly.
Actual Results:
The downloaded file wa corrupted, or only one of the file downloaded.

Expected Results:
Firefox should have recognized another file queued with the same name, and appended a different number to the filename.

For example, say a server only allows two transfer simultaneously, and it is desired to download four file called file.ext. These file are large enough that they will not finish downloading before the others is clicked.

File 1 will appear in download manager a file.ext and will begin downloading
File 2 will appear in download manager a file(2).ext and will begin downloading
File 3 will appear in download manager a file(3).ext but will not begin downloading yet
File 4 will also appear in download manager a file(3).ext, and this will cause the file file(3).ext to download improperly.
