Borrowed from the NUMEROUS complaint and request on this bug:

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191578

-----------
Please add a confirmation to 'Close Other Tabs'.

For a second time I have mistakenly slipped from 'Close Tab' to 'Close Other
Tabs', and lost all of the tab I wanted to keep (some of which had
half-completed form in them).

I really think a confirmation dialogue would fit in. One appears when you
attempt to close a browser window that ha several tabs.

Please add a 'Close Other Tabs' confirmation dialogue, before I lose more
important browser sessions.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open more than one tab.
2.Right click on the tab to bring up that tab's context menu.
3.Go down intending to hit "Close Tab"... accidently hit "Close Other Tabs"
4.All work in other tab is lost.

Actual Results:
Very often all work in 5+ tab is blown away.

Expected Results:
Prompt the user that he want to close (number of) other tabs. This is EXACTLY
like the behavior that Firefox now ha with closing the browser when there are
multiple tab open. Also including the checkbox to warn you or not in the
future. Again, just like the current close behavior.
