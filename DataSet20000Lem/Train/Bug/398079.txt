Firefox crashing upon start-up of program
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7

Regardless of whether I click on the Firefox icon in my start-up menu, or from the icon on the desktop, Firefox will open but it won't stay open -- get an error message saying that it ha encountered an error and must close and then I get the prompt if I want to send/not send error message to Microsoft. This ha been going on the last few days, and I have run AV scan, Spy-Bot *and* Ad-aware scan and have come up with no virus or worm or anything else to explain this behavior. I have the most recent version of Firefox (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.7) Gecko/20070914 Firefox/2.0.0.7).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Firefox via start up menu OR icon on desktop
2. type in *any* URL (doesn't matter which one - doe this regardless of what site you are visiting...have had it happen on AOL, Yahoo, Wikipedia, MySpace...)
3. at random times, Firefox will close stating it ha 'encountered' an error
4. close down Firefox, then restart again via start up menu or icon on desktop
5. it will ask if you wish to restore old session or start new session - I choose start new just in case something happened during old one to cause shutdown
6. start process all over again with random shutting down of program
Actual Results:
See step under "reproducibility" - that pretty much sum it up. No special set-up step or anything to make it happen. Also no rhyme nor reason to it happening, and no warning.

Expected Results:
Firefox eventually "encounters an error" and must close.

stayed open - not 'encountered an error' and need to close.
