Session Restore restores to virus loading website that prevent alt+F4 window closure that required TaskManager shutdown of Firefox
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.12) Gecko/20101026 Firefox/3.6.12 (.NET CLR 1.1.4322)

When a virus site is encountered that begin to run the fake virus scan of your computer while it downloads itself onto your computer, a site that prevents alt+F4 window closure, you must use ctrl+alt+delete to active TaskManager and shut down Firefox to prevent the site from accessing your computer. Once you try and reopen Firefox, Session Restore pop right back up to that site which is attacking your computer and begin to download the virus again forcing another ctrl+alt+delete. Upon trying to reopen Firefox the second time, it finally display the "This is embarrassing..." screen which allows you to select "Start A New Session".

I feel this auto restart to the last page visited without asking for confirmation of intent is dangerous to end user of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit MySpace and "Browse Friends" until attacked by virus ladden website.
2. alt+F4 doesn't work and give you the runaround anti-window close loop forcing you to ctrl+alt+delete into TaskManager to kill Firefox's process/process tree.
3. Restart Firefox which jump you right back to said virus ladden website without asking if I want to return there or start a new session.
Actual Results:
Upon the second restart of Firefox the "This is embarrasing..." message finally appears and allows me to start a new session.

Expected Results:
Session Restore should ask for permission/ instruction EVERY time it attempt to restore a website that wa active during a program crash/closure.

Thanks for providing a great browser, I'd like to see this issue resolved to help keep Firefox a safety first browser!
