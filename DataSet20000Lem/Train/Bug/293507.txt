When I set my default web page color to light on dark and/or use a high-dpi
monitor half of the web (including some mozilla.org pages) breaks.

My suggestion is to put a feature into Mozilla that would show the broken page
a such.

The most common problem are size in pixel and wrong color afaik.

For size in pixels, anything that is sized in pixel should be reduced to size
zero (or one pixel so that people are aware there is some contetnt). This
particular misfeature doe not affect Mozilla too much a one can increase text
size manually.

For colors, Mozilla should track if a color wa set (or inherited from) the
default color preference or it wa set from the web page.

When an object ha background-color specified by the page and color inherited
from the defaults, the color should be reset to background-color, rendering the
text or drawing invisible. The same when it is the other way around.

This should be default on (with a big fat warning in the release note which are
hardly ever read by anybody).

Since the error were already detected there could be a button in the ui that
turn on counter-bad-design mode temporarily so that the page can be read easily.

Reproducible: Always
