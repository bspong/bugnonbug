I went to Google to do a search. I found a few web site I wanted to look at based on what I put in the search box. I right clicked on each one of the result I wanted to look at and then clicked on Open Link in New Tab. I noticed after each tab fully loaded their page there wa no URL in the location bar. I had to right click in an open area of the page and click on View Page Info in order to see what the web site address for that site is. I also noticed that none of the page I opened are listed when I go to History>Show All History or press CTRL+SHIFT+H. I also tried to open a recently closed tab and the option is grayed out. What is this browser doing and how do I fix it.
