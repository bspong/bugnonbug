Multiple Passwords on one form cause a change password pop up for an non-related user.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20080404 Firefox/2.0.0.14

When a form contains more then one password field, then when one or all of those are filled in, Firefox doe not associate each password field to each corresponding user name. Instead it associate it to another password which wa first saved under the host IP.

In order to test this I made a valid page first with only one pair of user name/password. Upon adding a second user name/password field the behavior in question occurs.

Each input tag ha a name field which is different form every other uname.
Ex:
<input type="text" name="uname1"/><input type="password" name="pass1"/>
<input type="text" name="uname2"/><input type="password" name="pass2"/>


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Make a form page with 2 or more password field
2.Add a submit button
3.Click submit and you will receive a notification to change another user's password
Actual Results:
Getting the prompt:
Would you like Password Manager to change the stored password for <other-user>?
[Yes]/[NO]

Expected Results:
I should get the following prompt if the specific user's password is not saved yet:

Do you want Firefox to remember the password?

This is an inconvenience that I a well a other people can find really annoying.
