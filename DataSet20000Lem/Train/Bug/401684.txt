Having problem using Firefox on Mac OS 10.4.

When typing in text box - a common activity - the focus seems to be lost after every few characters. I have to click back inside the text box to get the focus back.

By focus being lost I mean the usual things, i.e. typing no longer work and the flashing cursor disappears.

Does not happen 100% of the time, but once it ha started, it doesn't go away of it own accord. Quitting Firefox and relaunching doesn't seem to solve the problem. Restarting the machine usually (but not always) fix it, at least for a while.

Sometimes drop-down menu fail. I can select another item from the list, but the original selection is retained.

Makes the product almost impossible to use a lot of the time.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
I haven't found a way to reproduce it reliably. On launching Firefox the problem is absent (e.g. right now it's fine) but once the software ha been running for a while, it usually start to happen spontaneously. I have no idea why.
Actual Results:
N/A

Expected Results:
As discussed

Using default theme. Also running Azureus, Apple Mail and MSN Messenger.
