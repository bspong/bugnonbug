Upgrade to CodeMirror 5.7.0
Created attachment 8563535
rough python upgrade script

So once CodeMirror 4.13 is out it'd be nice to upgrade to it since I've added support for CSS variable (which currently break parsing slightly), and fixed @supports and @-moz-document block so they highlight properly (bug 977665)

I have a rough python script I'm attaching that handle most of the legwork for me (actually the first time I've written any python, so I apologise in advance. I think adding error handling to try and make using it friendlier made the code rather le friendly). I figure it might be nice to have on record/possibly reuseable in future.

Currently the main issue is change introduced in 4.7 break a number of test
TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | Tern is (currently) defined on the window
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/sourceeditor/test/browser_editor_autocomplete_basic.js#31
#36, #51
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/sourceeditor/test/browser_editor_autocomplete_js.js#26

TEST-UNEXPECTED-FAIL | (gutters|folderGutters) is correct
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/sourceeditor/test/browser_editor_prefs.js#63
#81, #92

I think there are also some failure of the CodeMirrors test that I can/have fixed by updating imports, but I can worry about that more once these main issue are fixed.
