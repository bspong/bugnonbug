Firefox show rather strange behavior when trying to log in to ebay.de (ebay.com
works), amazon partner net, ib board site and a couple of others: when no
username and password is entered, I can click on the "login" button but of
course get an error message from the site. When any text at all is entered in
the username and password fields, clicking on the "login" button ha no effect
whatsoever.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to one of the following sites:

http://signin.ebay.de/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?SignIn
https://secure.amazon.de/exec/panama/associates/tg/resources-page/-/921776/028-0010580-5705347
http://www.goetterdaemmerung-thegame.de/cgi_bin/ikonboard.cgi?s=92db955c18bddbea1ab97fc686ff2cbe;act=SF;f=6
(as an example for a site using ibboard - you'll probably need to register an
account to get the password prompt)

2. enter any username or password
3. click on "login" / "einloggen"

Actual Results:
nothing at all

Expected Results:
should have completed the login procedure
