When you goto this site: http://login.sify.com/login.php?rurl=http://chat.sify.com/&sn=chat and enter a valid id (after registering), then you should see the available chat room (eg, Lovers' lane etc). When you click anyone of the room, a dialog box will showup telling u to enter a new nick name. After you enter a new nick name and then hit the button, that dialog box will close and the main window will redirect to another page, and then will again showup the same enter a new nick name dialog and again and again. This site work fine with IE but not with firefox. And in hi5.com you cannot upload files. After you have a valid account in hi5.com and when you are uploading an image from our pc to hi5 server, after sometime it will show the same page but the image won't have been uploaded. But there's no problem when using internet explorer. Thanks
