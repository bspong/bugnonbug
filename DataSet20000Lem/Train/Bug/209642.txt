New Style of Selecting and Managing Sidebar Panels using a Single-Selection
Dropdown List.

I always thought that the Mozilla Sidebar Panels took up too much vertical
space. Removing them to get more space is also bad, because wanted sidebar have
to be added, and the wxisting one removed (IN A SEPARATE STEP) to maintain the
vertical space advantage.

Conversely, I think the the Firebird solution make it too cumbersome to switch
between Sibebar Panels. The shortcut have to be remembered and the menu is too
far away and deeply nested.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:



Expected Results:
My suggestion is to introduce a new method of selecting sidebar panel that us
the advantage of both current system (increased vertical space and easy
accessibily) while eliminating the disadvantage of both current system
(decreased vertical space and difficult accessibility).

Suggested UI:
+----------------------------+------
| Sidebar [ Bookmarks ] x |___ <-- currently selected: Bookmarks
|-----------| Customize Sidebars |
| Personal | Sidebar directory |
| > Compute |--------------------|
| > Persona |o Bookmarks | <-- currently selected: Bookmarks
| > Mozilla | Search |
| mozill | History |
| Bugs | Bugzilla |
| Etique | ... |
| Thumpe +--------------------+
| FlamingBird |
| |
+----------------------------+

Notice that the dropdown list would show the selected Sidebar Panel with a
selection BULLET instead of (multiple) checkmarks.

My recommendation would be to alphabetically sort the entry in the dropdown
list when they are added to provide some structure and better overview.
