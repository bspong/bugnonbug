When a full-screen plugin is loaded and you hover over any toolbar button that glow (e.g. the bookmark button or the back button) while viewing a full-screen plugin page (e.g. QuickTime or VLC), a bar appears under the button in the content area. Sometimes you need to re-size the browser window or click another tab and return to make it happen (I'm guessing this is because it make the display redraw, but I'm ignorant of the internals).

I've seen this happen in the QuickTime and VLC plug-ins.

Could this be happening because this is normally something which is covered up by the displayed page, but isn't because the plug-in only us a finite amount of space?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
0. Make sure you have a plug-in such a QuickTime or VLC installed, and set up to handle audio/mpeg (for the attached URL).
1. Open the attached URL, or any other URL that you know will activate a full-screen plugin.
2. Hover over any toolbar button that glows. If a bar doesn't appear under the button, try clicking another tab then returning, or re-sizing the browser window.
Actual Results:
A black or white bar appears under the toolbar button in the content area.

Expected Results:
Nothing should appear in the content area.
