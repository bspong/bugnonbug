when an image is bigger then your browser window, even maximized, and you click on it, where it's with the right or left mouse button. It will move you to the centre of the image everytime before the action that the mouse button you pressed does.

2. Right click or click with the left mouse button on the image.

Actual Results:
You are sent to the middle of the image right away before the pop up menu show up if you clicked the right mouse button and nothing unless the image wa a link in that case, you are sent to that link after you are put directly in the middle of the image.

If you clicked with the right mouse button, you should stay on the page where you are, then a popup menu should show up. If you clicked with the left mouse button, you should stay on the page where you are, then you are sent to the next link the image is linked to.
