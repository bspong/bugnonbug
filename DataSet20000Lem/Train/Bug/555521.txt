The browser is generally very sluggish...especially once a video is viewed or when website with a lot of flash is used...new issue seen today wa the menu when clicked on,drop down into blank column whose border is seen...although it is possible to click on the region and get the command to work...for a lay user who doesn't know the location of the command it would be nearly impossible to use the browser...taskmanager show FF taking about 200+ MB of RAM...I have set it to clear all browsing data/cookies/blah-blah on exit...really wonder why it is so slow...I have 2048 MB of RAM and a 2.6 GHz processor AMD Athlon X2 and 32-bit Windows XP.

Reproducible: Didn't try




Generally happens when more than 2 to 3 tab are open..here mail,Facebook and Youtube and/or wikipedia...totalling not more than 5-8 tab at a time!!!
Do look into it...I'm not a big fan of Chrome but look like a move to it is inevitable until this is fixed....cheers!!
