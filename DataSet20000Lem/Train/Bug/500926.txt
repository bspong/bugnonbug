a) Home directory NFS mounted from central server
b) server ha nightly backup with gzip which take the server to high resource usage
c) mozilla client on client machine stop responding and the NFS mount from the
server get borked.

I can understand why the client would become unusable during high-stress period on the server, but this shouldn't be able to corrupt the underlying NFS link, and it should recover after the stress period is concluded.

Note that nobody is actually using the client at this time (2AM), but in the morning we come in and all of our client are NFS-dead. Shutting down all the firefox process before the backup is a workaround - the NFS link are fine unless mozilla is running.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. leave client computer running with firefox open window under NFS through server backup routine
2.
3.
Actual Results:
NFS link becomes corrupted and unusable. This only happens if firefox window are open when the server is stressed.
