Behavior is inconsistent:

1) Cut/Copy/Paste in the menu and it isn't sticky but using Delete it is
2) The drag of an item to another menu should cause the destination menu to open and remain sticky
3) Attempting to D&D an item between menu and the indication of where it's going to "land" when you release the mouse is one item below where you actually have your mouse pointer!


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Launch Minefield
2) Cut/Copy/Paste in the menu and it isn't sticky but using Delete it is
3) Drag an item to another menu and observe that the destination menu doesn't open and certainly doesn't remain sticky
Actual Results:
1) Launch Minefield
2) Cut/Copy/Paste in the menu and it isn't sticky but using Delete it is
3) Drag an item to another menu and observe that the destination menu doesn't open and certainly doesn't remain sticky

Expected Results:
1) That the use of the following function Cut/Copy/Paste in the Bookmark menu doesn't cause the bookmark menu to lose it's stickiness and behaves just like using Delete doe
2) That dragging an item to another menu would open the target menu and that target menu would remain sticky until dismissed by the user
