Click on Test Window(Title Bar area), this window will come up.
Now move mouse to Search Input Box. Right Click to see Context Menu, it appaers at
wrong position.

This happens all the time when 2 or more IFRAMES are overlapped.
The first loaded iframe will get focus and rest won't. The CSS z-index property
will show it correct but that is not right.

I tried even, document.getElementById('ifrm').contentWindow.focus()
a suggested in your docs, that doe not work either.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. GO to http://sspsoft.com/dhtml/win1.html
2. Click on Test Window(Title Bar area), this window will come up.
3. Now move mouse to Search Input Box. Right Click to see Context Menu, it
appaers at wrong position.

Actual Results:
The 1st iframe tag will retain focus. Even j tried to set focus for other
iframe, it will not do it. Will not show any error.

Expected Results:
Focus should be able to transfer on request, including IFRAME TAGS
