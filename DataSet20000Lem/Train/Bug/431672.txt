When opening a bookmark from the library, if the address will cause alert, for example, if there's unrecognized protocol, you cannot get focus back to library. if you minimize the main window, it will keep minimizing and maximizing for a while

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open bookmark library, and create a new bookmark with the address "places:history", or "asdasd:somthing" or anithing else that won't work.
2.double click on it from the library. the main window will get focus, and alert will pop up.
3.(optional) close the alert, and click on library in the taskbar, or press alt-tab. the library window still won't get focus.
4.minimize the main window. the main window will start minimizing and maximizing by itself
Actual Results:
you can't reach library window, and the main window keep minimizing and maximizing
