When you enter letter in the search box, suggestion start to appear. But, after you modify the Navigation bar (right-click => Customize), the suggestion no longer appear (until you restart FF).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF, start typing letter in search box (suggestions appear)
2. right click on Navigation bar (=> Customize)
3. click "done" (no need to make any real change to the Bar)
4. start typing letter (the same ones) in search box => no suggestion appear (until you restart)
Actual Results:
Suggestions no longer appeared.

Expected Results:
Suggestions should have appeared.

I checked with a pristine profile (without any extension), this behaviour is the same.

Note however, that I managed _once_ to see the suggestion after I performed those steps. So it doe not seem 100% reproducible. It still occured in all my other tests.

Restarting the browser cured the problem everytime. So this problem is just an annoyance.
