Unexpected result after selecting cancel in migration screen
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040608 Firefox/0.8

I had installed FF a Administrator into the default location (I believe it
installed over some prior version). When the installer asked if I would like to
launch, I said no.

I then tried to start FF a normal user (no admin rights). I got the migration
dialog (?) which asked me which profile (out of 5) to migrate. I did not want to
migrate any profile, and hit cancel. The dialog went away, and nothing else
seemed to happen.

I then tried to launch FF again, but nothing seems to happen. There is no FF in
the process list either (it might die before it end up there).

The only way I wa able to launch FF wa by logging in a Administrator, after
which it would run just fine.

While the Administrator FF wa running, I wa also able to launch FF profile
selector from a normal account. It brought up a profile selection dialog with
just one profile name. When I tried to launch, it said the profile is in use,
and would not launch. Then I hit exit, and FF crashed (got dialog "The
instruction at blah blah referenced memory at blah blah. The memory could not be
'written'."

I would have expected that
- I would be able to create a new profile in addition to selecting to migrate
- I would be able to run a normal user even if I had installed a admin
- there would be no crash under any circumstance
