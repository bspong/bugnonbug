I'm using a chat-Website (planetromeo.com). When you click on a message, a new window (message-winodow) pop up with the message and a text-box to enter the answer and the mainwindow stay in the background.

Problem: When the main-window reloads the number of message in planetromeo, the focus of the message-window with the textfield is gone. When you re-click on the textfield, the focus cannot be set back to the textfield.

Only Menu: Window-> Select-Mainwindow and a following Menu: Window -> select Message-Window set the focus back to the textfield.

How it should work: The Reload of the number of message in the mainwindow should not change the focus.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login planetromeo.com
2. Klick on Number of message -> Message-window pop up
3. Type a few letter and wait for reload of the "Number-of-messages"-frame in the mainwindow
4. After reload, when you receive a new message, Message-window is still in the front but ha no focus and you cannot type anything anymore
Actual Results:
see above

Expected Results:
The Reload of the number of message in the mainwindow should not change the focus.
