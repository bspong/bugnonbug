I inadvertently downloaded the Dealio toolbar, and immediately removed it. Ever since I removed it, every time a page load in firefox it say "Your search setting have been restored to their default settings." This happens every time I load a page. I've uninstalled firefox and reinstalled it, I've completely removed everything from Dealio that I can find, from my hard drive and my registry. How can I stop this from happening? And yes, I've rebooted. I've restarted everything. I can't find a file that wa written or removed other than the one that I've removed. I don't want to turn this feature off, and I don't want to stop using firefox. I've run all my anti everything software, and it still pop up, a if there's a broken link in a dll somewhere. Please help if you can, this is worse than bedbug (Google them).
