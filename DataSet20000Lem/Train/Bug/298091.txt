Firefox forgets it list of deactivated plugins
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

This bug might be related to bug #298089. I routinely deactivate "alien plugins"
(see description of the aforementioned bug) found by Firefox in "Options >
Download > File Types > Plugins". But after Firefox is closed/crashed (my
computer run 24/7 and I normally don't close my browser, so when it terminates,
it's more likely that it ha crashed than been intentionally closed by me - btw,
it crash about once a day, while my Windows run for month without restart)
and restarted, it often forgets the deactivation, so all found plugins are shown
a activated in the list again.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Deactivate some plugins found by Firefox in other browser's plugin directory
(see bug #298089) via "Options > Download > File Types > Plugins";
2. Use Firefox for some time and close it, or wait for it to crash;
3. Start Firefox again and wait a bit for the OS-wide search for alien plugins
to complete, then open "Options > Download > File Types > Plugins".
Actual Results:
Previously deactivated plugins are activated again.

Expected Results:
Deactivated plugins stay deactivated.

This bug appears cross-(browser-)session, which mean if I deactivate some
plugins now, close Firefox, restart it, and see the deactivated plugins are not
reactivated, I still can't imagine I'm on the safe side. Next time Firefox is
closed/crashed and restarted, it can "forgets" the deactivation again, even
though it ha "remembered" just this time.
