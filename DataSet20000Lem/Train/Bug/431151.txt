Firefox exit violently when editing some input fields.
User-Agent: Opera/9.27 (X11; Linux i686; U; en)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.1.14) Gecko/20061201 Firefox/2.0.0.14 (Ubuntu-feisty)

After I did update (auto update in ubuntu) to Firefox 2.0.0.14, trouble start if I edit an input box. I did see it first while working on our wiki (confluence 2.8) ... when I hit the Edit button, I presume some kind of javascript is downloaded that act a the editor, but upon activation of that script the whole Firefox exit without warning ... The problem is however not limited (or caused by) Confluence because it wa working just fine before the update and also if I do edit this verry box with Firefox 2.0.0.14 a crash is produced !!!!!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Report a bug for Firefox
2. Goto the "Details box"
3. Start editing ... et voila ... crash
Actual Results:
violently crashing of Firefox

Expected Results:
... no crashing ?!?

I have the impression that the bug wa introduced while fixing the "MFSA 2008-20 Crash in JavaScript garbage collector" bug

Funny ... I had to install Opera just to log this ticket ... Opera is not so bad ... I would fix this one fast before people are running to other browser !
