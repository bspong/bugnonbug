Firefox randomly and frequently throw google home page and google error page while using proxy
I first found this bug while using google search after sharing my internet
connection using a proxy server. While using manual proxy, when I searched for
'pizza hut' and when I clicked the first search result, instead of opening
pizzahut.com it throwed google english home page. Then one by one I clicked on
each search result and every time it either throwed Google hompage (depending
on the site url. e.g. if it .com it will throw google english home page, if it
.ca it will throw google canada home page) or google error page saying "Google
error location <url path with base url dropped> not found"

Here by base url dropped I mean, if the link were www.foo.com/foo/bar it will say
"Google error location /foo/bar not found"

I thought this is only when I use google search. So I avoided using google
search. But I often faced the problem while browsing any web site normally. When
I click some link on any random website that is supposed to take more time
because of slow server, firefox will directly show that google error page. While
in the address bar I see the original link address, not google address.

To further investigate I tried this with mozilla suit and same problem occured.
Then I tried in Firefox Linux version (till now I wa tryin in Windows XP), and
same problem (ofcourse with same proxy settings)

Firefox Version: 1.0
Mozilla Version: 1.7.2
OS: Windows XP, Linux (kernel 2.6)
Proxy server that I am running on my main computer is: AnalogX Proxy, Version: 4.14

My proxy settings:
HTTP 10.0.0.1 6588
SSL 10.0.0.1 6588
SOCKS 10.0.0.1 1080 (Tried v4 a well a v5)
FTP 10.0.0.1 21
