Firefox. Update 2.0.0.13 Error Message Download Failed, Update File corrupt.

Currently using Firefox version 2.0.0.12. In option Updater wa set to auto download and install. Update/Downloader installed update file. firefox required a restart and upon opening an "Alert" wa received stating. Type Error: AVG_DTFox.prefs have no properties.

I attempted then to use the add remove facility to uninstall Firefox and received a further error message saying that the Uninstaller wa corrupt and to contact the owner for a new version. I wa unable to uninstall the updated firefox (Version 2.0.0.13)

I went to my downloaded file opened Firefox 2.0.0.12 and re installed that version over 2.0.0.13 the alert screen dissappeared and firefox opened normally.

I have downloaded version 2.0.0.13 manually and the auto updater ha also done this on two occasion on each attempt the result ha beenthe same the "Alert" appears and I am unable to uninstall through the Add Remove function in XP (Home SP2)

I have since disabled the auto update feature to prevent it auto updating and have the preference set to " Ask me what i want to do" when update are found.

I am assuming that the Alert Type Error: AVG_DTFox.prefs have no properties. is a reference to my AVG Anti virus and Firewall I am running AVG Pro Version 8.0.87 and have not previously encountered any issue with AVG and Firefox update conflicting.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Download Firefox 2.0.0.13
2.Allow it to Install
3.Alert Appears
4.Uninstall fails


Expected Results:
Update should have occurred without any problems.
