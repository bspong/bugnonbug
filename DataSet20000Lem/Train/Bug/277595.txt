pdf plugin (acrobat 5) display the pdf filling about 50% of the browser width
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041219 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0+dfsg.1-1)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041219 Firefox/1.0 (Debian package 1.0+dfsg.1-1)

The opened pdf file is shown fully, but the width of the pdf is not fit to the
browser window width, it's only about 50% of the browser window width.

But if I press Restore (since the window wa full screen) and then Maximize
again, then the pdf is shown correctly fitted to the browser width.

Unfortunately(*) I didn't test what happens if browser window is not maximized
before loading pdf and if the problem existed in that case, would resizing by
dragging the window corner/side solve the problem.

(*) I already installed Acrobat 7 beta which doesn't have the problem. This
might be adobe 5 problem, but I suspect it's the plugin problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox and maximize the window (the [] button next to the [X] button)
2.Make sure that pdf plugin is enabled and acrobat 5 installed
3.Open some pdf file from internet

Actual Results:
width of the pdf is not fit to the browser window

Expected Results:
The pdf should scale to browser width
