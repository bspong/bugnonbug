At the url I have listed, and likely others similar to it, at time of posting
the site creator had not put a character limit on the text box and if you were
to copy and paste text into the text box and continue copying and pasting large
amount of text eventually firefox simply crashes. I and several friend have
reproduced this effect repeatedly. We have concluded that if you were to use a
text area with a javascript to fill it, you could potentially do a weak DOS
attack or possibly even execute malicious code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a page with a text box that ha no character limit.
2. Using the keyboard command for copy and paste, simply hold down control + v
copying large amount of text into the box

Actual Results:
Firefox dissapeared and quality agent opened.

Expected Results:
Continued to accept text until machine limit reached.

This bug on a variety of system configuration a my machine is a bit older and
my friend also have a variety of older and newer hardware. I'm not expert
enough to be sure, but it seems to be a potential security flaw and I will mark
it a such, I apologize in advance if I am incorrect in doing so.
