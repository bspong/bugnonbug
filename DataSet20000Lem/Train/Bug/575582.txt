3.6.4 update played havoc with Gmail/GoogleGears

FF 3.6.3 worked perfectly with GoogleGears and Gmail.

When I applied the 3.6.4 update, and immediately FF would not boot up. i.e. when I click the FF icon in the OSX dock, the icon give one bounce, and doe nothing else.

I tried re-installing FF with 3.6.4 and problem remained.

I tried uninstalling 3.6.4 and reinstalling 3.6.3 - problem remained.

The only way around it wa to use Apple's TimeMachine to restore all the folder that relate to Firefox and GoogleGears, e.g. in the Library folder, preference files, Cache file etc.

However, in 3.6.3, the problem wa replicated when I updated NoScript AddOn. Upon upgrading the NoScript AddOn, the above problem revived, i.e. when clicked on the FF icon, it give one bounce and then doe nothing else. FF cannot boot up.

So I had to restore all the FF and GoogleGears folder and preference files, a described above.

I became so worried that I thought of removing all AddOns to avoid further problem since, for my work, I rely on GoogleGears offline Gmail.

But I discovered that removing the WeatherBug AddOn caused the same problem, i.e. the FF when clicked give one bounce, and doe nothing else.

So now I am stuck on 3.6.3 and not wanting to touch my system for fear that anything random is going to kill FF.

Reproducible: Always
