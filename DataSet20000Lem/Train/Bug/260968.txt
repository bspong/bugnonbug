On scrolling up/down, you see "shadows" of Flash animation (normally gray
rectangle or still frame from the Flash movie) being redisplayed in the same
x-position on the new page (normally in the screen position the flash animation
wa at before the scroll). This occurs whether you use the mouse, the scroll bar
or the keyboard to scroll. Tests have shown that if the div containing the ad on
the right (which ha "position: fixed") is changed to "position: absolute", the
problem go away. It doe not matter what the content in the fixed div is.

The problem ha been seen in both Firefox 0.9.3 and 1.0PR on MacOS X. In both
case Flash plugin 7.0 wa being used. The problem ha not been observed in
Linux or Windows. It ha not been seen in Camino 0.8 for OS X either.

It sound similar to bug 256480 (despite a different OS) - perhaps it is related?
