can't modify/delete bookmark first launch
User-Agent:
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Problem:
I can't add bookmarks, move, or delete them. Same for folder and separators.

Steps Performed:
1) I downloaded firefox. No previous version of Mozilla or Firebird wa on the
computer.
2) I installed it, choosing customized option to enable the developer tools.
All the other option were the same.
3) I said, "yes, just go ahead and launch firefox" or whatever the message is.
I said "no" to making it my default browser.
4) I got into the option menu:
- blanked the homepage
- set it not to remember form or password
- block popup window
- load image from originating site only
- selected smooth scrolling
5) Disabled the bookmark toolbar
6) Selected "manage bookmarks". Selected all of the imported IE bookmark under
the IE bookmark folder. Selected "Cut". Tried to paste them into the root
bookmark folder. It didn't work. I tried to delete the default folder --
wouldn't work. No go for the separator too. Wouldn't let me add a bookmark or
a folder either.
7) Exited firefox and restarted it. All of my change were applied! So it
seems like some sort of refresh problem.
8) I wanted to see if I could reproduce the problem with a cleaner install
(fewer variables). So I used the uninstall firefox utility. Then I deleted the
firefox folder from c:\program file and reinstalled it with default options. I
could not reproduce the bug at this point. I'm guessing bookmark are saved in
the registry, because they were all still there.

If I knew how to clean out all of the settings, maybe I could reproduce this bug?


System Details:
I am running Windows Server 2003. A fairly new install that hasn't been crapped
up like Windows installation tend to do after a while. Bugzilla had an option
to set the OS to Windows Server 2003, but when I clicked submit, it didn't
accept it.

Related Bugs:
These bug didn't describe my problem perfectly enough to where I thought this
wa a dupe, but they seemed similar enough to possibly be related, so I'm
listing them:

I will be watching this bug in case there are questions. Unfortunately, this is
not my main computer and isn't even in the same town. It's the parents'
computer, so I can't try anything fishy. This also mean that I am unable to
compile by myself, although I'm willing to test patch or workarounds. Also,
I'm only here on the weekend (because of school). I can test and compile stuff
on my gentoo linux box at the dorms, though, if that will help.

Thanks,
Josh

Actual Results:
Couldn't edit bookmark first time firefox wa launched, or at least the change
weren't being refreshed. Restarting the browser showed the changes, and also
allowed normal editing. Reinstallation of firefox caused failure to reproduce bug.

Expected Results:
I should have been able to move/delete bookmarks/separators/folders
