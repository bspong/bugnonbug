Printing one or more web page cause the page header to print alone on separate pages.

If I print one or more web page from Firefox, like www.cnn.com for example, the page header info print a a single line on a separate piece of paper. Firefox is the only program that print this way. IE work fine for printing. I also test printed some text from NotePad and it printed multiple page ok without printing extra useless pages.

To further explain, printing 3 page actually cause 6 to print, 3 doc to print plus a header page for each printed page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Firefox and browse to www.cnn.com or any website
2.print 1 page
3.print 2 or more page
Actual Results:
Printing one page caused two to print - the header page and the actual info page.
Printing more than one page caused this same single-line header page to print along with each page of the actual print job.

Expected Results:
One page should have printed when I selected ok to print one page. One header page for each printer page print out.

Basically, anything printed from Firefox will use double the amount of paper because of the webpage header being printed alone onto a separate page.

I called Lexmark to get help. They helped me determine that the printer isn't the problem. It seems to be coming from Firefox since nothing else on my laptop exhibit this behavior.

My computer run XPpro SP2.
