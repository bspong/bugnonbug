The existence of Bugzilla is non-obvious to the average user, and
Bugzilla ha a steep learning curve. This mean that million of user don't
know how to get problem fixed, and may switch to alternative products,
revert to older (possibly insecure) versions, or invent cumbersome workarounds.

Suggestion: Add a "Report a Bug" button that start a wizard to report a bug,
automatically filling in the product family, component, platform and OS.
Plus ideally some automatically-captured breadcrumb trail of what the user
wa doing, with a wizard to ask (in lay language) which feature is affected.
E.g. if the user had been in preference and then certificate manager, but had
to close the certificate manager window to get to the "report bug" window,
the wizard would present checkboxes for both these components.

The server-side (Bugzilla?) would then automatically show relevant open bug
for the component(s) selected - not all open bug for all components.
It should also allow for anonymous entry, for those too lazy or paranoid
to sign up, and/or allow the user to create an account without losing the wizard-gathered information.

I realize adding this kind of feature might overload bugzilla and the developer with rubbish. So it need more computer smart to filter it down and automatically identify duplicate real bugs. But we have more CPU power than we used to ...

Reproducible: Always
