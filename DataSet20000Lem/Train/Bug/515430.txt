X Window Server Error when opening a web page with a big gif transparent background

When opening this address with firefox 3.0.x under linux, Firefox crash with the following message :

The program 'firefox' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error wa 'BadAlloc (insufficient resource for operation)'.
(Details: serial 2732 error_code 11 request_code 53 minor_code 0)
(Note to programmers: normally, X error are reported asynchronously;
that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

It seems that it is caused by the big gif background image with a big transparent area.

Reproducible: Always

1. Use Firefox 3.0.13 under Ubuntu (it doe not crash under Windows)
