Unable to copy url from location bar in popup
STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1) Load attached HTML file
2) Click the link
3) Select the url in the url bar with the mouse.
4) Cmd-C to copy it.

EXPECTED RESULTS: URL copied

ACTUAL RESULTS: Clipboard not affected.

This make life suck a lot on site that pop up the "printable" version of article in a window like that; if I want to send the url to someone else, I have to jump through hoops.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
1) This is worksforme on Linux, but I can reproduce quite reliably on Mac.
2) I did some debugging, and it look like browser.css set
"-moz-user-input: disable" on the urlbar in this case (due to the readonly
attribute). This mean that all event handling on the input is suppressed,
because of the code in nsHTMLInputElement::PreHandleEvent. In particular,
the keypress event is just not dispatched at all, hence not seen by the XBL
key event handler, and we get nowhere close to triggering the code in
urlbarBindings.xml. I would expect this to be the case on all platforms,
though, so not sure why this work on Linux.
3) Using the menu's Edit > Copy to copy the text work fine.
4) For some reason there is no context menu for the url bar in this case. I
can file that a a separate bug, if it's caused by something other than the
user-input style above.

This look like a regression from bug 419772.
