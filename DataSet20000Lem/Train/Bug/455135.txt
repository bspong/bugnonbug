I have a few bookmark that refer to a local file saved on a flash drive. Recently when I replaced that flash drive, the O/S assigned a new drive letter. When I attempted to change the bookmark to refer to the changed drive letter, I wa unable to edit or delete the bookmark. I did add a new bookmark that pointed to the file on the flash drive and wa able to delete and edit that one, but on the one that had previously referenced the old drive letter. Additionally, when I looked in the property for the bookmark that had the old drive letter, the location field contained nothing. It wa just a bookmark with a name. I ended up working around the problem by editing the last backup bookmark .json file and changing the drive letter by hand and the restoring this backup.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a bookmark referring to a file on a a flash drive
2. get the O/S to assign a new letter to the flash drive (you may be able to just delete/rename the file, but I have not tried this)
3. try and edit/delete the bookmark
Actual Results:
I have not tried to recreate the problem since it happened.

Expected Results:
I should be able to edit AND delete bookmark that refer to local file that don't exist (whether they are on a flash drive or not)

Allowed me to manage my bookmarks, not matter what.
