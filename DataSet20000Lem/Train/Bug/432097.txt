I get this error message in all the RSS feed I've subscribed when I start Firefox with no internet connection (which is obvious).
The strange thing is that the feed aren't reloaded even after I get an internet connection and restart firefox too quickly, so it seems like on the second start (when an internet connection IS available) firefox doesn't try to reload the r feeds, so I have to manually reload them one by one.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox with no internet connection available: no live bookmark is loaded, error message is displayed instead
2.Connect to the internet
3.Close firefox and re-open it quickly (not too quickly, else you get the "another instance is already running" dialog)
4.Even if an internet connection is now available, Firefox doesn't try to reload the feed at startup, you have to do it manually, or wait some second more before restarting it
Actual Results:
Live feed don't reload even when connected to the internet and firefox ha been restarted (quickly)

Expected Results:
Firefox should always try to reload live feed on startup, even if another instance ha been closed only a few second before.
