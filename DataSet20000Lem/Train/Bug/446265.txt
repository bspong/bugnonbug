This is an issue I never had with FX2 latest. It occurs since 3.0.0 (and 3.0.1). Whenever I close FX, I get 100% CPU usage for a lot more then 21 or 30 (see bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=415201) and it's not related to bookmark or the like.

Startup time is normal.

The problem doesn't depend on browsed website (AFAIK) nor on extension (I have a very few of them, with one disabled because not supporting FX3).

I have no crash so I can't show you an error, but the 100% CPU useage ha an impact on my CPU temp and on other process running, of course. This can last for an entire night. This smell like a MM issue... (MM=memory manager) and I would look at the difference between latest FX2 and FX3.0.1 in this area if I were you ;-)


The process of FX2 unallocating memory wa somewhat slow but predictable. I could follow it in Task Manager, seeing virtual memory being freed. The process took sometimes 10 or so.

Now in FX3 it last forever and no memory is deallocated. I have to kill the process manually so that the machine is functional again.

After this "kill", FX3 start nicely, not complaining about a crashed session or the like.

If there is a way to track the problem down without myself compiling FX3 from sources, it would be nice ;-)

HTH

PS time permitting, I will try "FX3 in safe mode" to see if it doe make any difference. I will post a followup later on.
