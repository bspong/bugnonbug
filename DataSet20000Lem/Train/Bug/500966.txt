After installing/uninstalling and Add-on on the new Firefox RC 3.5 you are given the option to restart Firefox, a always. But, after restarting, instead of returning to the page(s) you were currently on before, you are returned to your home page.
Also, when you go to the Privacy option (new features!) and select 'Never remember history' after closing/restarting Firefox your history option return to 'Use custom setting for history'.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install and add-on or change Privacy history option to 'Never remember history'.
2. Restart Firefox.
3. Problem occurs.
Actual Results:
When restarting Firefox after installing and add-on, you are returned to your home page, rather than the page you were previously on, unlike the older release of Firefox. When changing Privacy option to 'Never remember history' leaving and returning to Firefox, option becomes 'Use custom setting for history'.

Expected Results:
When you restart Firefox after installing/uninstalling/disabling/enabling an add-on, you should be returned to the page(s) you were previously on. When setting history option to 'Never remember history', this option should remain constant.
