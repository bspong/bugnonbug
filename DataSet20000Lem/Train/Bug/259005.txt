Print preview should hide the browser statusbar

Currently when a user selects Print Preview, the statusbar for the previewed
page remains visible. This mean that the user can create live bookmarks, change
pop-up settings, and switch stylesheets (bug 258800) using the statusbar icon -
which really have nothing to do with printing and, thus, is confusing to the
user. The only reason currently for showing the statusbar might be to show that
the page is secure, but the user should be aware of this before even printing.
For what it is worth, IE hide the statusbar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit a site that trigger a statusbar icon (like http://www.mozilla.org/).
2.Select Print Preview.

Actual Results:
You can still access the statusbar icon (in the case of mozilla.org you can set
a live bookmark).

Expected Results:
Hidden access to any site triggered statusbar icons.

Another acceptable option would be to follow the approach in bug 258800 and
leave the statusbar visible, but collapse all of the icons. This would also
allow for the security icon to remain visible, if desired.

This is also similar to bug 257178.
