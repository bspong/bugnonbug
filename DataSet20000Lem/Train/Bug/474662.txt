In 3.1 b3pre, Firfox hung with a spinning pinwheel for about 30 second on launch. That went away when I switched to the 3.2 alpha nightlies. Now that bug ha returned. After I applied the latest nightly update, the browser hung for about 30 second - 1 minute. I could move the browser, but could not interact with it, and it had a spinning pinwheel. Even after the pinwheel went away, I could not interact with the browser for about another minute. OS X indicated that the browser wa responding. It look like it might be blocking on something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install latest nightly build (as of Jan 21st morning) and restart (this may just require a restart with no nightly build update.
2. Browser hang for 30 second or more with a spinning pinwheel
3. Browser won't interact with mouse or even take the mouse focus change.
Actual Results:
Browser hang with pinwheel spinning

Expected Results:

Did not occur with the Jan 18th or 19th builds.
