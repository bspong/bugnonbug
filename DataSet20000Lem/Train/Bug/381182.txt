I have been seeing frequent lockup in Firefox since I switched to a new Windows Vista PC. The lock ups are 100% consistent in that it lock every time I visit an offending website. I can't see anything interesting about these sites; I visit plenty of site with Java, medium players, etc., etc. all the time.

A couple of day ago I downloaded a nightly build and created a blank profile. I went to a couple of site I had problem with before, with no lock ups. I continued to use Firefox until I got another lock up today.

I then created a new blank profile and visited the site and generated several lock ups.

I have checked the bug report and don't see any known bug which fits.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit offending website
2.
3.

The site is a login screen I have visited many time before in Windows XP, in Vista, on Macs, before the new computer, after the new computer, etc., etc. This particular site did not give me any trouble before I got the nightly build, now it's 100% failure.

Before I got the nightly build I wa also getting these 100% reproducible lock ups but on different sites.

Actual Results:
Firefox lock up and must be killed with task manager.

Expected Results:
This site should display a login screen. As this particular site seems to read cooky from it's parent site (www.neopets.com) I'm not sure if this is a factor.

On the other hand, I have seen many lockup on site that don't have any obvious business reading cookies.

Before I got the nightly build and made a new profile this wa happening a lot, on a whole lot of sites. You visit the site and it either hang before you visit the site, or the site is partially displayed and then hangs. The cumulative nature of the behavior make me wonder if these site are trying to access cooky or history.

I have Mc Afee installed and have scanned with Ad-aware.
