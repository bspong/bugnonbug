this ha happened to me at least a dozen time over the past month.

i click on 'print all' whether the e-mail thread ha one or > 1 e-mail item. i am then confronted with a nice, printable page and a print window to select my printer and then click on 'print' button. at time i cancel first, in order that i may check my 'page setup' first before committing to printing. at time i just print head-on.

the status bar in the new small window that pop up showing the progress of the print job with firefox is active, scrolling across. when it reach the end, however, and one expects the small window to disappear to indicate successful completion of the print job, the window just sits there most of the time. one expects that the window till close itself to indicate successful printing. moment later, i click on the X to close this sub window, and a new window tell me that the firefox application is not responding, so i select force quit. then, i bring up firefox again, sometimes restoring session, sometimes starting a new session. either way, the second attempt usually let me print a gmail item successfully. more often than not, it take the second attempt to print, not the first. this is a bit annoying and disrupts flow.

thanks for your help.

4. select print
5. print progress mini window pop up and remains, indicating crash
Actual Results:
