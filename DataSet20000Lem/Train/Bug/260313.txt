At http://www.hoovers.com/free there is a company search in the upper left.
Leave all the setting default on the page and type a company name in. Firefox
(PR 1.0/.10; Mac OSX) will crach if the "change status bar text" and "disable or
replace context me..." option are diabled under the javascript setting under
preferences.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox (PR 1.0/.10; on Mac OSX 10.3.5)
2. Open preferences->web features->enable javascript-> advanced
3. uncheck "change status bar text"
4. uncheck "disable or replace context me..."
5. surf to http://www.hoovers.com/free
6. in dialog box under "Search for business information" enter company name,
i.e. Pepsi, Google, etc.
7. click search

Actual Results:
Firefox crash and want to send feedback.

Expected Results:
Should not crash, should open sanctioned pop-up and on background page, surf on.

I have had several issue since switching to .10 but believe that most of them
result from this. I usually leave most of my javascript option off.
