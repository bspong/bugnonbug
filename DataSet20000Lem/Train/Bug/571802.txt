I am having difficulty printing to PDF article saved in Instapaper (requires a login and a saved article in Instapaper to replicate this). I've tried both Acrobat Pro (in OS X) and Nitro PDF Reader (in Windows). After I print, the resulting PDF only show 3 page regardless of article length - a blank page 1, page 2 a the text of the beginning of the article, and a blank page 3. I've also had this problem in the most recent Firefox in Windows.

Safari handle Instapaper article printing to pdf without any problem.

Thanks for your help.
