Pages are jumping up and down

Note: I'm filing this bug in the name of some other person.

Previous Firefox version wa 3.5.7, then he updated to 3.6.
On a new (and his old) profile every page wa "jumping" up and down a bit, a if it wa scrolled up and down permanently, even if there is no scrollbar shown and no action is taken by him.
He opened new tab which showed the same behaviour.
Then he clicked an external link (in his IRC client) which opened a new tab and suddenly all other tab didn't show the described "jumpy" behaviour anymore.

Some other observations:
The jumping doe NOT occur while the preference or the open-file dialog are opened. After closing these, the jumping continues.
The jumping DOES occur while the add-on dialog is opened or while the focus lie on the address bar (I guess any modal dialog stop it, while any non-modal dialog doe not).

I am attaching a video (WMV) which show the behaviour.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Upgrade from 3.5.7 to 3.6
2. Create a new profile and open it
----
3. Open some site(s)
-
4. Call the running Firefox with an URL
Actual Results:
After 3.: All opened page are jumping up and down
After 4.: All jumping stop until the next session

Expected Results:
No jumping at all.

The computer is a laptop, namely the Acer Aspire 7520G.
