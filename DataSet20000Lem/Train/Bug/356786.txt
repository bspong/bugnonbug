CSS Attribute FLOAT Acting Weird Randomly On First Load, or a SHIFT+Reload

If you visit the following test page, you'll see that some text information and a table done with CSS and DIV object that use the attribute FLOAT to line up next to one another.

On first page load, it sometimes won't break the alignment of the table rows. However, if you do a SHIFT+Refresh, you'll see that the row alignment breaks. If you hit refresh again, the page load fine.

It doesn't do it every time and when it doe break it's not always the same rows. There is a weird randomness to it, and combined with the fact that it doesn't do this on any other browser (not even Mac Firefox a far a I know), I believe this is a bug.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load that URL (http://www.lostadam.net/trainer/test.html)
2. Hit SHIFT+Refresh to load it again
3. If it doesn't break, hit SHIFT+Refresh again until it happens. It will happen eventually.

Actual Results:
The row of DIV object do not line up properly on every row every time the page loads.

Expected Results:
Every row of DIV object should line up the same way every time.

The CSS and XHTML are both valid. The page is totally self contained with no external dependency such a JS includes or graphics. It's been tested and seen to fail on "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7" and "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a1) Gecko/20061015 Minefield/3.0a1"

I hope this is enough information. It is a frustrating problem that come up in many of my design lately.
