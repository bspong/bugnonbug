If you click on History and then Show All History, the Library window open and if you double click on the Name, Location, Visit Date or other column name, CPU usage spike to 100% and the Library window will minimize and the current tab will be loaded with whatever link is highlighted in your history.

However, if you open the Library window and you look at Tags or All Bookmarks and then go back to the History and double click on the column name, it only spike the CPU a it sort the History, it doesn't minimize or open a highlighted link.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click History -> Show All History
2. Double click on Name, Location, Visit Date, etc.

Actual Results:
CPU usage spike to 100%, the Library window minimizes and whatever link is highlighted is opened in the current tab.

Expected Results:
1 click on the column name should sort it by default behavior. Double clicking should be whatever the default behavior is (undo maybe?).
