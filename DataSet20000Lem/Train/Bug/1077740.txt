Reset legacy homepage to about:home
We have million of Firefox user that are using latest version of Firefox that have their homepage set to one of the two websites:

https://www.google.com/firefox

http://start.mozilla.org

Start.mozilla.org traffic is many magnitude larger than www.google.com/firefox and start.mozilla.org is also a website that we control.

After Firefox 4, Mozilla created a static copy of www.google.com/firefox and hosted it internally at start.mozilla.org and it is why these two site look very similar. We would prefer if Google were to redirect google.com/firefox to start.mozilla.org, but that is unlikely to happen.

A few year ago to help address this problem, Mozilla changed a cname to point user to start.mozilla.org instead of google.com/firefox. While that is great that they aren't using googe.com/firefox a much, when those user upgrade, they have their homepage still set a start.mozilla.org.

I recommend that we add some code to the latest Firefox such that when Firefox find value matching regex .*(www\.google\.com/firefox|start\.mozilla\.org).* that we override the value in browser.startup.homepage to about:home. We are actively trying to get user to upgrade their browser and it appears that even after upgrading from an old version of Firefox to a recent version, their homepage are still being set of these values.

The current experience is not good for user or Mozilla. Why? Google.com/firefox ha broken UX/content and start.mozilla.org isn't much better. If we combine about:home and about:newtab in the future, these user will also be left behind because of their hardcoded values.

We are currently running A/B test on start.mozilla.org to get old user (Firefox 3.6 and below) to update, but for some reason we have *lots* of Firefox 32 user that have their browser set to that homepage.

In the spirit of unifying our message and offering to our Firefox users, we should get this changed asap. We have successful about:home snippet campaign running and the user who have their homepage set a these value are not seeing those messages. Also, the design/branding on those legacy homepage are outdated.
