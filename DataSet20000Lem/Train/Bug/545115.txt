Firefox hang when showing specific page when nvidia nView tool enabled
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-AT; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de-AT; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

My PC is running nView, a tool included in the nvidia graphic driver package. This tool seems to inject some code into every application running in the window XP session.
With this tool loaded, firefox crash when displaying attached file demo_crash.htm and clicking the link on top of the page many time (5-7 times). The attached file demo_works.htm is almost the same but only one line of data in the table; is will not crash the browser.

I cannot find something wrong in the page. even the html validator http://validator.w3.org/ say it is ok.

There is also another person here having the same problem, but running Seamonkey:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.23) Gecko/20090825 SeaMonkey/1.1.18

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. you need nview tool to be enabled (the additional symbol in window frame)
1. open demo_crash.htm, stored locally or on a server
2. click to the link on top of the page 5-8 time
3. firefox hang and us 100% of one core of your cpu
4. when killing firefox now by task manager, another process will take 100%
5. you can loop step 4 forever, finally you will have to reboot your machine
Actual Results:
System is not useable anymore after doing this test until rebooting the system.

Expected Results:
Page should just display and not crash. Even in case there is an error in the page, the browser should not hang or crash but display some garbage or an error.

Version of my NVIDIA nView Desktop Manager is 6.14.10.11044, but had same problem also with an older version.

The same test page in Internet Explorer 7 ha no problem
