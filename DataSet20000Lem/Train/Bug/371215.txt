Copy and paste function work outside of Firefox, but when attempting to copy from one tab to another, one tab to the location, location bar to search field, etc.

And a of this sentence I am unable to use the arrow key to modify the text in this field. Ctrl-A also fails. I can not also use single-quote.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use Firefox for any amount of time
2. Something important happens to prevent normal functioning.
4. Attempt to copy-paste, or use a keyboard shortcut.
Actual Results:
Single-quote open the quicksearch function. Copy, paste, and ctrl-a simply fail with no feedback. The menu item for copy and paste are often greyed out, and when not greyed out will fail.

Expected Results:
I expect copy-paste to put thing in my system"s clipboard, and respond in a consistent manner to keyboard shortcuts.

This ha been a reoccurring problem. I wa a Linux user originally, and this problem showed up (not to the same frequency or severity) in FF version <1.5.
