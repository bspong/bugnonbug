Firefox 31 crash [@ OOM | small ] VERY frequently in mozalloc_handle_oom() in mozalloc_oom.cpp#L50
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20140716183446

Steps to reproduce:

I have many tab open most of the time. Just using standard release build of Firefix 31 and seeing many crashes. It's very difficult to single out one page which might be causing a crash. The step are:
1) Just open Firefox 31 and surf a a heavy user, open all sort of websites.
2) See a crash in mozalloc_handle_oom() in the file mozalloc_oom.cpp at line 50 ( mozalloc_abort(oomMsg);)

Here are some of the crash report id I submitted when it crashed:
bp-a2b3dead-bd09-4c74-8ed9-d726c2140820
bp-0baf8e1f-5071-4d05-b9ec-683482140820

bp-487798cf-c09e-4cd5-b5e4-4aaaf2140820


Actual results:

Firefox crash frequently with showing the Crash Reporter dialog. When you restart and 'Restore the session', the crash occurs again in a few minutes. Only if you close all page together and start a new session it doesn't happen for some time (to a couple of days)


Expected results:

It shouldn't have crashed. I don't know what this crash is related to. I have Quadro 600 Graphics card, if that helps.
