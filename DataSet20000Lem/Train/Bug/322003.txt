i've been trying to open several attachment (.jpg files). for i have no reason they haven't opened in the browser (maybe because of the server or forum settings). First i tryed to open them in a new tab, that seemed to be ok, but then i tryed to open one clicking to direct link in common way. After that ff failed.
- i use flashgot plugin;
- tryed to open a .jpg in external program (XnView).

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
1. try to open an attachment (.jpg) in a new tab clicking to central mouse button;
2. it hasn't opened by browser, i forced flashgot to open it in XnView;
3. then i tryed to open another attachment (also .jpg) in a common way - clicking to left mouse button (also using flashgot window);
4. after that ff failed.

Actual Results:
ff failed, i have no reason why...

Expected Results:
don't think it's ff's fault that attachment hadn't open in browser,
but the fact of ff ha faied - i think it's something with it is wrong.

i use plugins: flashgot, switchproxy, talkback (it doesn't work :-(), new tab button on tabbar, launchy, scrapbook, IE tab and some others...
