Steps to reproduce:

Visit "bugzilla.mozilla.org" and "https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/adblock-plus/?src=hp-dl-mostpopular" on two separate tabs.

Reset zoom on both tab (Ctrl-0, switch tab, Ctrl-0). Go to "addons", zoom twice (either Ctrl+"+" or Control-wheel). Full-page zoom kick in, a expected. This is "before.png".

Switch to bugzilla. Zoom a lot (5-6 zoom ticks). Full-page zoom work a expected a well.

Switch to addons again ("after.png"). Notice how text look bigger in places, and generally there are broken element (notice the icon in "add to collections", which contains spurious elements). As if the page wa zoomed, but incorrectly, in "text only" mode.

If you reset zoom, and zoom-in again, full-page zoom work a expected.





Expected results:

I tend to use zoom a lot. At some point in one of the 3x series this problem started to affect google.com in random ways. I would switch to google.com and the page would look completely broken, requiring me to reset the zoom and zoom-in/out again. Then I noticed that zooming in one of the google.com subdomains (news, maps, etc) affected the other tabs.

I wa finally able to reproduce it properly today.

This is probably related to "browser.zoom.updateBackgroundTabs" and "browser.zoom.siteSpecific" setting (which I didn't customize).
