I cleared all my cooky and instructed Firebird to ask confirmation when a site
want to set a cookie. Then I surfed to www.tomshardware.com. While the site is
loading, you have to confirm the acceptance of the cookies. After that, the
scrollbar at the right of the page doesn't accept any mouseclicks anymore, but
you can still scroll with the arrowkeys. After loading a new page, the problem
is gone.

The latest nigthly build didn't work right for me, but Mozilla 1.4 doesn't have
this problem.
