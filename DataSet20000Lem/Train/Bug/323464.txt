I keep getting unresponsive script message when going to the above indicated page. It doe not occur with other CBS Sportsline page that also update, such a http://www.sportsline.com/nhl/gamecenter/live/NHL_20060114_NYR@DET. The message return me to the problem page from whatever other page I happen to be viewing at the time...very annoying. The message instructs me to click "continue", to see if the script can be completed; or "end script" to end the script now. No matter what I click, and even when I "x" the message out or make it disappear from the screen by clicking whatever other page is underneath (on rare occasions, the message appears over the page I am viewing without returning me to the problem page), it return within 15 second or so. I am using a Compaq laptop with Windows XP. By the way, this doe not happen when I go to the same page in Internet Explorer (6.0 with service pack 2) or the AOL browser. I'm using a wireless G adapter and no matter what wireless network I access, the problem exists.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://cvfhl.hockey.sportsline.com/scoreboard/live using Firefox browser



Actual Results:
