Migrating from old Sync to Firefox Accounts not possible if password only remembered by Firefox but not user
With the old Firefox Sync, I could add a new device by just transcribing a generated code from one device to another. With the new Firefox Accounts mechanism, I needed to provide a password, so I generated one with "pwgen -s 20", pasted it in, and let Firefox remember it. I had my phone handy at the time, so I entered it there a well. Later, Firefox on my work laptop helpfully notified me that I'd migrated to Sync, and asked me to enter my email and password.

That's already not a great experience, since I intentionally have no idea what my password is; Firefox remembers that for me. It would have been nice if Firefox could have used the old Sync to propagate the new sync information, but in any case that wouldn't have helped if I wa setting up Accounts for the first time, so OK. I figured I could look it up in the password manager on my personal laptop when I got home.

So, when I got home, I opened my work and personal laptop side-by-side, intending to transcribe the password from the password manager in Firefox on my personal laptop into the Firefox Accounts dialog on my work laptop. Except that the password manager on my personal laptop just know a JSON object containing a version, sessionTokenContext, kA, and kB, not my actual password. That's probably a security feature, except it leaf me unable to set up sync on my work laptop without going through the "forgotten password" flow. (I haven't forgotten it; I intentionally never knew it, and I intend to keep it that way; Firefox is quite capable of remembering a password far longer and more secure than I could memorize.)

(This is the same flow I use for all passwords: generate a secure password, paste it in, let Firefox remember it, let Sync propagate it across devices.)
