Returning 0 from NPP_WriteReady affect future streams?

Returning 0 from NPP_WriteReady in my application change how Firefox behaves in the future.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
In my application
1. I open a stream to a url using NPN_GetURLNotify.
2. As needed (my application doe not need more data) I return 0 from NPP_WriteReady. This should make the browser to try again later to send the data. It seems to work a expected.
3. However, when I press the Reload Current Page button in the browser, my application open the a stream to same url a in 1, but this time the browser doe not send me any data at all. It doe not call NPP_Write.

This only happens if I have returned 0 from NPP_WriteReady. If I return any other value, the stream keep working after I have pressed Reload. So, somehow returning 0 in that function affect how Firefox behaves sometime in the future.

Do you think this is possible?

Another minor thing that I noticed is that if I return 1 from NPP_WriteReady my application seems to get stuck, because the browser keep calling NPP_WriteReady and NPP_Write in a quite tight loop.
Actual Results:
After pressing Reload, the browser doe not call NPP_Write anymore.

Expected Results:
The web page/application should work in the same way a before pressing Reload.
