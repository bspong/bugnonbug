Firefox: (GPU spiking bad) The gpu spike uncontrollably on Firefox
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.0) AppleWebKit/535.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/16.0.912.77 Safari/535.7

Steps to reproduce:

Anything


Actual results:

I currently use a Geforce GTX 560ti (01G-P3-1460-KR). The problem is if I do anything such a scrolling or any page loading, even editing/designing webpage with firebug, the gpu spike intensively. This also occurs on v10, assuming it doe on v11 and so on.

Now before anyone get assumption or "idea's", you should know I am a specialist with computers, meaning my computer is optimized down to the very "bone". I a well have aero turned off (custom theme), "gfx.direct2d.disabled -true" set true and the "GPU acceleration" is off. I am sure this is a driver issue or a program issue itself due to I have 4 other browser and they behave, properly.

To be specific, I idle at 35c°-36c°, with intensive Directx10/11 game play, I get it up to 45 if that. I know this because I use EVGA precision and have for sometime now, before this GPU even. Now when I do anything pretty much with Firefox, it just spike like *****. Load a webpage, scroll a webpage, edit a webpage, anything that would trigger a spike, doe and seems to not have a leach on it when it doe and just take off.


Expected results:

Spikes from 35c°-36c° to 42c° approximately when anything occurs, this includes editing a webpage, scrolling a webpage, loading a webpage, pretty much anything that would trigger spikage, does.
