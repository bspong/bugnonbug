RSS feed with corrupted link (new bug since Firefox 1.5)
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-GB; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060918 Firefox/2.0

I am routinely using three RSS feed via Live Bookmarks. When I upgraded from Firefox 1.5 to 2.0 one of them ha all entry corrupted in the form of double entries: each link in the feed is exacactly the concatenation of the correct link with itself. This happens with all entry in the the RSS feed of the Italian newspaper La Repubblica http://www.repubblica.it/rss/homepage/rss2.0.xml, but not with two other feed I am using: http://www.spiegel.de/schlagzeilen/rss/0,5291,,00.xml and http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/front_page/rss091.xml. Reverting to the version 1.5 cure the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.repubblica.it/rss/homepage/rss2.0.xml
2. add a live bookmark to bookmark toolbar folder
3. click on the RSS feed and open any link

Actual Results:
The link will produce an error message from the Repubblica pages. When you analyse the link that the browser actually tried to open, you will see that it is actually the concatenation of a valid link with itself. Deleting the second half from the link give the valid link.



I have not done any check with other RSS feeds.
