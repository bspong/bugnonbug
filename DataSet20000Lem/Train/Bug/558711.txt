crash during Save Image As on Google Images

While using Google IMAGE search, when I right click and "Save Image As," Firefox crash with increasing frequency. However, I cannot be sure that it is the "Save Image As" function or something else like using the back arrow during Google IMAGE search (not the regular search)

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Google Image Search
2.Select a picture to view
3.Click on View Image (no need to wait for initial page to load)
4.Right-click Save Image As
5.Save image to hard drive
6.After downloading, click the Back button on the search bar twice
7.Repeat
Actual Results:
Crash Report occurs with increasing frequency. Initially, it started after about 10-15 searches, then every 10 searches, then every 5 searches, then every other search. Sometimes the crash occurs before the picture downloads, sometimes it occurs when I hit the back button. When the crash report window appears after re-booting Firefox, the problem continued to re-occur whether I selected to start a new search or if Firefox restored my session.

Expected Results:
Download image, then after clicking the back button twice, return to the Google Image Search Page Results.

Firefox created a crash report for every crash that occurred. The Add-On's I have installed are Weave, Bell Monitor Client, Google Update, iTunes Application Detector, Adobe Acrobat, Java Development Toolkit 6.0.180.7, Java Platform SE 6-U18, Microsoft DRM for Netscape Network Object and Store Netscape Plug-in, Quick Time Plug-in7.6.6, Shockwave Flash, Windows Media Player Plug-in Dynamic Link Library, Windows Presentation Foundation. Additionally, Meta-stream 3 Plug-in ha been grayed out and contains the text, "disabled for your protection." I do not know if any of these plug-in contributed to the problem.
