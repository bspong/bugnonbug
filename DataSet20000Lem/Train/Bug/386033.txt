If you set the system language in Mac OS X to Turkish, some Turkish character are not correctly displayed. The character our QE reported and I confirmed are:

U+011F(&#287;): LATIN SMALL LETTER G WITH BREVE - displayed a Euro sign
U+015F(&#351;): LATIN SMALL LETTER S WITH CEDILLA - displayed a a ligature of f and l

There might be more character not shown correctly.

I tired to create sample HTML file in some text encoding - UTF-8, Windows-1254 and also numeric entity in ISO-8859-1 - and the result are same in all of them. Strangely, they are displayed correctly in the title bar (by specifying <title/> element) but not in HTML body.

I'll attach a screen shot and sample HTML files.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open System Preferences and select International.
2. If Turkish (actually "Türkçe") is not in the list "Languages" on the left, lick "Edit List...".
3. Check "Türkçe" in the list and click OK. (see the attachment SystemPref.png)
4. Drag "Türkçe" to the top in the language list.
5. Once log out then log in again.
6. Launch Firefox and open sample HTML file I attach.

Actual Results:
U+011F(&#287;) is displayed a Euro currency sign.
U+015F(&#351;) is displayed a a ligature of small letter "f" and "l".


Expected Results:
These character should be displayed correctly.
