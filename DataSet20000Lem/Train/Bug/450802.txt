Firefox freeze when watching a video on heute.de
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008070208 Firefox/3.0.1

My problem is that it is nigh impossible to watch the news on heute.de without the browser freezing.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit heute.de
2. Start a video (I tested it with this one: http://www.zdf.de/ZDFmediathek/content/563042?inPopup=true )
3. Select "Windows Media Player" and "DSL -oder Breitbandverbindung". The Window Media Player Plugin must be installed, of course.
4. When the video is loaded the video may stop playing at some point and the browser may freeze shortly thereafter if you don't close the tab/window immediately. Alternately, skip to another point in the video. The video won't start again at the selected point, but the browser will freeze soon after it.
Actual Results:
The browser freezes.

Expected Results:
The video should play normally, I should be able to skip from one point of the video to another one.

The bug both happens with a long used session over many browser restarts and with a new one.

I have the following plugins installed:

Microsoft Windows Media Player Firefox Plugin
Mozilla Default Plug-In
Quicktime Plugin 7.4.5
RealPlayer Version Plugin 6.0.12.46
RealPlayer G2 Live Connect-Enabled Plug-In
Shockwave Flash 9.0 r124 [deactivated]
VLC Multimedia Plugin Version 0.8.6f [deactivated]
