I can get the pogo.com website no problem but when I try to enter a game room the room appears to lock up and when I click on it I get a "not responding" message and I have to close Firefox down. I've had no trouble with any other website I've visited with Firefox. Have pogo.com set a "allow" so that shouldn't be the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Sign into pogo.com
3.Try entering a game room
Actual Results:
The pogo.com website load properly and so doe the game room list, but when I click on a room to enter it, the screen for the room open up but doe not load. It just stop loading and say "not responding",and I have to shut down Firefox.

Expected Results:
Game room load and I can play the game.

I haven't had problem with other website and can access the pogo.com game room on Internet Explorer but I prefer using Mozilla Firefox.
