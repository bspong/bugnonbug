Manually restore window at end of browser_minimize to avoid breaking rest of suite if test fails

Feel free to WONTFIX if you want, a it doesn't affect the test slave - it only affect me when trying to run browser-chrome locally...

Unity/Compiz currently ha a bug where it doesn't notify window that they have been minimized. This break browser_minimize.js - a expected. However, although the browser-test focus (and hence raises) the window at the end of each test, the lack of a restore call mean our internal widget state continues to report "minimized". This cause all kind of wackiness and thus test failures. For example, all the PopupNotifications test fail, a layout won't display popups in a minimized window. Running TEST_PATH=browser/base/content/test make -C obj mochitest-browser-chrome, this cause 41 failures, all fixed by this patch.

Having looked at SetSizeMode in the widget code for the various platform (which is where we end up during window.restore, it's essentially a NOP when the window is already restored.

I considered also throwing this in waitForWindowState in the harness, but wasn't convinced it wa really necessary for 1 test running under 1 particular window manager.
