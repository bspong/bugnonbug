Right click on a link.

In selection 1,2 and 4 the word `Link' is used to refer to the target. In
selection 3 and 5 the word 'Link' is used to refer to URL, while in selection 6
the different term 'Link location' is used to refer to URL. I find this
inconsistent and confusing. Am I saving the target or the URL? Am I sending the
URL or the target? What is the difference between a link and a link location?


Expected Results:
I suggest the following

Open in New Window
Open in New Tab

--------------------

The word 'Link' is consistently (and only) used to reference the URL. To make
the distinction even clearer action on the target are grouped above the divider
while action on the URL are below it. The confusing extra word 'location' ha
been eliminated. the unneccessary word 'this' ha also gone. the result is a
simple clear menu free of `link' confusion.
