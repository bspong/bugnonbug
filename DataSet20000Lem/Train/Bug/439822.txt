If a dark skin (that is, one with light text on a dark background rather than the standard dark on light) is used for Windows XP, the slight shading around the back and forward button doe not shade properly. Specifically, the bottom half of the faux-indentation surrounding these indentation remains a bright white while the rest of the Firefox interface is properly colored to the darker color specified by the system. Apparently this portion of the UI is hardcoded rather than drawing it color information from the system settings.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set the system color setting to a dark theme. Easiest to do with Windowblinds, but doable manually given enough patience.
2. Check the color of the border around the back and forward buttons.
Actual Results:
The border remains colored a if the system were using a light skin.

Expected Results:
The border should draw it color information from the system color like the rest of the default theme does.
