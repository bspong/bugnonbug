Back and forward button on a new tool bar used to look small like 2 block next to each other. now they look like they normally do on the navigation bar the back button is huge. I think all the button got bigger may just be me. I don't like how back and forward button are bigger here's a picture of my toolbar. http://s179.photobucket.com/albums/w310/a_monkey_z/?action=view&current=FirefoxBug.png . It's only like this on the default Firefox 3.5 stratum theme. I have the latest update for Firefox 3.5 RC.

Pretty much I wa wondering if you could make it like it used to be small and slim on a new toolbar. If I wanted big and bulky I would use the normal Navigation bar.

Simply put: I created a new tool bar and put back and forward button on it they used to be small when I did this now they are big like on normal navigation bar.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create a new toolbar
2.Move Back and Forward button onto it
3.You will see that they are big unlike they used to be in Beta 4 and Firefox 3
Actual Results:
This happened http://s179.photobucket.com/albums/w310/a_monkey_z/?action=view&current=FirefoxBug.png

Expected Results:
I don't have a picture of the way it used to be but it used to be that the back and forward button looked like 2 small forward button

Please change back the icon used to be small now they are big.

By the way every time I go to http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html Firefox keep timing out so I had to go here
