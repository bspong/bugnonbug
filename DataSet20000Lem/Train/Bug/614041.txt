Browser ha wrong scale on drawing area after changing window size
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7

As shown in the picture, the left size is when the firefox ha just been started. After I change the window size by taking it out from maximize, the drawing area scale incorrectly compared to the area it uses. The mouse actually register component according to the actual area, but the window itself is drawn on smaller area. If I restart firefox, it us that size for the window a base, and doe the wrong scaling according to it.

This problem ha something to do with NVIDIA drivers, because when I installed new driver from 197.77 to 260.99, the time after the window uninstalled older drivers, and I didn't have any driver at all, the firefox wa working properly, but after the new version of NVIDIA driver were installed, the problem reappeared.

My guess is, that this ha something to do with the NVIDIA drivers, and using non-native resolution. Since I am using VGA-cable, I have no option to distinct between using NVIDIA own scaling, or letting my monitor to do the scaling for me.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Start firefox
2.Change the window size
3.
Actual Results:
The area reserved for firefox wa bigger, than the area where the image of the webpage wa drawn.

Expected Results:
The drawn area should be same size a the window size, not scaled wrongly.
