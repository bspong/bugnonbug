The problem is that firefox doe not redraw it interface or page content
correctly.

Screenshot: http://aserv.ownage.org.uk/firefox.PNG

As can be seen, in the screenshot, it redraws some thing if the mouse is moved
over them (buttons, text field etc) and it will redraw text if you select it.
It will also redraw area where another window covered it (aslong a it didn't
cover the WHOLE interface) Resizing the window down to a seemingly randomly
small size make everything work properly. Scrolling the window will make
anything that move up/down to the viewing area get drawn correctly.

Other people i know have had the same problem, a well a people on the
mozillazine forum.

The problem still exists in the release firefox-1.0+.en-US.win32.installer.exe

and ha existed for quite a while now (around 0.7 i think it started)

If you want me to run any debug versions, or older versions, or give more info,
just ask and i will provide what i can.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave window running for a while with a few apps open
2. Open firefox
3. After a while the interface refuse to draw (at around 450mb ram usage with
1024 or 512mb ram)
