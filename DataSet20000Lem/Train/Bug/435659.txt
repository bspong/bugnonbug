First-party FAVICON cookie behavior change with third-party cookie setting.

GRC's forthcoming browser cookie handling analyzer demonstrates some odd Firefox v3 behavior that is going to result in question and should be easy to fix. Specifically ...

o With third-party cooky disabled, FFv3 is NOT *accepting* first-party
cooky with FAVICON reply (but you are for CSS content).

o With third-party cookie enabled, FFv3 IS accepting first-party cooky with
both FAVISON and CSS content replies.

o And if third-party cooky are THEN disabled, you are RETURNING an "old" (stale) cookie that you previously accepted during the FAVICON query when third-party cooky were enabled. GRC's cookie forensics page show this a an orange colored (stale) cookie.

This is NOT a privacy concern, of course, since you have third-party cookie leakage nailed down tight under FFv3. But the behavior demonstrates an oddness that's going to make people wonder what's going on.

Thanks for your attention and consideration.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable third-party cooky in FFv3

2. Go to GRC's cookie forensics page: http://www.grc.com/cookies/forensics.htm

3. Page will show all type of first-party session and persistent cooky "green" -- meaning that they were just exchanged between your browser and our server. Page will also show all type of third-party session and persistent cooky "red" -- meaning that they were also just exchanged between your browser and our server.

4. Change FFv3 to NOT accept third-party cooky then either click "Reread Cookies" button or reload the page.

5. You will now see that all third-party cooky are absent (Very Good) and all first-party cooky are green ... *EXCEPT* for the Favicon cookie (ICON) which will show ORANGE. The "Oldest Cookie" field will also show the age of that stale Favicon cookie. This indicates that GRC's server is still *receiving* the cookie that it originally *set* in the browser when third-party cooky were being accepted, but that the cookie is no longer being set.

As I wrote above, this is NOT a "big" deal -- but it's weird -- and FFv3's cookie handling would be *perfect* if the acceptance of first-party Favicon cooky wa not, for some reason, tied to FF's acceptance of third-party cookies.
Actual Results:
First-party cooky are not being accepted with Favicon query reply when third-party cooky are disabled.

Expected Results:
First-party cookie handling should not be affected by the setting of third-party cookie handling. ONLY the Favicon reply are affected in this way.
