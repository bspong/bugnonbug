After Firefox restore, one tab per window is missing.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 5.0

When I upgraded from FF4 to FF5 and restarted FF, I found the 1st window wa OK but all subsequent window had the LH tab missing. Also, the "open a new tab" tab wa on the extreme LHS of the bar instead of the RHS.

I wa able to open the missing tab by using "list all tabs" drop-down menu and clicking on the top item, which wa the missing tab. Although the page displayed the tab belonging to it wa still missing.

If I opened a new tab by clicking on a hyperlink on the page belonging to the hidden tab, the new tab opened to the left of the "open a new tab" tab. Moving tab around on one side or the other of that latter tab wa possible but it wa not possible to move from L to R or R to L of the tab.

All this occurred on openSUSE 11.4 (x64). I then installed 12.1 (x32) on the same machine and FF5 seemed to work on that so I wondered whether it wa a 64-bit thing. At first, FF5 seemed OK after a 11.4 (x32) installation but this all proved illusory a FF5 exhibited the same problem on both 32-bit system after closing and reopening FF - either after a requested or automatic restore of all window and tabs. I have FF configured to remember the last status on closedown rather than the home-page.

In FF5, I've tried reconfiguring one of the affected window so that all the tab are visible and in the correct order - deleting them and reopening them - but when I close FF down, perhaps by logging out and logging on again, the corrected window is in the same mess a before.

When I de-install FF5 and return to FF4, all the tab are visible and back in the right place.

Reproducible: Always
