I use Netscape a my ISP. When I run "FIREFOX" a my browser I am continually
prompted to disconnect from the service. This happens mostly when I click on a
saved bookmark, home page icon on the toolbar, opening the sidebar menu, or my
e-mail link on my home page. This doe not happen with Netscape's browser or IE.
It frequently hang or freeze when I choose not to disconnect, causing me to
force a shutdow and restart.

Reproducible: Always

I have to force a shutdown and restart. My system report that the browser is
not responding and all I have found that I can do is to force a shutdown and
restart.

Expected Results:
There should be a smooth transition to my selection without the repeated
annoying prompt almost every time I try to navigate to to one of the above
mentioned site or link to them. It should not cause a software freeze.
