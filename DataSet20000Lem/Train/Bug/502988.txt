Setting browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll to true cause eratic behavior in address bar when Firefox left idle for a period of time
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060308 Ubuntu/9.04 (jaunty) Firefox/3.0.11

After setting browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll to true in about:config, the address bar exhibit strange behavior if Firefox ha been left idle for a while. The address function normally at first. After leaving Firefox idle for a while, 5 to 10 minute is usually sufficient, clicking the address bar will select the entire address, but typing result in only a few character being typed at best, highlighted, then overwritten by subsequent keystrokes. Typing random letter extremely rapidly and filling 10 or so letter seems to overtake this problem briefly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set browser.urlbar.clickSelectsAll to true
2. Leave Firefox alone and running for a period of time, 10 minute or so.
3. Click in the address bar and type a new address
Actual Results:
Only a few letter are typed, highlighted, then overwritten by next character typed.

Expected Results:
Should be able to type address completely

This ha been tested on multiple machine running Ubuntu Fiesty and Jaunty. Have not tried with other version of Linux.
