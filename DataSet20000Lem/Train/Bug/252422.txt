I installed the Java extension (flash already installed) and it wasn't
registering a installed on
http://das.reinvigorate.net/index.php?p=tm&time=1090407918 in Firefox v0.8 I
updated to v0.91 and the same problem occurs. I installed an older version of
Java a an extension (v1.4.2_05) and it registered and worked on the
reinvigorate.com traffic monitor until I installed the flash plugin, then it
said java wa not installed when I next visited the reinvigorate.com traffic
monitor. It look like the flash plugin is stopping the Java extension from
working or being recognised by this website. I think it's the plugin and not the
website that is at fault.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Install the Java extension
2.go to the reinvigorate.com traffic monitor, it should work even if you have to
be waiting on a server connection, it recognises the Java extension but tell
you to istall flash to view the chat bar on the right of the page
3.install flash plugin, go back to the traffic monitor page and it act like
Java ha not installed.

Actual Results:
just a I described it above.

Expected Results:
recognised both the Java extension for the traffic monitor and the flash plugin
should be able to display the chat window at the right. It seems that flash and
Java on the same page are not working together and they should.
