With Login to Belkin Routers, Firefox leaf out the entire left panel with all the link to router feature
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.6) Gecko/20070725 Firefox/2.0.0.6

I tried, using Firefox, to log in to a Belkin (4-port)Cable Router model F5D 5231-4, series 2000, bought 8 month ago, and also with a new series 3000 of the same model#, and with another new Belkin 4-port router, that is slightly larger but same model-family.

I tried this with one of my desktop computers, and also with a new WinXP Laptop -- same problem occurred. It only show part of the login page, leaving out all the important link to different router feature on the left side.
I had to use the Micro$uck Internet Distorter Browser to configure these routers. And I hate to use IE for anything!
I suppose I/we should complain to Belkin. They do seem to have excellent customer service, so far.
Thanks.
