firefox segfaults with flash even when you aren't actively browsing/viewing anything

When using firefox with flash in linux with several tab open some flash heavy I can reproduce every single time firefox segfaulting. Usually I can be on a completely different desktop and it will still crash, it doesn't seem to be related to any specific site, or to any specific action on my part. It just 'eventually happens'. With numerous flash heavy site open in tab it is possible to crash firefox immediately on startup when running through gdb.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install flash
2. have several flash heavy site open (youtube etc.)
3. wait (sometimes hours, however with 23 tab open 2 youtubes, pandora, and a few other misc. flash heavy site open I could reproduce it every time during startup running through gdb.)
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes, the crash reporter doesn't load (i think that's a reported bug elsewhere), and the output to console without gdb is 'Segmentation Fault'.

Expected Results:
Firefox not crashing

I have heard from some linux irc channel that they also experience odd problem with firefox dissapearing however it seems to be a small group probably due to the fact that a level of use that some would call excessive is required to reproduce the results..however this is to me normal browsing.

Attached is the output from gdb from one occasion of reproducing the crash with several flash heavy site during startup.
