toolbar keyboard navigation work strangely
As part of bug 1278473, I experimented a bit with keyboard navigation in the
toolbar. This wa added in bug 1242852.

I'm using Linux. STR:

* Open devtools
* Move mouse over "Inspector" tab on toolbar
* Press right arrow
=> Focus move to "Console" tab, good.
* Press left arrow once
=> Back to "Inspector", good.
* Press left arrow again
=> Focus disappears. I wa expecting it to move to the "Pick an element from the page"
button; or, failing that, perhaps to somewhere else on the toolbar

* Press right arrow a number of time
=> Focus move smoothly through toolbar tabs. Good so far...
* ... but keep pressing it and, for me, it eventually disappears.

It work fine through the "normal" tabs: Inspector, Console, Debugger,
Style Editor, Canvas, Performance, Memory, Network Monitor.
Then it disappears.
If I keep pressing the right arrow key while the focus is gone, I
eventually see the focus reappear on the Toolbox Options button.
If I press right arrow again after this, it disappears again for good.


I wa expecting this to either work a bit more like Tab, or to just cycle
through the various item on the toolbar.

Also, a similar toolbar in the inspector also allows arrow navigation, but
work differently. With the top-level toolbar, moving focus between the
button with the arrow key ha no other effect; whereas in the rule view,
moving between Rules/Computed/Animations/Forms using the arrow key ha
the side effect of displaying the content corresponding to that tab.
I don't know which is preferable but I do think they ought to work the same.
