When visiting PWInsider.com, using No Script (latest version), I found that enabling pwinsider.com's script cause Firefox memory usage to balloon to over 1GB within 5 minutes. Ran seperate test with No Script uninstalled and had same result. Not using any other add-ons. Have been seeing this on several other site lately (high or extreme memory usage), but this is the first time I've been able to resolve it by blocking the site's script. Disabling pwinsider.com instantly put my memory usage back to normal and Firefox wa again usable.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit PWinsider.com, something on that page is causing memory issue that are not present in IE or Chrome.
2. Using No Script, allow pwinsider.com, watch memory usage skyrocket.
3. Turn off pwinsider.com in No Script, watch rocket land.
Actual Results:
Firefox returned to normal memory usage and all were happy and glad.

Expected Results:
Not sure hwo to answer this.....
