At above URL frequently only the heading appears. Can send screen print. Balance of screen is just white. URL work fine with IE. Seems to happen when a site is repeatedly accessed. Sometimes other URLs produce only site map and actual site/page content cannot be accessed. This happened in version prior to Firefox 3.6 and continues in 3.6.

Here is the link I click on to get this URL:

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Happens almost every time I try to access this website which I do daily
2.With other website it happens after accessing several time in short period of time
3.Do not know anymore about how to reproduce it. It just happens.



The URL above should show a digital version of the National Post with a menu system to select other newspapers. I have used it for year but only recently (last 6 mo.??) it ha been failing to work properly.
