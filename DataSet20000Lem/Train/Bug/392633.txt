Search bar with a suggesting search plugin:

No suggestion are not shown when the answering server is comparatively slow and the user type too fast. It appears, that the asynchronous communication may break under such conditions.

Let me explain mny observation and give a suggestion for solution, which work well in other programms:

The developer are ask to check the XHR module and to make that specific client-server communication more robust. I suggest to use a lastsentrequest variable and _resubmit the XHR also from inside the _callback handler on the condition that the currentinputfield <> lastsentrequest. This is the condition that the user typing is overtaking the meanwhile outdated server response.

Simply fire a new request from inside the callback handler (if the input field ha changed since the XHR).


Reproducible: Always
