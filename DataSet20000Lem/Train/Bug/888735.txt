I have already tried various things, like cleaning cache in FF, cleaning cache in Adobe Flash Player, updating Flash Player, updating Graphics Driver, ...

I have opened a bug report on Adobe Bugtracker:
https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3552799

There wa a workaround, by pressing "Pop up",
where a new windows, perhaps a different player wa opened,
but this menu item is meanwhile not more available.

Meanwhile there wa another user which had tried the following
without success:

Things he ha tried:
- ReInstalling latest Firefox
- ReInstalling latest Flash Player
- Using other Users
- Starting Firefox in Save Mode
- Installing Flash Player Beta
- Installing Firefox Beta and Aurora
- Updating Video Card Drivers
- Using old Video Card Drivers
- Deleting any Cache and Cookies
- Restoring Firefox and Flash default
- Enabled and Disabled Hardware Acceleration
- Enable and Disable Flash Player Local Storage

He write
"This problem occurs just under Firefox; Chrome and IE work well."
I see the problem also in Firefox, even latest 22.0.
I assume it is combination of firefox, Google Youtube and ?




Actual results:

Error message: "An error occured. please try again later"


Expected results:

Video shall be playing
