After bookmarking the JavaScript "Shell" bookmarklet provided at http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html (which work fine), one can not edit the property of said bookmark. Attemping to open the property dialog in the bookmark-manager result in either
a) complete lock-up of Firefox or
b) sometimes the application even crashes.

This bug wa only reproducible with the JS shell bookmarklet, but not with other bookmarklets from said website.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to: http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html
2. Bookmark the "shell" bookmarklet (bookmark method doesn't sem to matter)
3. Open bookmark-manager
4. locate "shell" bookmarklet
5. Attempt to open property dialog for the bookmarklet

Actual Results:
Firefox lock up completely, sometimes even crash immediately.

Expected Results:
The bookmarklet's property dialog is shown.

My original goal wa to assign a keyword to the bookmarklet, and in an attempt to work around this bug I tried to manually assign a keyword (SHORTCUTURL) to the bookmarklet by modifying bookmarks.html. However, when I try to use the bookmark keyword in the location-bar, Firefox crash everytime.

Also tested with an empty firefox profile, with same results.
