The bookmark toolbar is empty if you close the original window while the new
one is opening.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new window from an existing one (File > New Window; Open Link/Bookmark
in New Window, etc.)
2. Before the new window opens, close the original window used to spawn the new one
(You'll need another window open (another browser window, downloads manager,
DOMI, etc.) to keep the process alive after you close the first window)
Actual Results:
Bookmarks Toolbar is empty. Menus break after customize.

Expected Results:
Bookmars are there like normal.
