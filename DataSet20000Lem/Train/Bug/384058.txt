After I opened Gran Paradiso to see if a theme worked, the browser crashed.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9a5) Gecko/20070606 GranParadiso/3.0a5

I opened Firefox to see how my theme looked - Great! - Then I open Gran Paradiso to see how to it looked - The browser did not open it just said : Crash! Boom! blah blah blah.... I reported the bug and tried to open Gran Paradiso again, still same problem. This kept on repeating until I opened Firefox then went to Gran Paradiso again. But my theme wasn't working on Gran Paradiso. I close Gran Paradiso and open Firefox and the theme worked.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Reported the error
2. Open Firefox - Then close
3. Re-open Gran Paradiso
Actual Results:
Gran Paradiso opened, but did not use the selected theme although the theme wa compatible with 3.0a5

Expected Results:
Gran Paradiso would open but closer quickly after the opening.

I wa using myFirefox. Opening Gran Paradiso will sometimes open with a default theme.
