New Window in New Tab Setting change in 3.6.4
I work at a company who develops an online application which is flash based. Previous to the 3.6.4 update, we had no problem with Firefox. After yesterday's update, the application still run fine but doesn't open a new window correctly. Specifically, the user log into our site and launch the application. The application creates a new window which is fairly small (300x400 px). After yesterday's update, the application is opened in a new tab, rather than a new window - then resizes the browser to screen.availWidthx400 px.

There is a 'Open New Windows in a New Tab instead' setting under Tools >> Options... >> Tabs. It appears that this behavior ha changed. I've always had this setting enabled and our application always opened fine. In this case, since we're using Javascript to open the window, rather than a link, that it always opened in a new window.

If I disable this setting, then our application work the way we expect it to. However, this now change the behavior globally.

Has anyone else reported an unexpected change in this behavior? I didn't see anything about this in the release note or bug list.

I also noticed that this happens in other pages, not just our application.

Here's an example that ha the same problem, but isn't flash based:
http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/examples_im/example_01.php

After the page loads, there is a Insert/Edit image link that look like a tree. It's on the far left side on the toolbar of the application. Click it with and without the 'Open new window in new tab instead' option enabled. Before 3.6.4, it always opened in a separate, sized window. Now it only work if the setting is disabled. While enabled, it load in a new tab and resizes the browser.
