When viewing a page with multiple frames, moving the pointer over a frame set it a the target for scroll-wheel events, but it's necessary to click in the frame for it to receive keyboard page-up, page-down, home, and end.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to a site with multiple frame
2. Adjust window size so at least one frame ha a scroll bar
3. Click in a different frame
4. Hover mouse in the scrollable frame and use scroll wheel to scroll it
5. Press page-up and page-down key without moving mouse

Actual Results:
The frame the mouse is over scroll when the scroll wheel is moved. The frame that wa clicked in scroll when the keyboard is used, if it ha a scroll bar; otherwise, nothing happens.

Expected Results:
Scroll wheel and keyboard-based scrolling should use the same criterion to determine which frame they apply to.

One example of a page in which this is easily viewed is
