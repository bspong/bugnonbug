The error message suggesting removing page from session restore may not initially be required.
When I reopen a session I always get this message and used to give up at this point since removing page did not seem to help. However when ignoring this error message eventually the page all open.
Perhaps an alternative error message or different instruction could allow the system more time. Or perhaps the system could be changed to open one page at a time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Opened firefox after forced closure
2.Restored session fails and give suggestion to cut out some page - of course although I have no idea which page might have failed all I can do is close them one by one, trying to remember which relates to which information I want to look at again on the web site (THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE SESSION RESTORE).
3.Even closing page did not allow the other page to open.
4.Using restore seemed pointless so I stopped using firefox - other browser do cope with restoring.
5.At some point I just ignored the error message - the page DO eventually load.

6.Changing the error message OR the time sequence in the opening program may enable others to use the restore feature.
TKS Keith.
