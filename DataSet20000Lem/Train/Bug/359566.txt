The favicon will occasionally not update correctly. I have only found this to be a problem when changing from a tab which doe not have a favicon (i.e. default favicon). Subsequently hovering over a tab with it's own favicon will result in the default favicon remaining.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few tab with different favicons. Include one without a favicon (e.g. http://www.squarefree.com/burningedge/ )
2. Select some text on one of these pages.
3. Drag this text to the tab bar and hover over "The Burning Edge" tab and then over other tabs.

Actual Results:
After hovering over the "The Burning Edge" tab, favicons for other tab are not displayed when switching to them.

Expected Results:
Favicons correctly displayed

If there are two tab with the same favicon, hovering over these in succession will cause the favicon to be correctly displayed again, until switching to a tab with the default favicon again. In all other case the favicon appears to be correctly displayed.
