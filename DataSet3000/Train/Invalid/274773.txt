Middle-clicking non-hyperlinked areas of a page attempts to load from clipboard
This bug is only reproducible in Linux OS.
I get this annoyance every time I accidentally press middle button of the mouse
in the non-clickable part of a page and the browser attempts to load a page by
the address of what is previously stored in the clipboard, possibly resorting to
google to resolve a valid url and loading an arbitrary page in the process.
To reproduce the bug, just select a portion of text and copy it to clipboard.
Then middle-click the page and you see firefox attempting to resolve the text
you earlier copied to clipboard.
