When DOCTYPE is specified Firefox/Mozilla loads only css sheets with .css extension
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pl-PL; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pl-PL; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050414 Firefox/1.0.3

(I know this bug was reported, but it wasn't fixed)
Let's say, I want have this piece of code:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.php" />
It won't work if I have DOCTYPE on my page (doesn't matter if it is HTML or XHTML)
If I want to get it to work I have either:
1. Remove DOCTYPE
2. Change css.php to style.css
This bug is also present on Windows XP.
