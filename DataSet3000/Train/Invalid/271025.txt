Firefox acting weird with css headers
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041114 Firefox/1.0

The css file in the URL is not automatically handled by firefox: it asks the end
user what to do with it. However, on the link, http://www.tvland.com/shows/, the
file is loaded as CSS, and the javascript console for the web developer toolbar
says the file was gave a warning that the file was loaded as CSS, even though
the mime-type header for the file was application/x-pointplus.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox handles the same file in two different ways, most likely from ignoring
mime-type headers

Expected Results:  
Loaded the file as application/x-pointplus
