My windows ME machine and my Compaq are running Firefox nicely...better by far
than  IE.  I would appreciate a fix for this problem.  Thank you,  Lloyd



The problem is on a Toshiba 1805 notebook with XP Home edition.  I have recently
installed DeLorme Street Atlas 2003.  And I have been tweaking the security
systems a little.
The Virus block programs are AVG, SpywareBlaster, Spybot and ZoneAlarm. These
applications are also on the ME  and the Compaq and have not caused problems.
