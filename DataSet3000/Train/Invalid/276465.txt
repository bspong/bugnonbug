Mal-Design choice leads to lost email, bookmarks preferences &c.
In Windows in general the user has to sometimes delete the windows directory in
order to reinstall.  Depending on the nature and number of software loaded and
uninstalled this may be every two weeks to every year or so.

e.g. http://nytimes.com/2004/12/30/technology/circuits/30hard.html  Granted this
person is not too savvy about tech, she's an idiot actually, but still she is
writing tech columns for the NYT and so may be less clueless than the average
user.  You could also consult techtips.com or google to find that this is
recommended procedure.  

FireFox and Thunderbird seem to keep their user data in 
   %windir%\application data
This is not a design choice made by clear headed professionals for Windows.

Were the application data is stored someplace at user discretion then after
Windows has crashed terminally and is reinstalled the user could still have
their mail files, bookmarks, et cetera.

The way you have done it, all is needlessly lost.
