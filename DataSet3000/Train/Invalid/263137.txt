Mail button on my toolbar opens Gmail related items
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1

Whenever I press the 'Read Mail and News' button on my toolbar, the regular
options come up  "Read Mail" & "New Message".

If I choose Read Mail option, I am redirected to my Gmail inbox. If I choose New
Message, I am redirected to the Compose Mail page of my Gmail account.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press 'Read Mail and News' button on my toolbar
2. Choose one of the following options: Read Mail or New Message
3.

Actual Results:  
(Assuming I am signed in to my Gmail account) If I choose Read Mail option, I am
redirected to my Gmail inbox. If I choose New Message, I am redirected to the
Compose Mail page of my Gmail account.

Expected Results:  
Previously when I chose Read Mail, Thunderbird would come up. If I chose New
Message, a new message window would come up (similar to pressing Ctrl+M in
Thunderbird)

It's possible that this bug may have somethingto do with the Gmail Toolbar login
button as I do not remember having this problem before instaling that particular
extension. At one point, I disabled the Gmail Toolbar login button. 
Unfortunately, I was redirected to the page without the courtesy of being signed in.
