Firefox misunderstands '>' character in processing instructions (XHTML)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko)

In XHTML documents containing processing instructions (PIs), anything between 
'<?target' and '?>' should be ignored, and not rendered. (See XML spec at  
http://w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#sec-pi ).  
  
Unfortunately, if I have the following PI:  
  
   <?mkindex index  
   $name > operator  
   ?>  
  
Firefox renders "operator ?>" as part of the document's text. The XML spec 
clearly says that the PI ends at the first occurence of "?>", and that ">" is a 
legal character inside PIs. 
 
There is an example of this rendering problem at the URL given; look for the > 
operator description.
