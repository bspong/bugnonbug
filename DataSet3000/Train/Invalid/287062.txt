Java applet loading time is very large plus strange behaviour from JVM loader
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

This problem occurs also with FireFox 0.9.
I have Java Plug-in 1.5.0 Using JRE version 1.5.0 Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM
installed (also occurs with 1.4.1).
Please see steps to reproduce the problem.
When loading the "classic" game you are presented with the normal Sun java
placeholder, where you see the Java logo and a progress bar in red. This
progress bar normally fills up until the applet is loaded. However with Firefox
the progress bar continues pass the end and off the screen! The game does
eventually load. It appears also that the applet is not cached and loaded each
time. In IE this works totally normal.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto http://play3dpool.com
2.Click on the Pool table (8-ball)
3.Click on the "Goto Pool Hall" link.
4.Click on the "classic" game

Actual Results:  
As above:
"When loading the "classic" game you are presented with the normal Sun java

Expected Results:  
The progress bar normally fills up until the applet is loaded. Also the applet
should be cached.

The only thing that might be relavent this that the "European" game uses a
difference Obfuscation tool to the Classic to generate the jar.
