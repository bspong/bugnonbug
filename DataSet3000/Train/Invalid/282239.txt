Prog's tracking bug: Bugs that annoy Suite users switching to Firefox
Bug 246237 - "Ctrl+Backspace in the address bar is incorrectly handled..."
Bug 206175, INVALID - "Tabs (default Firefox theme) need a visual redesign"
Bug 187488, WONTFIX - "No site navigation bar (link navbar)"

Bug 216501, WONTFIX - "Ability to pick and choose file associations"
Bug 250587, WONTFIX - "Find Toolbar: Ctrl+F should close an already open find
toolbar" (not directly a Seamonkey-parity issue, but no issue with the modal
Find dialog)
Bug 280195, Bug 254961, Bug 251735, Bug 229343, Bug 241282 - Installer issues
Bug 172675 - "accel-click on personal toolbar does not open folder as a group of
tabs'
Bug 250309 - "allow disabling of Find Toolbar with Find As You Type"
Bug 250924, WONTFIX - "Find toolbar should expose full text/links-only find options"

The above bugs prevent me from from switching to Firefox, but are clearly not
the only ones that effect Seamonkey users. Feel free to add the ones you deem
important.
