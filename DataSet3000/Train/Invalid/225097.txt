When I try to access images that don't have there extension as the back of the
file name, they very often fail to be displayed.

Same with music files, like
"http://www.bless.se/?sid=release&pid=soundsample&id=398" links to a mp3 file,
yet it is displayed as code, this is only in some cases though, when you try
that same link with id=418, it will work.

All files work with Internet Explorer

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://galeon.com/burnin/mar (image)

Actual Results:  
The code will be shown.

Expected Results:  
Show the image / play the music file.
