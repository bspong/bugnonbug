two bugs for the price of one loading the page causes four instances to be loaded into history and mouseover causes constant loading
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0

To recreate the first bug fully...close and reopen firefox so that the browser 
has no current history...swoop on over to 
http://webpages.charter.net/xanadu/DragonsClaw/index_dc.htm
look at your history and notice that four instances of this site are loaded 
(this bug seems to be fixed in the nightly build)... for the second bug...the 
buttons at left are not links...they are simply buttons that when moused-over 
change the middle layer...the bug is this...when you mouse over the 
buttons...the message changes to "Waiting for webpages.charter.net..." and the 
progress bar is lighted as if though it were transferring something...this 
doesnt happen until you first mouse over a button...it doesnt go away after you 
move your mouse away and stays this way until you refresh the page

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just read
2. the 
3. details

Actual Results:  
again read the details

Expected Results:  
the layers should change without any constant loading necessary but maybe im 
just dumb and should never have built a webpage that works in that fashion
