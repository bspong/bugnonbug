I was trying to download JBuilder foundation edition from Borland web site and 
ran into this problem.

From URL http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_jbuilder.html#, 
click "Foundation" link. It brings a popup window which immediately displays 
message box saying

The connection was refuced when attempting to contact ussvs-bes1.borland.com

After this, Firefox gets frozen. I cannot click any buttons or move any 
windows. It unfreezes after several seconds. 

Reproducible: Always
