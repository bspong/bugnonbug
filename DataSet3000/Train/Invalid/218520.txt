When using the alternate stylesheet where at the default stylesheet the page has
a definition for hover for contextual styles (div#main p:hover) and at the
alternate stylesheet it doesn't define it again, this hover will remain at the
alternate stylesheet. Then the new stylesheet must redefine it (div#main
p:hover) and give the same values as the class so the hover won't happen.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a page with a link to the main style (style.css)
2. Create a contextual class div#main p { color:Black; }
3. Add a contextual class to this last with hover: div#main p:hover {
background: Blue; }
4. Create an "alternate stylesheet" appoint to style2.css and add it to the page
with title="another style"
5. Only define the contextual class: div#main p { color: Yellow; }
6. Browse the page, move the cursor over the paragraph inside div#main and see
that it changes its background color
7. Change the style at the bottom menu to "another style"
8. Move the cursor over the paragraph inside div#main and see that it continues
 changing its background color.

Actual Results:  
It continues changing its background color even that style2.css don't define a
hover class.

Expected Results:  
I think that it should clear all style definitions and read only from the
alternate style without the need to redefine them, but I don't know what are the
standards to this operation, or, if I do need to redefine all hover that I
defined at the main style.
