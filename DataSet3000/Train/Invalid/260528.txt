Firefox doesn't open, or takes a very long time to open.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)
Build Identifier: FirFox 1.0 Preview Release

I installed the Magpie tools and Dom Inspector from the tools available option 
in the firfox 1.0 and after that, the browser became very slow.  It takes 
about 10 seconds for the browser to open before it would take less then a 
second.  Sometimes, the browser just opens but I can’t go to any websites. It 
stops responding. 

Also, when the browser is trying to load a page and i exit it then when i try 
to open the browser again, the process gets started but the browser does not.  



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. double clicked on the browser, it opens but i can't navigate to any 
websites.  My bookmarks are not showing and i can't type a link.
2. Went to washingtonpost.com click on a popup link and exited the browser, 
doubling on the browser fails to open the browser.
3.

Actual Results:  
1.  it opens but i can't navigate to any websites.  My bookmarks are not 
showing and i can't type a link.
2. doubling on the browser fails to open the browser.
