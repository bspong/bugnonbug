css files not correctly loaded
Hi,

i use firefox since his fist release, but in this time there was no update 
which fixed this bug....

i have a w3c conform css stylesheet an in opara an IE6 it is correctly loaded 
and the page works, but with firefox i have several problems.

for example, dimension data are not correctly displayed, the scrollbar is not 
working (i do not mean an colored scrollbar, i mean the scrollbar itself is not 
there!)
a php loop which lists some data in several boxes does not become its border, 
the borders are all on the first box instead 

there are many more, but i don't know why mozilla/firefox doesn'n support css 
correctly

I hope u'll find the bug i mean

sincerely yours
eMs
