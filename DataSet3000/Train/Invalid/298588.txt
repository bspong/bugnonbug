When hitting return after entering an URI in the URI input field in the main
window (i.e. not in the dialog opened by the "Inspect a URL..." menu entry), the
inspection does not start automatically. Instead, one first has to press the
"Inspect" button to start.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter URI in URI input field in main window
2. Press return key

Actual Results:  
Nothing.

Expected Results:  
Specified URI should get loaded for inspection.
