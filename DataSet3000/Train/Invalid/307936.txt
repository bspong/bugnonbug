Taskbar icon is incorrect (Deer Park) for Firefox when "Grouped"
Not sure if i've missed a dupe (likely) or if this is the wrong component
(likely again) but here goes.

In 1.5beta1 on WinXP, the taskbar icon is correct for FF with one window open. 
But if I open enough windows to get WinXP to collect into a Group, the icon for
the group is the Deer Park one.
