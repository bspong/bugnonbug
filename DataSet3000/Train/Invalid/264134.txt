Missing buttons and other graphics in etrade web pages

The etrade web site is unusable with Firefox because many buttons and
other graphics are invisible.  I used to access etrade with Mozilla but
it has been a while and they may have changed their web site.  So this
may be an evangelism issue.  

But they are a fairly high-profile site and it is not good if Firefox can
not view it.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Delete all cookies for any etrade domain (us.etrade.com, www.etrade.com etc.)
2. Enter https://us.etrade.com into the address bar and press ENTER
3.

Actual Results:  
Missing buttons, such as the orange "LOG ON" button under the
username/password fields.  

I will try to attach screen shots showing Firefix vs. Internet Explorer
(FF on Linux, IE on Windows XP)
