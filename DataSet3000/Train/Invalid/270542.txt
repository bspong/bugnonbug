When I click on the hotmail link in the 'bookmarks toolbar', the webpage opens
up in my 'sidebar' which previously contained all my bookmarks.  When I click on
the same link in the bookmark held in my sidebar, or if I manually type the URL
into the address bar - the page correctly opens in the main page...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select View/Sidebar/Bookmarks
2. Go to www.hotmail.com
3. Bookmark Hotmail 
4. Drag Hotmail bookmark from sidebar to 'bookmarks toolbar'
5. Go to any other site
6. Click on hotmail bookmark in 'bookmarks toolbar'
7.  Restore sidebar by going to View/Sidebar/Bookmarks
8. Click on hotmail bookmark in sidebar - should not replace sidebar content
9. Go to any other site
10. Manually type in URL to address bar - should not replace sidebar content
11.  Check other links in 'bookmark toolbar' - should not replace sidebar content

Actual Results:  
All sidebar content is replaced by Hotmail website content - main page is unaffected

Expected Results:
