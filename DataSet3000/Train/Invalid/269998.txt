Needless MySQL database entry for session control
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

The problem is not visible for normal users!!!!
When the page on the site is opened for the first time a unic number is
generated for session control, in al the links on the site this number is send
with the URL 
URL?sid=#number#
this number is also stored in a database on the site so sessions can be tracked.
en when links are followed within the site no new numbers are generad, only when
firefox is used to view the pages, every click genereds a extra database entry,
which is not used on the viewed page. (When the page is viewed with MIE it works
correctly.)

This is verry un plessand when your webspace is limmed

I have the feeling thad firefox send de request 2 times 1 time with te variables
and 1 time wihtout the variables and the brouwser only displays the page with de
varibals

I hope jou can fix this bug (or if you think its my programming let me know)
