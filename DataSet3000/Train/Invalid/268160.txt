Style switcher not showing up in RC2
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/0.10.1

Pages no longer show the Style Switcher button in RC2. The easiest way to see
this problem in action is to load an XML file in Firefox, since a recent version
(PR maybe?) had the style switcher for XML documents. Otherwise, go to a site,
like www.zeldman.com, and notice how there is no Style Switcher in RC2.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open page with alternate stylesheets, like an un-styled XML document
2. Notice lack of theme switch button in status bar.




I ran Firefox in safe mode to make sure it wasn't an issue with any extensions.
