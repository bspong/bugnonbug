opening new tab or window sometimes minimizes all
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

I can't discern under exactly what unique circumstances this happens, but it
seems after several days or more of running, I've noticed that opening a new
window and/or opening a new tab in an existing window can minimize *all* Mozilla
windows, at the moment when the new window or tab should load.  This has
happened during at least four sessions in maybe the last 4 months.  When this
starts, it will occur about 75% of the time, with the other 25% seeming to be
normal refreshing/new tabs/windows opening.  Problem *may* be associated with
sessions when I also have Kazaa running.  My only cure thus far is to close all
Mozilla windows and start over.  Otherwise, most any time I refresh a page or
open a new one, Mozilla minimizes and I will have to relocate the tab/window I
just wanted to open. 

Reproducible: Sometimes




I've LONG wished for some way to close a browser, and then restart with the same
windows/tabs open, especially when being forced to close by a hang or problem as
I described above.
