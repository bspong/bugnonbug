menus suddenly empty
I reboot into a different operating system and when I booted into Windows again,
all the menus in Firefox (and Thunderbird too) stopped working. When I try to
open a menu (or right click) I see what looks like the menu but with all the
items being empty. (The height of the menu looks correct, but it seems empty and
hence the width is almost zero)

I tried reinstalling Firefox, and it doesn't help. The Firefox directory was
removed completely between reinstalls. I have also tried renaming my profile.
That did not help either. 

This makes Thunderbird somewhat unusable for me at the moment. (I can get by in
Firefox with shortcuts). However, I am unable to do some  things in Thunderbird
without using menus.
