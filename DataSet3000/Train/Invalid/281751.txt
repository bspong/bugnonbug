On a clean install of the latest nightly build (and back until 0.9.3) the File
Types window is empty (Tools -> Options -> Downloads [File Types]).  From what I
can gather this should have a list of all the plugins and offer the option to
"Change Action" and "Remove".  I can click on the Plug-Ins button and it will
show me all the plugins (with enable option).  This has occurred on all PC's
that I have installed it on after Firefox 0.9.1, both Windows 2K and Windows XP.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install New OS or install on PC without Firefox
2. Install Fire Fox
3. Go to Tools -> Options -> Downloads

Actual Results:  
The [File Types] scroll box is empty, even when there are plugins installed.  It
is still empty after installing things like Quicktime and Divx.

Expected Results:  
Should show icon, file type name and associated action of installed plugins
(shows this on my 0.9.1 version) but not on anything since.
