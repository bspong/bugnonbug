Problem render &nbsp if it is followed by a  single quote character
I am using OSCommerce PHP online shop tool.

In a particular Add-on module I find the following declaration

  define('MODULE_PAYMENT_AUS_BANK_TEXT_DESCRIPTION', '<BR>Please use the
following details to transfer your total order value:<br><br>Account No.:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp' . MODULE_PAYMENT_AUS_BANK_ACCNUM . '<BR>BSB Number:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp' . MODULE_PAYMENT_AUS_BANK_BSB . '<BR>Account
Name: ' . MODULE_PAYMENT_AUS_BANK_ACCNAM . '<BR>Bank Name: &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
' . MODULE_PAYMENT_AUS_BANK_BANKNAM . '<br><br>Your order will not ship until we
receive payment in the above account.');

Which is later used to render details of payment method on the web page such:

Please use the following details to transfer your total order value:

Account No.:   &nbsp99999
BSB Number:      &nbsp999-999
Account Name: Soaps Plus
Bank Name:      Blue Mountains Credit union

Your order will not ship until we receive payment in the above account.

Notice that the BANK NAME field has a space after the &nbsp tag in the definition.
This renders correctly - whereas the account no and BSB number fields have the
single quote immediatly following the &nbsp. as you can see this does not.

As it only seems to appear incorrect on FireFox, I suggest this is a FF bug.

As it effects the Professional look of an Online shop it is worth a Major severity.

I look forward to your response.
