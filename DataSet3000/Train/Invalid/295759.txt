Firefox asks to save file to disk even if mime-type is text/plain
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Opening the url http://www.rockbox.org/irc/rockbox-20050527.txt pops up Firefox'
download-dialog even though the webserving is specifying the mimetype
text/plain. The file includes 6 non-printable characters, but I don't believe
this warrants ignoring the mimetype specified by the server.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open url http://www.rockbox.org/irc/rockbox-20050527.txt
2. That's it
3. There is no 3.
Actual Results:  
Firefox opens its "Save or open with" dialog.

Expected Results:  
Display the file-contents as text/plain as the server specified.
