When I try to type in either box, it notifies me that an error message is being
sent and then disconnects me from the internet.  The only way that I can type in
a URL or search request is by going to Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to address bar.
2.  Try typing in either frame.
3.

Actual Results:  
I get a box saying that an error message is being sent, and then I am
disconnected from the internet.

Expected Results:  
Before today, it was working fine.  I could type normally in the address box or
the search engine box.
