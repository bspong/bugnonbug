Firefox crashes after downloading some extensions
My Firefox browser continually crashes and the quality feedback agent will not
work as it reports it cannot connect to the server (this is happening for more
than two months).  This problem really rquries attention as I keep losing info
when the browser crashes.  This problem only occurred after downloading some of
your extensions.  Which one is the problem if it is.  What is a b.m.o. issue????
