XHTML is an application of XML. As such, it should accept <a name="..." /> as a
*closed* empty element.

But for an XHTML web page to be treated as XML it has to be served with
MIME-type application/xhtml+xml. But when it is, Firefox doesn't display it as a
web page, but an XML tree.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a valid XHTML web page
2. Make the web server serve the web page as application/xhtml+xml
3. Browse to the web page
Actual Results:  
The page is shown as an XML tree

Expected Results:  
The page should be shown as a web page
