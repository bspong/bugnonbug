1. Interface to yahoo messenger is totally useless, when proxies are used and
multiple users only the first connect can ever use the auto login...clearing all
caches does not help.... 

2. Installing addons, totally confusing (no auto download) and if you back out
you never get another chance.

3. Once installed as default... no option except to uninstall...

4. Barge in... many bugs.. no option to back out.. sounds too much like
Microsoft without any obvious advantage..

at last IE6 actually works... most times

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.attemp to use the product

3.re-attemp to use the product

Apologies fot the obvious lack of info here, but I doubt 40kB of space was available

I hate Microsoft, but this doesn't even come close to an option... stop trying
to emulate them and become better...

Here we go... even filing a bug is not intuitive... if this gets through it will
be amazing...

Pick a box.. any box to complete this crap
