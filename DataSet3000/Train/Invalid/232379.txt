linked to other pages as a chart. It uses an Image Map file by "MAP This!".

1.Just open the page in Mozilla Firebird.
Actual Results:  
Firebird opens only the HTML code itself.

It should have shown all the images and links.

I am using default theme. Internet Explorer views the page with no problems.
Images are enabled from all sites. No extensions or other stuff.
