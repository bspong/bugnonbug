After writing a program that edits html files to use relative paths to open
images, Mozilla doesn't find it. A first I thoaght it was a bug in my app untill
I ran Mozilla in Linux, Internet Explorer in Windows, etc. then it worked 100%.
This is what Mozilla Firefox has problems with:
Example:

Lets say we're in "c:\my webs". Now I have file1.html that has a link to
file2.html but file2.html is in "c:\my webs\more" and file1.html uses the link
"more\file2.html". The thing is sometimes file2.html is opened, but lets say we
have another subdirectory "c:\my webs\more\images" and images has image1.gif.
Now since file2.html also uses relative paths : "images\image1.gif", the images
is found at all and gives a Protocol error or something.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create any directory anywhere (wherever you want to)
2. Create a sub directory "sub" in (1.)'s directory, sothat you will have :
"..\your_dir_name\sub"
3. Create "images" in "sub" : "..\your_dir_name\sub\images"
4. Put an image file in "images"
5. Create a html file in "sub" but link the image in "images" relatively :
"images\image.gif" for example
6. Create an html file in "your_dir_name" that links to the html file in "sub"
but also relatively.
Actual Results:  
The html file in "sub" doesn't show the images

Expected Results:  
It should show the images

It kept giving me something like "e" is not a protocol or something. (The e was
my drive "e:\")
