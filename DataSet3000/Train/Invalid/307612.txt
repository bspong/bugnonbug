when you mouse over some regular text so that the pointer changes to I and
perform a shift+double-left-click the text in that paragragh completely
vanishes. It doesnt just change color, trying to highlight it doesnt reveal any
hidden text, it is simply gone. This does not seem to work for links just
regular text. I could not find this bug in bug tracker and it is way too weird
of behavior to be by design, atleast I hope its not by design as I cant see the
purpose. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. move mouse pointer over regular text so pointer changes to I
2. while holding down shift double click the left mouse button
3. you will see the paragraph vanish without a trace.

Actual Results:  
the text dissapeared

Expected Results:  
as far as I know it should ignore the shift key being held down and just bulk
highlight the paragraph. This is how IE handles the scenario and I see no
advantage to dissapearing text.
