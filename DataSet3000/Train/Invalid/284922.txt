Application freeze on FrontPage JScript

Upon visiting the site and executing the "JScript", Firefox freezes (needing a
process restart to clear it up). I'm unable to narrow it down as to what line
results in the application freeze. Note: not a crash... Firefox just becomes
unresponsive

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the site
2. Note how you can't do anything
3. Ctrl+Alt+Del

Actual Results:  
Firefox "crashes" and Windows throws an error

Expected Results:  
View the page normally

I'm unable to narrow down what part of the JScript throws the error due to a
lack of time, sorry!
