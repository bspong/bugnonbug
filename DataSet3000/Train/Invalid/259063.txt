Keybindings changed. No more C-U to delete whole line or C-k to delete to end of
line. However new keybindings cannot be found.
Could we have 1) a documentaion on how to edit ? (how do I kill to end of line,
with Delete key only ?)
2) a way to customize those keybindfings, allowwing unix users to get their
standard keybindings.
