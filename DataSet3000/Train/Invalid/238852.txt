Hi All,

    My Jet Direct 300X print server
           
http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF06b/18972-236253-64302-34214-64302-27316-13138-13139.html

has a built in web page, which I use to configure the
print server's printer port.  This web page is called an Embedded 
Web Server (EWS) by HP.

EWS works under Mozilla, but will not work under Firebird 0.7,
Firefox 0.8, or Firefox 0.8-20040325 trunk on Win XP or
Red Hat 9.  All it does is load up the Java coffee cups and 
keeps loading forever (Firefox does not crash).

Can you get me back this functionality?

Hp's WebJetAdmin does run correctly under Red Hat 9
with this print server.  But it a huge pain to use.



Many thanks,
