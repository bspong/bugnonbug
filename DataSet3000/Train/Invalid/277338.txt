Memory Leak
Leaving Firefox on for more than 12/24 hours, and you will see your CPU
utilization rise dramatically, upwards of 75% and higher.

As you know, this is very, very serious.  I'm concerned that once this becomes
known, this could be a major drag on Firefox's new found success.

Question:  Why isn't this bug not prominently featured on the Mozilla main page?
 You go there and its all nice and cheery as if there were no issues at all.

This is extremely serious, and I hope you are able to fix this forthwith.

Thank you.
