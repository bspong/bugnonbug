As soon as I install the latest version 1.01 of firefox all access to the web is
stopped. I am running windows ME (so I'm the only one - I  know) with all of the
latest updates applied. I have IE6 still installed and fully updated. I connect
with a cable modem through a 10/100 network card. Internet connection share by
second 10/100 card. This is is new install yesterday, because I couldn't get
onto the net!. Fresh install worked fine, all connecting ok with IE. installed
firefox 1.0.1 from file saved to disk. ALL CONECTION TO WEB IMPOSSIBLE AFTER
INSTALL - all machines, including those on the network (3). Restarting my
machine, the cable modem made no difference. Removed ver 1.0.1,and restart,
tried with IE all machines restored all ok. Installed firefox 1.0 - all still good. 
This has bee the source of MUCH hassle and two complete reloads. Please fix or
warn users at least.  I know if I load the latest version the connectivity is
stopped.
