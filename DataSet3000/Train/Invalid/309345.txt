OS X 10.4 + USB Microsoft Optical Wireless Mouse 2.0

Installed Firefox 1.5b1 (DP) over 1.0.6 release.

The Mouse has horizontal scrolling on a tilting mouse wheel. With previous
Firefox releases the horizontal scrolling feature mapped to Back and Forward
navigation. Once copying the 1.5b1 package over 1.0.6 and running it this
stopped working.
Looking through all the preferences within Firefox and the System Preference of
Mac OS X and the IntelliPoint driver I can't see of any way of correcting this.

Reproducible: Didn't try

Steps to Reproduce:
Not sure how to reproduce this reliably - as now my profile has been updated to
1.5. If I was testing this properly, I'd have kept a copy of my profile and done
it all again.

1. Install 1.5b1 over 1.0.6
2. Start Firefox 1.5b1
3. Browser to a few sites, see if you can use the horizontal scrolling feature
of your mouse to go 'Back' and 'Forward'.

Actual Results:  
Couldn't go back or forward.

Expected Results:  
Navigated back or forward (scroll left = back, scroll right = forward)
