Tree View in "Add Bookmark" dialog is too small.

The current tree view in the "Add Bookmark" dialog is limited to 6 lines.  This
is a pretty small amount of space, for something as complex as a tree view.  To
truly use the tree view effectively, we need to show more lines.

How many lines?  I do not know.  Internet Explorer shows 10.  However, what
factor we should use to determine how many lines to show as default, I am not sure.

Reproducible: Always
