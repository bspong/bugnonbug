A naked base firefox theme, A breakdown of files/images for those who want to
pick up and make their own skin for firefox. This would very likely help weed
out files that were removed from previous skin versions (ie: AboutDialog.css)
and random, no longer-used/changed elements found in other files. Also giving
someone with at least some mild skinning experience a breakdown of the current
theming API and all functions available with an up to date theme.jar source tree
along with good source documention to help them get on their way.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Provided a naked theme.jar :)

If something like this already exists out there, please feel free to point me to
it. As I've searched and searched and found nothing. And most existing themes
still contain files that have yet to get weeded out or accuratly updated but
still work :)
