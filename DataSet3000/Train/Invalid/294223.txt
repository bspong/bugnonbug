75% of the time I load a page, it takes an extremely long time to load
completely and some times it says (Not Responding) on the top of the firefox
window. It never gets to the point where its like that so long I have to end the
firefox process, but it always takes awhile. I have run many virus, spyware, and
adware tests, nothing shows up. I even tried without running any other programs
(even ones in the background) and the same thing happens.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to a webpage.
Actual Results:  
The page froze up for about a minute and then it went back to normal.

Expected Results:  
Just loaded the page and displayed it normal.
