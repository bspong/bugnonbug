From yesterday, after I restarted FireFox1.0, I got a debug(??) window just
below the status bar, and it seems that no way to turn it off. I tried to
un-install/re-install Firefox, but the annoying window is always there.

The window shows the following line:

     <menuitem id="context-flashAllow" label="&flashAllow.label;"----^

here's a screenshot for that area:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
just start firefox it shows up.
Actual Results:  
it does.

Expected Results:  
User should be allowed to turn this window off.

I think this is a debug window for developers? I have no ideas what the line
means. I searched about:config, registry, .ini files but did not find anywhere
you can turn it off.
