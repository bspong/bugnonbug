List does not reorder when you click on column headers (view in IE to see how it should work)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

The referenced web page will "reorder" itself when the column headers are
clicked... the default view is programs by alphabetical sequence, but by
clicking on the headers you can reorder by Organization, acronym, or Last Update. 

Using IE 6.00.2800, the page reorders correctly. However under Firefox 0.9.2
(and earlier) it does not. Both programs appear to be calling a Javascript
command "Orderby" (for example, "javascript:Orderby(DateDESC)" but in Firefox it
has no effect.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to cited web page
2. Click on column header "Last Update"
3. Note that no reordering takes place

Actual Results:  
Firefox continues to run with no crash or interruption, but the expected
reordering of programs by date does not occur.

Expected Results:  
The contents of the table should have reordered by date (most recent program first).

No crash. Occurs in all themes (I am using Pinball 0.9.1, but it also occurs in
Default Theme and Noia 2.0 Extreme). Only loaded extensions are DOM inspector
and ieview 0.8 beta.

This is probably a minor javascript implementation bug which will affect a
relatively small group of people, but for my job it's important since I have to
check this website on a daily basis for updates and changes!

Nonetheless I think Firefox is great! Thanks for the terrific alternative to
Internet Exploder!
