can't close window/tab with "command+w" or with the "x" on tab when going to a site that is blocked using adblock with the site blocking option set

When going to a page that is blocked by the extension Adblock, such as
"http://adfarm.mediaplex.com/", and the "Site Blocking" option is set, I can not
close the window or tab with "command+w", with the "x" next to the tab, or with
quit. 

The "command+w" and "x" by the tabs are totally unresponsive. As well as the tab
it self, I can not go to any other sites using that tab. Other tabs in the same
window operate with no apparent problem.

When I try to quit firefox I get the window asking if I would like to close all
open tabs, I click yes and nothing happens. None of the tabs close not even the
unaffected ones. 

The only way to close them is to use "File>Close Window" or the "x" for the
whole window, and then the dialog asking to close all tabs appears and clicking
to close them all will do so.

Also, turning off adblock, the site blocking option, or removing the block site
form the adblock list will stop the problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Adblock.
2. Add site, such as "adfarm.mediaplex.com".
3. Go to Adblock prefrences, select Adblock Options>Site block.
4. Go to the block site.

Actual Results:  
The window/tab became unresponsive.

Expected Results:  
It should still be closeable or responsive.
