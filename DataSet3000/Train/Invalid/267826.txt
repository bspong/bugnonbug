If an anchor includes an image, and the close tag is on a new line, and there's
whitespace after the closing anchor, that whitespace is treated as part of the
anchor.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go here: http://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_imglink
2. After closing anchor tag </a>, type " firefox", yes, there IS a space before
the word firefox
3. Click on the button that says Edit the text and click me
Actual Results:  
Between the image and the word firefox, the space is underlined and treated as
part of the link.

Expected Results:  
The space shouldn't be part of the link.

Set severity as major as the presentation of the page is extremely distracting
and out of place.

Note: only occurs when closing anchor tag on a new line from image tag.
