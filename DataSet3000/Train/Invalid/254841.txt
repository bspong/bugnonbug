mozilla.org is promoting version 0.9.3   but in some 
ways this is a retrograde from version 0.9.1+ 
in .9.1+  there is some legend/fieldset  repairs
that do not show up in 0.9.3   
it was repaired in dailies  for about a week before the 0.9.3 
came out  which lost the bug-fix   
current dailies show repair as working
hopefully the publicized release will catch up ...  
i always use dailies but ask my students to use the 
version advertised as stable ... students have enuff troubles
anyways ;-]  ;-]
