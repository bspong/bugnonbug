The order of multiple successive spans, each with their own styles applied,
causes Firefox to render them differently.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Attachment
2. Review 'underline bold', 'italic underline bold', 'underline bold italic',
and 'underline italic bold'


Actual Results:  
The font is bolded but the underline is an inconsistant width compared to other
'identical' styles.

Expected Results:  
'identical' styles should render consistantly.
