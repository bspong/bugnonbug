Firefox locks up when two separate frames attempt to set focus at the same time

Was developing a page that had two frames.  Mistakenly, each frame was
attempting to set the focus using javascript, when the frameset loaded.  This
would cause firefox to lock up completely.  

Tried it with several other people, and they all had the same problem when going
to this page in firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
Firefox would hang.  Sometimes it would crash, but most times it would just lock up.

Expected Results:  
Probably, it should have set the focus to whatever frame loaded last.
