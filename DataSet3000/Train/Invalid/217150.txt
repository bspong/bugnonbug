Firebird can't open .eml files or handle message/rfc822 MIME-type

(see also bug 217118)

Seamonkey could write files from the mailer, and they could be read in the
browser. The same thing for everything with the message/rfc822 (for instance
http://www.omnifarious.org/~hopper/bad.822 as mentioned in bug 217118). This was
easy because Semonkey was both a browser and a mailer.

With Firebird, it's a bit more difficult. It doesn't know how to parse
message/rfc822 anymore, so it tells you to open it with an external application.
 But Thunderbird isn't the default handler for this MIME-type (bug 217149) yet.

I don't think that we ever want to open the .eml files directly in Firebird (we
would have to including the parser-routines from the mailer), but rfc822 could
be routed to Thunderbird if bug 217149 is solved.
