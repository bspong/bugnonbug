3rd party cookies still stored in spite of "originating  web site only" pref
couldn't find an existing bug on this after several queries: I've turned on the
pref for storing cookies from "originating web site only," but 3rd party cookies
are still being stored.

found using 2004-07-15-11-0.9 on fedora core 2, while running a variation of
this test:

http://testrunner.mozilla.org/test.cgi#972

recipe used:

1. make sure that about:blank is your home page.

2. in Prefs > Privacy > Cookies, clear out all the stored cookies.

3. now set the follow cookie prefs:
* enable cookies selected
* "for the orginating web site only" selected
* "accept cookies normally" selected

4. hit OK to save and dismiss prefs.

5. visit a site which serves cookies from its own and other sites: I visited
http://www.cnn.com

6. open Prefs > Privacy > Cookies > Stored Cookies dialog.

expected: should only see cookies from cnn.com in the listbox.

actual results: there are several cookies from other sites, like advertising.com
and atwola.com.

this seems buggy to me, but perhaps cnn.com is somehow working around firefox's
means of avoiding 3rd party cookies...?
