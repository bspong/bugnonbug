This page renders fine in Mozilla 1.2.1, but it displays brown bars in Phoenix 0.5.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20030117 Phoenix/0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.3a) Gecko/20030117 Phoenix/0.5

I don't have any other computer to test this on however. Mozilla 1.2.1 and
Konqueror display it fine. Many other pages on this site show this same problem.
I use Debian Unstable with KDE 3.0.4. If any more information is needed, I will
be glad to help. If any other links that have this effect are needed, I can get
those as well.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://uo.stratics.com/content/aos/customhouse.shtml


Actual Results:  
Big vertical brown bars appear in the table where the page content should be.

Expected Results:  
You should see the content rather than vertical bars.
