In the Bookmarks menu, if you right-click on a bookmark which is in a subfolder
to bring up the context menu (which is empty, wtf?), then click outside the
Bookmarks menu, you can no longer access the subfolder of the bookmark you
right-clicked. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a subfolder in the Bookmarks menu.
2. Right-click a Bookmark in it.
3. Click outside the Bookmarks menu.
4. Try to open the same subfolder. You cannot do so.
5. To regain access to the subfolder you must restart Firefox.
Actual Results:  
The subfolder refused to open.

Expected Results:  
The subfolder should have opened.

The bug occurs in safe mode.
