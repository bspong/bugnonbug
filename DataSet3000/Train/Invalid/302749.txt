Feedview: feedview removes html and thus garbles certain blogposts
It seems that feedview removes HTML tags from the posts (for one reason or
another) so the blogpost ends up looking bad.

Here are 2 examples:

http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/atom.xml - roc's blog uses lists, and since
they are stripped (look at the Gecko 1.9 post) it becomes unreadable.

http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/atom.xml - Asa's blog uses <strong> and <p>,
and the feedview ends up doing strange things to the <p> tags.
