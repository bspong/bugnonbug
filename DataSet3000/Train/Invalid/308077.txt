Update of extension has erased all content of drop-down section of URL Bar

Having had a pop-up reminding me for 4-5 days that an up date was available, I
up-dated MR Tech About About to ver 1.2.2, today. Upon restarting FF I find all
URL'S that used to be stored in the DD box below the URL box are no longer visible.
I have looked to see if this has been reported elsewhere, and whilst several
items had similar characteristics, none appeared to 'match' exactly.

As many of the URL's are quite lengthy and not stored elsewhere, the process of
recovering from their loss, could be lengthy/costly to say the least.

If it is simply a matter of re-connecting to a config. file, your direction to
the necessary instructions would be greatly appreciated. Otherwise, any help you
can offer would be gratefully received.

Kind regards

Ian Sneddon

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Up-Date via Pop-up
2.Re-start FF
3.URL'S all gone

Actual Results:  
I was unable to view any URL's previously accessible, via the drop-down box
below the URL box.

Expected Results:  
I would have expected the URL's to have remained available.
Having previously updated the browser from 1.0.4 to 1.0.6, and experienced no
adverse effects from so doing, I fully expected similar results on this occasion.
