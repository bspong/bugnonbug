firefox keeps trying to access a website that failed to load

I am seeing firefox continuously trying to access a website where there is no
web server configured. I entered the IP address into firefox manually, and ever
since it has been trying every 5 minutes to access this site. it sends 3 SYN
packets, gets 3 RST packets back from the site... Then it waits 5 minutes and
repeats the exercise. As far as I can tell it's only doing it for this one IP
address. I'm not sure if there is something strange about the response it is
recieving or what. I've tried to reproduce it with other IP addresses but not
seeing the same thing. This is persistant across reboots and reloads of the
browser. If I close the browser, the activity stops.




Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. try to visit IP address with no server configured.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
mozilla first states connection refused, then continually seems to try to access
the site in the background, giving no indication to the user that it is doing
so. It seems to repeat this every 5 minutes when the browser is open.

Expected Results:  
give up, once it has determined that there is no site there.. certainly not
silently retry, and definitely not retry across reloads!
