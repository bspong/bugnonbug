Popup Blocker is messed up

For some reason, links that have window.open in them are not functioning. A
window does not pop up, even though it was requested and clicked on.
Whitelisting the domain doesn't seem to work, either.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:




It is particularly apparent in the commercial stats package "Urchin", since it
uses window.open a lot to open up individual reports.

The JavaScript console also reports this error (with popup blocking off):

Error: [Exception... "'Permission denied to get property
XULElement.selectedIndex' when calling method:
[nsIAutoCompletePopup::selectedIndex]"  nsresult: "0x8057001e
(NS_ERROR_XPC_JS_THREW_STRING)"  location: "JS frame ::
http://www.ignition-project.com:8000/ujs/admin.js :: openReport :: line 434" 
data: no]
Source File: http://www.ignition-project.com:8000/ujs/admin.js
Line: 434

This worked in Firefox 0.8.
