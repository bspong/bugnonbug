Firefox 1.0.6 ignores scroll key click on image with link not opening given link
in a new tab.
Originally found this bug (?) in a phpbb forum when I tried to see new posts for
a thread in a new tab (clicking this icon:
http://www.nutribody.pt/phpBB2/templates/subSilver/images/icon_newest_reply.gif).
Then I came to the conclusion that it happened on and off... for instance, on
www.mozilla.org it doesn't happen on the linked image in the upper left corner
(return to the home page) but it happens on the images referring to "Get
Thunderbird" and "Mozilla Store 2.0", just a few lines below.
If I right-click the image and choose "open link in a new tab", the bug doesn't
occur, it seems to happen only with scroll-click.

This problem didn't occur in Firefox 1.0.2 (my previous FF version).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open one of the sites mentioned or any phpBB-based forum.
2. If on phpBB forum: Search for new posts or open a sub-forum and try to see
new posts for a given thread in a new tab. If in another site, do as said for
mozilla.org in "details".
Actual Results:  
No link was opened in a new tab.

Expected Results:  
It should've opened said link(s) in a new tab.

I'm using the Pinball Theme by David James but the bug still occurs with the
defaut theme.
