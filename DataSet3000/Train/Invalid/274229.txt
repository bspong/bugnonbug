Hi,

This page that I made has a 'moving' header with text "Art by Jaana" but it does
not show up coming from the right as it does using Explorer. Also the pictures
on this page have a thin frame around them that seems to be shown diffrently
compared to what explorer shows.
Mayby my page is badly coded?

BR, Jouni
