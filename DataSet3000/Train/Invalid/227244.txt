DOM Inspector not on Tools menu. When I manually add it, an error in debug occurs.

Somewhere between 30Nov and 01Dec, several of us (ref:
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=38019)  began to have problems
with DOM Inspector. 

In my case: The Tools/DOM Inspector menu choice is missing entirely. I added it
manually as it was defined in browser-menubars.inc 2 days ago when it worked.
I've done this many times in the past, but it seems as if the actual function
name may have changed. 

I built FB in debug and captured some debug output after I clicked on DOM
Inspector as follows:

-----------debug------------
*********** click on DOM Inspector here and then on Inspect page ********

------------end DOMI (and venkman afterwards as well which isn't working ----

Another person is getting a javascript error that shows up in the JS console,
but see the thread I noted above for that. 






Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Pull CVS as of ~1500 PST
2. Build using this mozconfig.
. $topsrcdir/browser/config/mozconfig
ac_add_options --disable-tests
ac_add_options --enable-debug #or disable whatever.. 
ac_add_options --enable-optimize="-O3 -march=athlon-xp -msse"
ac_add_options --enable-jsd
ac_add_options --enable-xft
ac_add_options --enable-default-toolkit=gtk2
ac_add_options --enable-extensions=venkman

3. Run FB and click on Tools / DOM Inspector 
4. In this build also try Tools/Javascript Debugger. 


Actual Results:  
I received the debug error noted in "Details" above. 
Same for Venkman but for Venkman, I got a blank venkman-like window as if the
overlay weren't there. 

Expected Results:  
Should have opened DOM Inspector window with some context. 
For Venkman, should have opened Javascript debugger with context. 

Platform: Athlon XP on NF7 abit Motherboard.
OS: Fedora Core 1, completely up to date, 
gcc: 3.3.2-2 -- glibc 2.3.2-101.1

mozconfig is above. 

I ran firebird after moving the old profile to another directory. 
I also tried it with the old profile. 
I installed firebird into a new directory. 
I downloaded an official build which didn't work for me either (the 31-Nov gtk2
build)
I downloaded someone else's build without gtk2 which *did* work (or at least had
DOMi). 
I'm running KDE 3.1.4 desktop and gnome 2.4 devel and gconf2 for the registry
needs.
