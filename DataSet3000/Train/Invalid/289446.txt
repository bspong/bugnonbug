Open the URL.
There will be an Image with a peace of javascript writing the dimensions of the
image into the document.

The first time the image is loaded, the size '24 x 24 Pixel' is printed. This is

printed.

If you reload the Page with CTRL + F5 (to override the cache) the size '24 x 24
Pixel' is printed again.
