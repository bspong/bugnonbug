Crash on sites that try to install WindUpdates adware
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

Certain websites which attempt to install spyware from
http://www.windupdates.com/ use a horribly obfusicated JavaScript in order to
attempt to install adware on your computer. This script will crash both Firefox
PR1.0 and 0.9. The example URL is just one of many sites that use this script.

For some reason, this will not always cause a crash, but it will on a fairly
regularly basis. I suspect the obfusicated code may change. I will attach a copy
of the script which I know has crashed Firefox.

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make sure JavaScript is enabled.
2. Browse to example URL.
Actual Results:  
Firefox.exe crashes in js3250.dll.
