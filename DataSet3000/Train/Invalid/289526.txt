After installation of the Switch Proxy 1.3.1 extension, firefox freezes immediately after a restart
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050405 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050405 Firefox/1.0+

The Summary is it actually. I tried some things like with or without preconfigured 
proxy. I tried it with firefox 1.0.1/1.0.2/nightly build. It was always the same.

Let me add that it works very fine without this extension.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Delete ~/,mozilla
2.Install nighly build and keep standard configuration
3.Get Switch Proxy Tool 
4 Restart

Actual Results:  
Firefox appears with the new toolbar but freezes immediately before I can access 
a menu

Expected Results:  
Run
