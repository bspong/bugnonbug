When clicking Help->About, an XML Parsing error occurs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2

When I click Help -> About Mozilla Firefox, the resulting window displays an
XHML parsing error in line 45, column 3 (this is the end of the file) of
chrome://browser/content/aboutDialog.xul. It appears that there are some
malformed characters choking the XML (I get "PK[block][block]" where "[block]"
is a weird rectangular character placeholder. When I review the file in
question, I see no obvious problems

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click Help -> About Mozilla Firefox


Actual Results:  
Yellow XML Parse Error screen appears where the About dialog is expected.

Expected Results:  
Displayed About dialog.
