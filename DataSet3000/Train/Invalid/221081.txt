As far as I'm concerned, this broken URL sort order in the drop down address bar
is a terrible bug.  It would be nice if you could add an option to completely
disable the "automatic sort" of it so the URLs would be sorted by last visited
date.  Obviously their order would only change if you typed in the URL or picked
it from the drop down list.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on address bar
2. Enjoy spending 5 minutes finding a URL

Actual Results:  
Terrible sort order.

Expected Results:  
URLs listed by last visited date.
