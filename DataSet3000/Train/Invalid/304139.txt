The Firefox Browser screen does not seem to fit adequately on my 12 inch iBook, and I cannot adjust the size in order to access the bottom of the screen
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

The bottom of my screen is always cut off whenever I use the Firefox browser on
my 12 inch iBook.  Unlike the Safari browser, there appears to be no means of
sizing the window, and clicking on the sizing button at the top right does
nothing to solve the problem.  I can never see the bottom of my screen in
Firefox.  Isnt there, like Safari, a sizing tab or corner just below the
scrolling buttons on the right margin of the screen?  I cannot seem to access it
at all.  I tried using a minimal skin in order to reduce the frame but to no
avail.  I also tried getting rid of toolbars, but the bottom of the browser
window remains fixed, there seems to be no way to size it at all.  I am
surprised that no one else has brought this to your attention, as it seems a
major drawback.
