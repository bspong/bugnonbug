For no reason Firefox started working much slower than just a few weeks ago,
sometimes it crashes 1-3 and more times on initial program start. Uninstalling
and reinstalling did not fix the problem.

If this cannot be explained by a bug, I would suspect Microsoft is trying to
undermine Firefox superiority to their IE by probably including some nusty code
in their windows updates - is it possible? I have no choice but to use IE as
Firefox does not work well anymore. I will try to fix it but please make sure MS
does not interfere with your product because I support Firefox all 100%, I do
not want to use IE!
