Print Preview will not close
When clicking Print Preview to view a web page before printing, everything loads
fine.  The Close button however seems to not be workings.  It could be one of my
plugins, so here's what I have installed at the time I noticed the error:
tabextensions_en.xpi
tabprefs_0.6.14.xpi
textlink.xpi
Adblock v.5 d2 * nightly 39
Plain Text Links 0.2
Tabbrowser Extensions 1.11.2004110502

Even when I switch between tabs, it's still in print preview mode.  The only way
to get out of it is to restart the browser.
