links appear blue, but are not clickable (although the page html/css validates OK)

In this page (I've mirrored this part of the site for your convenience):
http://www.richard.neill.hemscott.net/theo/home.html
there are some links in the right hand part of the page, eg the link 'Guardian'.
These links do appear blue/underlined, but the mouse cursor does not change, and
 nothing happens when they are clicked.

The page does validate correctly for both CSS and HTML.

By experimentation, I have found that this page:
http://www.richard.neill.hemscott.net/theo/home2.html
which has only one change will work correctly. The offnding line is this one:
<img src="images/sidebar1.gif" width="160" height="641" border="0" alt="navigate" />
and if the height attribute is reduced below 150, it will work.

However, a changing the background image in one part of a page shouldn't cause
links to stop working in another part!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
This bug is reproducible in Mozilla (suite), and in Konqueror. However, the page
works OK in I.E.



Expected Results:  
Perhaps there is something wrong with the page design, however subtle, which is
causing this. But even though the layout may be wrong, I think no layout error
should cause links to stop working.
