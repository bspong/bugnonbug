The "set default browser" options tab doesn't work.
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier:  Firefox/0.8

 Nothing happens when I click on the Options "General" tab for setting Firefox
as my default browser.  I am directed to any links I click on in Thunderbird
mail messages m via Netscape Communicator 4.5 instead of Firefox. I've tried
reinstalling Firefox but it doesn't help.  (BTW, the space provided to describe
previously reported bugs is too narrow for me to be able to read other people's
reports--half the column is cut off, and maximizing or using the horizontal bar
does not help--so I cannot tell if anyone has already reported this.)   

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to Options, General, Default browser 
2.Left mouse click on Set Default Browser ("Make Firefox your default browser") 
3.Nothing happens. 
Actual Results:  
Thunderbird connects to Netscape 4.5 instead of Firefox. 


Expected Results:  
It should have taken me to Firefox whenever there is a need for a browser.
