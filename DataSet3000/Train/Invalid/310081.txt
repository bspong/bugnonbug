Firefox modifies the URL after it is manually entered or if a server opens another browser window with the same URL.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

I believe I have found a problem with the way Firefox parses text in the URL
field.  I tried to find my bug in the subdivision: "Location Bar and
Autocomplete", but did not see any matches.

I also search using the keywords: url parse location

When I was an intern at IBM Research I developed an some javascript code for
their bioinformatics site which extracts text from the URL field.  For testing
the code (while at IBM), I used Windows NT 4.0 running both the IE 5.X (I forgot
which version) and the Netscape 4.75 browsers.

The javascript code currently works using IE 5.5 with service pack 2 (on an
Windows 2000 Professional, SP4 system).  I do not have Netscape installed on my
current system.

The javascript code does NOT work with Firefox 1.0.6 because the browse modifies
the URL.

The javascript code parses the entire URL in the location/url field of the
browser and extracts information which it then transfers to a textarea on the page.

This bug can be easily duplicated if you paste the following URL into your browsers.

	http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/Tpa.html?>1_to_5_(5_residues)%abcde

After you press ENTER key the part of the URL after the ? (namely the single ">"
character) is changed by Firefox to three characters "%3E"

	http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/Tpa.html?%3E1_to_5_(5_residues)%abcde

If you compare IE vs Firefox the contents of the TextArea are different.

2.Hit Enter Key

3.URL is changed by firefox

http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/Tpa.html?%3E1_to_5_(5_residues)%abcde

4. The
Actual Results:  
http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/Tpa.html?%3E1_to_5_(5_residues)%abcde

Expected Results:
