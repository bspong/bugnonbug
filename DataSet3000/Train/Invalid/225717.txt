When a user adds new search engines to the CTRL+K search toolbar, the drop-down
list of search engines is not alphabetically sorted until the user exits and
restarts the browser. This is annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. From the search toolbar drop-down list, select "Add engines..."
2. Add a couple new search engines
3. Look at the search toolbar drop-down list again.

Actual Results:  
The new search engines are appended to the end of the drop-down list. If you
exit and restart the browser, the drop-down list will then be alphetically sorted.

Expected Results:  
The drop-down list should always alphabetically sort the search engine list.
