Firefox is not portable to LP64 systems, segmentation fault
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.78 [en] (X11; U; NetBSD 1.6.2 alpha; Nav)
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0

Tens of thousands of compiler warnings (yes really! Tens of thousands!).
Fixed over 1900 of them, mostly LP64 related.
Still get a seg fault before it even puts up a window.  I assume the seg fault
is due to an LP64 problem, as I hear it runs on x86.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Turn on the gcc -W options that aren't silly.

-Wimplicit -Wmain -Wreturn-type -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes
-Wmissing-declarations -Wredundant-decls -Wformat -Wchar-subscripts
-Wconversion -Wunused -Wswitch -Wtrigraphs -Wuninitialized -Wpointer-arith
-Wcast-qual -Wcast-align -Wwrite-strings -Wnested-externs -W -Wparentheses
-Wcomment -Waggregate-return -Winline -Wshadow

2. Compile on an LP64 system.
3. Be amased that one program could generate sooooo many warnings.
4. Be annoyed at the seg fault (with or without my diffs).



Expected Results:  
A high quality program should generate NO compiler warnings, even with
all the "reasonable" -W options turned on, with the possible exception of
false positives from -Wuninitilized.

A high quality program will never have a segmentation fault.


I will attempt to attach diffs with the "Create a new Attachment" gizmo.
Most of them are very straightforward, but a few need more than a once over
lightly code review, and there are things (notes to myself in comments)
that you will not want to check in.
