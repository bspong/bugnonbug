if the header tag contains two CSS files linked with the link tag and one is for
"screen" @media, the other is for "print" @media, only the first is applied
(only since ff 1.0pr). the bug only appears to apply to text/html content type
documents, in the case of serving the same pages as application/xhtml+xml the
XML stylesheets are applied correctly. in both cases the format of the pages is
XHTML1.0 strict.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit the URL
2. click on "print preview"

Actual Results:  
the print preview is without the print @media CSS rules applied to it.

Expected Results:  
the rules for @media print contained in
http://www.homeandhearth.com.au/css/print.css should have been applied.

this bug has only appeared since Firefox 1.0pr
