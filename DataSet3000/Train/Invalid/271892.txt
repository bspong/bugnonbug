1.Create page that uses a button or url to call javascript that will open a new
window. 
2.Have a button on that new page that will call javascript code on the opening
page using window.opener.yourformname.submit(); - is a good example. 
3. 

Actual Results:  
The form is not submitted and any javascript commands after that are not
executed i.e window.close();

Expected Results:  
Submitted the procedure in the opening window that will refresh that page and
then close itself (2nd poped up window)
