relocation error: ...: undefined symbol: _ZTISt9bad_alloc  in certain cases
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.79 [en] (X11; U; HP-UX B.11.00 9000/800)
Build Identifier: MozillaFirebird

When launching Firebird  after changing UID to a different normal use UID using
a setuid program I see the error /appl/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin:
relocation error: /appl/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin: undefined symbol:
_ZTISt9bad_alloc
If I set UID to the UID that owns the original process group, also unprivileged,
it runs normally.  All files and the $HOME directory exists are are owned by the
appropriate user in each case. (they are created dyunamically) and in each case
both a normal launchand a -createprofile launch fail.  Apparently I msised
something bhut can not see what. 

Reproducible: Always

1.Create a setuid wrapper program that sanities teh environement changes the uid
and launches Firebird
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
/appl/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin: relocation error:
/appl/MozillaFirebird/MozillaFirebird-bin: undefined symbol: _ZTISt9bad_alloc
se (-createprofile) and to	

Expected Results:  
I had expected it to fixup the appreg file in the first case
