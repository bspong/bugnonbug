if we create an html page and the table... in one of the cells we insert an 
iframe. in the iframe there is a link...eg href="../html/membs/a.html" 
the iframe (source page) is in the membs directory too.
if we click the link... in firefox it doesn't find it! it trys to find it in 
the "html" folder, but the same link can be opened in IE5+ without a problem:
creating the problem:
1. Folder: HTML
2. Inside html create another folder named membs
3. in the html folder we create a page which has a table
4. In one of the table's cell we put an iframe
5. The iframe links to a page (html) in the membs folder
6. the iframe_page has one link.... which links to another html page inside the 
membs folder
7. in firefox it searches the file in the html folder instead in the membs 
folder. it search in the directory were the MAIN page was which had the iframe 
link while IE searches the directory were the iframe_page is
8. i can create an example and send it if it helps

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Folder: HTML
2. Inside html create another folder named membs
3. in the html folder we create a page which has a table
4. In one of the table's cell we put an iframe
5. The iframe links to a page (html) in the membs folder
6. the iframe_page has one link.... which links to another html page inside the 
membs folder
7. in firefox it searches the file in the html folder instead in the membs 
folder. it search in the directory were the MAIN page was which had the iframe 
link while IE searches the directory were the iframe_page is
8. i can create an example and send it if it helps

Actual Results:  
the link cannot be found... if you fix the url link then the link won't work in 
IE (any version)

Expected Results:  
when a page is being loaded either inside frames or not, to "capture" the 
directory were the link got "read" from and not to "still" remember the 
directory of the main frame or page/since it's an iframe error

the problem is the same on win XP also... 
it doesn;t crash the broswer it justs understand the directories differently 
and so my web site cannot be compatiable bot with firefox 1 and IE.
