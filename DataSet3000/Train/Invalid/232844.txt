I opened a website that timed out. Now forgive me, as I wont be able to be very
specific, but the website timed out and an error popped up (forget wether it
mentoned java..) The error message said the site had timoout which I beleive it
shouold read timeout. I cannot replicate the problem as the website is now
responding correctly. page for reference is:

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Unable to reproduce unless I find a different website that times out
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Refreshed and the webpage loaded, so I didnt get the error, and mistakenly did
not write the complete error message. 

Expected Results:  
Error message should have correct spelling for timeout.
<timeout>
