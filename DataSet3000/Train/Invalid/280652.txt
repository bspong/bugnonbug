I create Crystal Reports somewhat often where I work and while having a FireFox
window open I experience issues while trying to save my reports. Now I know that
sounds like a Crystal Issue but... I can remedy the problem by closing my
FireFox windows. I don't know it might be a Crystal issue...

The error is as follows:

The instruction at "0x73dd1351" referenced memory at "0x00000004". The memory
not be "read". Click on OK to terminate the program.

Hope that helps.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open firefox
2.open Crystal Reports
3.modify a report
4.save
5.error occurs on save

Actual Results:

The instruction at "0x73dd1351" referenced memory at "0x00000004". The memory
not be "read". Click on OK to terminate the program.
