REQ: Add functionality to bookmark groups of tabs (not just set them as homepage)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040614 Firefox/0.9

Desired Functionality:

1. Have multiple tabs with various sites open.
2. Click Bookmarks->Bookmark Tabs as Group
3. Popup dialouge would ask for name of group, where to save group bookmark,
perhaps even give checkboxes next to open tab names/urls to allow finer
selection of tab groups.
4. Hit 'Ok' to save a bookmark group.
5. Bookmark would have different "group" icon, and opening bookmark would open
tabs with those webpages loaded.


Look to CrazyBrowser on windows (an IE extension) for similar functionality.
