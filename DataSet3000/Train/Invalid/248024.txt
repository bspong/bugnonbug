Prefs are in different places and are differently named depending on the OS

In Firefox 0.9 for Linux, the preferences can be reached via Edit-->Preferences
(the typical Mozilla way, like in the suite). On the other hand, in Firefox 0.9
Win32, the preferences are called 'Options', and are located in the 'Tools' menu.

This, apart of being nosense, is a direct threat to Mozilla and Firefox's
cross-platform nature, as there start appearing significant (and unnecessary)
differences between the different versions.

This way, we can't say that Firefox is completely cross-platform, but that it is
a Windows-centered browser which has been ported and re-implemented for working
on Linux and Mac OS X. And that's not true.

So, the preferences must be in the same place on all Firefox versions, no matter
the OS being used. I think Edit-->Preferences would be more normal, as it has
been like that since Netscape 4.0, and because putting it under 'Tools' means
copying Microsoft. Also, preferences aren't a tool.

Anyway, the important think here is that the preferences should be always in the
same place, and with the same name.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.In Firefox for Linux, go to the preferences.
2.Now try to do the same on Windows.
3.Whoa, there aren't preferences but options and they are even in another place.

Actual Results:  
The preferences are differently located and named.

Expected Results:  
They should have been in the same place both in Windows and Linux, and with the
same name, wether they were in Edit-->Preferences OR in Tools-->Options.
