"Check Now..." extensions/themes button should be disabled if there are no themes/extensions installed
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050225

I have no themes nor extensions installed, and when i go to
/options/advanced/
i see a button to check an update for them. This part should be dimmed or not
shown if the user dont have any themes/extensions installed
