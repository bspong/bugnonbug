FireFox install does not create KDE/Gnome toolbar/desktop/start menu icons

I am reporting this after reading a computer columnist's Nov 2004 column in a
local business paper titled "Linux OS still not quite ready for prime time yet".
He's a Mac & Windows user... he reported installing Mandrake Linux successfully,
then downloading and installing Firefox, which ran the first time OK, but he was
then umable to find a start icon. It might seem ludicrous to apparently rate an
entire operating system on something this trivial, but I guess it's a valid
point, similar to the "where did my download go?" issue that lead to the
download manager

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download FireFox on Mandrake Linux 
2. Install FireFox
3.

Actual Results:  
No obvious start icon for FireFox

Expected Results:  
Figured out if user was running KDE or Gnome, or maybe some other desktop
Added a start icon to the start menu, if possible.
Prompted user to add a start icon to toolbar
Prompted user to add a shortcut icon to desktop



When I installed FireFox (or Mozilla) myself on RedHat 9, I do not recall being
prompted for a desktop or toolbar icon. I don't use the start menu, so I can't
be certain that there was no FireFox icon (RedHat includes Mozilla), but I don't
think so.

Although Gnome and KDE might be prone to disparate user configurations,I would
think it possible to script some install procedure that would work in a majority
of cases.
