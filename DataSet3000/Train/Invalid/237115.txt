In the page http://www.stgeorge.com.au (a bank!) the log-in (right hand side of
page) uses javascript to open a new window to enter log-in details. If pop-up
blocking is enabled, it is not possible to allow the pop-up for this site. 
Entering the site URL produces "www.stgeorge.com.au" in the allow-window.
Entering https://www.stgeorge.com.au also produces "www.stgeorge.com.au" in the
allow-window.
I have not checked this with sites with a URL of the format http://sitename.tld

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Tools
2. Options
3. Web features
4. Add site
5. Enter the site to unblock (https.www.sitename.com)
6. OK

Actual Results:  
www.sitename.com was entered in the "Allways allow..." window.

Expected Results:  
https://www.sitename.com should have been entered in the "Allways allow..." window.
