Netscape Web Accelerator fails to perform, it reports connected with 0.0 % acceleration

This feature is an enhancement to a dial-up connection. It launches after the
dialer has verified the connection. It normally reports the acceleration rate as
a multiplier of savings and is usually in or near the 4.0 range. With FIREFOX,
it always shows savings of 0.0. I have tried re-installing it to no avail. If I
switch to a different browser, IE or Netscape it functions normally. Even if I
start a session with IE or Netscape and then switch to FIREFOX, it immediately
stops responding.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Launch Dialer which then starts the accelerator and the browser
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The accelerator reports normal connection but with 0.0 savings. If I run a
diagnostics from the accelerator menu, it then reports an extremely high
savings, sometimes as high as 40.0 +, but I feel this is an eroneous reading as
there does not appear to be any detectable change. This value never changes
unless I re-run the diagnostics, but there is still no apparent change. Also the
Icon on the taskbar should change color when it is functioning, but does not.

Expected Results:  
The accelerator should report savings near the 4.0 range, (this is the usual
normal reading ) and the taskbar icon should indicate activity along with the
modem icon, the modem icon reflects activity but the accelerator does not unless
I launch a different browser, IE or Netscape.
