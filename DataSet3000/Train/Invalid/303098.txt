When too more downloads or megabytes limit (i don't improve this), firefox is
blocking and not responding with memory increment (i seen it in processes of
task manager). It has been 3 or 4 times (i was downloaded about 10 gigabytes),
but i can't reproduced it, because it may be need too much downloads. My system:
win xp sp2 corporate rus

Reproducible: Always
