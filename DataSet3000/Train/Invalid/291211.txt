I just upgraded to firefox 1.0.3 (from 1.0.2) and now when I open up the browser I get a blank and frozen window.

I just upgraded to firefox 1.0.3 (from 1.0.2) on windows 2000 and now when I
open up the browser I get a blank and frozen window without my bookmarks toolbar
and with no tabs, see this screen shot

It doesn't matter if I:

1) click on a link in a email or instant message
2) open the browser from scratch
3) have 1 tab or 5 tabs as my homepage(s).  If I do have multiple tabs though I
can <ctrl> + <tab> between them for which the browser title bar does chnage but
again the browser is useless.
4) open an html file
5) open a flash swf file
6) open a image file

I have tried to:

1) unistall and reinstall firefox 1.0.3 (doesn't help)
2) uninstall 1.0.3 and reinstall 1.0.2 (problem still exists)
3) uninstall any plugins I wasn't reallly using or any one that Ihave been
updated recently (still doesn't help). Here is a screen shot of the plugins I
have - http://www.ee.udel.edu/~staiano/firefox/FireFoxExtensions.gif

Once out of 15 or so times the browser will work open up correctly but nothing
special is done to get the result.   It seems to be random luck when it actually
works.

My problem is similar to Bugzilla Bug 290617 except that problem is on the MAC.
 I have tried different tips talked about there and in other tickets (for
windows xp sp2) but not of them work (again I am on windows 2000).

Help,

until I upgrade to 1.0.3.
