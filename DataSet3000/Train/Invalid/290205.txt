X Server stalls up while general browsing
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050404 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; de-DE; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050404 Firefox/1.0.2

System:
Gentoo, X.org 6.8.2, Kernel 2.6.11-r4

Browsing with Firefox 1.0.2 and also MozillaSuite on no specific or equal pages
hangs up the system 1 or 2 times everyday, never more, independend how long I
browse. This Machine doesn't response in every way (can't move mouse, etc.).
Only once I was able so get ssh'ed onto this Machine and X was running with
99,8% CPU. Therefor I was not able to get a traceback or stdout outputs.
This behavior happens only with Firefox and MozillaBrowser, no other Applications.
If other information have to be provided, I'll do my best.
Btw. it seems only happen while scrolling the page but I can't swear. I'll keep
an eye on it.
