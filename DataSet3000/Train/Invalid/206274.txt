I think this has to do with the tabbed browsing extensions...
http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/_tabextensions.html.en
... so maybe I should be reporting this to the extensions author, but it's only
broken in the last couple of nightlies.

In the tabbed settings I have the window mode set to "Use multiple browser
windows only when I open them" so that if I double click an html in My Computer
or click a link in an email for example it opens the page in a new tab of any
exisitng browser window. However if I do already have a browser window it crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install tab browsing extensions
2. Set tab prefs to Window Mode - "Use multiple browser windows only when I open
them"
3. Open a web page from internet then double click a local page in my computer

Actual Results:  
Browser crashes.

Expected Results:  
Opened the local file in a new tab.
