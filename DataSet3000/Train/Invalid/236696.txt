When using the Bookmarks Manager, adding a separator to the bookmarks lets the
user give every separator a name to organize the entries inside a folder. This
is a good and easy way of orientation when browsing the bookmarks.
The name is displayed at the left side of the separator, but only in the
Bookmarks Manager. The Bookmarks function in Firefox itself (Menu item
"Bookmarks") lacks the names at all.
Since this function in Bookmark Manger is well designed and a great help I
consider its lack in Firefox a bug.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Bookmarks Manager
2. Add a new separator and enter a name
3. Return to the Firefox main application, choose the Menu item "Bookmarks" and
navigate to the corresponding separator position

Actual Results:  
The separators name is displayed in the Bookmarks Manager at the left side of
the separator which is what is expected.
But in the Firefox Bookmarks only the separator is shown, without the name.

Expected Results:  
Just like in the Bookmarks Managers display the separator names should be
displayed in the Firefox Bookmarks on the left side of the separator.
