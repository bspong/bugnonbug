reference to master password present on first use of autocomplete
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030429 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

Upon using the autocomplete feature for the first time, Firebird will show the
standard Mozilla dialog regarding Master Passwords. Since this functionality is
(as far as I know) not implemented in Firebird (and at the very least not
visible), it would probably be less confusing to new users if this dialog was
changed to reflect Firebird - remove the reference to Master Passwords and
simply state that the password file is hard, but not impossible, to break into.
This bug might depend on bug 173565 (Satchel should replace password manager)
but, in the meantime, editing the text of that dialog would probably not be too
time-consuming.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a new profile
2. Enter a password and ask to have it saved


Actual Results:  
Receive dialog that references Master Passwords

Expected Results:  
Receive perhaps a similar dialog that doesn't make reference to Master Passwords.
