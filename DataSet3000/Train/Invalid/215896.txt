http-authentication does not send username/password to pages in the same directory

Since the recent version (0.6.1) http-authentication is partially broken.
Firebird 6.0 did not have this behaviour.

On a site I use the following page to log-in "/login.php". This works fine.

After logging in, password and username are correctly submitted to pages in the
directories below (like /editor/index.php)

But the password is not submitted to other pages in the same directory (like
/documents.php). Also /logout.php does not work, because it never detects that
the user has already been logged in
