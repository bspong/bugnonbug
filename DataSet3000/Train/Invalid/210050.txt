Is there a possibility current build(s) is/are contaminated with new spyware? I've run 20030619 also

Today came back to computer after a while of rest after installing 2003 06 19.
Home page had been hijacked (alexa ?) by URL listed (opens as a second tab in
browser window). I use a file on harddrive with links to often visited sites. 
Firebird is the only browser affected (I run IExplorer 5.5, Netscape 4.8,
Netscape 7.02 and Firebird). 
I've had AdAware for some time and nothing shows up it. I've installed Spybot
and nothing showed up in it!
That's why I'm wondering about current Firebird build.

1.Open program
2.Home page is hijacked
3.

Actual Results:  
If you change home page back to normal the hijacked page still opens as a tab in
browser window

Expected Results:  
Kept homepage
