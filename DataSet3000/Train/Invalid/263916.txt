Click  a link to a local html file doesn't load file
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Firefox 1.0 Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 (downloaded yesterday)

My home page is file:///E:%5Cmydata%5CWINDOWS%5CMAIN.HTM
and it contains an anchor  <A HREF="info.htm">Sources of general info</A>
referring to a local file in the same directory as the parent.

Clicking on this link causes Firefox to try to access file:///info.htm, which I
am guessing is an ambiguous reference because the disk is missing?  Or ???   But
 it does not load the referenced page.

I need this to work correctly, as it does in IE and Netscape.  Any idea when it
might get fixed?   Please reply to dave1@wcf.com  

Reproducible: Always

2.   Follow the link (click on it)
3.   Nothing happens (FILE:///fn.ft is displayed at the bottom of screen)

Actual Results:  
Nothing

Expected Results:  
Displayed linked page
