The "Address" field in the "mailto" properties window is truncated

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://212.199.222.121/aaci/owa/listp?type=0&l=1&in_id=2542&garea=0&dates=2
2. RMB on the "mailto" link
3. Select "Properties"

Actual Results:  
Only part of the "Address" field is visible.

Expected Results:  
See the whole field.
It took me time to realize I can click on the text and move with the rught arrow.
Please make the window wider or put a horiz. scroll bar or any other visual clue
that the user can see the rest of the field.
A good example might be the file properties on the download manager.
You see the 2 fields and you can assume you can see the right side.
