Option "Notification: Change the bookmark's icon" has no visable effect in Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Konqueror/3.2; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko)

When a bookmark is scheduled to check for updates the notification option "Change the 
bookmark's icon" doesn't work.  When Firefox believes the page to have changed (which it gets 
slightly wrong; see bug 207814) it will display a notice if "Display an alert" has been selected, 
or alternatively 'beep' if "play a sound" is selected, but the icon displayed on the Bookmarks 
Toolbar never changes when "Change the bookmark's icon" is selected.  The icon shown on the 
menu Bookmarks/Bookmarks Toolbar Folder doesn't change either.  This is using the default 
theme Firefox(default) 2.0 Gerich and Horlander. 
 
Have reproduced using: 
 
Firefox 0.9.1 
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040719 Firefox/0.9.1 
 
Firefox 0.9.2 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2 
 
Firefox 0.9.2 
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2 
 
Have tried the same test in Mozilla 1.7.1[Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.1) 
Gecko/20040726 Debian/1.7.1-4] and the bookmark icon changes.  NB Mozilla doesn't show 
favicons which Firefox does and this I'm guessing is probably relevant to the problem.
