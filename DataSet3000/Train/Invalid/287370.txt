Quite oftenly by opening some pages in web sites (for instance
http://www.sharereactor.ru/) , FireFox sudenly stops loading page and all my
Win2K freezes compleatly. I have to reboot my systems by presing RST button.
That happens not so offenly (can be few times a day). In case if browser is
switched off this freez situation hapens never.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open for instance this web site (can be some other):
http://www.sharereactor.ru/ I've tested thsi site twise - both time same esult
of freeze system.
2. Whait till web site will open. It's seams system freezes by the end of
opening this site (open icon stil runing, web site seems near to be open
compleatly). 
3. Stop opening web site, no respond from mouse and keyboard, system freezed.

Actual Results:  
:o) What happend?! You waiting-waiting, then deciding to press RESET button..
Worst thing is that you loosing all work you've done on this current point of
freez .. 

Expected Results:  
This situation of freezing windows system hapens ONLY by browsing web sites.
Browsing by FireFox - shouldn't couse system freez.

 My Windows Event Viwer says:
 1) The browser has received a server announcement indicating that the computer
WHOPPER is a master browser, but this computer is not a master browser. [MRxSmb,
13.11h, Warning]
 2) The browser was unable to promote itself to master browser.  The browser
will continue to attempt to promote itself to the master browser, but will no
longer log any events in the event log in Event Viewer. [BROWSER, 13.11h, Error]

 That's a last log message before system bacome to be compleatly freezed.
