User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

The dialogue box is titled:  Firefox entry point not found 

The rest reads: The procedure entry point RtUnhandledException Filter could not
be located in the dynamic link library.  ntdll.dll

with "Okay" as the only option.  Once you click okay, it seems to work (slowly),
but you have to hold CTRL and mouse click to activate links - sometimes they
work, sometimes not.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. When you open Firefox the first time, this happens
2. Once you click "Okay" it seems to go away until the next time you open it



Expected Results:  
opened,without dialogue box, and gone right to embedded links
