This forum has a message editor interface in WYSIWYG mode (Enhanced mode) when
posting messages. However, when using Firefox 1.0PR, this feature is not
available. When using Firefox 0.9 and older I am able to use this feature.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.First, must be registered
2.Click on "New Thread"
3.And switch to "Enhanced Mode" in the editor
4.Editor should now be viewed in WYSIWYG mode (white screen).

Actual Results:  
When switching to "Enhanced Mode" nothing happens, the editor stays in black screen.

Expected Results:  
Editor should have switched to WYSIWYG mode (white screen) where images and text
formats can be viewed.

I am using "Single Window 1.4" and Noia 2.0 (eXtreme) theme. I want to point out
that this was happening before I installed the extension and theme.
