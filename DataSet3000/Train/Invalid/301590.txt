Unable to connect to the Internet via any method after installing Firefox 1.05

I started with Firefox 1.0 and have upgraded immediately upon availability to
1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, with no problems. After upgrading to 1.0.5 I was
unable to connect with the Internet through the address bar, bookmarks, or even
going to my designated homepage "Google". The error message was always " unable
to locate www.xxx.xxxxxx, please re-enter" I uninstalled 1.0.5 and re-installed
1.0.4 and everything worked fine again. A week later I tried to upgrade to 1.0.6
and had the same problem - inability to connect to the Internet. I uninstalled
1.0.6 and re-installed 1.0.4 and I was back and running again. I have always
chosen the standard options and just click "Next" at all decision points. What's
happening or happened between 1.0.4 and the newer versions?
