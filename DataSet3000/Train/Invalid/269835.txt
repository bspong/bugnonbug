new set of prefs in "Tabbed Browsing" isn't a complete replacement for browser.block.target_new_window

In Firefox 1.0 the browser.block.target_new_window pref is ignored and its
function should have been taken over by the "Force links that open new windows
to open in:" option, but this cannot reproduce the same behavior on PopUps that
older versions of FF (e.g. 1.0RP) showed with
browser.block.target_new_window="True" . 
browser.block.target_new_window="True" forced links with "target=_blank" to open
in new windows, but not JavaScript PopUps. This is the desired behavior (for
me), since it wouldn't be very convenient to have the pictures opened in the
same window on a page like this:
http://www.haarlem.de/fotos/40-jahre-haarlem/40-jahre-haarlem.htm
But if one checks "Force links that open new windows to open in:" in FF1.0 also
the JavaScript PopUps will open in the same Window. There seems to be no way to
recover the former behavior.
