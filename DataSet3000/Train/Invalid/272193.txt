if Load Images is checked and "only for originating website" is unchecked, it does NOT stay unchecked!

In Tools/Options/Web Features/Load Images [>>>for the originating website
only<<<] must be UNTICKED each and every time before a new page is loaded to be
sure that everything gets loaded!  hmmpph!

In other words, even though I UNcheck the "originating..." box, it REchecks
itself  for all subsequent pages!  NOT nice!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to the indicated menu/submenus
2. uncheck the box for Load Images: for originating website only
3. load your page
4. open a new tab (or close the browser and reopen it) and check the check box
status!

Actual Results:  
the checkbox is again rechecked!

Expected Results:  
settings should remain as the user sets them!
