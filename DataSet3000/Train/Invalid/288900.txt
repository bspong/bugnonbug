"Sanitize Now" needs visual feedback (disable the button while sanitizing is in progress)

Currently when you click "Sanitize Now", and this involves clearing the cache,
several seconds can pass before the dialog closes. Ideally, the Sanitize button
should be disabled after clicking to give visual feedback that Sanitization is
occurring.

This is hardly critical, but can be confusing, as the user has no idea whether
their click had any effect or not.
