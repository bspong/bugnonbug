Options & Sanitize Dialog Boxes In Firefox 1.0+ Are Not Visible
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050325 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050325 Firefox/1.0+

After installing Firefox 1.0+ nightly build 3/25/05, when the menu TOOLS,
OPTIONS or TOOLS, SANITIZE are selected, the dialog box is not visible.  


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install Firefox 1.0+
2. Open Firefox 1.0+
3. Select TOOLS, OPTIONS or TOOLS, SANITIZE


Actual Results:  
Rather than the Options or Sanitize dialog box appearing, the current screen/web
page remains.  The only thing that Options or Sanitize does to change the
current screen/web page is it adds the dialog box headings (GENERAL, PRIVACY,
CONTENT, TABS, DOWNLOADS, ADVANCED) and the OK and CANCEL radio buttons to the
current screen/web page.


Expected Results:  
The OPTIONS or SANITIZE dialog box should have appeared in place of the current
web page/screen.
