Unable to see "Continue" text when processing and order.

When processing an order, the "continue" button wasn't visible.  If I moved the
mouse around, the "finger" appeared where the box should have been displayed,
and it worked.  I wouldn't have been able to do this if the person I talked to
on the phone at IHerb didn't use Firefox also.

I'd much Firefox would show me the text window rather than only giving me the
finger.  (Sorry, I couldn't resist the last remark.)  Firefox is a great browser.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to www.iherb.com
2.  Select an item to order
3.   The item appears in the "shopping basket"

Actual Results:  
From the "shopping basket" there is no indication about how to go to "check
out".  There should be a "Continue" button in the space under the "shopping
basket" window on the right sice, oppositer the "Continue Shopping" text.

Expected Results:  
The software should have displayed "Continue Shopping" and "Continue" in the
same sub-window.
