Actual Results:  
I get the message about missing export and device attached to system not 
functioning

Expected Results:  
Allowed me to use Mozilla as my web browser.  

Each time I have to use Internet Explorer to download something that Mozilla 
does not support or browse a web site that does not recognize Mozilla, I 
experience problems.  If I knew how to rid the computer  of Internet Explorer 
(my dialup (Cascade Access) only supports IE) I would get rid of IE.
