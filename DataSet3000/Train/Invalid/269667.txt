When Ctrl+F4 is pressed, two tabs are closed instead of one

Normally (in other browsers - NS/Moz/...), Ctrl+F4 closes only the active tab.
But in Firefox, when I press Ctrl + F4, two tabs are being closed (the active
tab and the one immediately left to it). If there are only two tabs/one tab, the
first tab also closes and is replaced with an 'Untitled' page (similar to bug
#266851).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a few tabs
2. Press Ctrl + F4


Actual Results:  
The active tab and the one to its immediate left would close.

Expected Results:  
Only close the active tab
