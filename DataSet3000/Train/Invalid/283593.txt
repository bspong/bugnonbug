Unable to complete transaction at bank site but the same transaction works in IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I live in Indonesia and use a local bank for daily transactions by Internet. 
Have routinely used the site for 2 years.  In IE I can routinely transfer funds
to other accounts, but in Firefox I reach the point where an intended transfer
is supposed to be clicked into the 'transaction basket' whereupon the Web page
freezes so that I cannot proceed with the transaction. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log into my account at the Bank Permata
2. Go to transfer page
3. Enter all the data for a transfer
4. Click "Send to transaction basket"

Actual Results:  
Nothing.  The screen remains the same and there is no indication at the bottom
of the frame (as in IE) that data is being exchanged with the bank site.  

Expected Results:  
In IE, within 2 minutes, a new screen pops up showing the Transaction Basket but
that never happens in Firefox
