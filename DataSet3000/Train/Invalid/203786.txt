Renaming Mozilla Firebird application to "Mozilla Browser"
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030428 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

Latest nightlies still fail to meet the new branding guidelines of April 25,
differentiating between project name (Mozilla Firebird) and application name
(Mozilla Browser).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open any of the latest nightlies.
2. Read the name of the application in the title bar.
3. Read the bookmarks toolbar.
4. Read Help -> About Mozilla Firebird.

Actual Results:  
The project name (Mozilla Firebird) appears as the application name.

Expected Results:  
The application name ("Mozilla Browser" and "Mozilla Browser 0.6", for these
nightlies) should be shown in the application, not the project name ("Mozilla
Firebird Project"), in the same way that there was for instance a "Mozilla 0.6",
etc., including the current browser Mozilla Navigator, and not a "SeaMonkey
0.6", etc.

According to the new Branding Strategy (April 25), the project and application
names are:

Project name:
"Mozilla Firebird" (until Mozilla 1.4)
"Mozilla Browser" (after Mozilla 1.4)

Application/product/files name:
"Mozilla Browser"

"6.  Product Naming in resources, executables and on the desktop

The Mozilla Browser and Mail programs should try to stick to the mozilla product
name whenever possible, even in resource names. [...]"
