pages display too wide

On various pages on the web, Firefox loads pages to wide, forcing you to scroll
to read line by line.  This is not the case with everyone, but I have test on
various OS's, PC's, and out of 10 diff PC's, it happened to 2+.  If especially
happens strangely on the MOZILLA Forums, and also Spreadfirefox.com .  The
mozilla forums seem to load about an inch wider then it should on pages with
long posts, or something.

This link shows people having the same problem as me, on the same pages on the
forums as examples, and refreshes DO NOT solve the problem:

I view these pages in IE fine, but FF continues to load these specific pages to
wide on a consistent basic, I have run tests and it happens precisely the same
and on the same pages to other users, some of which can confirm as an example in
that forum topic alone.  This really is embarrassing.  Mozilla put down MS for
not running to standards and theyre site not working on other browsers, when
Mozilla's own site is not working for what seems like a reasonable amount of
Mozilla users, on the mozilla site, worse - IE loads them fine.

If is the same pages, refreshes do not fix it, others have posted confirming,
and I have also ran tests, either the sites in question have a problem, or the
browser.  You may not be able to re-create it personally, this does not been the
bug is not there, I and many can re-create it all day, on whatever version FF,
with whatever settings.  The site or the browser, which is it?

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to
http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=146651&postdays=0&postorder=asc&postsperpage=15&start=45
2. The page displays too wide
3. Refresh, the page is still too wide, happens quite regularly on various sites.

Actual Results:  
The page is 1 inch wider than it should be forcing you to read it line by line,
moving left and right.  IE displays it fine, FF, cannot - and it's Mozilla's site.

Expected Results:  
A page the same size width as the last, and every page on the site, as with IE
and previous pages.
