Pop ups from this site are somehow circumventing Mozilla's pop up blocker

The complete address for one specific pop up that continues to evade Mozilla's
pop up block is
http://z1.adserver.com/w/cp.x;rid=652;tid=5;ev=2;ac=60;mid=5038
Z1 apparently has found a way to circumvent Mozilla's pop up blocker. I do NOT
have it entered in my "pop up exceptions." These pop ups are getting more and
more frequent, now a couple of times a day at least.  

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce




The pop ups seem very random and pop up visiting completely different sites,
that  don't seem related in any way.
