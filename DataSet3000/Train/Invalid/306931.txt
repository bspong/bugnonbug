McAfee and Mozilla appear to be incompatible
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I have been informed by McAfee that their products have become inactive because
I can't verify them. Nor can I download updates. Mozilla message was that McAfee
had been prevented from downloading.  I requested Mozilla to "allow" McAfee and
it will now let me into the McAfee site but will not allow me to access any of
the functions. I don't know if this qualifies as a bug but it is certainly
irritating. Can you help?

Reproducible: Always

1. Attempt to contact McAfee
2. Request downloads
3.

Actual Results:  
The McAfee screen lost its wording and the words "not defined" appeared

Expected Results:  
Allowed me to access downloads and to verify myy description.
