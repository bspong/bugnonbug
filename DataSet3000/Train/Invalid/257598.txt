Javascript bookmarklet causes Block Popup Windows option to disable

And I've been getting pop-ups lately, and noticing that my Block Popup Windows
option keeps unchecking itself. I finally figured out it was my javascript item
in my personal toolbar.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a bookmark on the personal toolbar that creates a javascript window.
javascript:void(open('http://www.google.com')); works.
2. Make sure Block Popup Windows is enabled.
3. Click the bookmark.

Actual Results:  
Block Popup Windows is now disabled.

Expected Results:  
Block Popup Windows option should have remained enabled.
