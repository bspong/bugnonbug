The bookmark properties option in the context sensitive menu doesn't work if
selected from the menu bar, only if selected from within the bookmark manager

I know this is a minor bug, but it's very annoying, and we're nearing 1.0...

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select the Bookmarks option on the menu bar
2. Right-click on any arbitrary bookmark
3. Click Properties

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens (well, the menu closes).

Expected Results:  
The Properties dialog for the bookmark should have been opened.
