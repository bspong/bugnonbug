By performing (at least) one specific set of tab maneuvers Firefox (Deer Park)
can be thrown into tab confusion as described in the steps to reproduce.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1) Open Firefox and navigate to any website.
2) Open a new, blank tab.  Optionally, navigate to a site within the new tab.
3) Reverse the order of the tabs by dragging/dropping.  It does not matter which
tab is dragged.
Actual Results:  
Both tabs now display the contents of the active tab (that is, the tab that was
active at the time of dragging).  Reloading or renavigating within the
then-inactive tab has no effect (i.e. cannot load a different page), and the tab
sometimes cannot be closed without restarting the browser (though this final
behavior seems rather rare).

Expected Results:  
Moving tabs should only affect the order and not affect the contents of the tabs.

Using default theme, occurs with and without TabBrowserPreferences extension
installed.

I have also verified the bug with three tabs (in this case, dragging the first
tab to the middle).
