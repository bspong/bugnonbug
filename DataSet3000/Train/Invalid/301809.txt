Middle-clicking a link doesn't always open a new tab as expected

In such a page as a Google search result page, when clicking a link with the
middle-button in order to open a tab, the tab won't always open as expected,
depending on the link :

-a link on a page won't open with middle-click for no understandable reason
-middle-clicking the same link again still won't open the link in a new tab
-another link may work
-reloading the page is likely to make the link that would previously not open open.

This bug is on 1.0.6. I never tried on 1.0.5 so I cannot tell about it, but on
1.0.4 or any previous release I never observed such a bug

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to some page such as some Google search result
2. By middle-clicking some links, sometimes you will see that some links won't
open in a new tab

Actual Results:  
Nothing (in case of a link that wouldn' open, which happens often but not that
often). The link won't open in a new tab, unless you use the contextual menu and
choose Open Link In A New Tab

Expected Results:  
it should have opened the link in a new tab
