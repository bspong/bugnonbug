"Open with default application" field is empty for some apps/extensions
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050228 Firefox/1.0+

For some apps/extensions the "Open with default application" in the "Download
Actions" section of Options contains no text, just an icon. I've seen this with
WinZip9/.zip, 7-Zip/.zip and Azureus/.torrent.

Steps to Reproduce
1. Install one of the above apps and make it the default app for the associated
filetype.
2. Start Firefox.
3. Download a file of the relevant type and tell it to "Do this automatically
for files of this type from now on".
4. Goto Tools->Options->Downloads->View & Edit Actions
5. Highlight the relevant file type and press "Change Action".
6. Notice how the "Open them with the default application" box is empty.

Some filetypes e.g. AdobeReader6/.pdf work as expected and have a name filled in
the default application box, others are empty.
