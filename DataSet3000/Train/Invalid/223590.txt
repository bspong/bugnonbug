I have a wheel mouse with cmd-click mapped to the wheel click using MS's
Intellimouse Preferences Panel. This mapping should open a link in a new tab
when used. It opens a new tab in both Safari and Camino, but not in Firebird.
When I do a manual cmd-click using the keyboard and first mouse button, the link
is successfully opened in a new tab. It seems like Firebird is stealing the
focus of the third mouse button. I tried removing the mapping in the prefs, but
this did not allow the third mouse button to open a new tab.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set wheel button to cmd-click in preferences panel
2. Click a link in Firebird with the wheel button

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
A new tab should open displaying the link clicked on.
