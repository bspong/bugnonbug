When I have more than one tab opens (or when the tab bar is visible) and I go in
fullscreen mode, the tab bar is always visible.

In Firefox 1.0, the tab bar was not visible in fullscreen mode so I guess it's a
regression because, with the new behavior, you don't get a "true" fullscreen mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Open a new tab so that the tab bar is visible
3. Go to fullscreen mode with F11

Actual Results:  
Tab bar is still visible

Expected Results:  
Tab bar would not be visible like every othe toolbars (except the find toolbar)
and firefox would provide true fullscreen
