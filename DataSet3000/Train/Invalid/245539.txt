I have chosen Lotus Notes as may default email client using Windows XP 
nice preferences. IE works nice, but Firefox still opens Outlook Express.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Choose programs to use: (Windows XP's feature to set Email, Browser, Java
machine etc). I chose Lotus Notes.
2.  Open Firefox
3. Click mailto: link and Outlook Express opens

Actual Results:  
Outlook Express is offered with recipient in link. Nice. Then I copy paste it to
my real email client.

Expected Results:  
Open email client I've chosen.  There is some mechanism in XP nowadays.
