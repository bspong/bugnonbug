After using forefox for a few months, it freezes in normal startup - only works
in safe mode. Can't access tools or other menus.  Can't type in url or search
fields.
Even in safe mode, new extensions and updates do not show or work after install.
Previous tab settings don't work any longer -all sites open in same tab -and
menu options appear different (e;g., option for cursor activation of tab no
longer appears).  Nothing changes with new install in separate folder.

Reproducible: Always

3.

Actual Results:  
As described above.
