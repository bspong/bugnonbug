I was working on some Flash, using Flash MX, to create a simple button.  When
you click the button it was meant to goto the page brochure.htm.  As the page
does not exist I would of expected it to popup and tell me it can't find it. 
Instead, the browser opens a blank tab, then another blank tab.  The 2nd blank
tab then goes to www.petetownshend.co.uk for some odd reason.

I've told IE and Opera to be default browser and this does not happen.  I'm not
exactly sure why this happens.  

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Click flash button
Actual Results:  
The browser opens a blank tab, then another blank tab.  The 2nd blank tab then
goes to www.petetownshend.co.uk for some odd reason.


Expected Results:  
Told me it can't find the URL.
