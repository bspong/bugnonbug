The problem has actually shown up on other web sites. Navigating around Amazon
seemed fine while I added a couple of items to my Shopping Basket. When I went
to Checkout, I filled in the requested information, but no box appeared. I kept
moving the cursor in the general area where I thought the box should be until
the cursor turned into the Hand and clicked in the blind. Only the outline of
the box appreared, not the text in the box. I guess it is time to go back to
Netscape, or horrors, IE.  Reproducibility: I think it is any site where
acceopting or rejecting is an option via a box, not a check box.

Reproducible: Always
