After running for a while, Firefox will not acknowledge interaction - requires quitting and restarting

Occasionally, Firefox ceases to respond when trying to go to a website - both
typing in a URL or clicking on a bookmark - usually after I have had the
software running for a while, switching back and forth between Firefox and other
apps. When this occurs, if I quit and restart the software, things are fine.

I haven't gotten any "real" crashes - where I get a kernel notification - but
just general inablity for the software to function properly.
