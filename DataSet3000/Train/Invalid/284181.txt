I had some nice plugins when LiveConnect was around.  I see there is a new
initiative to bring back scriptable plugins.  If I want to build the "basic"
plugin (from GeckoPluginSDK - samples) will this work with FireFox.  I would
like to "send and receive" streams and utilize calls like NPN_GetURL and
NPN_MemAlloc.    With the new scriptable API evolving, is there any merit to
develop around these tools of the past?

Reproducible: Always
