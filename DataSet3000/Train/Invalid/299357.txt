When going to different panels in the options dialog, it was shown on a video
(http://www.bengoodger.com/software/mb/options/prefwindowv/PrefwindowV2.wmv)
that the options dialog would fade into the different panels.  This is not the
case on Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050630
Firefox/1.0+.  Was this effect taken out earlier?

1. Open up Deer Park
2. go to Tools -> Options...
3. Flip through the different panels and notice that there is no fading effect

Actual Results:  
Options dialog panels did not fade in.

Expected Results:
