Still getting popups warning me about Spyware, not sure if legit or tempting me

I am an ex-IE user.  I apparently was infected with Spyware, since I was getting
multiple popups that I could not control, and it got to the point that so many
popups were happening, that I could not close them fast enough, thus rendering
my use of the internet impossible.  A friend suggested I try Firefox, but that
didn't stop the problem.

Ultimately, I had to reinstall my operating system.  That solved my problem, and
I now use Firefox web browser exclusively, which I love.

However, I keep getting popups warning me that I may be infected with Spyware,
then it advises me to type in a certain url (which changes with each popup),
then hit the "ok" button to rid my computer of this alleged Spyware infection. 
For example, I receive this message often:

Messenger Service:
Message from Spyware Advisory to User on [date and time, which is usually wrong]

Important Alert Message
Your computer may be infected with unauthorized Spyware Progams
To fix:
1.  write down www.spw7.com
2.  enter the url in your IE, AOL, or Netscape browser
3.  then press GO

Is this a legit warning or someone trying to tempt me to a site that will then
infect my computer with Spyware?  How do I get rid of these messages?

PLEASE HELP!!!!
