File extentions overwrite mime settings
As I can't reopen bug# 234083 I reopen a new bug form instead.

FF (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107
Firefox/1.0) does not handle mime types correctly, file extentsions seem to
overrule the mime type is some cases.

test results from http://entropymine.com/jason/testbed/mime/

Mime: Result

text/html : OK (opens in browser)
image/gif : OK (opens in browser)
image/png : OK (opens in browser)
text/plain [A] & [B] : OK (opens in browser)
application/octet-stream [A],[B],[C] & [D] & x-foo/x-bar: NOT OK it correctly
pops up where I want to download the file or view it but it defaults to "open in
firefoxhtml")
application/zip : OK (downloads the file)

In my own test it shows that when downloading a file with extention .avi it
always pops up the option view or save with the default set to view. (including
when MIME is set to "application/zip") (if I change the extention to .foo it
handles it correctly)

IMMO FF should honnor the MIME above file extention, so AT LEAST set the default
action to SAVE when mime is set to application/octet-stream no matter what the
file extention is.
