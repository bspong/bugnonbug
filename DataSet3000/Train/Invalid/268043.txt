Unable to add new toolbars

When I go to View->Toolbars->Customize->Add New Toolbar, provide a name and
click "Okay", no new toolbar appears.

It does appear to be storing the toolbars temporarily, as I can't create another
one with the same name (until I click "Done", at which point I assume the
undisplayed and empty toolbar is deleted).

Reproducible: Always

Expected Results:  
New toolbar should be created when I click "Add New Toolbar"
