The first n seconds are missing.
A black area is displayed. After about 3 seconds (sometimes more or less) it
shows a picture, but the first n seconds in timeline are missing.

The plugin seems to start playing before it has all necessary data to show anything.

Starting from Shell I get the following Warnings (but maybe this is not
responsible, I get it with every view of a page):
Gtk-WARNING **: invalid cast from `GtkSuperWin' to `GtkWidget'

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.install svg plugin ;-)
2.got to page
3.it is an animated svg with timeline from w3cs testsuite

Actual Results:  
about three seconds of the scg it is black, than it starts displaying at the
point of abaout 3-4 Seconds. (no crashes)

Expected Results:  
showing ths svg from beginning ;-)
