On certain sites clicking a link (often) doesn't do anything.  Right-clicking
and then opening in a new tab or window will load the link, but left-clicking
doesn't even appear to focus the link (normally I see a dashed box around a link
when I've clicked but not yet released it, and it changes color). 

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1.click link

Actual Results:  
nothing
