After downloading the latest updates, a large gray bar appears at the bottom of
the browser below the bottom location bar.  It only appears with Firefox, no
other programs, and I cannot drag to reduce it.  I have the following extensions
showing on the location bar just above the gray box:  Auto Copy, Abe Vigoda's
Status, and Adblock.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Everytime I open Firefox, it is there and stays there
2.
3.



Expected Results:  
There should be no gray bar, or at the very least I should be able to reduce it.

I have a picture of it but do not know how to attach it.
