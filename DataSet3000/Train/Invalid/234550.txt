Page info misreads shortcut icon (.ico) file type

When autoloading a .ico shortcut icon, the browser incorrectly determines the
file type. The correct type should be "image/ico" or "image/x-icon". The actual
assumed filetype is "text/plain."

Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the URL: <a
href="http://webstu.messiah.edu/~sf1183/icontest.htm">http://webstu.messiah.edu/~sf1183/icontest.htm</a>
2. Click on Tools > Page Info
3. Click on the Media tab
4. Examine the file type for the icon file "favicon.ico"
This always works for the above address, but other websites do not exhibit the
same behavior. For example, the site <a
href="www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a> uses the exact same icon (I
copied it as a test file) but for this page the browser correctly detects the
file type.

Actual Results:  
The type reads "text/plain"

Expected Results:  
The type should auto-detect to "image/ico" (or "image/x-icon", I'm not sure which).

This may be related to (or a part of?) bug 234374, but I included it because
that bug seems to deal with files on a computer hard drive and this one deals
with files on the internet.

In addition, this may (or may not) be related to problems like that which occurs
in bug 222602 - problems where the browser has trouble recognizing shortcut
icons properly.
