Part of your response to Bug 260079 was to tell me to read "release notes",
which I had, and that "Bookmarks are in your profile." I found
"C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application
Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\s3epxjbe.default\bookmarks.html",
which is NOT ON A SECURE LOCATION.
I want it on D:, and where I specify, such as where I installed FireFox.
Do you not allow path choices?
