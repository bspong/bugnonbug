Address bar disappears in the popup opened by this page

In the page at http://www.megaproxy.com/freesurf/, when you type an url, a popup
is opened. That popups tries to mimic a browser. But that popup also makes the
address bar of Firefox to disapear. I don't know if that is intentionnal from
the webmaster or if there is a bug with the mimic process.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.megaproxy.com/freesurf/
2. Enter an url to browse and click the "Surf!" button
3. Observe the missing address bar in the opened popup.

Actual Results:  
The popup is missing the address bar.
I found no way to make it appear again (well, i haven't searched for long :D)

Expected Results:  
A web page should not be able to interact with any component of the browser. So
the address bar should not disappear.

I have tested this on FireFox 1.0.1 on Linux and Windows XP.
On linux i tested with my every-day profile. On Windows i tested with my
every-day profile and also with a blank profile, same results.
