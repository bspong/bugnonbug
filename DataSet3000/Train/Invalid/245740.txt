some comment tags do not parse properly

FireFox doesn't parse comments correctly sometimes. For example:

It parses this fine:
<!--QuoteBegin-Brumdron+May 26 2004, 08:36 PM-->

But it doesn't find the end to this quote tag:
<!--QuoteBegin--Intolerable Axe General+Sep 8 2003, 06:00 PM-->

And everything after this tag is seen as a comment, until the next comment.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a .html file
2. Paste this in: <!--QuoteBegin--Intolerable Axe General+Sep 8 2003, 06:00
PM--> and then some text and then another comment, such as <!--comment-->
3. Save, then open in FireFox. 
4. Use FireFox's view source for more information. 
Actual Results:  
Everything between the comment tags is a comment. FireFox couldn't parse the
inital comment tag correctly.

And in FireFox's View Source, notice the colour indicating the text after the
first comment is still a comment? This shouldn't be like this.


Expected Results:  
The software should have read the inital comment tag properly, that way
following text and html after this tag shouldn't be read as a comment.
