One of the ads currently in rotation at the URL attempts to install a piece of
spyware.  This causes Firefox to display an unending stream of Javascript
dialogs ("CLICK OK TO INSTALL IE PLUGIN") as long as the page is in view.

Furthermore a series of "missing ; before statement" errors appear on the
Javascript console, although perhaps this is because the hijackers write poor
Javascript.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Surf to URL above
2. Reload a few times until offending ad appears
Actual Results:  
Unending stream of spyware-derived javascript dialogs

Expected Results:  
Avoid said dialogs

I realize there's only so much one can do if the user visits a shady site.  (Of
course, it wasn't classified as a shady site in my book until this morning.) 
But I wonder if this is real misbehavior in Firefox, i.e. if the dialog is only
supposed to come up once.  For hopefully understandable reasons, I'm not willing
to load it in IE to find out.
