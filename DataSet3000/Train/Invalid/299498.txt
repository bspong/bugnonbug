Pop up appears every time I open Mozilla browzer window

Everytime I open a Mozilla browser window, a pop up window appears.  The browser
window has the same name every time: Aurora- Part of the ABI Network.  I was
sure Mozilla prevents pop-ups if you select the option in the Tool menu which I
have.  I never had a problem with this until a couple of days ago.  I would like
to resolve this as it as worrysome as annoying.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Mozilla browser
2.After several seconds Aurora pop-up window appears.
3.

Actual Results:  
Pop up window keeps appearing.  I checked my settings to make sure pop-up
windows are blocked, and I have no webcsites on the "allowed sites" option.  

Expected Results:  
Not allow any pop-up windows.
