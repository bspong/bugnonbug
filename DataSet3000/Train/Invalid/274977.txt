Slowdown when dynamically applying CSS rule "text-decoration: underline" to a LONG element
Hello, 
I experience massive slowdown while viewing this page:
http://www.k-arvutisalong.ee/Detailid.htm
Especially when i scroll page, text got underlined for some time, then back
normal and again, menwhile browser uses all my proccessor resources.

On this pahe is quite a big list of items(text), my other browser handle it
well, so i thought it could be some bug in proccessing page, sorry if i'm wrong
and wasting your time.

Thank you.

Some system information:
AMD Athlon XP 2000, 512 ram.
I got SP2 installed and all latest updates.
