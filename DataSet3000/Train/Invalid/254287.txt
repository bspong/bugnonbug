Icon for 'Switch to an alternate stylesheet' looks like a soy bean speared by a hairclip.
I always have to frown at this icon a bit when I see it, trying to figure out
what it might be trying to say to me.  When I click it to find out, I know that
it must be real art because its meaning it just beyond me.  But then I forget
again by the next time I see it.
