Dragging Tab Down Locks up X on Linux

When I have two or more tabs open and I down click on the center of a tab (the
actual tab and not the content window) hold my the button down, and move it to
the content window, before I let go of the button (upClick) the browser will
freeze.  This also freezes the rest of X windows.  So I have to go to a terminal
(ctrl-alt-f1) and kill Firebird.  After I kill it and return to X everything is
okay, and the browser is gone.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. open two or more tabs
2. downclick on the center of on (it doesn't matter if it is active or not)
3. hold the mouse down and drag it to the content window
4. As soon as it enters the content window you should see it lock up.

Actual Results:  
Everything Locks up.  You can still move the mouse around though, and instead of
a pointer it is a right angle pointing to the upper left.   But you can click on
anything.

Expected Results:  
I don't think it should lock up everything.
