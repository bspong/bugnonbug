User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; Media Center PC 2.8)

When I access the above named URL, I do not see 2 program selections which 
other users DO - I asked another Firefox user to view the page source on his 
computer - the 2 selection commands include CGI interface coding.
I have gone through every Firefox option I can find to see if there's a way 
to "enable CGI code" but can't find anything - the Firefox user who performed 
this task said he uses Firefox without changing any selections following 
installation

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Select the aireo site -  http://www.aireo.org from my bookmarks

2. Home page displays WITHOUT 2 selection options - Houses For Sale and 
Vendors Board
3.
