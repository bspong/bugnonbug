:hover bg color overwrites page background-image url

The background color declared in CSS :hover{} causes firefox (current nightly
build and release 1.0) to "blank out" the background-image in the body{} stanza.
The background color displays normally if you move the cursor focus outside the
page contents (Eg., tab bar, menu bar, outside Firefox)

The "blanking" seems to follow table and div boundaries.

If you go to my homepage (in URL above) you can see this behaviour. The page in
question passes both the W3C HTML and CSS validation tests.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.tifosi.com/rali
2. Wave the cursor around the page and menu bars
3. 

Actual Results:  
The background image will appear and disappear -- ie., the :hover background
color  supercedes large parts of the page background

Expected Results:  
Only the anchor links should have gotten the :hover background color.

Largely a cosmetic problem: The :hover foreground color works correctly so the
page remains legible and works properly.
