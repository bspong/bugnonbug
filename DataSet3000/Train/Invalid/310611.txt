Scroll with Up/Down arrows doesn't appear to work

With Firefox 1.0.x, after displaying a page, using the up/down arrows will
scroll the page up/down a few lines at a time.  A text cursor does *not* appear
on the page doing this unless the page is clicked on.  However, with Deer Park
Beta 1, a text cursor *always* appears on the page, and the first time the Down
arrow is used, it shifts all the way to the bottom of the page.  This makes
viewing a page with the keyboard (which I use almost exclusively) extremely
difficult.  Because installing Deer Park (in a separate folder) screwed up my
Firefox 1.0.x installation, I now have to live with this or uninstall Deer Park
and re-install 1.0.7.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type in a URL and press Enter.
2. When the page is displayed, press the down arrow key.
3.

Actual Results:  
Page jumps all the way to the bottom, and text cursor appears at the bottom, as
if the page was clicked on.

Expected Results:  
Scrolled a few lines down (without a text cursor being placed on the page).
