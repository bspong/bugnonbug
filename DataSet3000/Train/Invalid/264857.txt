Whenever I access my statcounter page, the page display appears broken. At
first, the view was ok, then upon load completion, all of sudden the formatting
seems to break up.  The links doesn't work as well (reports: the requested URL
was not found). When I tested in IE though, it seems to be working fine.

I checked the JavaScript console and it reports the following:

Error: illegal character
