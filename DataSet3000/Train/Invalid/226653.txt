Firebird does frequent reloads of page

On http://www.fetchbook.info if you search on a book, then click on the compare
prices link you'll get to a page like that given above.  This page will display
and then reload every five seconds or so repeatedly.  The only way I've found to
stop it is to leave that page.  The reloads are very annoying as they grab the
cursor, make the form on the page unchangeable (by reloading the original
contents every time through) and generally make things icky.

Eventually the site responds by saying that you're doing "suspicious activity"
and will only reload the "suspicious activity" page.

I reported this to the site and said I'd be filing a bugzilla report as well. 
The web person there says it might be  that the pages are expiring immediately,
but for me the expiration date does not show up on the "page info" screen. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.fetchbook.info/compare.do?search=3110126230

Actual Results:  
I got the page.  Again, and again and again and again..... 

Expected Results:  
Load the page once. 

I'm using the tab extensions.  Setting the option for "slow down auto-reloading
for inactive tabs" to only reload once seems to stop this.  I'll also report
this to the tab extensions guy.
