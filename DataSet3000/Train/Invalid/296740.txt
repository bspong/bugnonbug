When I type in "http://www.cracks.ss.ru" or "htp://www.cracks.ss.ru/data" I get
a virus.  I AM using Firefox, the version is: "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows
NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4".  I have visited other
websites this month, and have found many trojans in the Java folder.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  "http://www.cracks.ss.ru" (or) "http://www.cracks.ss.ru/data"
2.  Virus is auto installed after a second or two

Actual Results:  
My virus scanner found it.  Now that I have On-Access protection by Avast, Avast
warns me and allowes me to abort the connection.

Expected Results:  
Protected me from trojans/viruses, spyware, and adware.
