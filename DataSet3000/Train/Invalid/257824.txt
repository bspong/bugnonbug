When opening many web pages, an error dialog appears with the message "Could not
create the control {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}.  Check that it has
been installed on your computer abd that thispage correctly references it."

I can click it away (but you get many of them, so it's pretty tedious) so it's
more of an annoyance.  I only get this on my laptop - an install on a desktop
(also running WinXP) does not experience this problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a web page e.g. www.tgw.com
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
A number of the error dialogs appeared.  Click them away and you can proceed as
normal

Expected Results:  
Nothing!!!

Originally insalled 0.9.2, installed 0.9.3 over the top, did not un-install
0.9.2.  The desktop was a "clean" 0.9.3 install
