Selecting options in Preferences-Options-Tabbed browser-Advanced Tab and Tabbar do  not seem to get updated to preferences.

Note: AFAICT entering values in Advanced Preferences for these values:
browser.{tabs|tabar}.extensions.{ondblclick|onmiddleckick} (four options in total) are sticky and are used when middle or double clicking on the tab or tabbar (I assume tabbar means the portion of the tabbar not occupied by a tab)

Unfortunately, numbers aren't shown on the Preferences panel and alpha equivs aren't shown in the Advanced Preferences descriptions. 


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the Preferences section described above make selections to any or all of the values. Click [OK] then [OK] then [OK] (I think that's the right number ;-) )
2. Return to same panel and values are not shown.
3. Atttempting to dblclick/middleclick on tab/tabbar does nothing

Actual Results:  
No response.
Setting these values in "Advanced Preferences" tree DOES result in actions being taken when double clicking/middle clicking. 

Values appear when I revisit the tabbed browser prefs page but I haven't yet tried entering them again to see which if either is retained.



Expected Results:  
Save/Display and act upon the settings entered
