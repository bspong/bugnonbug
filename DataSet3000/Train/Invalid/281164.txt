User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

The page above is rendered properly in Internet Explorer 6 (haven't tried
anything else). However, when I attempt to view the same page in FireFox 1.0
absolutely NOTHING is displayed, only a black page (black background).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Point browser to http://www.NorfolkLine.com/
2. Select the link labelled "Corporate site"
3. Should take you to http://www.norfolkline.com/default.aspx



Actual Results:  
Only the page background (black color) is rendered

Expected Results:  
Display the contents of the page of course! you can see it is all there using
the View Source option.
