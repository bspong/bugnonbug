Window Eyes mouse over func does not work w/ image maps
Window Eyes mouse over function does not work with image maps. For normal text
links, when you move mouse over the link, Window Eyes speaks the link
information. For links in image maps, Window Eyes stays silent.

Steps to recreate:

1.  Start Window Eyes and Firefox.
2.  Open page www.ibm.com
3.  Move mouse pointer over a normal text link. Window Eyes speaks the link info.
4.  Move mouse over links on the image map. Window Eyes is silent.

Expected Results: Window Eyes should speak links on image maps just as it does 
      
                  other link on mouse-over.
