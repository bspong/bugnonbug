When the spelling checker is invoked in Compuserve/Netscape forums (Prospero
software), the text window appears but the functional controls under it do not.
 This appears to be from the online service http://SpellChecker.net not part of the
forum software.  It works correctly on all 1.0 versions of Firefox. Entering
these forums requires an AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) account (free).

Minor glitch: when you open the message reply editor and click in the box, the
text cursor does not appear until you start typing.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter URL: http://go.compuserve.com/linuxforum
2. Click "login", log in with AIM "screen name" and password
3. Select any message catagory on left of screen
4. Select any message thread
5. Click "Reply" under any message and type a few words
6. Click "Spell Check"

Actual Results:  
Child window opens with text box showing message.  spelling errors are
highlighted.  Blank area under text box.

Expected Results:  
Should show several function buttons and a "suggested spelling" box under the
text box.
