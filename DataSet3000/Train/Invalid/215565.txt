Form Variables are sometimes posted with original values instead of current values

I change some of my hidden form variables using JavaScript.  However, 
intermittenly these variables are posted to the server using their original 
value instead of the current value assigned by the Javascript.

So my forms work sometimes and then unexpected do not work.  When I check the 
posted value for the form variables in  such cases I will find one with the 
wrong value (ie. the value posted does not agree with the current value on the 
web page.)
