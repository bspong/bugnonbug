 I have been using your firefox 1.0 on my OLD computer with great success.
 
 I just got a 2nd computer (STAND ALONE NOT NETWORK) AND i HAVE INSTALLED 
 
 AND UNINSTALLED 1.0 3XS AND CANNOT GET IT TO WORK.
 
 BY THAT I MEAN AFTER I'M TOLD THE INSTALL WAS SUCCESSFUL, I LAUCH THE  
 PROG AND A FIREFOX PAGE COMES UP...BUT THE HOME PAGE DOES NOT SHOW UP.  
 THE FILE, EDIT, TOOLS, MENUS DON'T WORK ETC. There is no URL in the address bar
and you cannot put one in. You cannot put the curser in any of the fields. I've
installed and uninstalled it multiple times and get the same reaction.
 
IT LOOKS LIKES IT'S ON BUT IT'S NOT.

 ps IT STILL WORKS FINE ON MY OLD COMPUTER.
I am sending this from my old computer.
Consequently the url (above that I'm downloading firefox from (eg:Mozilla/5.0
(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0) is the
setting from my OLD computer. I cannot access this info in my new computer since
I can't get firfox to do anything.

Please help!!!
