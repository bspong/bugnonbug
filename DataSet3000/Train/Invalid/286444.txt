The symantec NAV package comes with a popup blocker that redefines the windows
object. It seems javascript errors, like using nonexistant variables or
unterminated strings, do not show up anymore inside the are bracketed by the NAV
scripts. Actually I have no idea whether it is NAV or version 1.1, I'm just
naming suspects

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.write a javascript with an error inside a webpage
2.load page while the NAV popup blocker is running
3.look in console

Actual Results:  
No errors from the webpage.
I was using DTD HTML4.1 strict, if that makes a difference

Expected Results:  
give diagnostics for debugging
