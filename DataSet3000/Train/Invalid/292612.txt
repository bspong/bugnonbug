When using the GNOME file dialog to choose a "helper application", you can't type a program name
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050405 Firefox/1.0 (Ubuntu package 1.0.2)

When using the GNOME to choose a "helper application" (e.g. you want to open
PDFs with XPDF), you can't type a program name in.  This means you have to use
the little command-buttons to browse to /usr/bin, and then wait for it to list
the entire contents of /usr/bin in the listbox (takes ages), and find the
application you want in that list. 

Even using the / key to search within the textbox gives a long delay as the
contents of /usr/bin are listed to give data to an "autocomplete" function.
