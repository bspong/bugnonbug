Firefox shows no simbol (hex# 07)
hi, I found some strange bug (?) in firefox 1.0

try to open following page

<html>
<body>
<table><tr><td>
</td></tr></table>
</body>
</html>

IE shows the dot there! In firefox it will work only if you will remove a line
break before the dot. The dot sign has hex# 07.

br,
