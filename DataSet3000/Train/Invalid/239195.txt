GTK1 and 2 Build

I was just wondering if Mozilla could provide offical builds of recent Firefox
and Mozilla browsers for both GTK1 and GTK2, I understand that GTK1 is desirable
since it will run smoothly on older Linux distributions, but it would be nice if
a GTK2 build was also provided, so people with newer distributions can take
advantage of the much nicer fonts.  This would be esp. helpful with a product
like Firefox where distributors are not yet providing thier own binary packages
(where they often compile against GTK2 for new releases.)
