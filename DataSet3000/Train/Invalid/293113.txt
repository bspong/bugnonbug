When I open an offline html of my bank statement, Mozilla connects to the live
bank site and does not open the offline version unless I go to File, Work
Offline then it opens the offline version.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.I save my bank statements to my local hard drive
2.Open the html on my local hard drive
3.Mozilla connects to the live bank site

Actual Results:  
I have to supply a username & password to logon to the live site which is not my
intention

Expected Results:  
It should open the offline html file and not the live site
