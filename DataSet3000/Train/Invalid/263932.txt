Shortcut and Start Menu
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

I downloaded Firefox and it installed a shortcut on my desktop.  So as to keep
the desktop uncluttered, I right clicked the icon and clicked on "Pin to start
menu," which it did.  I then sent the desktop icon to the recycle bin.  The
start menu shortcut does not work.  To make it work, I have to restore the
desktop icon then the shortcut on the start menu will work (so will the desktop
icon.

What's wrong?
