I tried navigating to http://www.mysticradio.com/ in Firefox.
Firefox, showed another website instead. It showed the content from
http://www.sailinganarchy.com/ but the address bar continued to show
http://www.mysticradio.com/

Firefox is really messed up at this point. All the links from the page are
replacing www.sailinganarchy.com with www.mysticradio.com.

It happened to me before with another website, but at that time I thought it is
only a DNS issue.

Now I verified the same website in Internet Explorer and everything worked fine.
