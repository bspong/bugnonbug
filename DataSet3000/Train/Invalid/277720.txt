Unwanted space appears when resizing sidebar larger than max-width of sidebar content box
A gap appears at the left of the sidebar when making it wider which reveals the
toolbar background image, this is due to a max-width being set for the sidebar
content (as opposed to the sidebar box itself).

An easy fix is to set the min/max-width in the style for the sidebar-box and
remove the min/max-width for the sidebar content box..

This is a minor but very visible error which detracts from the otherwise
professional appearance of the browser and I feel it should be changed on those
grounds.

I would be happy to make the necessary changes but I have never submitted a
patch before, so if someone could do it, I would be very grateful.

Thanks

Dan
