CSS Padding command adds width to division rather than padding inside the specified width

In the page at http://www.westportresources.com/beta the CSS padding command is
generated somewhat incorrectly. When a width is specified and then the padding
command is used the division ends up taking, when generated, width = width +
padding. For example, if the width was specified as 200px with padding-left:
15px then the page will be generated with a division box of width 215px. The
correct version should have a width of 200px and any text should begin at 15px
and be placed within a box of 185px. Currently FireFox gives the entire division
an extra 15px and allows the text to be contained in a box of 200px. 

It seems erroneous to specify a width and then have the padding command override
that width. More logical would be to have the padding fit inside the width
specified by the css style.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a CSS style (give it some class name)
2. Specify: position: absolute; width: 200px;
3. Also specify: padding-left: 15 px;
4. in the HTML file specify <div class="styleName">Hello world</div>
5. Notice the width of the division is really 215 px. 

6. You can see this better using the following:
in CSS style sheet:
div.someBox
 {
   position: absolute; left: 0px; width: 200px; padding-left: 15px;
 }
div.otherBox
 {
   position: absolute; left: 200px; width: 200px;
 }

in html:
<div class="someBox">Enter a long string of text here so that it reaches
200px.</div>
<div class="otherBox">Note the overlap here</div>.
Actual Results:  
There's an overlap in the text because the original box is increased by the
padding-left amount of pixels.

Expected Results:  
Should have placed the padding within the 200px box, keeping the box absolutly
at 200px and the amount of space for text being 15px. In other words it should
have left a 15px white space from the start of the box to where the text or
other HTML is generated.
