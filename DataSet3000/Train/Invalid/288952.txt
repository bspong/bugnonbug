The RSS feed at http://www.mcld.co.uk/rss/flatfour.rss has multiple items all
with the same destination URL. Firefox gets confused by this - all items with
the same destination URL end up with the same bookmark title in the menu.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add http://www.mcld.co.uk/rss/flatfour.rss as a livemark
2. Open the livemark menu
3. Check the titles seen against the titles actually present in the RSS file

Actual Results:  
Titles aren't as given in the RSS

Expected Results:  
Titles should be as given in the RSS
