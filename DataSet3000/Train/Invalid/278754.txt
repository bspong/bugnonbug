I dont know whether it is intended behavior or not (it should not be!)

Open up any site, even good old google, and while holding down shift, click on a
ui element (like button, text box, radio button) twice. It disappears.

Dont know if that should happen....

Reproducible: Always

Actual Results:  
The clicked element disappears.

Expected Results:  
The UI element should obviously still be visible.

Upon using DOM inspector, it seems that the visibility computed style becomes
hidden.
