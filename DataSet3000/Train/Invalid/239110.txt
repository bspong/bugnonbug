Every site I go to that uses javascript to open a new window, and example would
be Sun's website with their new linux distro or some BBS systems, Firefox will
totally crash. Absolute exit. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to a web page that does a window.open() using javscript

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed.

Expected Results:  
Should have opened a new window with the appropriate contents contained within,
as it did on all other browsers tested at the same urls, including Mozilla.
