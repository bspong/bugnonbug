Typing wp <auschwitz trials> to find wikipedia details for a college paper leads
to a bizarre holocaust denial site. The wp <> doesn't seem to work at all, yet
the built-in bookmark in my build of firefox says it should. Unless something
has affected by firefox otherwise.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type wp <auschwitz trials>
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Arrive to zundersite.com

Expected Results:
