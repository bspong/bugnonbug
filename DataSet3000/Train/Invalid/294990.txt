how move bookmarks?
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.23; Mac_PowerPC)

There are no instructions about moving my Bookmarks from Firefox 1.0.1 to the newer 
1.0.4.  I personally refer to the Bookmarks as my "Favorites List".
What do I do?

Reproducible: Always

I hope for instructions about moving the Bookmarks and "Favorites List".
