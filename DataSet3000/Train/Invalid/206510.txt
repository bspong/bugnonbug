I cannot import my Netscape 4.6 bookmark file.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.6 [en-gb] (Win98; I)
Build Identifier: Build from 19/5/03

I get a "not responding" situation. Bookmark file is 2,384KB in size. I tried deleting the "default" bookmark file but even after deletion/replacement it still showed ! There seems to be no easy way to change the default bookmark file to a different one. This was the same thing that happened in Phoenix about six months ago when I tried that out then. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Opened the bookmarks page.
2. Selected the file "Import" option.
3.

Actual Results:  
As stated. Got the "not responding" situation.

Expected Results:  
Imported the file.
