I was developing a application with popups and I needed to pass a value from the
popup to the opener window. I made it like I always had done, with
opener.document.getElementByID() and it worked in IE. Then I tested it in
firefox and the Javascript Console says opener have no properties.
I checked the O'Reilly reference in DreamWeaver and it says opener should be
supported since IE3 and NS3. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use a window.open to open a popup
2.In popup try to use opener.document or any other property 


Actual Results:  
No error visible to the use that do not open Javascript Console

Expected Results:  
The opener should expose all the properties of the window where window.open was
called.
