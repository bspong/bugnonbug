When rendering a webpage with tables that have borders greater then 1 and with 
bordercolor tags the gecko rendering engine will still render the default 
color of table borders. I don't think I really need to include this like as an 
example, I know everyone that uses Firefox has seen this but here you go 
http://civilrebellion.com/firefox_error.html

I have seen this problem a lot and is one major reason I have not used 
Firefox. I have however been rather forced to make web pages that are bloated 
just to make sure they render correctly in Firefox and I know this is a 
problem with the gecko rendering engine it is something that should be 
corrected I am re porting this here so it can be fixed on a grander scale then 
I feel I can do but i am also willing and going see if I can correct this 
problem if someone can just point me to the hidden location that the source 
code is stored at.
