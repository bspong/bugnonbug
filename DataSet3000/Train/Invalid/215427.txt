opening a bookmark folder in tabs does not respect web panels
1. Make a folder in your bookmarks and add a few bookmarks to it
2. Set one of those bookmarks to load in the sidebar
3. Middle-click the folder in the bookmarks menu

Actual Results: All bookmarks open in tabs

Expected Results: Actually, i'm not sure.  If there's only one sidebar bookmark,
it would make sense for it to open in the sidebar.  But what if there is more
than one sidebar bookmark in the folder?  Perhaps only open the last one in the
sidebar...?
