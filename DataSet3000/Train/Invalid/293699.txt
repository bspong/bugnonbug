User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)

In the page at http://www.spencerskuse.com the text at the top of the page, to 
the right of the logo should be formatted according to the style specified in 
the head of the document: most noticeably both the title and the sub title 
should be Times New Roman, with 5px of padding to the left; in Firefox they do 
not have the correct padding and are not the correct font. The page validates 
for both HTML and CSS.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Visit http://www.spencerskuse.com
2.Look at the title and subtitle
3. They should be in Times New Roman and should have padding-left: 5px

Actual Results:  
Title and Subtitle next to the logo displayed in a default sans font, without 
the correct padding 

Expected Results:  
displayed the text correctly
