There should be an option in the "options" to disable the following javascript
LeftPosition = (screen.width) ? (screen.width-(400+98))/2 : 0;
TopPosition = (screen.height) ? (screen.height-400)/2 : 0;
window.resizeTo(400+98, 400);
window.moveTo(LeftPosition, TopPosition);

A lot of sites use this code to resize the browser to fit the page, this is,
however, very annoying if you use tabbed browsing .. since all the sessions are
resized.

Reproducible: Always
