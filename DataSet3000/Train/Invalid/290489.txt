(I live in Belgium and my English is bad)

When you are on a page, you can see "the informations of the page". We can see
all headers and we can save headers on a file. The problem arrive if I want to
save the headers in a file whose already exist.  Firefox asks me if I want to
crush the old file and I answer "Yes" but Firefox don't save the headers, it's
the old data in the file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create the file "test.txt" on "C:\" (so C:\test.txt) and write "Hello" in it.
2. Go on a site
3. Clik right > Informations of the page > Headers > Save as...
4. Save as "C:\test.txt" and clik "Yes" on the box
5. Check the file "test.txt"
Actual Results:  
The file wasn't write with the new data

Expected Results:  
Nothing
