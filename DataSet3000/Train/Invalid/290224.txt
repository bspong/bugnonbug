When I have a page with a flash animation and use the WMODE="transparent" param, in Firefox 1.0.2 it doesn't work, it just ignore the param. It worked perfectly in Firefox 1.0
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pt-BR; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050318 Firefox/1.0.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pt-BR; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050318 Firefox/1.0.2

In the page http://www.oi.com.br the top menu is a flash animation. They used
WMODE="transparent" to make it possible to see behind the flash. In Firefox 1.0
and all other browsers (IE, Opera, Netscape, Mozilla) it works perfectly, but in
Firefox 1.0.2 you can see a white box where should be the content behind the
flash menu.

Reproducible: Always
