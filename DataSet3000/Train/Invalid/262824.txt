popup blocking [resets/disabled/unchecked] when javascript popups are opened (TBE bug)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1

Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10.1
I have these extensions installed: adblock, flashblock, tabbrowser and openbook.

Clicking on images on this page
http://213.215.144.81/public_html/cafonal/cafonal_01.html (sorry for the ugly
faces <g>) triggers a javascript function that open up a new window and write in
it the actual content. 
I have popup blocking activated as i used to have in Mozilla 1.7.3 but in
Mozilla these links always worked.
Trying to open these links in firefox 0.10 will eventually lead (after one or
sometimes two tries) to the popup blocking checkbox (in the options window) to
be resetted to clear (as i wouldn't want popups blocked).
After this, no more these links works. 
Opening pages that triggers popups confirms that popup blocking don't work
anymore (as popups show up).
Closing and reopening Firefox doesn't restore popup blocking (it is really
disabled). 


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enable popup blocking
2. Open http://213.215.144.81/public_html/cafonal/cafonal_01.html
3. Click on image links, try a few times

Actual Results:  
Popup blocking gets disabled

Expected Results:  
Popup blocking should stay enabled (while allowing those popups to open as I
actively linked on them)

These problem shows in Firefox 0.10 as well as in Firefox 0.10.1

I have these extensions installed: adblock, flashblock, tabbrowser and openbook.
I couldn't check it yet without these extensions installed.
