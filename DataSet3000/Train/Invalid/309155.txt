SetTimeOut fails when IFRAME is involved

I'll start this by saying that there is no issue with Internet Explorer 6.x,
only with Mozilla Firefox.

If you go to the URL above, and move your mouse over the dynamic javascript
menus, you will notice that the menus do not vanish after 0.5 seconds *IF* the
mouse has moved into the IFRAME (directly below the two rows of dynamic menus).
If the mouse is in the main page, then the menus will dissapear.

This appears to be a problem with Javascript SetTimeOut, which seems to be abort
or fails to execute the minute the mouse moves across the IFRAME.

This problem does not occur with IE 6.x.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Move your mouse over the dynamic javascript menus (do not select a URL)
2. Make sure your mouse is over the IFRAME when the mouse pointer moves off the menu
Actual Results:  
The menu will not vanish.. SetTimeOut mysteriously aborts if the mouse pointer
is over the IFRAME when it moves off the dynamic menu. 


Expected Results:  
Functionality should behave as Internet Explorer 6.x. Regardless of what IFRAME
the mouse pointer is over, the SetTimeOut function should be called (in this
case, the function calls a Javascript function that hides the dynamic menu after
the onMouseOut function i

The problem is not caused by onMouseOut.. I have confirmed that onMouseOut still
fires even when the mouse pointer is over the IFRAME (using a simple alert()
javascript).

The problem is definitely SetTimeOut...

P.S. No click is involved at all.. this is purely mouse movement.
