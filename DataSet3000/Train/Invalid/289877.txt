I'm sure it used to show the padlock item

When I visit a secure UK site there is no "padlock" security icon showing in the
taskbar. It does show a "veritas" icon on one site and an "XRamp security
services inc" on a US (I think) site.
Are these Ok or should it be the padlock item?

Reproducible: Always



Expected Results:  
IE6 shows this padlock
