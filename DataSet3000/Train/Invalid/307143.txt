Thawte's "Fetch" button to install a new Email Certificate fails to download into Cert Store.

At Thawte.com's personal email certificate system, I requested a certificate for
Netscape/Mozilla.  After selecting the certificate Type and pressing the "Fetch"
button, I navigate to Firefox>Preferences>Advanced>Certificates>Manage
Certificates and there's nothing in the list. Restarted Firefox but still no joy.
Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to https://www.thawte.com/cgi/personal/contents.exe (need login)
2. Select certificates>new certificate status in the menu on the left
3. In the list of certs, selecte the "Navigator" type that you previously created
4. In new page, click Fetch at bottom of screen

Actual Results:  
Firefox status bar indicates a transfer of data from thawte web site, but no
certificate is present in Firefox.

Expected Results:  
The new certificate should be listed in the Manage Certificates pane.
