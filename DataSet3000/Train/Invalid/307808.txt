Firefox 1.5 beta 1 shows version 1.4 in about screen and extension update dialog
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4

Firefox 1.5 shows itself as version 1.5 AND 1.4 in the about box, as well as
when trying to install an incompatible extension.  ("[extension xxx] could not
be installed because it is not compatible with Firefox 1.4. ...")
The about dialog shows:
     Firefox
     version 1.5 Beta 1
at the top, but shows "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4)
Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4" at the bottom.  The version numbers do not match.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Help|About
OR
2. Install an incompatible extension (i.e. Google toolbar)
Actual Results:  
Firefox shows the wrong version number or two different numbers (as in the about
screen)

Expected Results:  
It should have a consistent version 1.5 [Beta], rather than 1.5 Beta and 1.4.
