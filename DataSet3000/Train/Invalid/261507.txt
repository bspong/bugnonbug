My website CSS is not displayed by Firefox, though it displays locally
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20040913 Firefox/0.10

Both Firefox 0.8 and 1.0pr do not show the CSS at the given address.  With the
webdev extension when I click CSS-> Edit the stylesheet activates suddenly.  (I
have uninstalled the extension to make sure its not the problem since)

Also, Internet Explorer and Opera do show the stylesheet correctly.  In
addition, Firefox shows the stylesheet correctly when I view the page locally.  

The page checks out as valid:

I've tried this with
Firefox 0.8 and 1.0pr in Windows XP
and
Firefox 1.0pr in Linux

Both fail to show the stylesheet.
