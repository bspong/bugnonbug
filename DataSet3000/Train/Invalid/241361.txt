Clicking 'Send Image' without an email app configured launches 60 instances of Internet Explorer

I don't have an email client on my system, not even Outlook Express, which I
uninstalled. In the right-click context menu for images, I accidently clicked on
'Send Image'. I thought the browser had frozen, but after I left it for a minute
about 60 instances of Internet Explorer launched, each informing me that I
didn't have an email client configured. One would have been fine, but 60 is just
too much!

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Remove all mail clients from your system. Use a program like XPlite to remove
Outlook Express.
2. Right-click on an image in Firefox and select 'Send Image'.
3. Sit back and watch the fun.

Actual Results:  
The browser hangs while it launches 60 instances of Internet Explorer.

Expected Results:  
Launched one, maybe?

A system without any email client may not be very common, but a simple check for
a client before trying to launch it should be easy to impliment.
