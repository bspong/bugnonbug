If you have two page elements that you want to visibly toggle via javascript you
need 2 lines of code.  One line turns one element off by setting display="none"
and the second line turns the other element on by setting display="block". 
Previously, this was working fine.  Under 1.5beta (on Mac at the minimum), the
page seems to refresh in between the two lines so that you get a flicker with
either both elements displayed or both elements invisible depending on the order
of your javascript.  See the listed url for an example.

pseudoJScode:

element1.display="none";
**page draw should NOT happen here**
element2.display="block";
**page draw should happen here**
