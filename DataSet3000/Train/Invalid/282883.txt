If one holds shift and clicks quickly while moving mouse up and down over text
contained in one text block ( like a div or <p>), the text hides. I just did it
to the paragraph above the details box on the bug report page

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Press shift
2. Click and drag a little of the paragraph
3. Click quickly while moving mouse up and down over paragraph

Actual Results:  
Text that was clicked over (whole paragraph) dissapears.

Expected Results:  
Simply highlighted text

Happens on both pages i tried (paypa and bugzilla)
