popup blocker options/whitelist-entries aren't working at all, firefox just blocks everything
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1) Opera 7.54  [en]
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

In any page which has (according to Firefox) unrequested popups, the whitelist 
isn't working, also turning off all popup blocking in tools - options doesn't 
work - firefox blocks them. you have to explicitly tell firefox to open the 
popups every time. also restarting the browser doesn't solve the problem, 
firefox keeps on blocking - although the popup-options seem to be saved, they 
just aren't working.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to a page with popups, for example http://www.dbna.net/
2. add this page to the popup-whitelist or completely turn of all popup blocking
3. try getting firefox to open the popup without explicitly allowing it...

Actual Results:  
preferences have no effect

Expected Results:  
allowed the popups to be opened

I'm using Tabbrowser extensions and the Noia 2.0 Theme, but I don't think that 
has anything to do with this problem.
