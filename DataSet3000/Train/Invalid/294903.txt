If the tag forms is inside a table tag or a td tag is after impossible to
retreive the elements of the forms in javascript: 
document.forms.elements[x].name==undefined ???
It's works fine with IE and Opera, why not with Mozilla / Firefox familly.
It's a bug or we need to change more than 1000 templates ???


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.include a forms inside a table
2.try in javascript to retreived the elements values of this forms
3.but if you try document.getElementsByTagName, than it's possible to retreive
the information. So why not with the basic definition( document.forms).

Actual Results:  
impossible to retreived any information about the forms elements. always
undefined. If you alert the document.forms that the result is good but for an
element of the forms is always undefined.

Expected Results:  
like for IE and Opera, the name of the element of the value.
document.forms.elements[X].name
document.forms.elements[X].value
etc etc
