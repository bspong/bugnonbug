crash whenever I enter belinda.ca, possibly java related
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

Whenever I go to http://www.belinda.ca, and then click the "English" link it
tries to load http://www.belinda.ca/Belinda/english/index.shtml.  At this point,
the Java icon appears in the bottom right corner in my system tray (Java
1.4.2_03), but the tab never loads.  I am permitted to use other tabs and ignore
that tab, but when I try to close it (usually via right clicking on it, waiting
a few seconds for the context  menu to appear, and then clicking close),
firefox.exe crashes completely.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.belinda.ca
2. Click "English"
3. Watch as the tab does not load
4. Notice the Java VM starting in the system tray
5. Wait
6. Right click on the tab the site was opened in, select "Close"
7. Witness firefox.exe crash

Actual Results:  
Firefox crashes

Expected Results:  
Not crash :)

Using the Cryogenic-alloy theme.
