I use the Bookmarks toolbar for various webpages. I also have 2 atom feed
bookmarks or live bookmarks. Any other bookmark I can give another place on the
bar, by drag and drop them. With the live ones, it won't.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add bookmarks to the bookmarks toolbar.
2. Add also live bookmarks of atom feed bmarks.
3. Then replace the live one. It won't.
