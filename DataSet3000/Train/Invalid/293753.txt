Hello ,

    As I am new to Firefox, when encountering the .XPI files, I donwloaded PAZIP
, a zip file extractor tool, which can extract .XPI files .

    However I found out later that Firefox has the inbuilt capability of
installing the .XPI files. But even after uninstalling the PAZIP utlitity,
whenever I want to install any Firefox extension ,the dialog box is coming up
saying that PAZIP is the default handler for .XPI files. I even deleted the
default handler for .XPI in the Windows registry; and now it says that the file
can be opened with XPIInstall , which I dont know where to find .

    How can I roll back to the old step, wherein I dont need to do anything and
FireFox shall do the necessary .

    Thanks ,

    Sujay
