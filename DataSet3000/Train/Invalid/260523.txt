Because this UI is missing, you cannot subscribe to (new) page changes on a site
automatically. This is obviously only a UI bug. Pages subscribed with earlier
versions are still saved correctly in the bookmarks file. 

This functionality was working correctly until very recently (v.0.9.1+). 
It seems to be new with 1.0 PR. I couldn't find an existing bug discribing this
issue. 
It seems to be a cross-platform bug. It occures on Mac OS X and Windows 2000
(both tested), possibly on other platforms (untested)? 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open Bookmarks Manager and select a specific bookmark 
2. select the Properties... menu (or right-click) 


Actual Results:  
the Properties window only displays the first left tab (Info), the others are
missing 

Expected Results:  
it should display 3 tabs: Info, Schedule and Notification
