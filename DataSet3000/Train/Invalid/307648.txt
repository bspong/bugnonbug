International/accented character support for extensions/JavaScript is broken

The international character support for extensions and/or JavaScript is somehow 
broken between Deer Park Alpha 2 and Firefox 1.4 (1.5). Extensions using 
international chars in inline JS-constants can display these strings (messages) 
using for ex. an alert() call properly in Firefox 1.0.x and Deer Park alpha 2 
versions, but in FF 1.4/1.5b1 the browser displays question marks in place of 
the accented/non-US-ASCII characters. The problem seems to affected JS-constant 
strings only - strings hardcoded inside XUL forms seem to display correctly, 
though. If you try to display the same string in a plain HTML page using alert
() (and not from inside an extenions), it also works correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download and install the extension specified at the homepage URL
2. Press the rightmost button (labeled "Belépés")
3. Check the contents of the displayed messagebox

Actual Results:  
In FF 1.4/1.5b1 "?" characters are displayed where some accented chars should 
be shown. US-ASCII chars are displayed correctly, though.

Expected Results:  
Display accented/international characters correctly

The problem is present in the newest FF 1.5b1 (which has 1.4 in it's user-agent 
string as version) in the US-EN version (no other version available now), but 
I've also tested it previously with yesterdays 1.4 nightly build in HU-hu 
(hungarian) language version, which had the bug, too. Previous FF versions 
(1.0.x, DPa2) display the international strings correctly in both EN-us and HU-
hu language versions.
