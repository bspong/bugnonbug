Ok in Explorer and some pages of site.  The page, badges.htm, has three missing
images from folder /images though other images from this folder display ok on
other pages.  Pages linked from the page, badges.htm to other pages e.g.
page1.htm and associated folder, e.g. /rnbadges1 also fail to appear.

Have checked with host company, telivo.com and they confirm symptoms and
suggested  I contact Firefox.
