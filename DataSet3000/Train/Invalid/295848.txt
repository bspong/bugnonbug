DISCLAIMER: I cannot bother to search for the right bug # because this has
already been reported at least 100 times with different wording so if you think
it is duplicate of a duplicate of a duplicate then delete the other ones and
confirm this one because others do not bear any useful info as this one. Thank you.

It happens with other pages too but here is the most visible --
http://www.homepages.hetnet.nl/~brianpostma/pc.html -- my 3.0 GHz Pentium 4 with
1GB RAM becomes 90MHz Pentium 1 as I scroll over the page. I have narrowed the
issue down to the transparent GIF background image. Seems that the rendering of
GIF images is broken in Firefox. This issue also affects AMD CPUs. I am not sure
if it has anything to do with video card make and model (I have nVidia 6600 GT)
and video drivers (Forceware 71.89).


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just open the page and try to scroll up/down.

Actual Results:  
I got CPU usage >50% and the Firefox scrolled the page awfully slow.

Expected Results:  
It should scroll fast and smooth without taxing the CPU that much.
