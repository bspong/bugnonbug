Just paste this code in a html file and see that it won't show the file with the
gif image.

neither dead.gif nor dead.png exists
<A href="dead.gif">text not showing if href contains dead.gif</A><br />
<A href="dead.png">text showing if href is dead.png</A>

Firefox can't show a gif image names dead.gif either.
