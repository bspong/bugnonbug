firefox crashes when it cannot find path to java_vm for java plugin
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

I tried to install the Java plugin by copying the file 

/usr/java/j2re1.4.2_03/plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32/libjavaplugin_oji.so 

to the directory 

/usr/local/firefox/plugins

but when I went to a page that requires the Java plugin, Firefox crashed with
the following error message:

INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Exec of "java_vm" failed: 2
<
System error?:: No such file or directory
INTERNAL ERROR on Browser End: Could not read ack from child process
System error?:: Resource temporarily unavailable

Then I replaced the copy of the .so file with a link to the location of the
original file like this:

libjavaplugin_oji.so ->
/usr/java/j2re1.4.2_03/plugin/i386/ns610-gcc32/libjavaplugin_oji.so

This fixed the problem.  We believe Firefox could not assemble the path to the
Java plugin by itself, which is why we had to make a link.  Firefox should not
crash when this happens; instead it should provide some sort of error message.

Reproducible: Always
