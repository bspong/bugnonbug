Photographs no longer appear on my Digital Railroad website since April 7, 2005.
 I contacted Digital Railroad and they confirm they are there.

I cannot view them.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. I log into my archive.
2. No photos appear on my home page.
3. When I upload new photos they do not appear in production.  The only thing
showing are the borders minus the photos.  Running my mouse over the blank
space, the id# shows as confirmation the photos were received by Digital Railroad.
        THERE ARE NO PHOTOS APPEARING AT ALL.

Actual Results:  
NO PHOTOS SHOW.

Expected Results:  
SHOULD HAVE DISPLAYED THE PHOTOS AS IT USED TO.
