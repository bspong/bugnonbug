http://members.cox.net/geecruzer2/UT-AZ_Day1.htm is the URL to a Streets & Trips
map with directions saved as a Web Page. Directions load ok but gif image map
not loaded instead a broken link icon is displayed. The Element Properies dialog
box for the broken link lists the URL for the gif image map as
http://members.cox.net/geecruzer2/UT-AZ_Day1_files%5Cimage_map.gif. For some
reason Firefox browser is changing the URL by replacing a / with %5c thus
preventing the proper loading of the gif image. When the correct URL is pasted
into Firefox address bar the gif image is loaded fine. This problem does not
occur with IE6. Special note: I installed the lastest build of Firefox but it
would not start up so I reinstalled the older build.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Go to http://members.cox.net/geecruzer2/utah_az_loop_1.htm
2.Scroll to bottom of page.
3.Click on "Map & Directions" link.

Actual Results:  
Web page displayed directions without image map.

Expected Results:  
Gif image of map should have been displayed along with directions.

My OS is Windows XP Pro version 2002 Service Pack 1. The web site where this
problem occurs is my personal web site which uses frames and is created using
Microsoft Front Page. All my web pages are displayed correctly by Firefox except
the Streets & Trips web pages. Three items are uploaded for each Streets & Trips
web page. A .htm file, a .gif file, and a folder where the .gif file is stored.
