The following simple html shows the problem. Not sure what the html standard
says about this, but IE displays it without problem (i.e., comments are
correctly recognized, and skipped).

<html><head>
<title>eValuator -
<!-- <div class="docstyle">include = clnyy_Benefit_Plans_Hdr <br><br></div> -->
Your eValuator&trade; Home Page
<!-- <div class="docstyle"><br><br>include-end<br><br></div> -->
</title>
<body>
XXX
</body>
</html>
