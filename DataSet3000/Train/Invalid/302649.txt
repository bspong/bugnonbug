Closing a window incorrectly brings up "closing multiple tabs" warning if other windows have multiple tabs

When closing a window with no tabs (just the one), the warning box about closing
windows with multiple tabs appears.  It shouldn't.  This behavior occurs when
another Firefox window does have multiple tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Window
2. Create new tab
3. Open second window
4. Close second window

Actual Results:  
The closing window with multiple tabs warning appears.

Expected Results:  
Close the window.

This happened on 1.4 too, I never tried it on other versions but I bet it has
the same behavior.

I've only confirmed this bug on Windows platforms.
