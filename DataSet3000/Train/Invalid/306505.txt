&not in URL causes misinterpretation (not sign)

When the name of a name/value pair in a url is 'not' and it comes after another
name/val pair, the concatenating ampersand causes the name 'not' to be
interpreted as &not, or the not sign logical symbol.

This is important because most webservers will not decode a ¬ to mean &not, and
the proper data won't be passed to the web application.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
<html><a href="http://www.example.com/index.php?find=string&not=string2">click
here</a></html>



Actual Results:  
part of the data is left out and not passed to index.php

Expected Results:  
php should find that find=string and that not=string2
