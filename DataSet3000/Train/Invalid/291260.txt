Say a company uses an IP range of 10.x.x.x.

1.  Is there any way to bypass the proxy server for the whole range of any IP
addresses that starts with 10?

2.  How do you specify to bypass server names...  For example bypass all server
names that starts with na- or za-?

Thanks in advance

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add 10./24, za-, na- to the "Do not use proxy" setting.
2. Opened a website that starts with http://10 or http://za- or http://na-


Actual Results:  
The sites were not loaded because the proxy server cannot access those sites.

Expected Results:  
The proxy server settings should have been ignored.
