When opening a window with window.open(), the window always has a location bar

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Extract and install the 20040909 non-installer build
2. Create and use a new profile
3. Enter the URL: javascript:window.open('about:blank','test','location=no');

Actual Results:  
A blank window appears, with a location toolbar at the top, across the full
width of the window, as though 'location=yes' were specified.

Expected Results:  
Should have shown a completely blank window with no toolbar.

Also shows the location bar when no location feature is used, eg.
javascript:window.open('about:blank','test','foo');

20040826 build doesn't have this problem. I don't know about the intervening
September builds.
