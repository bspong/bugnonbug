Installing Phoenix as an Administrator on Win2k does not allow normal restricted users to use it.

I expanded the Phoenix Zipfile into the Program Files directory & wasable to run
it fine as the same user (which has admin rights) but no other (restricted)
users can use it. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Login as an Administrator
2.Unpack Phoenix.
3.Logout & then login as a restricted user.
4. Attempt to run Phoenix.

Actual Results:  
I got a series of error dialogs saying that certain files could not be written to. 

Expected Results:  
The browser should just run, using the personal directories of the user running
it as the location to which it writes data.
