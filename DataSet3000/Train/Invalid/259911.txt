Firefox 1.0 pre-release crashes constantly on Mac OS X 10.3.5
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040825 Camino/0.8.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.2) Gecko/20040825 Camino/0.8.1

I've been using Firefox since it was called Phoenix. Up until the latest build
it has worked very well, however with this build, regardless of pages/tabs being
displayed, it crashes randomly. Safari & Camino remain stable. To fix things,
I've uninstalled 1.0PR and reinstalled 0.9.1 . I'm sorry I can't provide
detailed details, but I wanted to contribute anecdotal information. The Talkback
crash application worked twice, but not on subsequent crashes. I do not have the
Talkback ID to report to you.
