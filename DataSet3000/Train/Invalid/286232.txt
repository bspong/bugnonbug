popup links on the betanews.com site do not work correctly.  (I have set my
prefs to allow popups from *.betanews.com).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. http://www.betanews.com
2. following down the right side of the screen, you will see a "View Changes",
"watch", and "ignore" icon next to the software titles.  Click on one of these
links.
3.

Actual Results:  
The popup shows up in the original window as if it was a normal link.  This is
an issue because it does not allow me to use the intended functionality.  For
example, when clicking on "watch", I want to add the respective file to my watch
list.  However, when the link is clicked, the new window does not reflect my
"watched" software.

Expected Results:  
Link should be displayed in a popup window.
