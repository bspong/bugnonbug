Look at the source of the mentioned url, it is reduced to the absolute minimum
for displaying the bug. Problem: Inside a HTML-Comment there is a <p>-tag with
two lines (--) inside. Firefox recognizes the end </p>-tag as end of my comment.
(could be any tag, the <p> is only an example)
This bug only occurs when any doctype is defined.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create an empty html-page, define a doctype inside
2. add any comment with any tag inside
3. place two lines (--) anywhere in the text inside the tag. (for example <p>foo
-- bar</p>)
4. view the page in firefox -> it isn't displayed correctly
Actual Results:  
firefox recognizes the end-tag as end of comment. '-->' is displayed

Expected Results:  
display nothing, because every text is inside the comment
