automatically recognize <link> in feeds when adding Live Bookmark manually

When adding Live Bookmark manually(File -> New Live Bookmark... in Bookmarks
Manager), it only provides the URL to be filled in as FEEDURL attribute in
bookmarks.html.
However, it makes Live Bookmark empty in Location column in Bookmark Manager due
to the lack of URL attribute.
Besides, this makes the Live Bookmark couldn't be imported to Mozilla as links
for backwards-compatibility.
I hope the <link> element inside feeds could be filled automatically when adding
Live Bookmark in order to fix the above issues.
