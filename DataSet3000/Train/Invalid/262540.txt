<span> with position: absolute style inside block-level positioned incorrectly
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1

If I use a <span> element nested inside a <div> element and position it
absolutely, Firefox positions the <span> relative to the top left corner of the
page, rather than the top left corner of the <div>. It works fine with relative
positioning. I am using a remotely linked stylesheet, relative URIs and the
file: protocol. I have not experimented with other block-level elements. I am
using the following document type: 
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "W3C//DTD//XHTML 1.1//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
My page displays in Standards Compliance mode. 
I have experienced this problem before in similar situations and with similar
results. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make an HTML document including a CSS stylesheet. 
2. Absolutely position a <div> anywhere on the page. Have an absolutely
positioned <span> inside it. Using background colors would be helpful to
identify each element. 
3. Load the page in the browser and see where the <span> appears (inside or
outside the <div>). 

Actual Results:  
The <span> was positioned relative to the top left corner of the screen, instead
of the top level corner of the containing <div>. 

Expected Results:  
According to the W3C specification, the <span> should have been rendered
relative to the <div> instead of relative to the screen.
