Manual proxy ignored in 1.0 RC1, worked in PR release.
Selecting Manual Proxy just flat stopped working, ignores settings, and does a
direct connection. This worked with the 1.0 PR release.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Setup manual anonymous proxy
2. Go to a web site that detects your IP address
3. See that it is not using proxy at all.



Expected Results:  
Worked perfectly in 1.0 PR release.
