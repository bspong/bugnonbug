single browser with multiple tabs closes when clicking close and then selecting cancel

This can be reproduced easily. If more than one Firefox browser window is opened
and only one of them has ever had multiple tabs opened, go to the multiple
tabbed window select the red X in the upper right hand of the window to close
which brings up the dialog box asking if you want to close the multiple tabs. If
you select cancel the window will still close. I forget if the behavior is when
this is the only remaining Firefox window or not. Sorry, it's been a long day.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open multiple Firefox windows but only one may have multiple tabs
2.Select the red X in the upper right hand of the window to close Firefox.
3.select cancel from the dialog box asking if you want to close the multiple tabs.

Actual Results:  
The Firefox window will still close.

Expected Results:  
The Firefox window should remain open.
