The phrasing of the button "Remove Cookie forever" seems to suggest that only
the cookie selected in the list box when you press it will be effected, and only
this one is removed from the list. However, it seems that when you click it, all
cookies that are from the same domain (or any subdomain of that domain) are also
blocked.

This is particularly serious as, thanks to bug 252342, removing a cookie set by
one site may block cookies on an entirely different site.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:

1. Visit a site that sets multiple cookies (e.g. www.kelkoo.co.uk).
2. Go to Tools / Page Info and switch to the Cookies tab.  Select a cookie and
click "Remove Cookie forever"
3. The cookie disappears from the list, but the others remain.

Actual Results:  
On visiting other pages on the site the other cookies are not sent, so any login
attempts fail.  Future cookies set by the site are ignored.  If the "domain"
field of the cookie was set to (e.g.) "co.uk" (cf. bug 252342), all cookies set
by any sites in the co.uk SLD are ignored.

If you open Tools / Options / Privacy / Cookies and click "Exceptions", you will
find the "domain" field of the cookie you had selected is listed there.

Expected Results:  
Removed the cookie selected, and added a rule that would specifically disallow
_that_ cookie being set again (probably by detecting that the cookie name and
domain fields were exactly equal).  A third button "Block cookies for this
domain" should be added that behaves as "Remove Cookie forever" currently does.
