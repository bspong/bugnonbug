Firefox 0.9 browser never appears after installing over Firefox 0.8
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040206 Firefox/0.8

I was successfully using Firefox 0.8 for several weeks., when I decided to go to
Firefox 0.9.. I DID NOT UNINSTALL FIREFOX 0.8 BEFORE INSTALLING FIREFOX 0.9 ON
MY WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL SYSTEM. I then had the problem that Firefox 0.9
would never bring up its browser window. The Firefox process would be there, but
never any browser window. I tried following the steps regarding deleting the
profile directory but that did not help. I also followed the instructions
contained on the mozilla support page,
http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.phtml?title=Firefox_:_Issues:_Firefox_Won't_Startup
but that did not help either. I have redownloaded and then uninstalled and
reinstalled FireFox 0.9 again, but still no success with EVER bringing up the
Firefox 0.9 browser window. I would sincerely appreciate any suggestions to what
could be causing my problem. I have seen this problem on WINDOWS 2000
Professional. Both of these operating systems were up to date as far as the
latest critical updates from Microsoft were concerned. In the meantime, I will
stay with Firefox 0.8, which I was able to reinstall just fine and it now works
as it did before I tried to upgrade to FireFox 0.9.

Please email me at rdachows@us.ibm.com or just post your message here in this
mozilla forum.
