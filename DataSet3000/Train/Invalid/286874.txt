when clicking on a hyper link get pop-up message as follows:     Debug: ReferenceError: getRepositoryAsDom is not defined
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041001 Firefox/0.10.1 StumbleUpon/1.9992

If you click on the OK button it still renders the page fine...just a really
annoying bug, because you have to click OK all the time!!

Reproducible: Didn't try



Expected Results:  
Just goner to the page I clicked on with no pop-up message
