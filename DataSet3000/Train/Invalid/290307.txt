In a normal Text editor:
Home: Go to the act. line's first char
End: Go to the act. line's last char

Ctrl+Home, or Ctrl+PgU: Go to the act. docs's first char
Ctrl+End, or Ctrl+PgD: Go to the act. docs's last char

In Mozilla or FireFox that is exchanged. Everytime when I want to go to the 
first char in line, I go to the first line in doc.

That is very hateable thing ! Please exchange this, if possible !
See the Context Editor for example.



Reproducible: Always
