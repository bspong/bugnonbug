Back button is not enabled until the third page in the history of a new window, not 2nd.

Opening any web page in a new window or tab by any means (ie. from the "Open a
new window" toolbar button, File menu, Right-click a link and choose new window
or tab, or desktop shortcut, etc.) and then clicking a link will not enable the
Back button.  The Back button is not enabled until the third page in the history
of a new window, not the second as you would expect.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page that contains links in a new window from the File menu, context
menu, or desktop shortcut, etc.
2. Click on a link in that new window.
3. Note the lack of a back button to return to the previous page :(.
4. Click on a link in this second page.
5. Note that we do now have a back button to return to the previous page.  But
we still cannot return to the page before that (ie. the first page in the
history.)  Note: you can get there by the Go menu (so the history is accurate,
just not the Back button.)

Actual Results:  
Page history starting with a new window:
1st page --> No Back button as expected (nothing to go to.)
2nd page --> No Back button (BROKEN!, Should be able to get to the first.)
3rd page --> Back button is now enabled.

Expected Results:  
Page history starting with a new window:
1st page --> No Back button as expected (nothing to go to.)
2nd page --> Back button is now enabled.
