Refer to the attached html page.

This page contains a table with two identical single-cell rows, each of which
contains a sub-table.

The first table renders correctly, with a 5% margin on each side. The second
table originally renders with a 10% margin on the right. Resizing the browser
windows causes the alignment of the second table to be corrected.

This page behaves correctly in the current Mozilla nightly (Mozilla/5.0
(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031028) but not in firebird.
