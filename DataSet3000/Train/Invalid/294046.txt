javascript console shows
"Error: document.__gmCommandCallback is not a function"
on every page load. Tried with all extensions diabled: same result. Uninstalled
GreaseMonkey (imagining the "__gm" prefix related to that): same result. Posted
note about this in Mozilla forums -- no comments received.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load any page
2. open javascript console
3. read message in javascript console

Actual Results:  
javascript console shows "Error: document.__gmCommandCallback is not a
function", followed by name of page loaded

Expected Results:  
javsscript console should ideally show only errors and warnings that are
specific to the page loaded
