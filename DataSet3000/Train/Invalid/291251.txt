Drag and drop of folders in bookmarks causes lockup.  Works for individual pages, but not folders or Live Bookmarks.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

This is one of a couple of problems I've found with drag and drop.
Cannot drag and drop folders or LiveBookmarks in the bookmarks.  When attempting
it with those in the personal bookmark toolbar, Firefox locks up instantly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a few bookmarks in the personal bookmark toolbar including multiple
folders and pages.
2. Click and hold on a folder and attempt to drag it to another location on the
personal bookmark toolbar. (so to change the order of the bookmarks)
3. Firefox will lock up.

Actual Results:  
All inputs to Firefox disabled.
No redraw of browser (when switching to another program and switching back to
the frozen Firefox).
Only solution is to force quit Firefox.

Expected Results:  
The same functionality as when drag and dropping individual page bookmarks.

It is a minor bug, but because it locks up the entire browser, anything you were
doing in this or any other tab is lost.  So it could potentially happen at a
critical time with a substancial amount of lost data.
