Default  Browser
I set FF to be the default browser.  Then, I changed my mind and cleared the
flag on FF; set the flag on IE.  Everytime my apps need a browser, it still
defaults to FF.  When I check the setting in FF, the checkbox is clear, but upon
hitting the "Check now" button, the popup dialog box says "Firefox is already
set as your default browser".  I cannot seem to clear the setting even though
the checkbox is clear.  HELP!
