On every single page that I view, I notice that at least 25% of the right hand
side of the page can not be seen. It is as if the whole page will not load
and center itself properly.

Is there a fix?

Otherwise, this is a killer browser!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Just open the browser and jump from page to page.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The same thing: 75% of the page is viewable and 25% of the page is located too far
past the right hand of the screen.

Expected Results:  
The page should be centered every single time.
