When i have like 30 tabs open, right clickin on one to go to close, somethimes
brings up print preview and other items, without me being able to close.
Some times i right click on a tab and nothing will highligt in the menu, you
need to click another tab, then click the tab you want to close again to close it.
Double clicking a tab by acident when the program responds slow will open a new tab.
when saving a web page that is finished downloading you click on file save and
it takes ages for the save as window to open.

Sugestions
when clicking on close all other tabs, it should ask you do you want to.
you should be able to scroll tabs. i.e if you have 30 tabs open, you can only
click on the ones visable, not the ones that dont fit on screen.
when your browser closes or crashes, you should be able to open it again to have
all the pages still there.
