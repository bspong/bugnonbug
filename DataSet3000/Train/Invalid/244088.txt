Idea for making Firefox autoupdate

I was thinking maybe Mozilla Firefox could have something like a autoupdating
system that preserved the opened webpages.  For instance, the upcoming Extention
Manager could also have the ability to update Firefox when a new version is
released.  The update would download and install any files that are needed, and
then restart Firefox.  However, it will remember the opened tabs and form
information, etc. so that when the browser is restarted, it looks as it was
before it restarted.

Would this be possible/would it cause problems?

It could also make updating almost instant for important bugs, etc.
