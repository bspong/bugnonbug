User profile continually locks up; unable to delete parent.lock file

Twice today, Firefox locked up, so I shut it down.  When trying to boot it back
up, it says my user profile is being used.  I followed instructions to delete
the parent.lock file, but the system will not allow this to happen.

Reproducible: Didn't try




The system did not give me an error message when it crashed; it just stopped
loading pages.
