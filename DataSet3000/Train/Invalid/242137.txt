I've been using Firefox 0.8 since it was released, basically very happy.  

In the last few days I have had dozens of "connection refused" errors, which are
repeatable on a particular site at any one time, but which work fine when you
come back to them in another session.  Here is one URL that gave problems:
http://www.defra.gov.uk/planth/pvs/pbrguide.htm

Nothing has changed in my setup.

I am not the only one having this problem:
