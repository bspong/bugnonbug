When I enter "accountibill" as the URL Firefox does nottakes me to
"www.accountibill.com" instead it takes me to
"http://www.bidict.com/cgi-bin/auction/auction.cgi?accountibill".

When I enter "www.accountibill.com" ther is no problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.enter "accountibill" as the URL
2.press the RETURN key
3.

Actual Results:  
I am sent to the following URL
"http://www.bidict.com/cgi-bin/auction/auction.cgi?accountibill"

Expected Results:  
I should be sent to "http://www.accountibill.com/"

I am guessing that this is a parser problem. That "accountibill" is being parsed
into "account" and "ibill", with "account" being thrown away.

THIS IS JUST A GUESS.
