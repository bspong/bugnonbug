The new automatic updates are great, but on several occasions they download
almost completely unusable browser. A couple of weeks ago the frames rendering
was completely broken, and now (with the today's update) the tabs can not be
closed, and CPU goes to 100% after few minutes of work.

It would be good if at least some most basic tests are done before automatic
updates are pushed out - otherwise the testng turns out to be quite unpleasant task.
