PopUps shouldn't open as new tabs, they should open as new windows instead.

In 1.0RC1 there's options regarding tabbed browsing. These options replaces
SingleWindow plugin functionality. I'm using option "Force links that opens in
new window to open in NEW TABS". This option is forcing PopUps to open as tabs,
but this is incorrect. PopUps should remain popups, I can't work with some sites
due to this behaviour. The good-old SingleWindow plugin worked perfectly for me.
