I don't know when this appeared (some checking were done recently to make the
'Customize...' dialog look more like a window) but if you open the
'Customize...' dialog on windows _without_ running the theme engine, a title bar
will appear above it (see the screen shot)

There are at least two problems with firefox when you are using the app without
any themes in windows (the other one being the missing borders in _any_ progress
bar), you should try to fix those before 1.0 final

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
0. Make sure you have the classic windows style, dont use the themes
1. Open the 'Customize...' window
Actual Results:  
You see a titlebar floating above the dialog

Expected Results:  
No titlebar at all
