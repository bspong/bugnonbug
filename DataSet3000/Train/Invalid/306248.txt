I am not sure how they manage to sneak by the popup control:
On the above link http://www.reflecta.de/ click on the british
flag to select the english language. My Firexox opens up than 
another small window, despite the fact that supress popups and
in addition I disallow Javascript to manipulate window size.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Goto http://www.reflecta.de/
2.Click on the British flag
3.

Actual Results:  
2nd small window appear

Expected Results:  
Popup warning icon should appear, not the window
