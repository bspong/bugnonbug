option for minimal font size

On a high-resolution screen, some websites become unreadable because of the
small font size used.

One can zoom the text size in FF, but that is a per-page setting, not a global,
persistent setting (see bug 260143). Also, not all web sites need the same zoom
factor.

I therefor want to suggest adding an option to specify a minimum font size. This
should be a global, persistent setting, and whenever a website uses font sizes
that are smaller than the configured minimum size, they are automatically increased.


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Look at www.byte.com using a high-res 1680x1050 laptop screen (like my Dell
laptop has). I cannot lower the resolution, and the font used on the Byte site
is very small.
