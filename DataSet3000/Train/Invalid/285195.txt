When using the Noia 2.0 (lite) theme, and visiting an https website, a small
mark in the location bar appears to the right of the address after some space.
It is always in the upper half of the location bar. The mark can be of different
shapes/sizes, and is the same colour as the text in the location bar. It looks
(to my non-expert eyes) to be a remnant that is not painted over when the font
style in the address bar is bold+italic.

Reproducible: Sometimes
