Link nested inside other link doesn't work (Mozilla 1.7 and Firefox 1.0)

With nesting like this
<a><div>Outerlink<a><div>Innerlink</div></a></div></a>
the inner link doesn't work. Clicking the inner link will activate the outer
link. This works in IE 6 (but it has other problems with it...).

Not sure what the standards say about this. Is it supposed to work?

Note: I tested it with the XHTML transitional DTD.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load demo page.
2. Click inner link (www.sourceforge.net).
3. You will get the outer link (www.mozilla.org).

Actual Results:  
The wrong page showed up - the one that the outer link refers to - www.mozilla.org.

Expected Results:  
The inner link's page should show up - www.sourceforge.net.
