missing locale entries in extension after installing a pt-BR build over en-US
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; pt-BR; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041118 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win 9x 4.90; pt-BR; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041118 Firefox/1.0

The browser appears with a message under the status bar.
label="&flashgotLink.label;"
I was using Firefox 1.0 English. Then I downloaded the Portuguese(brasilian)
version, uninstalled the English version and installed the Portuguese version.
Then, every time I start the browser that message appears, making the work area
smaller.
