take a look at iCab-specific features
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.5 (compatible; iCab 2.9.5; Macintosh; U; PPC)
Build Identifier: I´m currently with iCab cause here I have only 32MB of RAM and Moz devoures it

I know this may sound stupid, and that perhaps it receives a rapid WONTFIX... but, have you aver heard of the Mac browser iCab? I can´t say that is fast, but it is little, nice and customizable, just like Fbirebird :-D
i´m listing some nice features that it has that would be nice to implement in Firebird...
-The option to close tabs with a little button in each of them, permitting to close not only the open one
-More Tabbed Browsing configuration options, such as opening tabs instead of windows (f/e, when JavaScript code opens them)
-More options for toolbar customization, and more buttons
`-little grippie for changing the size of the URL and Search input boxes
-Autocomplete option for remembering soruce URLs instead of subpaths (www.mozilla.org instead of www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird)
-Alternative button function when pressing it together with Shift
-Option for Reload completely a page, or only what has changed (a real Refresh)
-Links Manager
-Links submenu in contextual menu, showing all the links in a page
-Customization, via preferences of the contextual menu
-Support for the AddFavorite command of M$IE... we must accept it... It´s a standard, as much as Mozilla/something is a standard when browsers identify themselves. Important for web develpers to choose Mozilla
-Error Report (Non-standard HTML code)
-Filter Manager
-Detailed info about the file being downloaded in the status bar
-Special options for images in the contextual menu
-Integration with Download Managers (Download with...)
-Pre-download detailes information about the file
-REAL pause download ability (even if iCab is closed, I mean)
Also, note that restoring the Online/Offline button in the status bar is essential.
As a personal appreciation -i know this isn´t the place-, I prefer Edit-->Preferences to Tools-->Options...
Preferences aren´t a tool, and being different to the competence is what makes end-users to remember something. Mozilla must not emulate M$IEm apart that in all the other browsers, even in M$IE for Mac, it is located in the Edit menu.
