Search bar ceases to work after accidentally copying a long string into it.

I accidentally copied a very long string (containing some houndred words) from a
webpage into the search-bar.

The following queries will never work, the new query string is appearently
attached to the end of the very long string and the concatenated string is sent
to the search engine. The problem seems to be that it is hard to delete the
whole string from the search bar.

One could theoretically delete the string by keeping the backspace pressed for
several minutes, but it would be tedious. Pressing home, and shift+End followed
by backspace does not kill the whole text, only a small part of it.

It is very hard to restore the functioning of the search bar without restarting
the browser.




 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to www.amazon.com
2. Copy and paste the whole page into the search bar. Do a search.
3. Try to get rid of the text in the search bar.

Actual Results:  
You can delete the text in the search var by iterating the 
following sequence of keystrokes:
Home + shift End + backspace + backspace,
but it is very tedious.

Especially misleading that after 
Home + shift End + backspace
the search bar seems to be empty and usable, 
but it will yield wrong results when being used.

Expected Results:  
Home + shift End + backspace + backspace 
should delete the search bar at once.

An empty looking search bar should be really empty.
