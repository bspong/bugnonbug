Autoscroll attempts to scroll in location field bar  pasting with middle mouse button no work

I have a cvs build (two builds in a row)
that has done this behavior...

autoscroll 1.0r3

also: I turned off middle mouse paste in the background (it's in about:config)
I was sick of having wrong URLs load when I middle mouse clicked in the background

anyway, if I middle click to paste something from the X clip board, the
autoscroll icon comes up.

Another possible fix to this issue is better X and clipboard integration... I
don't know how that would work because I hate hight=paste because I highlight to
delete.. and paste over what is highlighted (but that is digressing)

I also have it so that I can middle click on a tab and have it go away (I think
it was the same option that fixed that)

oh, that option needs to be off by default (middle mouse button click opens new url)

Reproducible: Always

3.

Actual Results:

then highight and copy using Mozilla's clipboard
