Sort by Name doesn't work when I try to sort a bookmark by name.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Disorder bookmarks
2.Try to sort by name

Actual Results:  
This works in bookmark manager but then I can't change where the seperator is
and it has no effect on the actual bookmarks.

Expected Results:  
It should correctly sort by name.
