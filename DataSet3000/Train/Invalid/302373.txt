After installing FF 1.0.6, when a Music CD is inserted into a cd drive and
begins to play, Windows reboots.  
I've used QCD cd player and WinAmp and both crash.  I uninstalled FF and get no
crashes.  I reinstalled FF 1.0.4 and no crashes.  Upgraded again to 1.0.6 and
the crashing occurs again.  I turned OFF autoplay on the CD drive, and it had no
effect on the crashes.  If the CD is already in the drive when the system boots,
playing it does not cause a crash.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install FF 1.0.6
2. Insert music CD
3. either autorun or start the cd and the system crashes.

Actual Results:  
XP Reboots.
