Our server logs tell us that most of our visitors use IE.  Therefore I design
for IE but try to keep other browsers in mind.  Foxfire messed up my CSS left
nav.  I finally figured out that the Foxfire proportional font default of
"Serif" was the culprit.  When I changed it to "Sans Serif" the page rendered
correctly. Not many users will tweak their preferences to that extent and I
would suggest that the default be set to "Sans Serif" to be more compatable with
the broad usage base of IE users.

Second problem: the Foxfire default of "Underline links" overwrites our CSS
style sheet.  In IE, links are normally underlined anyway but in specific areas
of the page I can change that with CSS.  Not so with Foxfire.  Foxfire ignores
the CSS and underlines anyway.  (None of the boxes are checked in "Always use
my......")

I love your tabbed interface.  Pure genius.
