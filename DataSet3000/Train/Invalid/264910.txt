While this isn't a *bug*, on some iPlanet systems the compose button is broken -
the user hits it and firefox blocks the popup (on some other systems it doesn't
happen).  This would slow adoption of firefox since it sure confused a couple
people I know.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Log in
2. Try to compose a message
3.

Actual Results:  
Popup (compose message window) gets blocked.

Expected Results:  
Should have popped up.
