firefox profile 'in use' if hdd is full
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040228 Firefox/0.8.0+

Whilst working with Firefox, editing files and creating an extension, I found I couldn't start up Firefox... it claimed my profile was in use.  I assumed I'd broken something and went searching, taking about 10-15 minutes (including a consideration of reinstalling Firefox) before I realised my hdd was full.

Tagged this as a minor bug because I can't see it happening too often, however I consider tagging 'normal' since there is no workaround until you realise what's wrong.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Fill hdd to bursting point (ie cannot create anymore files - even 0kb)
2. Start Firefox
3. When profile manager comes up, select your profile.

Actual Results:  
Alert box: 
Firefox cannot use the profile "Zarius because it is in use.
Please choose another profile or create a new one.

Expected Results:  
Alert box should have informed me that I was out of hdd space.

It assume that since Firefox cannot create "parent.lock" in the profile directory (due to full hdd) it assumes one is there already...
