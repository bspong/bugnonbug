Large table causes vertical black bars rendering problem on Solaris and Linux platforms (not in Windows to my knowledge)

Whenever I load up the large table show Firefox and NS7 in Solaris will show
vertical black bars over the table.  In Linux it is not as bad and the text
under the table is still readable.  The table validates and has proper tagging.

It seems to be a rendering problem because highlighting the text will take away
some of the black bars over the text to where it is readable and some times it
will not.  Scrolling effects this as well and the bars will either disappear or
move to another location above or below on the table.

I should also note the tables are formatted with a CSS style sheet.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:

Vertical black bars appeared

No vertical black bars
