DIV tag defaults to IE NOWRAP
In the following example, it is displayed properly in IE, Opera.  It fails in
both Firefox and Mozilla.  Can't seem to post to mozilla folks, so please pass
it on.

By fail I mean that the text continues on instead of wrapping to the table width.
You can make IE do this by adding the NOWRAP option to the div tag.  According
to my doc, all browsers are suppose to wrap (except in the case of IE and nowrap)

<html>
<head>
<title>	</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Begin Table -->
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="200">

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<div nowrap id="baseball" style="position:absolute; visibility:visible;
z-index:1; width=200px;height=200px;">
This is text to be shown before we overwrite it.  Hopefully this wraps.
</td>
</div>

</tr>

</table>
<!-- End Table -->

</body>
</html>
