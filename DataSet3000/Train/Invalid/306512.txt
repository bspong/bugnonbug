When trying to open the Options (or the Sanitize) window, broswer is
out-focused, but no window is opened. Pressing ESC brings browser back to focus.
This problem doesn't exist when working in safe mode.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Deer Park (regular mode)
2. Choose Tools/Options


Actual Results:  
No Options window.

Expected Results:  
Open Options window.

All extensions where disabled so they are not the source of the problem. 
I guess it something with my configuration, since I worked with Deer park on
other Win2K machines...
