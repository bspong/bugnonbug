firefox interprets text/plain that is 95% not binary as binary
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050306 Firefox/1.0.1 (Debian package 1.0.1-2)

The returned page (which is reproduced with a simple CGI) specified content-type
text/plain. Nevertheless, Firefox insists on it being a BIN file and only offers
to download it.

PS: text/* should just render inline.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Visit http://albatross.madduck.net/cgi-bin/firefox-bug.cgi
Actual Results:  
BIN file download

Expected Results:  
inline text display
