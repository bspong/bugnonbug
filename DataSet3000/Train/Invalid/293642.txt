Copying script with document.write() displays output in new window instead of div
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)

This is relatively confusing bug, but it's a distilled-down testcase that's 
important for Oracle.  We're loading an iframe that, in its onLoad handler, 
copies scripts into the parent.  Some of those scripts have document.write() 
calls.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download frames5.zip to your local machine, and open START.htm
2. Click the link.

Actual Results:  
Note that the document.write() appears to run in a new window, whereas in IE 
(Win) and Safari (Mac), it writes inside the IFRAME.

Also, the progress icon in the upper-right spins endlessly.  If you click 
STOP, you get an issue with the BACK button -- clicking Back does not have any 
effect (you have to go back 2-3 steps to really go back).  None of this is a 
problem on IE or Safari.

Expected Results:  
I should see text written inside the IFRAME.

I reproduced this on Firefox for Mac as well.  This is possibly related to bug 
293633, which is itself possibly related to bug 283389.  There are issues with 
copying scripts between documents (iframe to parent).
