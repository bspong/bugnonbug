The Quick Time link often appears broken when I browse an URL with a Quick Time
link. I am using version 6.5.2 of Quick Time. The Quick Time site describes this
problem for the IE browser. Their solution is to download and install the
ActiveX plug in. I have the ActiveX plug in in my Quick Time Plugin folder. But
I still have the same problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just log onto the URL.
2.
3.

Expected Results:  
There should be a link to send a message to the member.
