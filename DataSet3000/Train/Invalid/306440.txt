Firefox seems to open too many handles to "\Device\WS2IFSL\NifsSct". After about
a week, there are 27,000 open file handles to that device. Every browsing action
causes more handles to be open. It appears as though perhaps
WPUCreateSocketHandle is being called without a corresponding WPUCloseSocketHandle?


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open firefox
2.Browse to any web site
3.Watch the open handles and see them grow

Actual Results:  
Apparent file handle leak

Expected Results:  
Close IFS handles when finished with them
