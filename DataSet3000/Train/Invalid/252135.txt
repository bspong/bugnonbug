Firefox does not install required shared library, when not found on system.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040707 Firefox/0.9.2

When installing Firefox .9.2 on a fresh Debian (current Stable) the
firefox-installer-bin complains that it cannot find libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0. It
seems to me that Firefox should install all of the shared libraries it needs
when they are not present on target system.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install latest stable Debian release
2. Run KDE
3. Download Firefox .9.2
4. Unpack and run firefox-installer

Actual Results:  
Error: firefox-installer-bin could not find libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0.

Expected Results:  
Installs lib if needed
