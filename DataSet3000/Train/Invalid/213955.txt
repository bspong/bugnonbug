The nightly build ignore my theme setting and displays the default.
Tools->options will not accept my canges of theme. If I start with a new
.phoenix and try to download a theme, the browser crashes.

I belive this is new to the build as of 25 July 2003

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open browser
2. Note theme is default, ignore s your last theme set.
3. Try to set theme - theme highlights, but does not change when you click OK

(download nightly from mox.org, clean .phoenix dir, try to downlod theme, watch
browser crash)

Actual Results:  
Still looking at default theme

Expected Results:  
theme should have stayed at the selected theme instead of showing default
(selection in the options dialog seems to work - it just never renders the new
custom theme)
