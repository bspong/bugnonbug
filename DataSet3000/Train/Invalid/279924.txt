when i entered a url site (http://wm.somesite.com), the location bar shows
previously visited site... i believe i pressed enter key plus another key by
mistake and the browser looked for http://www.wm.somesite.com.net ... of course
that wasn't what i had intended.... also the history on the location bar keeps
showing the www.wm.somesite.com.net as the first choice and lists the
wm.somesite.com/member/ as the last choice... obviously there is an ordering
issue in the history
