Feedview: an alternate link with an HTML type attribute in an Atom 1.0 feed should be used for the title's link
Currently, when an Atom 1.0 feed is Feedviewed, the self link (e.g. <link rel=
"self" type= "application/atom+xml" href= "http://example.com/youarehere.atom"
/>) is used as the link for the title.

If an Atom 1.0 feed provides an alternate link to some HTML (e.g. <link rel=
"alternate" type= "application/xhtml+xml" href= "http://example.com" />) that
should be used instead.

Typically this link is to the site's front page; this is where the user would
expect to be taken when clicking the title, and is consistent with Feedview's
rendering of RSS 2.0 feeds.
