if missing protocol, Firefox deems "username:password@site.com" to be an unregistered protocol
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.3) Gecko/20041026 Firefox/1.0RC1

It's simple: if someone wants to login to a site, let's say a site's cpanel for
example, they might use the following format:

username:password@site.com:2082

However, firefox thinks username: is the protocol, and therefore says "not a
registered protocol"

I think Firefox should stick an http:// onto a url that it might recognize as an
unknown protocol, such as username:, and if it still fails, then return it's not
a registered protocol.
