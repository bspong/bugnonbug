Drag and drop text string to viewport goes to google search.

Steps:
1. go to firefox.org (or any url)
2. drag any text string ("junk" will do) to viewport surface, not onto a control
3. ff now goes to google search page on this string
4. the bug is that there is no way to turn off this behavior

I know will you close this bug instantly due to your "world view" but it still a
bug to me.
