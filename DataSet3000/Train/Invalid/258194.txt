Whenever a document pointed to by an URL is opened (using some external app,
such as Word or Excel) or simply saved to disk, a new empty tab is created
('(Untitled)').  This tab doe not go away when the document that was opened is
closed or when the save to disk operation completes.  Ideally, no new tab should
be created, or, barring that, the tab should automatically close when the
document is closed or after the save to disk completes.
