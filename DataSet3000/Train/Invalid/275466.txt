Clicking a link in IRC opens in the latest link, instead of a new window.
Clicking a link in IRC opens in the latest link, instead of a new window. This
was fixed in a previous version, but is now happening again. Even if you right
click the link and go to "open in new browser", it still opens in the last
modified already open tab. Kind of annoying.

Thanks.
