Location bar URL different from current page (not updated)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b3) Gecko/20050712 Firefox/1.0+

Example: When I click on the "Home" button, it will load my home page, but the
previous page's URL is displayed in the location bar. If it's opened in a new
tab, the location bar would be blank.

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. CLICK on a link / button / menu item or anything else that can result in a
URL being loaded.
2. Wait for the page to load.
3. Look in the location bar.
Actual Results:  
Previous page's URL shown in location bar.

Expected Results:  
Current page's URL shown in location bar.

I cannot find any specific steps to reproduce this problem, but I believe it CAN
be reproduced anyway. I have encountered this a few times. Can someone help me
reproduce it please?

Hope to draw attention to fix this. I'm certain that this is a problem with the
code. Ask me if you need to know anything else that I've failed to provide.

Additional info: I'm ALWAYS using Noia 2.0(eXtreme) v2.88 theme, so I think that
wouldn't be a factor.
