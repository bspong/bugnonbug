When increasing the font size (CTRL +) to the point that a horizontal scroll bar
is necessary, the scroll bar is all the way to the left, and not to the right,
which is the correct behavior since the page is in Hebrew (a right to left
language).

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Increase the font repeatedly until a horizontal scroll bar is displayed
(number of times determines on the size/resolution of your display)
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Scroll bar appears, left-aligned.

Expected Results:  
Scroll bar appears, right-aligned.
