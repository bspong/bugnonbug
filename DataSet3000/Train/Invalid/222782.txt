Under Tools/Options/Web Features/Advanced Javascript, The window that pops up is
1) too small to display the text, and 2) Not resizable. 
The First line of text shows as "Move or resize existing wind..."

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open tools menu
2. Select Options 
3. Select "Web features Tab"
4. Under Javasript, click the "Advanced" Button. 
5. Look at the window

Actual Results:  
The First line of text shows as "Move or resize existing wind..."

Expected Results:  
Opened a larger window. And the window must be resizeable. If someone is using
larger fonts, even if the window is made larger, it may not be big enough. All
windows should be resizable, no matter how small or simple they are.

I have large fonts selected
