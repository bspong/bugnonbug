Gmail hangs with Firefox 1.07
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8b4) Gecko/20050908 Firefox/1.07

Gmail screen gets to "loading..." and goes no further.  Other webmail sites
work.  Gmail worked fine with Firefox 1.0? (immediately prior to 1.07), works
fine with Internet Explorer 6, works fine with Safari (Mac OS X 10.5), works
fine with Firefox 1.5 beta.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. browse to http://mail.google.com
2. wait for login screen
3. wait for login screen
....
n. wait for login screen


Actual Results:  
Nothing.  Neither the tab nor Firefox crashed.  But the page never loaded.

Expected Results:  
The login screen should have appeared.

I emphasize that behavior seems peculiar to Firefox 1.07.  Earlier version did
not hang Gmail.  Firefox 1.5 beta does not hang Gmail either.  This problem will
go away when version 1.07 goes away, presumably this fall.  However Gmail is
important to those who use it, so the problem is worth addressing.
