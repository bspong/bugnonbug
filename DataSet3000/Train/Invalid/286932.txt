Doesn't bring up normal applet - instead I get gargage unformatted text with two
non-functioning 'ok' & 'cancel' buttons that do nothing.  hitting 'esc' gets me
out of this, but I'm unable to config firefox at this time.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open Tools
2.open Options
3.stuck...  see unformatted text versions of item headers, but not rest of
applet, all superimposed on current page, whatever that  may be.

Actual Results:  
click on ok or cancel, hear pc bleep, nothing happens

Expected Results:  
open applet page with normal tabs and windows found in 'options' dialgue applet
