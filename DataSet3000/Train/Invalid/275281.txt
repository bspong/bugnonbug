The search bar shows no icon to choose a search engine anymore. I accidentally
clicked on "find in this page", and the icon just disappeared. Everything I
tried to get the icon back failed. Now I can only search the current website for
phrases, but I can not start a search in any search engine I have installed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. choose "find in this page" from the search bar drop down menu
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
The icon disappeared and the only option left is to search the current website
for a phrase.

Expected Results:  
Firefox should show me a magnifier icon. That way I could click that icon and
choose another search engine.
