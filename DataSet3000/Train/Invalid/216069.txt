The third button on the IBM Thinkpad 600e is used for scrolling; holding the
button down while using the Trackpoint emulates the scroll wheel of most mice.

In Firebird, the button does not function at all; it doesn't scroll or act as a
middle button. It functions in other programs running simultaneously.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firebird
2. Open any web page
3. Press the middle button


Actual Results:  
No function observed

Expected Results:  
If the button is pressed then released: Open the scroll function (similar to
clicking a scroll wheel).

If the button is held and the Trackpoint moved up or down - scroll the current
window (similar to operating the scroll wheel).
