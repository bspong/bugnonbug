After running for several seconds, Firefox freezes. If I kill process iiim-xbe,
the problem does not occur. Possibly, the freeze occurs when loading the
WikiPedia front page.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start Firefox
2. load pages
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox freezes, and does not respond to mouseclicks.

Expected Results:  
Displayed pages, responded to mouseclicks, etc etc.

Everything worked fine under Fedora Core 3, but bad behaviour began as soon as
Fedora Core 4 was installed. Have run yum update several times but behaviour has
persisted.
