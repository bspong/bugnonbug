when two (or more) windows of firefox opened at the same time, central processing unit load reaches 96-100%
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; ru-RU; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050318 Firefox/1.0.2

When I open second Firefox window, in that window in the left corner I see
"Ready" sign when page is fully downloaded, but at the same time in the right
corner the green bar, that indicates how much of the page is loaded, it shows
that the page is almost loaded...and it all just awfully slows down. Firefox
doesn't crash, but  switching between two Firefox windows becomes almost
impossible. In Firefox 1.0 and 1.0.1 everything worked fine however.

Reproducible: Always




I'm using default theme. "Forecast Fox" and "AdBlock" extensions I use worked
fine with Firefox 1.0 and Firefox 1.0.1
