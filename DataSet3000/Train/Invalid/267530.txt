firefox will not display the image on the page when it has this form
when firefox accesses the image this is the url it uses
http://www.subsurfaceimaging.net/images%5Cservices_2.jpg

this does not work... it maybe its some artifact of the asp

however if I change the txt to
http://www.subsurfaceimaging.net/images/services_2.jpg

that works
