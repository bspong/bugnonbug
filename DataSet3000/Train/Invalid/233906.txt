The CSS with statement seems to be ignored for <a...>...</a> tags. When 
creating active menus, it is helpful, and saves coding, to be able to force an 
<a> element to take the full width allowed by the parent element.
For example:

    <div style="width: 250px;">
        <a style="width: 100%;" href="http://www.foo.com">foo</a>
    </div>

In Mozilla, the above code will produce a 250 pixel wide <div>, containing a 
link only as wide as the letters "foo".

In Internet Explorer, the above code will produce a 250 pixel wide <div>, 
containing a 250 pixel wide link.

This is not DOM standard, but it is very useful, and would reduce coding 
efforts significantly. Instead of controlling background colors of an active, 
dynamic menu with javascript, it can be done with CSS (via "a" and "a:hover" 
property assignments), and save considerable overhead.

For now, I use javascript to accomplish this in gecko, and CSS to accomplish it 
in IE.
