Can't connect to any web sites
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; (R1 1.5); .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 

After installing FireFox 1.1 (latest version) I can't connect to the Internet 
or any web sites, it only says "Connection Refused" I am using the default 
settings and have changed nothing from the last version, please help I 
FREAKING HATE IE but am forced to use it again now. I have checked 
preferences/options to make sure the LAN settings were on automatic and 
uninstalled then reinstalled twice but nothing I try helps.

 Thanks

Reproducible: Always
