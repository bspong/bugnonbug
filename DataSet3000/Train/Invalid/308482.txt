High CPU / memory leak over short period of time on scrubs cast pages

Firefox crashed before I was able to track down what was causing the slowdown
the first time around, so I submitted a talkback form and reloaded firefox, back
to my surfing - same thing happened, so I figured it had to be scrubs. (I would
have noticed slashdot imdb etc earlier)


Visiting the cast URL, no problems.

Viewing one cast member page - nothing happens to memory usage, but firefox
begins to idle around 8-9% cpu usage.

Open another in a tab, idle cpu usage now has a new floor. And so on. I was
unlucky and opened all the cast bios in new tabs, hoping to read them all. By
the time I got through firefox was using 198mb (starting at 70) of ram, 200mb
swap, and 93-97% cpu usage).

Opening all the cast bio pages in firefox 1.5 beta 1 leads to insane memory/cpu
usage over a short time - and a crash if you wait long enough.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://http://www.scrubs-tv.com/cast.html
2. Open each cast member page in a new tab
3. Wait

Note: I had 2-3 other tabs open at this time, but closing the scrubs pages
caused the slowdown to go away and memory to be freed.

Actual Results:  
Firefox idles at, and this is a floor, 60%
Sometimes up to 97% idle, no images still loading, everything is done - but 90%
cpu usage.

Expected Results:  
Live long enough to let me read the cast bios! :P

Sorry no Talkback ID, but it's in there somewhere :|
brian@duality.ca I believe I used.
