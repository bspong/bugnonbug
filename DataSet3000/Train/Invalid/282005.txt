build mozilla products for X11 on Mac?

Actually, this is a documentation bug in all the aps.  How
am I supposed to build a version of the aps that runs under X11
on Mac OS X?  It isn't clear to me.  Emacs, by contrast, has
easy configuration options --with-x and --without-carbon.  I can't find
such options for Mozilla applications.  I know it is possible to configure
mozilla applications this way, because Fink does it.  But how??
