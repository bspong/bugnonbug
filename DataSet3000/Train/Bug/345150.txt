Middle clicking items in "Recently Closed Tabs" closes the menu but takes no action.  This forces the user to start again.

Other menu items which have no middle-click action don't close the menu.

Either an action should be taken (such as opening the item in a new tab) or the menu should remain open.  This is for consistency with the behaviour of other menu items.

For example:
- Menu items which point to bookmarks or history items load in new tabs when middle clicked
- Other menu items such as those in the file or edit menu do nothing when middle clicked.  The menu stays open.  This provides clear feedback to the user that middle click has no purpose here, but doesn't irritate the user by forcing them to start over.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Close one or more tabs.
2. Middle-click an item in History -> Recently Closed Tabs


Actual Results:  
Menu disappears and no new tabs are opened

Expected Results:  
A new tab should be opened containing the item the user middle-clicked on.  If for some reason we decide we don't want users to be able to middle-click those items, then the menu should remain open.

This is very similar to enhancement #344140, although this bug points out that the menu closes, forcing the user to start again.
