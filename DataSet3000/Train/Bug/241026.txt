Would like to import settings from other installs of firefox.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040416 Firefox/0.8.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8a) Gecko/20040416 Firefox/0.8.0+ (2004-04-16)

I have approximatly 3 builds of Firefox on my machine at any one time.
I generally have the latest nightly, an older 'extensionized' nightly, and the
stable build. I wish to import the settings from my 'extensionized' nightly into
the newly downloaded nightly.

Very unimportanat, but it would be nice. It'd make it easier to do testing/QA.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
A scenario for the normal user:
1. Have a currently installed version of Firefox.
2. Download new version (some new stable release or something like that)
3. Want to uninstall and get settings from old firefox.
4. Try to import but find no setting to import from Firefox.

For me:
1. I like testing the nightlies. I generally download the new nightly zip and
move it to an alternate install like 'G:\Program Files\Firefox\'.
2. I change my shortcuts in start menu and elsewhere to point to the new firefox.
3. I run firefox

Actual Results:  
It only imports from one or the other of the installs listed in 'expected
results'. Apparently random which one it imports. I believe it imports from the
last one I opened.

Expected Results:  
I expect it to import the settings (specifically bookmarks) from the last
nightly that I downloaded (installed in something like 'G:\Program
Files\Mozilla_Firefox') and the stable build (installed in the default
'G:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox').

I would love to see an addition to the import dialog to import from a previous
install of firefox. I believe this'd be useful not just for testers like me, but
for the casual user as described above.

Was this clear? Do you need more explanation?
