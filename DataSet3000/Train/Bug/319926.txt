V1.5 installs but previous version still active, and overwriting parts of the splashscreen.

Installed v1.5,installer ran ok. Open firefox and have spurious drop menu bar in http window. Open options in tools (this is still there, though on a mac it is not there in 1.5) and get the buttons and a little text but no full window. It looks like the previous version 1.0.7 is still being called in some way despite the apparent suscessful install. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.download v 1.5 and run firefox105.exe.
2.Open firefox ok.
3.check tools > options and get bottom buttons only.

Actual Results:  
The address line has a dropdown arrow and box in the right hand end. Can open tools > options and get the bottom three buttons and some text up top but nothing else.

Expected Results:  
Address line should be clean, and the options is no longer under tools (or if it is in xp than the full options screen should be displayed)

I am running this software after downloading it through the uni system from the firefox website. It could be a problem with firewalls etc , though the installer seems to work fine. Alternatively there may be something in the setup of my computer that is not allowing the full overwriting of the previous version of firefox.
