Browser returns to wrong history item when using fragments, forms, and the back button. Discovered while working on an AJAX app.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

Page A has several <a href="#cheese" ... tags, and a form submitting to Page B.
After clicking several fragment links, then submitting the form, then hitting the back button, the browser does not return to the last fragment that we looked at before submitting the form.
Note: The page does not have the associated <a name=""/> tags. I'm using the fragments to store page state for an AJAX application.
Firefox 1.0.7 behaves correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create HTML page 'start.html' with several <a href="#one">test one</a> tags, obviously updating the 'one' to 'two', 'three', etc. Include a form that posts to other.html, with any fields on it.
2. Create HTML page 'other.html' that does nothing.
3. Open start.html in browser. click through your fragment links, watching the URL change each time to reflect the new fragment.
4. Submit the form, rememebering your last fragment.
5. press the back button.
Actual Results:  
Page is not on last fragment visited before form submission.

Expected Results:  
The page should be on the last fragment visited.

This behavior is critical to being able to preserve page state in an AJAX application. Preserving page state will allow bookmarking of a page, and also enable 'expected' behavior of the back button.
