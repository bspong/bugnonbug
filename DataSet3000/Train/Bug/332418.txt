Firefox virtual memory use grows without bound until all available memory is 
used. After running Firefox and MPlayer for several hours, 1.98GB of ram is 
in use. Firefox has the largets real and second largest virtual memory size 
allocation. Only Firefox keeps growing.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Forefox
2. Open many links, always selecting the contextual menu
   "Open Link in New Window" until screeen is filled and then
   close the windows one by one in reverse order.
3. Repeat step 2 above and periodically monitor Firefox's Virtual and real 
   memory allocation.

Actual Results:  
Firefox's virtual memory and real memory continues to grow.
closing the windows does not release more than a minimal ammount
of virtual storage.

Expected Results:  
Firefox's memory should decrease back to the level it has when
Firefox is first launched as all but the first window are closed.
