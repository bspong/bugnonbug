mouse pointer "hot spot" wrong after opening first tab

In old Firefox versions, scrolling with the mouse wheel, without moving the
mouse at all, didn't fire onMouseOut events and the like.
This has been corrected in the 1.5 beta. However, if no more tabs are opened and
new tab is opened with a middle-button click (thus causing the "tab bar" to
appear), the webpage is scrolled down a little and the mouse position is wrong
for further events, up until the mouse is moved.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Without tabs opened, go to a webpage with onmouseover/onmouseout effects,
such as http://www.mudmagic.com/boards/promote/11
2. Middle-click over a link. Don't move the mouse at all after that.
3. Scroll with the mouse-wheel or the keyboard.

Actual Results:  
The onmouseover/onmouseout will display as if the mouse were a few pixels below
than where it actually is.
Moving the mouse fixes the problem.

Expected Results:  
When the tab is created, trigger an onmouseout event, the an onmouseover event
on the new mouse position.
