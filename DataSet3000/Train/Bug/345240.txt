Not loading an image with ACUTE ACCENT characters in name (not related to space)

I created a php page to generate thumbnails (which works)
The problem was not all the thumbnails where showing up in Firefox.
The one's that were not showing up were:
Thumb_A turma do Kick - Cacém.jpg
Thumb_Os Sócio s3.jpg
Thumb_Os Sócios.jpg
Thumb_Os Sócios2.jpg
(there were more, but this is enough to see a pattern)

All those names where in the html tag <img> in the src definition:
(the images where in the thumbs folder)
<img src="thumbs/Thumb_Os Sócio s3.jpg"/>
<img src="thumbs/Thumb_Os Sócios.jpg"/>
<img src="thumbs/Thumb_Os Sócios2.jpg"/>

The problem here are not the spaces, because I had many other images with spaces and they were shown. The problem is, firefox does not load images with the ´ in their name. IE loaded them perfectly. When I dragged and dropped one of those images to firefox, it was shown, but when I do it with the <img> tag it is not 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just put <img src="Some image with an acute accent on it's name"/> on a html page
2. Open it with Firefox


Actual Results:  
The image is not shown

Expected Results:  
The image
