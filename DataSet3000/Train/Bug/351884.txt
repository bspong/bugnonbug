HTML link to "about:plugins" is not clickable nor draggable to Bookmarks Toolbar Folder

An HTML link to "about:plugins" seems to lack support in 2.0b2.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create an HTML file with this in it: <a href='about:plugins'>Plugins</a>
2. Open that file in Firefox
3. Click on the "Plugins" link: nothing happens.
4. Open another tab and type the URL "about:plugins" manually.
5. Drag this tab to the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder: nothing happens.

Actual Results:  
Clicking: nothing happens when clicking with the left or the middle mouse buttons, nor when using the context menu's "Open in New Window" and "Open in New Tab" commands.

Dragging: during the dragging, the mouse cursor shows the appropriate symbol, but dropping has no effect.  Tabs that contain other kinds of pages can be dragged to the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder successfully.

Expected Results:  
Clicking: seeing the About Plugins page.

Dragging: a bookmark for that page in the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder.

For what it's worth, Konqueror 3.5.3 does not have this problem (re: clicking).
