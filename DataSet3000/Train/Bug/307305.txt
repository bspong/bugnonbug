I'm trying to set up an apache server with client-side certificate
authentication.  I may have it set up wrong, though -- but that's not the point.  

I import the certificate and in "Manage Certificates" and it shows up fine.  I
try and hit the server and it only shows an empty screen.  Then I go back into
"Manage Certificates" and no certificates show up.  

I then restart FireFox and the certificate shows up again.

I have the "select how firefox determines which certificate to send to web sites
that require one" set to "ask every time" -- not sure that this matters.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. add a certificate
2. try and use it
3. go back to manage certificates and it's gone

Actual Results:  
I'm unable to get to a client-side cert protected site that IE can get to using
the same client side cert (it's in p12 format)

Expected Results:  
I should be able to get data from a client-side certificate protected site.
