This is for a build I made of 1.5.0.3 on Fedora Core 5 using ICC.  Mouse-over on really long URLs causes a redraw of the window contents as though they were being rendered in a window the width of the URL, without changing the window size.

ie, if the URL, written out, were twice the size of the current window, the window contents would be redrawn to fit a window twice the width of the current one.

The window itself doesn't change size, though, and no scrollbar appears (in fact, generally all scrollbars disappear) so half the content disappears off the right-hand side.  Also, since the contents of the page have been redrawn, the links don't always stay under the cursor, which a) makes them really hard to click and b) makes the window flicker a lot as everything is redrawn several times a second.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Mouseover a long URL
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
Window redrawing, flickering, and really badly rendered content.

Expected Results:  
Displaying the URL in the status bar doesn't cause the window to be redrawn.
