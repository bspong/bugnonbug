Esource takes over the browser completly to the point of taking away all navigation controls and menus, rendering Firfox useless and needing to be removed.

On both my and my girlfriends computers, I have had esource take over the browser. Upon opening the browser, the esource page comes up even though the options have the home set to the default location. On my computer, I deleted all cookies, certificates, private data and used both norton and system mechanic to check the registry and clean my system. So far so good. On my girlfriends computer, esource highjacked the browser completely, to the extent of removing all access to any Firefox controls- the broswer opened to esource's homepage, popped another one underneath in a seperate window, and provided no controls but maximize, minimize, and close. I had to fully delete all folders and registry items from firefox and mozilla and reload to repair. Just reinstalling Firefox did not cure the problem, which might mean that whatever they are using is one of the ugly tricks used in IE, which is why I switched to 'Fox in the first place. I didn't see any other occurances of this in your bug lists (not really a bug, maybe). Main sites I visit are slyck.com and the torrent links they provide. Hope this helps.
