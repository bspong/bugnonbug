Places' smart folders highlight incorrect days in calendar widget
This may need to be split out to a couple of bugs, but this might be able to be fixed in one patch.

1. Click Show Places.
2. Click "Viewed today."

Problem: The calendar highlights what should be "All pages viewed".  I expect only today to be highlighted.

Workaround: Click "Viewed last week" (which highlights last week correctly) and then click "Viewed today" again.

1. Click Show Places (yes, load the chrome again).
2. Click "Viewed past week."

Problem: The calendar highlights what should be "All pages viewed".  I expect today to one week ago to be to be highlighted.

Workaround: Click "Viewed today" (which highlights today correctly) and then click "Viewed past week" again.

1. Click Show Places (yes, load the chrome again).
2. Click "All pages viewed."

Problem: The calendar highlights nothing.  I expect all of my past to be highlighted.

Workaround: None found.

When inside places, clicking "All pages viewed" makes the calendar "forget" the correct highlight.  For example:

1. Select "All pages viewed." (Get no highlight - BAD.)
2. Select "Viewed past week." (Get all past history highlight - BAD.)
3. Select "Viewed today." (Get today highlight - GOOD.)
4. Select "All pages viewed." (Returns to step one's state - BAD.)
5. Select "Viewed today." (Get all past history highlight - BAD.)
6. Select "Viewed past week." (Get past week's history highlight - GOOD.)
7. Select "All pages viewed." (Returns to step one's state - BAD.)
