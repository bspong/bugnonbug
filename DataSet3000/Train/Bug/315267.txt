A Java-based solitaire game that works well in Safari but does not work consistently using 1.5RC1 on Mac OS X 10.3.9. For example, selecting a card does not hilite immediately. This is a good test case since we are seeing the same problem in another web application that uses a Java applet - this application requires username and password to access. It seems that we are having to click on an object in the applet window many time for the action to take affect.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Click on card you want to move
2.Click on card you want to move the other card to
3.

Actual Results:  
The first click does not cause the card to hilite indicating that it was selected. Many times the second click does not move the card.

Expected Results:  
Clicking on card, hilites the card.

We are seeing this behavior in another applet that make the applet unusable. We can provide a tester access to the other applet should you want to pursue this further.
