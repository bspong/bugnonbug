Help Viewer does not work.  AND Themes will not install or say there are missing components.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

Sorry, I see that this is filed in the wrong section, however it is too much
time for me to backstep and find the proper "product".  I cannot update the
themes (I use Sphere now).  Says it cannot find installer script.  I also cannot
seem to upload any other themes, nor extensions into Firefox. I thought using
1.0.6 would fix it as it was present in 1.0.4 as well.  Neither works correctly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Help Viewer
2.Click on Index -- Index menu shows up
3.Click on ANY topic in index, and nothing happens.  The main page remains.  No
other options change the content (opening screen) on the help viewer screen.


Actual Results:  
Described above.  Also when I try to install ANYTHING, it says it cannot.  I
cannot change it, as the "Extensions" screen is blank, no matter what I do.

Expected Results:  
I suppose it should've shown me the topic?  And, should've insalled the themes
and extensions?
