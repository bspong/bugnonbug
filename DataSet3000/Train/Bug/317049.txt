I am currently developing a Java applet that allows a user to view/modify an image and then optionally save the original/edited image on their own machines.  This applet has been self-signed to allow the applet to access files outside of the Java sandbox.

The same applet works as expected with IE (edited files are saved), but on Firefox everything seem to work fine, but no files are created.  A dialog box appears that requests the user to input a name and file type for the image, but clicking on the save button does nothing.  There are no error messages (Exceptions) in the Java Console.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a signed applet that allows a user to save an image from the applet locally onto their machine.
2. Try to save the image.

Actual Results:  
No files are created.  No error messages from Firefox nor Java Console.

Expected Results:  
The saved image should appear in the location that was specified.

The same applet works fine in IE.  Both Firefox and IE are using JRE 1.5.0_05 on the same machine.
