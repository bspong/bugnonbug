invisible text which reappears when certain parts of it are selected.

In the page http://www.cityofangel.com/episodes/summaries/ep3_06.html at the
start of the second paragraph in the "Teaser:" section, the first line is not
visible.  If I select the text, I can get parts of it to appear depending on
which part I select.  Viewing the source, some of the text is also not appearing
there.

I've noticed this problem with several sites but this is the most consistant
one.  Observed with Firefox 0.9.1 but not Mozilla 1.7.2 on Linux.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.cityofangel.com/episodes/summaries/ep3_06.html
2. observe missing text
3. try selecting portions of the missing text

Actual Results:  
Text did not appear initially, portions appeared when certain parts were selected.

Expected Results:  
Display the text initially

I have screen shots of the missing text, the missing text in the source viewer,
and the portions that are made visible in three different selections of the text
that I'll post after filing this bug.
