popups do not resize correctly on various javascript galleries

the default selections for the advanced javascript should all be selected.
otherwise, a few different types of javascript popups do not work right. i've
seen this on multiple sites this morning alone.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to
http://evanwilliams.missiondata.net/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/1?osCsid=e4f0d9e0107d93fd213c4cbc2a661ba3
or
http://icon.missiondata.net/properties-cottages.shtml
2. click on the product image in the store or the image gallery on the other site.
3. the windows are not sizing correctly at all.

Actual Results:  
the windows do not size correctly at all. i thought it was a browser BUG since
the windows showed either no picture (in the store, you see a pagbg, but no
image without resizing) or, the window just doesn't resize the way it should.



Expected Results:  
If you go into advanced javascript options and check all of the boxes, you will
see the expected results. I'm not sure if this is because of the status bar or
because of the window resizing.

This seems to be only in the recent build of firefox, but i think it's a major
issue if all of the programs (mozilla/firefox/netscape) have the same default
settings. This inhibits the proper viewing of many existing sites and seems like
a strange adjustment of browser defaults.
