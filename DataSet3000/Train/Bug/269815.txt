You can't type in the text box for "Open them in this application:"

In the dialog for Change Action for downloads, there is a textbox labeled "Open
them in this application:" with a button labeled "Change" next to it.  It is
imposible to manually enter the path to an application in this box and once a
path is in there, you can't edit it.  This is a major hastle as the Gnome based
file picker that pops up when you click on the "change" button is slow and
awkward and does not have any way to type in a path either.  

As an example as to why this is so annoying, think about trying to add "xmms" as
the default application to open an "m3u" file.  I know where xmms is
"/usr/bin/xmms" and it would be very fast to just type that into the text box. 
But what I have to do know is to click on the radio button for "Open them..."
which automatically opens the file picker, double-click on the "filesystem"
icon, double-click on the "usr" folder, double-click on the "bin" folder, wait
for 30-60 seconds while the very large "/usr/bin" folder populates, scroll all
the say to the bottom to find "xmms", highlight "xmms" and click on the "open"
button.  This is a major usabilty issue that makes this feature close to being
unusable to me.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Prefences->Downloads
2.Highlight a type without an associated application
3.Click on the "Open them in this application:" radio button

Actual Results:  
A file picker pops up automatically without you being able to first type into
the text box.

Expected Results:  
Let you type into the text box and not opened up the file picker unless you
clicked on the "change" button
