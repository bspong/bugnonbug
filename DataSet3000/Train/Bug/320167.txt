Jimmy "Jimbo" Wales, creator of Wikipedia, allows other Wikipedia users to edit his user page. This is great and all, but Mozilla Firefox has a problem with it. I recently tried to change the background colours of his user page. I went to the "99f" RGB colour value at the Wiki source code of his user page, pressed the left cursor key to move one character to the left, and Mozilla Firefox crashed instantly. I tried again, this time with the right cursor key, and Mozilla Firefox crashed again. I can't understand the reason for this. This is on a Linux machine, I edited Jimbo Wales's userpage previously with Mozilla Firefox (I don't know which version) on a Windows machine, and it worked. I haven't tried yet if it still works.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the above URL.
2. Place your text cursor at the "99f" at the first line.
3. Press the left or right cursor key.

Actual Results:  
Mozilla Firefox crashes instantly.

Expected Results:  
Mozilla Firefox should have moved the text cursor as normal.
