mailto protocol should be a non-exposed protocol in firefox [makes SendPage work correctly with xremote]
i have the following shell script configured as my default mailto handler in GNOME:

  #!/bin/sh
                                                                               
                                                              export
MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME="/opt/mozilla-builds/thunderbird-current"
                                                                               
                                                              addr_trim="$(echo
"$1" | cut -d':' -f2-)"
                                                                               
                                                              if
$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME/mozilla-xremote-client 'mailto('"$addr_trim"')'; then
    exit 0
  fi
                                                                               
                                                             
$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME/thunderbird -P default -compose "$1"

when firefox is running, it intercepts and tries to handle the mailto xremote
command.  it discovers that it can handle this protocol using the external
protocol handler service.  it does so, which launches the script again.  but,
this time mozilla-xremote-client fails, and thunderbird is launched.  however,
for some reason it ends up in a loop launching several instances of thunderbird.
 there seems to be some kind of race because the number of thunderbird instances
is limited, but varies from run to run.  i usually end up with several compose
windows and several profile selection dialogs.

now, if i just set this pref in firefox, the problem goes away:

pref("network.protocol-handler.expose.mailto", false);

this pref causes firefox's xremoteservice to reject any mailto requests.  i
think we might want this pref for the next release of firefox.

with this pref and the script above, send-page and mailto links work perfectly
from firefox to thunderbird.
