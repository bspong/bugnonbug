Bon Echo seems to be hanging on me at random intervals without any sensible way to reproduce the error(s).  It has been happening to me since B1 was released to the public.  I was thinking perhaps this was originally a cousin of #346308 but it doesn't seem to be that way since a fix was tracked in to fix that (and my issue predates 346308).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Start Bon Echo
2.  Navigate around the web

Actual Results:  
Bon Echo will eventually stop working -- most notably around sites with a lot of activity such as Flash, AJAX or similar things.  The CPU usage on the processes list will spike up to 100% and the memory usage will go as high as 128k and it eventually will hang out and die (without TB incident btw!)

Expected Results:  
It should not do this?

I am at a *TOTAL* loss for words on how to reproduce this or even get any information back off this problem.  All I can say is it started on B1 and has NOT relented since the fix for #346308 was checked in.

It is less recurrent now that that fix is in place which leads me to believe I was suffering from two separate bugs with the same symptoms.  I'm totally willing to run debug builds or anything needed to track this.  However, I'm unable to get any reliable information from any possible ways I know how so far.
