Unable to trigger a file download when left-clicking on downloadable files

When I left-click on a link to a file that would normally be downloaded, Firefox
generates a modal error dialog and throws the following exception:

Error: [Exception... "'Component does not have requested interface' when calling
method: [nsIFactory::createInstance]"  nsresult: "0x80004002 (NS_NOINTERFACE)" 
location: "<unknown>"  data: no]

I first experienced this bug in the 20050607 trunk build.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Browse to http://www.kernel.org/
2. Click on the link to the 2.6.11.12 bzipped patch file.
3. Observe the modal error dialog.

Actual Results:  
"/tmp/blahblah could not be saved, because the source file could not be read."

Expected Results:  
The file handling dialog would appear, asking me to either find a program to
open the file with, or to save it to disk, if so configured.

Bug 250157 appears to be related, albeit with a different error message.
