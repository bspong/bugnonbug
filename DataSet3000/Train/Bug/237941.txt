Even if Bookmarks directory looks empty, we can still access some files in the Bookmarks directory of Bookmarks Manager.

Even if all files and folders in the Bookmarks Manager are deleted until only
two nested folders, “Bookmarks” and “Bookmarks Toolbar Folder” are left and
Bookmarks looks empty, some of the files in Bookmarks directory can be still
seen by using the “Search” field in the Bookmarks Manager. I do not figure out
why they appear as a result of the searching process after deleting them from
the Bookmarks.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmarks-> Bookmarks Manager.
2.Delete all files and folders until two nested folders, “Bookmarks” and
“Bookmarks Toolbar Folder” are left.
3.Select the Bookmarks directory in the Bookmarks Manager.
4.After that, click the “Search” field and enter a character such as “a”, ”b”,
or “c”.
5.The result of the searching process is that some files in the Bookmarks
directory that we already deleted still appear in the Bookmarks Manager.

Actual Results:  
As a result of the searching process, it still shows some files in the Bookmarks
directory even if they are deleted.



Expected Results:  
It should not show any file in the Bookmarks directory since all of them are
deleted from the Bookmarks.

Additionally, after the result of the searching process, I wanted to delete the
resulted files in the Bookmarks Manager, but delete function do not process
anything. In other words, the files are not deleted even if Delete icon is
highlighted after I select the files.
