Browser crashes on navigating to many (all !?) of the links from the Neopets home page [@ 0x00000000  - nsIView::Destroy]

This may be related to the site changes Neopets has rolled out today morning. 
When I navigate to the Neopets home page and try to access further links from
there, the browser crashes.  I have TalkBack installed and everytime the browser
crashed, the utility has transmitted data back.  

The site works fine on Mozilla 1.7.3 on the same system.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the Neopets home page. (http://www.neopets.com)
2. If you are already logged in, try logging out.  That crashes.
3. If not you can try logging in and try navigating.   (I understand this is a
bit vague but I am right now behind WebSense and most of the links are blocked.)

Actual Results:  
The browser crashed.

Expected Results:  
The browser should have continued working and displayed the page.

I don't know what priority to assign.  Since the browser crashes, I have
assigned critical severity.  I apologize, if it is too high.  I will try to find
out what code changes on Neopets site is causing this problem.

If needed, I can capture the Windows error information log (from the Windows
talkback utility that sends data to Microsoft) and post it.

Thanks a lot for whoever spares the time to look in to this.
