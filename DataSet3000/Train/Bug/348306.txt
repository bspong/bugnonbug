After composing email message and adding attachment and sending the message plus attachment, I cant retrieve the attachment which is in unreadable binary form.

I can't check the accuracy or completeness of attachments in Word or pages off the internet, when the attachment is retrieved from SENT archive in unusable, unwanted binary format instead of readable format resembling the originals.  This problem does not exist on Safari.  Why?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create email message in COMPOSE mode in Firefox
2.Attach WORD or web page article
3.SEND to another via Yahoo Mail Plus
4.Call up SEND message afterwards to check attachment as sent
5.Open up attachment and get unreable binary display

Actual Results:  

See Item 5 above.

Expected Results:  
Get a readable copy of the original attachmentto print out

This retrieval problem also has a corollary retrieval problem.  If I save an email in DRAFT mode, only about the first two paragraphs are reproduced.  The rest of the email is cut off.  I get a second blank page with header like a normal third page for a two-page message.  The same thing happens if I merely want to make a hard copy of the email when it is long.  My Yahoo email message length is supposed to be up to 20MB for graphics, and no cut off occurs with Safari. Why?
