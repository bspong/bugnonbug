Import fails consistently on new installs
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040616
Build Identifier: Firefox 0.7.2

This bug is easy to duplicate.  Take a Windows machine that's never had Mozilla
or firefox installed on it before.  Run the firefox 0.9.2 installer. Once
complete, the first run of Firefox prompts to import.  If the user clicks the
default option (to import from prior Firefox, Phoenix, etc) then it hangs forever.  

Note the correct option for a new install, when no other browser is present, is
"Do nothing" since there is nothing to import. However, if the user simply
clicks "next" on the default option to import, the application will hang.  

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Get clean machine with Windows.  (No prior browsers installed)
2. Install firefox 0.9.2, launch it, let it try to import prior browser
settings. which is its default setting.
3. Watch as the applcation hangs (presumably looking for settings which do not
exist)

Actual Results:  
I hit CTRL+ALT+DEL to get the task list and killed the firefox import
task. This works around the problem.


Suggested fix: Change the default on "Import settings"  to "Do Nothing" which is
correct for users who don't have a prior version.  
OR 
If the user screws up, and selects import settings, when there are none to
import, eventually exit rather than hang.

This bug is so bad, our main free CD-ROM called Duckware will not install
firefox because of it.  i.e. Novice user just keeps clicking next without
reading anything and they end up in this state.  It is easily reproducible.
