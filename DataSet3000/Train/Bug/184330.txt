When bookmarks on the toolbar are to long for the toolbar itself and extent
under the ">>" arrows, the right click options do not appear. This makes it
clunky when trying to edit these bookmarks. The bookmarks also do not move into
the toolbar when there is room.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Create multiple bookmarks on the toolbar that invoke the ">>" button for more
toolbar favorites.
2.Edit toolbar favorites that appear in the toolbar to have a shorter name (eg,
userfriendly to UF)
3.Bookmarks do not shift in when there is room.
4.Click the ">>" button to access other bookmarks that do not appear
5.Right click on bookmarks, the right click option does not appear

Actual Results:  
Bookmarks do not shift in and right click options do not appear

Expected Results:  
The next bookmark will shift in when there is room.
Right click option appears when right clicking bookmarks that are under ">>" button

default theme and other themes same result. Bookmarks shift in when changing themes.
