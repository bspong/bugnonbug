One monitor is set to run in Portrait mode, and when Firefox is used on this
monitor, the Menu Bar options run slower (fading in/out behaviour) when the
menus are accessed.  THis is 100% reproducible.   THe menus are fast and no
fading is apparent on the Landscape oriented monitor.  

The landscape monitor is the primary monitor.

Reproducible: Always

1.  Open Firefox on portrait monitor
2.  Use MOUSE to select any menu bar option (File, edit, view, etc.)

display.  The menus appear to fade in or out as the mouse is used to access an
option.
