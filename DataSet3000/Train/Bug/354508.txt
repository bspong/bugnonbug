When you stream media (such as in Windows Media Player), the request sends out two packets with the same GET request.  The second packet includes a header packet-pair-experiment=1 and pipeline-experiment=1.  This is all normal.  The bug is that the second request does NOT retain the original session of the first request, thus the request sent to the server is recognized seperately.  This is not a problem in most cases, but in cases where the server needs to know the session (such as protected video files), the bug will not let the video plugin retain the session.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Embed a video player such as Windows Media Player
2. Request a video on a server that uses sessions
3. Notice that the session IDs are different between packets, not a problem in other browsers

Actual Results:  
The session is NOT retained between requests.

Expected Results:  
The session IDs in the request packets should be identical.
