firefox "send link" does not work with thunderbird in twm window manager on rh9
User-Agent:       
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040207 Firefox/0.8

I have implemented the network.protocol-handler.app.mailto to run an external
script which launches thunderbird.  I have an echo statement in the script
which prints to a log file, so I know that the script is NOT being run
when I select the "Send Page" or "Send Link" menu item.

Several web sites suggest that I have to set my "default mail application" for
the window manager, as in gnome and kde.  But I use twm, which does not have
a "default mail application".

Is it possible to get "Send Page" in firefox to launch thunderbird on redhat 9
linux under the twm window manager?  If so, how?   How does the "Send Page"
menu item work?  Can it be made to work without the window manager dependency?



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. set up the network.protocol-handler.app.mailto to a wrapper script which
calls thunderbird
2. select "Send Page" or "Send Link"
3.

Actual Results:  
Nothing; the wrapper script is never called

Expected Results:  
The wrapper script should have been called, which would have logged the
attempt and launched thunderbird

If launching thunderbird from firebird under linux is doable WITHOUT
window manager dependencies, this needs to be documented.
