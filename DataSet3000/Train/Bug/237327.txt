compiled firefox does not install Adblock extension unless offical build's chrome directory is copied into compiled version's directory
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040312 Firefox/0.8
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.6) Gecko/20040312 Firefox/0.8

I have compiled firefox several times from cvs, 0.8 source, and have always had
problems getting certain extension, namely adblock, to work properly on my
compiled version of firefox. The extensions ususally work correctly after
copying the chrome directory files from the officially firefox build into my
compiled version of firefox's chrome directory. This problem occurs with and
without CFLAGS.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Compile Firefox 0.8 source on a Mac OSX Panther 10.3.2
2. Try to install adblock extension
http://downloads.mozdev.org/adblock/adblock-0.5-dev.xpi
3. Try to access the preferences from the Tools in the menu bar. Adblock will
not be in the menu bar, and neither will DOM inspector.
4. download the official build of firefox 0.8 for mac and mount image etc.
5. copy the chrome directory files from the official build into the chrome
directory of the your compiled build.
6. go to Tools in the menu bar, adblock and DOM Inspectory now show up in the
tools menu.
Actual Results:  
See Steps to reproduce.

Expected Results:  
Adblock preferences should be in the Tools menu, along with DOM Inspector.

This had nothing to do with CFLAGS, because I used extensive CFLAGS when I
compiled firefox, however I also compiled firefox with any CFLAGS to be certain,
and the same problem occured without the CFLAGS.
