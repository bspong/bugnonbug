   Running Dell Notebook, P-III, 1.2GHz, 512 MB RAM, WinXP Pro SP2.  Trend Micro PCillin running on PC, also behind network firewall and other "security" considered necessary by company IT folk.  However, since all of that was also true before symptoms began, doubt there is a relationship.
   Repeated episodes of Firefox (with a few or many Windows and/or Tabs open) hanging.  Cannot move from Tab to Tab, if I shift to another application, screen is very slow to redraw or won't redraw, leaving image of Firefox within Window frame of now "active" application.
   Task Manager shows CPU at 70-100% and Firefox is using it all.  When it goes above 90% usage, nothing is apparent, not response from Firefox until Tabs/Windows are forced closed.
   Does not appear to be related to Pop-ups, tho the Web sites are often commercial sites, e.g., media sites such as example entered in URL above.  However, this is not always the case.
   Appears to be random and is much worse with this release (1.5.0.6) that prior releases.
