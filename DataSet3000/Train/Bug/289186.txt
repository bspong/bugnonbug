Web form fields' AutoComplete too short to display similar starting entries. eg VeryLongName...@ various.com

On entering web forms, AutoComplete drop-downs are restricted to being the width
of their associated field.  On occasions, AutoComplete entries are wider than
the field in which it is to be entered.  Similar starting AutoComplete entries
such as:

   MargaretBloodyThatcher@AssetPlunderer.co.uk
   MargaretBloodyThatcher@AssetPlunderer.gov.uk

... can be incompletely displayed and thus clipped of the vital distinguishing
information.  Some websites need to have shorter fields for practical reasons so
could this option perhaps be resizable, as in Micro$oft IE?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type an entry into any webpage search field, far longer than it's width and
search for entry (to create AutoComplete entry).
2. Click Back
3. Repeat search, using same entry string with an additional character at the end
4. Click Back.  Clear the contents of the search box, start to reenter the same
string and look at the AutoCorrect options. They both begin the same and are
indistinguishable but different.


Actual Results:  
As described above

Expected Results:  
Either:
 * the AutoCorrect suggestion box is automatically big enough
 * or let me drag an AutoCorrect Suggestion Field handle and increase it to a
size where the full contents are readable
 * and, better still, also having a multiline 'OnMouseHover note' with the
complete entry listed in a temporary box... you know what I mean, like M$ IE
does with incompletely displayed webpage names in it's history column
