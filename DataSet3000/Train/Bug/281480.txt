When closing a pop-up window containing a video, the video datastream isn't
stopped - need to exit Firefox to stop it

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.plus.net/webcams/index.html
2. Select one of the webcam feeds, which opens in a pop-up window
3. Close the window and note that the data is still streaming (e.g. watch the
Network Connection icon in the system Tray

Actual Results:  
The data is still streaming (e.g. watch the Network Connection icon in the
system Tray). Exit FF and it stops


Expected Results:  
The data stream should stop when the window is closed.

This has also been seen in FF 1.0 as downloaded from the FF website as well as
the version in the UA string above.

If you enter the URL of a feed, e.g.
<http://www.plus.net/webcams/webcamview.html?CAM_IP=ptb-cam-csc1.plus.net&CAM_TITLE=Customer%20Support%20Centre%201>,
in the URL bar so it opens in the main window, or set
Tools->Options->Advanced->Tabbed Browsing and check "Force links that open new
windows to open in:", the problem doesn't occur when the tab is closed or you
navigate away from the page.

When the pop-up window is closed, two Uncaught Exceptions appear in the JS
Console which seem to be the cause:

Error: uncaught exception: [Exception... "Component returned failure 
code: 0x80004005 (NS_ERROR_FAILURE) [nsIObserverService.removeObserver]"
