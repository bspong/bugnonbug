firefox alpha 2 has a run-a-away script on no search engines
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060319 Firefox/2.0a1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8) Gecko/20060319 Firefox/2.0a1

I just untarred the firefox 2 alpha 1, and after starting it up with my old profile (from 1.5), it hangs for a while, before giving a "script is running slow" message.

The script triggering this is apparently trying to find the searchengines availaible in my profile, but finding none.

Trying the searchbox in the top gives me the same results, (since there are no search engines installed)

Shouldn't we either show the user a "install your favorite search engine" option, or remove the search box from the top all together if there are no engines installed? (this will allow sys-admins to just clean out the search-engine folder without crashing the foxes on their clients pc's.

Or we could just search on the local page, if there are no search engines installed. like with crtl-F

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.untar firefox 2.0 aplha 1
2.start
3.notice severe slowdown, and slow script message
4.notice that there are no searchengines available
5.try a search
6.notice severe slowdown, and slow script message
7.notice there's no message allowing us to install a searchengine.
Actual Results:  
firefox slows down, and afther allowing me to cancel the search script, it obviously doesn't search (anywere)

Expected Results:  
search the local page,
or let me know there are no engines installed, and let me pick from a list to install.
Or remove the box from the top altogether disabling me to even try a search.
