In building firefox from either the CVS code (Aviary Branch) or the Firefox 1.0
source code tarball,  there is an issue with http://www.usatoday.com when the
software is build with gtk2 as the default toolkit and the flash player plugin
is installed (version 7).  If the software is compiled against gtk1 as the
default toolkit and the flash player plugin is installed (version 7), there are
no issues.

base OS is Linux, kernel is 2.4 on Lycoris Desktop/LX 1.4
gcc  version is 2.95
glibc version is 2.2.5
gtk1 version is 1.2.10
gtk2 version is 2.4.13
libflashplayer.so version is  Shockwave Flash 7.0 r25

If firefox is compiled against gtk1, and installed, no issues with flash player
on any site.

If firefox is compiled against gtk2 (only changed in the ./configure options by
changing --enable-toolkit-gtk to --enagle-toolkit-gtk2 and setting the default
toolkit to gtk2.,  Sites such as http://www.usatoday.com  will cause a SEGFAULT.
   Not all sites are effected.  http://www.lycoris.com/ does not create any
issues with either gtk1 or gtk2 and flash plugins are enabled.

On gtk2 build, if the flash plugin files are removed from the plugin directory,
and the browser is restarted, there are no issues on http://www.usatoday.com.

of note,
When building from the Mozilla SeaMonkey tree, mozilla 1.7 branch or the 1.7.x
minibranches, there are no issues in this area with either gtk1 or gtk2 builds.



Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Build firefox against gtk2 & install
2. Install flash player plugin (from download service)
3. Run firefox, browse to http://www.usatoday.com

Actual Results:  
SEGFA

Expected Results:  
Display web page, as is done if firefox is built against gtk1, or as seamonkey
(1.7 branch or 1.7.x mini branches) does when built against either gtk1 or gtk2

Default theme is used.
Issue is only on gtk2 builds in aviary branch.
