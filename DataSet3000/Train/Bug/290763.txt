"Links from other applications" resets to default after using Latest-Trunk
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.7) Gecko/20050415 Firefox/1.0.3

This has happened a few times (for 20050407, 20050416, and some other
latest-trunk).  I kill off firefox aviary nightly, and run the unzipped version
of latest-trunk.  Once I come back to aviary nightly, things are fine for a
while, till I click a link from an external program.  It opens in the latest
tab, instead of what I had set the pref to, "a new tab in the latest window",
the most sane option.  This happened after I used the 07 trunk and I didn't
associate the two for a while, until it happened again today.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set, in latest-aviary installed (this is how i have it setup) the "Open links
from other applications in:" option to "A new tab in the most recent window"
2. Grab and extract firefox latest-trunk
3. Run firefox latest-trunk
4. Exit firefox latest-trunk and open up aviary again.
5. Click a link from another window (mIRC, AIM/MSN/whatever)
6. Notice it doesn't open in a new tab but the current tab

Actual Results:  
it opened in the current tab, which has caused data loss (gmail)

Expected Results:  
not forgotten the setting and opened in a new tab

Currently I'm on aviary 20050415 and it occurred with trunk 20050416 (i think,
it was recent).
