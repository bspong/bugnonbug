Entire window portion of screen bounces on some web pages.

On some web pages, the screen area between the upper and lower tool/status bars
bunces up and down a bit over a sixteenth of an inch, as does the right scrollbar. 
It will also sometimes occur in tabbed windows. It does not always happen, even
when returning to a page that previously bounced.  Sometimes
maximizing/maximizing the window stops the effect; sometimes not. I've noticed
that, when the window is in the "minimized" option, while I click and drag the
corner to resize the window, the bouncing stops while resizing.  Special note:
if I move the window quickly while resizing, it gives an effect of dragging
"multiple copies" of the window (and contents.)  

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.It happens on it's own. 
2.

Uhhh.... screen shouldn't bounce?  8^)

I'm using the original theme.  I've reinstalled Mozilla, and also Firefox (but I
did not un-install, first.) This only started a few days ago. I've used firefox
ffor over six months before it started.  I've installed no software that might
cause an issue.  I've went thru the problem search but found nothing exactly
like this. This has not happened while using the regular Mozilla browser.  Right
now I have two pages open; both on your site.  If I refresh the page, sometimes
it will be stable. However, if I minimize the page (it's set for just slightly
smaller than maximum,) it started bouncing, even if I again maximized the
window.  Again, this does not always happen.
