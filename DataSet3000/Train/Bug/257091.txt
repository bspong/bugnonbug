For the last month I have had problems with my hotmail account when it comes to
logging out. I can log in and all of the familiar buttons are there and work
properly EXCEPT for the "Sign Out" area which I am used to seeing in the upper
right corner. If I scan the area with my mouse I can get a hover over finger and
when I click on this area I can log out. I tried to resolve with MSN tech
support, but I was told that it was a Mozilla problem and to check with you. In
the past it has worked correctly. When I went back to IE to see if I could
duplicate the problem, it worked as used to work.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.url is msn.com, click on hotmail
2.sign in using user id and password
3.have to hover over area to find sign out area

Actual Results:  
I can sign out, BUT the visable area is not displayed. If I hover I can log out
but the area image is NEVER displayed.

Expected Results:  
There should be a visable area dedicated to signing out.
