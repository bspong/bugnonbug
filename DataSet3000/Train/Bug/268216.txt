No proxy authentication dialog if extension is first to request external URL
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2

As of the 2004-11-03 build, the initial interaction with password authenticating
proxy servers is having some problems. My last test of this used Mozilla/5.0
(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041103 Firefox/1.0RC2 (the
RC2 bulid released a few days back).  Prior to the build mentioned, the Firefox
behaved as expected.

The basic issue is that if an extension, not a start page/favourite/typed URL,
is the first item to use a URL requiring authentication, Firefox does not
display a dialog indicating this.  It just causes the URL to return an error.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1) Start new browser.  (Note: Ensure start page is blank or an intranet site, so
no proxy authentication occurs.)
2) Open Sage 1.3 RC sidebar and hit the "refresh feeds" button.  (Note: Assumes
internet feeds are already configured.)
Actual Results:  
Most or all feeds will be marked as having XML Parse Errors

Expected Results:  
Prior to the 2004-11-03 build, step 2) would trigger proxy authentication and
refresh the feeds OK.

To work around this issue:
3) Open a favouite (not RSS feed) pointing to an external web page. This
triggers authentication against the proxy server and will load the page OK
provided correct authentication details are provided.
4) Repeat step 2). All feeds will now refresh properly.

PS I also noticed that during a second test of this issue, I had to try step 3)
twice because the first didn't trigger proxy authentication. Haven't been able
to reproduce this issue though.
