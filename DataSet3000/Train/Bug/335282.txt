Weird Window Opens After Refreshing or Clicking a Link

I have noticed this quite a bit lately on 1.5.0 and even more after updating to 1.5.0.2. When refreshing some pages or clicking certain links, Firefox will open up a completely new window that shows the content of the page I just refreshed with a "??" in the taskbar. If I close that window, it closes out of Firefox and all my windows. It's hard to describe so I have attached a screenshot. That is unaltered and also shows how it keeps my menu on the left size from my desktop environment displayed even after closing it.

A couple sites that I frequent that do it a lot are the "My eBay" section of eBay, and the NBC "Deal or No Deal" Play and Win Game at http://www.nbc.com/Deal_or_No_Deal/playwin/ (click on "enter for free here"). Others do it though as shown in my screenshot, and it has happened on several sites.

It happens at least once a day now.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Refresh a page or click on a link

Actual Results:  
Opens up the link in a weird "popup" window that completely closes Firefox if you close that window.

Expected Results:  
It should have gone to the page or refreshed it in the current tab.
