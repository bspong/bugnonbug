Purposing maintenance tab,in Advanced,under Option,under Tools.(a user for 4y)              
Under this maintenance tab

Deleting profile folder button or a firefox reset button (with a strong  warning), Backup bookmarks first, and right down your extensions and themes. This will bring firefox back to its original state. After Upgrading, Reinstalling, uninstalling fox or extensions (extensions have a life of their own,  that come from many places and  are sometimes corky ) will not do the trick, there is steal junk left over that  slows down fox or bugs it out. we need an easy way for a user to reset fox) Messing around with %AppData% or profilemanager will not cut it for the avenge computer user.

Backup Bookmarks

Extensions button

download   button

Themes     button

customize  button

check for up grands button

I'm not proposing we move this button from there original place,just that we make more and organize them in options before 1.5 :) (i know, were the hell were you,    i don't think so! )

Reproducible: Sometimes
