digest auth spreads across multiple instances of the browser

Not sure if this is a "bug" or a "feature" - its just different to Internet
Explorer and I don't know which is the "correct" behaviour.

In IE, on sites with digest authentication (DA), I can log on to the site as two
different users at the same time as long as I use two instances of the browser -
one for each log on. In FF the second instance presumes I must want to use the
credentials I used in the first instance so you don't get asked for them again
it just lets you right in! I do this a lot while developing sites which use DA
and it bugs me that I have to use IE all the time!

It would be OK if FF did this for tabs in the same instance but not across
instances. (For clarity: by "instance" I mean a new window entirely not just a
tab in an existing window.)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a site with DA
2. Hit the site and log in to it in IE
3. Open a new IE window (new instance)
4. Hit the same site (you get prompted for credentials again) and log into it
with different credentials
5. Try the same thing with FF - the second window (instance) just lets you right in!

Actual Results:  
See "Steps to Reproduce"

Expected Results:  
IE lets you log in as two different users. It separates the instances for the
purpose of DA. FF does not. You can only log in as one user over multiple instances.

I have marked this as minor - however depending on what the "correct" behaviour
of DA should be it could be major. It is certainly more usefull the IE way.
