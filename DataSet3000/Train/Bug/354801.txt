I'm linked to google.com even if I use the italian version of Firefox
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; it; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060918 Firefox/2.0

I'm using the italian version of Firefox
When I use the embedded search engine Google, I'm redirect to Google.com web site. So that all the results of my search are loaded from english web pages. 
For example if I search for "cane" (an italian word that means dog) the results are all the english pages that deals with the canes. No one of them deals with dogs (in italian, obviously).
I've tried to install ffox on another PC on which ffox was never installed before but the same problem was still there.

I've just solved the problem changing the google.xml file. I've changed, in that file, all the items google.com to google.it and now everythig is ok.

I hope this warning is useful to you.

Bye and thanks a lot for your wonderful work.
