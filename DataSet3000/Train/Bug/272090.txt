Awhile ago, Yahoo! created a quick download to set Yahoomail as one's default
email.  When a mailto: link was clicked on, an IE window would pop up with the
mail.yahoo.com webpage open.  When one clicked "send as attachment" in Microsoft
Word, an IE window would pop up with the mail.yahoo.com webpage open. 
Basically, a browser window pointing to one's yahoo email replaced the normal
Outlook or Express popping up for all email functions.  This feature was very
handy, but the download provided by Yahoo! only works with IE.  I prefer
Mozilla, and I would love to see the ability to do the same with this browser. 
See http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/mail/ext/ext-11.html for details on the Yahoo
- Explorer download. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on any mailto: link OR click on "send as attachment" in a Microsoft
Office document.
2. 
3.  

Actual Results:  
Instead of a browser window with mail.yahoo.com popping up as Yahoo's download
can cause when was uses Internet Explorer, Outlook pops up.

Expected Results:  
Opened a browser window with Yahoomail.  When using the mailto: link, the
browser should have automatically entered the To: field.  When using the "Send
as attachment" in Office, it should have already attached the document and be
ready for me to enter the To: field information.

I know this is a very minor issue that only affects Yahoomail users that
previously had Internet Explorer and used the download to make Yahoo a default
email program.  I'll file it as an enhancement request.
