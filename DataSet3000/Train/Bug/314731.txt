Using JRE 1.5.0_05: about:plugins shows installed java.

Java plugin is initialized (Java logo displayed), and login applet is reported to have been loaded (at bottom of screen). But the embedded window does not display the login fields. The missing login fields are:

"Vælg brugernavn" (label, followed by input box), button, "find sikkerhedsnøgle"
"Indtast personligt kodeord" (label, followed by input box)

In Firefox 1.0.x this works: You see the login fields and you can login.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. use url (specified in bug report) to get login window, but no login fields.
Actual Results:  
empty login window (just with some descriptive text at the top of the window (in danish)

Expected Results:  
Login fields should be displayed.

This is the login page for the danish Nordea net banking application.

This problem is NOT related to JRE 1.5.0. This problem can be reproduced with JRE 1.4.x as well.
