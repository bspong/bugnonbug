Password requested on browser open; when password protected domain added to bookmark toolbar
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7) Gecko/20040803 Firefox/0.8

When the browser opens it requests the favicon.ico from every domain in the
bookmark toolbar, if the file is password protected, it asks for a password to
download the favicon.ico.

This is annoying if I am trying to quickly access information. The browser
should probably just not display the icon if the domain requests authentication,
and update the icon only when it has the credentials.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Add a bookmark to a domain with top-level authentication to the bookmark
toolbar. (i.e. totalfark.com, you don't need to know the password to recreate
the problem)
2.  Enable the bookmark toolbar
3.  close ALL occurances of firefox
4.  open firefox.
Actual Results:  
the browser requests authentication even though my homepage does not require a
password.

Expected Results:  
Not try to display an icon if a page requests authentication for favicon.ico.
Don't ask me for a password, just use the default icon.  I should only get the
password prompt on browser open IF my homepage, or the link used to activate
Firefox require authentication.
