As page loads slowly, image marks up table border specified in CSS.

When visiting web pages that have a table background specified like this:
Table.mainbg
{
	background-image: url(ligerbot.png);
	background-position: -2 bottom;
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
The image marks up the left border of the table until the affected region is
hidden perhaps by scrolling. I believe this is an Engine problem as the same
thing occurs in the Netscape browser as well. Best if tested on a 56k as the
page loads more slowly.
An example screenshot of this can be viewed here:

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit this page first (to load 'ligerbot.gif' into cache):
http://www.bearcreekfire.com/zoids3d/home/index.html
2. View this page http://www.bearcreekfire.com/zoids3d/media/dvd/index.html but
keep the scroll to the very bottom as the images load. You will notice the
tracking effect.
3. To remove the effect, just page above until it can't be seen anymore, then
page back down.
