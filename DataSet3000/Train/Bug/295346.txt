Tools->Options->Clear History often fails to clear history if history set to 0
(zero) days
With "Remember visited pages for the last x days" set to zero, opening
Tools-Options-History and selecting "Clear" often fails to reset the history,
and even when it appears to do so, the "Back" button will nonetheless revisit
the previous page. The behavior occurs even when Cache is also cleared.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In Tools->Options->History, set "Remember visited pages for the last x days"
to zero. 
2. Visit some web pages.
3. In Tools-Options-History, selecting "Clear".
4. (Optional): Clear Cache as well.
5. Look at the Clear button. If it not grayed-out, History has not cleared.
6. Look at the Back button. If it is still enabled, allowing you to visit the
previous page, History has not cleared.
7. Behavior is not 100% but I have been unable to determine any cause-effect
using other criteria.
8. Workaround: Close Firefox and re-open. With History set to zero, History will
have cleared.
Actual Results:  
History did not clear.

Expected Results:  
History should clear.
