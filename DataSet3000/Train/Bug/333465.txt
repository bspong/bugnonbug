bookmarks.html file owner/group gets changed by firefox

I'm on Mandriva 2006.0 community. I installed FF 1.5.0.1 from the official binary package (tarred, not rpm) since my distro comes with FF 1.0.7 in the stable branch.
On my linux box I have the habit to use 2 user accounts, one for web activity (surfing web , mail, watching streaming video, etc.), and one for when using apps (writing my thesis, doing system maintenace, etc.). That is the way I keep my apps less exposed to security risks coming from the web.
That can be debatable, however I feel the need to have the same bookmarks in these 2 accounts, so to share my bookmarks I've do the following:
0) Let me call my users 'web' and 'apps', they belongs to the 'myusers' group.
1) I have made a new folder /home/bookmarks and pasted there my bookmarks.html.
2) I've assigned read/write user/group permission for /home/bookmarks and /home/bookmarks/bookmarks.html so they are like this:
/home/bookmarks web.myusers 770
/home/bookmarks/bookmarks.html web.myusers 660
3)In both firefox user profile I've setup through about:config the string browser.bookmarks.file pointing at that folder/file

Doing so I can read my bookmarks from both users.
The problem arises when I add or modify a bookmark: every times firefox writes on bookmarks.html, it changes the owner/group of bookmarks.html to the user writing on it. For example, if I'm logged as 'web' and I add a new bookmark, firefox changes thing so they looks like this:
/home/bookmarks web.myusers 770
/home/bookmarks/bookmarks.html web.web 660 (/home/bookmarks/bookmarks.html apps.apps 660 if I'm logged as apps).
At this point of course user 'apps' (web) is cutted out from bookmarks.
Trying to manage the problem, as a first (stupid) workaround i've made a script that control and change (if needed) the owner/group of bookmarks.html, runned every hour by cron. But after a bit I found that, under particular circumstances (I think this is related to bugs 251692 and 273088), the bookmarks file can be rewrited by FF with an empty file.
Actually I've removed the group write permission on the shared bookmarks file to avoid data loss, and I can live with the problem of a partially bookmarks share, however I think FF should let me share my bookmarks if I instructed it to do so. Why keep changing that file owner, since it isn't in the profile folder, it is in a shared folder?
Now, I eared that FF 2.0 will use sqlite for bookmarks: please don't let FF 2.0 be too egoist on the sqlite bookmarks file as FF 1.5.0.1 is with bookmarks.html.
I think we also need managing concurrency on sqlite file (using a lockfile?)
