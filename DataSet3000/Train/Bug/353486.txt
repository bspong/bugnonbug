All Firefox windows and tabs hangs when opening www.cisco.com
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.0.7) Gecko/20060909 Firefox/1.5.0.7

Once www.cisco.com starts loading all Firefox windows become unresponsive, sometimes the firefox icon on the taskbar even dissappears, although you can still ALT-TAB to it (although it shows a blank firefox window then). 
8/10 times response eventually comes back after 2min+ after www.cisco.com has finished loading, sometimes it completely crashes and have to end-task it.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open new window and go to www.google.com
2. Open a second window and go to www.cisco.com
3. See what happens, all open firefox windows/tabs become unresponsive for the complete duration of cisco.com load, or sometimes completely locks up and only a END-TASK operation gives back control.

Actual Results:  
All Firefox windows and tabs become unresponsive, sometimes the firefox icons on die Windows taskbar dissapear. 

Expected Results:  
I expect any other Firefox window not to lock up when accessing a problematic site on another firefox window/tab.
