Firefox 2 RC 1 http-encodes some characters (including spaces) twice when doing Google 'Browse By Name", making it fail
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-UK; rv:1.8.1) Gecko/20060918 Firefox/2.0

When doing a search in the location bar that results in a Google 'browse by name' search, Firefox encodes the % in the already http-encoded results. This causes the keyword search to fail for all searches which contain these characters, including any with spaces.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Type "moo cow" (without the quotes) in the location bar and press enter
2. Firefox briefly shows moo%20cow
3. Firefox then goes to the Google Browse By Name search
4. Firefox re-encodes the % in the already encoded moo%20cow, and instead ends up making the keyword in the URL be moo%2520cow
5. The Google search comes up (because this particular example does not autocomplete), and the resulting search on Google is for the text "moo%cow" not "moo cow" (all without quotes)

Actual Results:  
Google searches for "moo%cow"

Expected Results:  
Google searches for "moo cow", as originally typed.

This appears to be a regression from 1.5 - didn't file it earlier because I thought it was so obvious it had to have been filed already.

This really has to block Firefox 2, because it makes all keyword searches including spaces (and some other characters - I imagine all those that get http-encoded) fail, and makes us look really silly.

I don't think this should be hard to fix, I imagine it's just a case of evaluating which encoding step was not needed. Best probably to see how Firefox 1.5 did it.
