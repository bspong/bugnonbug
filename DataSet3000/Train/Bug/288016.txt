etag token is not returned to server if loaded from an iframe
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

Consider the following scenario.

You have a single web page that loads in a CSS page; that sets an ETag to flag
when it should be cached etc.  Refresh this page, and all works as it should.
Perfect.

Now, take that page, and include an IFRAME inside it, that loads another file,
but that file references the same CSS page (or another one).  The Etag will
presented to the browser (as demostrated by viewing LiveHttpHeaders) is never
returned to the server.  Access that page directly outside of the iframe and
Firefox does as it should.

Tried on InternetExplorer; IE obeys all etag communications perfectly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create web page; include a reference to a resource that has an ETAG
2. Place an IFRAME inside that page
3. IFRAME references another resource that has a ETAG setup

Actual Results:  
the inner pages do not cache at all.

Expected Results:  
the inner pages should obey the HTTP headers
