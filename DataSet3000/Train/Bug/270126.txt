Support import of shortcuts to local files (.LNK)

Import during install of Firefox fails to collect any shortcuts to local HTML
pages from my Favorites folder. It does however manage to import all of my
"Internet Shortcut"s.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a local HTML file in IE.
2. Drag the document icon from the location box onto IE's Links bar (this
creates a Shortcut, rather than an Internet Shortcut).
3. Install Firefox and import IE favorites.
Actual Results:  
Firefox imports all internet shortcuts, but no (regular windows) shortcuts.

Expected Results:  
Firefox's links bar should contain all shortcuts (internet or otherwise), or
internet shortcuts to the same shortcuts. Changing a local file link to a URL
would just involve prepending it with file:/// and reversing any backslashes.
Changing a UNC path (eg \\machine\share\file.html) file link to a URL would
involve prepending it simply with file: and reversing backslashes.

A workaround for the import problem would be to copy the shortcuts into Firefox
by hand, but this can be time consuming and frustrating (since it's awkward to
compare the contents of the Favorites folder with those in the bookmarks
manager, and painful to add new shortcuts for each link missing).

Also, technically speaking, file: URLs should not need rewriting at all (they're
meant to get passed unchanged to the underlying filesystem), but Firefox doesn't
seem to do this the way I'd expect either. Opening UNC files directly into
Firefox results in URLs like "file://///machine/share/file.html", which is silly.
