Arrow keys and PageUp/PageDown inoperative after loading page in background

The arrow keys, spacebar, and page up/page down cease to work after I open a
page in the background.  If the page has text fields, then the arrow keys fail
to work in it, too.  From thereon, all arrow keys in that tab fail to work even
if you go to a new page.

If I disable "open links in background", the problem does not occur.

The problem seems to be tied to how fast a page loads.  If a page loads quickly
I rarely have a problem.  But I have a slow PC (P2-300) and some pages are large
Bugilla queries.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start up on http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
2. Memorize a large query and put it in your page footer.  It should take a few
seconds (at least 5) to load and be more than one screenful.
3. Start a fresh window (Ctrl+N) on http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/
4. Middle-click on the new query link in the footer, to load it in the
background of a new tab. ("Open In New Tab" does the same thing.)
5. Wait for page to finish loading, switch to the tab.  
6. Press PageDown to scroll.


Actual Results:  
Nothing.


Expected Results:  
Scroll one page down.

This is a bit intermittent.  If it fails to reproduce, close the open tab with
the "X" button, go back to step 4.

In my case, it fails 100% of time when I query our local Bugzilla database.  If
I use Mozilla's, it happens less often, maybe 50%.

My other relevant prefs are set:

  [ ] Move system caret... (no idea what this does)
  [X] Use find as you type...
      [x] to search links...

  [X] Hide tab bar...
  [X] Open links in background
