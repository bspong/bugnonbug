Web of science allows one to export references directly to reference software (in this case endnote).  This works fine in internet explorer.  When i try to do so in firefox, a downloading file window comes up, but the file is never downloaded.  Eventually i have to cancel the downloading of the file.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0.Install endnote.
1.go to web of science (unfortunatly you need a subcription, but almost all universities have one)
2.find a reference
3.attempt to export the reference.

Actual Results:  
again, the file never downloads

Expected Results:  
endnote should be prompted to ask which library you would like to add the reference to.  once you choose a library, the reference should appear in that library.

As a result i used internet explorer to deal with references, and it stole all my firefox bookmarks, settings, etc.  I'm sure this is easy to fix, only i don't have time today.  This makes me very sad.  I hate internet explorer.
