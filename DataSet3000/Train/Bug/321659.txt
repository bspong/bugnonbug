Earlier versions of Firfox (I am now using 1.5) had a problem with printer printerfriendly pages from the washington Times.  That was fixed.  But now as of a couple of days ago it will not load www.washtimes.com    Only text comes up with no graphics.  Other problems sites where graphics do not show in Firefox but do  in Safari: -  Ace Hardware - www.acehardware.com     Washington Times:  www.washtimes.com     -  http://www.thebabylukas.blogspot.com/

There are several others site that also will not load graphics.  Used to be OK but not now.

There are also many problems with prints from the Charles Schwab web site.  I have talked with them and not sure whose problem it is but the mutual fund lists for one will not print from Firefox.

I like Firefox but there are problmes.
