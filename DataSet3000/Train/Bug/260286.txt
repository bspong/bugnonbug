serach results highlighting does not work for websites that are loading in
background

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. open www.google.com and search for "firefox"
2. open one of the search results in another tab
3. in this second tab, enter "firefox" in the search bar and switch on "Highlight"
4. switch back to the google-tab and drag another link of a search result in the
second tab
5. wait(!) until the second tab has loaded (until the animation has stopped)
6. then switch to the second tab

Actual Results:  
the search-string ("firefox" in this case) is on highloghted, although the
highlight-button is kept snapped-in.

(You have to turn on and off highlighting to solve the problem.)

Expected Results:  
the search-string should be highlighted

the problem doe not appear if the tab is open while the page is loading

(because this problem can irritate the user (make him believe the page does not
contain the search-string) I set this bug "major")
