Standardize installer/tarball file names, and tinderbox build automation for localizations
Followup to bug 254175 and discussions on npm.l10n, we need to

1) standardize the names of release packages (tarballs and installers)

2) Set up build automation so that a tinderbox can show basic green/red for all
the locales in CVS, and produce nightly localized builds

The part of this that needs to go in the CVS tree (the makefile-fu) is pretty
simple. The part about setting up a tinderbox server shouldn't be hard, I
imagine... the only part that mystifies me is setting up the tinderbox client
(in post-mozilla.pl) to loop through a bunch of locales and send each one as a
separate tinderbox email pair.

Here's what the tinderbox client needs to do:

After the regular tinderbox build is complete (in English), and the packages are
staged, the tinderbox should loop through all the non-English locale dirs in
CVS, and do the following actions (ab-CD is the locale):

send an "I'm starting the tinderbox "ab-CD"
"make -C browser/locales installers-ab-CD"
send an "I finished ab-CD (red/green with a log)

and hopefully stage the resultant langpack+tarball+installer to FTP (or at least
the nightly build machines should do this).
