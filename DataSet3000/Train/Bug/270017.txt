Firefox locks up with malformed file: URL in Location toolbar, e.g. file://c://
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.7.5) Gecko/20041107 Firefox/1.0

When a malformed file: url is typed into the location bar, firefox locks up. For
some reason when I substituted 'a' for the drive letter the problem did not
occur. At least one of the times I experienced the lockup, CcApp - Symantec's
"Common Client" - stopped responding shortly after Firefox stopped responding,
so it could be a problem with Norton Antivirus 2004. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. In location bar, type in file://c:// or file:c://
2. Hit the enter key on keyboard
3.

Actual Results:  
Firefox locks up. Ctrl+Alt+Delete Displays "(not responding)" message for
firefox. At least one time, Symantec Norton's CcApp locked up simultaneously.
CcApp does not lock up every time.

Expected Results:  
Should have generated a "file not found" or "please look up how to write a
properly formed file: url" message.

I am running Symantec Norton Antivirus 2004 on this machine. The only reason I
mention this is that the symantec memory resident CcApp.exe locked up on at
least one of the occasions that firefox did (but not every time).
