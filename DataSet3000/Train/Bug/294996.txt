Build ID off by one between master.ini/manifest.ini and build directory
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050520 Firefox/1.0.4
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050520 Firefox/1.0.4

Starting at some point between build IDs 2005052004 and 2005052007 (at least for
Thunderbird and Firefox "aviary" builds) the Build ID in the Talkback file
manifest.ini is one unit lower than the build ID derived from the build
directory: e.g. 2005-05-20-07-aviary1.0.1/ThunderbirdSetup.exe creates Talbsck
build IDs of 2005052006.

Checked for TB 2005-05-20-07 (2005052006) and Fx 2005-05-20-13 (2005052012).
Does not affect Fx 2005-05-20-04 (2005052004).

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download a TB or Fx aviary nightly installer (not from the ...latest1.0.1
directory) and note the build ID in the directory name.
2. Install.
3. Do a directory listing of %APPDATA%\Talkback\MozillaOrg\Thunderbird10\Win32
(for TB) or of %APPDATA%\Talkback\MozillaOrg\Firefox10\Win32 (for Fx).
4. Note the name of the latest subdirectory and cd to it
5. Note the BuildID mentioned near the top of the file manifest.ini

Actual Results:  
IDs in 4 and 5 above are one unit lower than that in 1 above

Expected Results:  
All three IDs should be equal (disregarding the dashes)
