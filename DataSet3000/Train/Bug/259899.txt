I attempted to do "Save link to disk" on the "MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe" link thinking
that it was a file. In fact, this link points to another page. The source for
the link is <a href="http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe?download"
target="_nw">. Doing this created a file of about 13kb which I assume was the
page content the link pointed to. The problem is that this file was corrupted.
Even when the computer was restarted multiple times the operating system refused
to delete the file saying it was in use by another process (sharing violation).
The only way to delete the file was to go into safe mode.

I reproduced the error accidentally when I went to download the file again and
moronically did the same thing as before--saving the link instead of going to
the linked page. Once again the file was locked no matter.

I would stress that the Firefox was NOT running and the file was still locked. I
rebooted the machine and the file was still locked. The only way to delete the
file was to go into safe mode.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml#hdr2
2. find the link to MinGW-3.1.0-1.exe on that page
3. right click on the link and choose "Save to disk..."
4. save the file
5. try to delete the file you just created

Actual Results:  
A file was created which could not be deleted.

Expected Results:  
Created a file that did not have a corrupted lock on it. In fact there should be
no lock on the file whatsoever when it is done saving.
