Firebird 0.6 fails to launch when any URL is clicked in Thunderbird (when using Firebird as default browser)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030516 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

While using Firebird as default browser and Thunderbird (061303 Build) as
default E-Mqail client the following occurs whenever a URL is clicked in a
HTML-formatted message, the following error message is issued by Thunderbird: 
"Error launching browswer window
TypeError:Components.classes['@mozilla.org/appshell/component/browser/instance.1']
has no properties." 

When using Thunderbird with other default browsers, i.e. Safari, Thunderbird and
Safari link properly whenever a URL is clicked in a message within Thunderbird.

Firebird works properly with other e-mail clients such as GNUMail, Mail.app, etc.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Set Firebird as default browser in OSX.
2.Set Thunderbird as default e-mail client in OSX.
3.Click on Thunderbird's throbber, or any URL in a HTML-formatted email message

Actual Results:  
See details.

Expected Results:  
Firbird should have gone to the web site represented by the URL in the e-mail
message.

Talkback was not invoked.  To clear the error message in Thunderbird I had to
force quit the app and relaunch it.
