Firefox buffer overrun detected c++ runtime library internal state
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.2; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

When entering the url http://www.dr-klein.de/Baufinanzierung/index.htm in 
Firefox, I see the top of the page and then I get a messagebox from Firefox 
which tells me

"Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library"

"Buffer overrun detected!

Program: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe

A buffer overrun has been detected which has corrupted the program's internal 
state. The program cannot safely continue execution and must now be terminated."

Now I can click only on "Ok" and all open Firefox windows are closed.

This happens with a fresh installation on Server 2003 with SP1 and Data 
Execution Prevention. Perhaps that's causing the problem. I have this on some 
more sites also. e.g. www.cdr24.de. But on this site, it's not always 
reproducable for me.

I have installed the talkback function, but it's not working.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start Firefox
2. Paste the URL into Firefox http://www.dr-klein.de/Baufinanzierung/index.htm
3. Press Enter
