For all pdf files from the web that you view in Firefox with Acrobat 6.0.2: When
you press the Adobe Acrobat search button (not the Firefox find), the searches
do not find any results, even if you search for a word that is obviously in the
document.  The pdf file opened in a separate window.  This window did not have
the usual navigation bar.  Internet Explorer does not have this problem.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Blackwell-Synergy website
2. Open a journal (you need a password)
3. Click the pdf link
4. The pdf file opened in a separate window (with no nav. bar)
5. Click on the search button in Acrobat 6.0.2 which is running within the
browser.  The search button has a picture of binoculars on it.
6. Try search for "objective", which is always in these documents (they are
journal articles)

Actual Results:  
1. The search comes up with "0 items found"
2. You can try searching for other words that are obviously in the document

Expected Results:  
The search should have come up with a number of results and I should have been
able to go to these in the document.
