This is the same issue raised in bug 242134. This issue is still present for me.

I upgraded to the latest version of Firefox 1.5.0.4. I changed the Page Setup settings so the margins were set to 0 and there were no headers and footers. After restarting the browser, when I printed a web page, the default margins, headers, and footers were used.

When I open the Page Setup dialog box, the settings I had previously set were visible. After clicking "OK", the settings were used the next time I printed a web page.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open File -> Page setup... dialog box and change the default margins, headers, and footers.
2. Exit Firefox. Restart Firefox.
3. Visit a web page. Print the web page.


Actual Results:  
The web page is printed with the default margins, headers, and footers.


Expected Results:  
The margins, headers, and footers that appear in the Page Setup dialog should have been used.
