Empty toolbar shown in popup if webpage hides all the toolbar's items

If a webpage uses JavaScript to open a popup window without the Location bar,
and the user has created a toolbar that contains only the Location bar, the
popup window will still display the empty toolbar. This is a trivial bug; only a
slight loss of screen real estate and an annoyance for those who can't stand the
waste of such real estate.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to View | Toolbars | Customize...
2. Create a new toolbar.
3. In it, place only the Location Bar.
4. Click Done.
5. Go to a website that uses JavaScript to open popup windows without the
Location Bar, such as http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/
6. Click on the link that generates the popup window. In Asa's blog's case,
click on one of the Comments links.

The same results occur if you replace each occurrence of "Location Bar" with
"Search Bar". Some other websites that you can observe this behavior on are
Netscape WebMail, Netscape Address Book (the one on Netscape.com), and many
weblogs powered by Movable Type or TypePad. (MT's default templates create such
popup windows)

Actual Results:  
The new toolbar was displayed, empty.

Expected Results:  
Firebird should have hidden the new toolbar, since it would've been empty anyways.
