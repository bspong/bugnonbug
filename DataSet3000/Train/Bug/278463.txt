Maybe something to do with the server being really slow.
I was in a tab of one window when I clicked refresh and then I realised that I
wanted to actually click a link, so I did. 
The refresh is what got processed in the tab, but the link click opened in a
full height window that was just rendered html with no window parts, so the
window could neither be resized or closed.
I could still navigate in the window, but none of the menu options, such as back
close tab and close window would work

Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a page in a tab
2. click refresh
3. before page refreshes, click a link

Actual Results:  
Refresh got processed in the tab and the link click got opened in an
html-rendered window with no window menus or control stuff

Expected Results:  
Link click should have opened in same tab

Not using any theme other than the default.
Just using a Powerbook G4 running 10.3.7
Couldn't select Mac OS 10.0 because when submitting the bug I was getting an
internal server error: No legal OS/Version set, so I chose 'other' as the OS
