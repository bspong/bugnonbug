DHTML menus appear underneath Flash plugin movies even when Macromedia's workaround (inserting a WMODE=TRANSPARENT parameter into EMBED and OBJECT areas) is inserted.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050225 Firefox/1.0.1

DHTML menus will appear underneath a Flash movie that has been embedded in a
page, regardless of z-indexing (because it is not a z-indexing issue, but a
combination of browser type and how that browser handles plugins).  Macromedia
has acknowledged this issue in the following URL: 
http://www.macromedia.com/cfusion/knowledgebase/index.cfm?id=tn_15523

However, this workaround does NOT work in Firefox.  It DOES work in Internet
Explorer, Netscape 6/7, Safari and others.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Insert a Flash movie into a page near a DHTML menu.
2. Set WMODE="TRANSPARENT" parameter for both the OBJECT and EMBED tags
3. Activate DHTML menu --it will appear underneath Flash movie instead of over
top, but ONLY in Firefox.



Expected Results:  
The WMODE parameter should have allowed the DHTML menu to appear over top the
flash movie.  If nothing else, Firefox should be designed to instead recognize
the OBJECT tag and not the deprecated EMBED tag, and then allow for the movie to
appear underneath DHTML menus using z-indexing or some other technique.
