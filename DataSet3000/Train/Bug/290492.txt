<form action='samepage.asp' method='post' name='foobar_form'>
<input type='image' src='somepath/image1.gif' name='e_foo' value='bar1'>
<input type='image' src='somepath/inage2.gif' name='x_foo' value='bar2'>
</form>
clicking on the first button will result in a postback with no data.  If the
method is 'get' it works.  The 2nd button causes a postback with data.  As far
as I can tell it's only names starting with 'e_'.  Any other name seems to be
fine.  Also does not depend on order (first last, more than two <input>s etc)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. create page with a method=post form
2. create <input type=image name='e_foo' value='bar'>
3. write some code to query and display form data
4. browse to the page
5. click on the image
6. observe lack of form data

Actual Results:  
in asp:
at the top of the page I have:
response.Write Request.Form.Count
Response.Write "<BR>"
for i = 1 to request.Form.Count		
	response.Write request.Form.Key(i)
	response.Write " = "
	response.Write Request.Form.Item(i)
	response.Write "<br>"
next

A '0' is displayed at the top of the page after clicking on the image button

Expected Results:  
If the image name is change to 'd_foo'
3
d_foo.x = 13
d_foo.y = 10
d_foo = bar

IE 6 and Opera 7.54 exhibit the same behavior.
If it's intentional, it's a pretty good job of boog compatability!
