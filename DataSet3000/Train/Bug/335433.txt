Cannot open the application. Always complains it is running and quit the other version
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X; en) AppleWebKit/418 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/417.9.2
Build Identifier: http://mozilla.org.  (Firefox 1.5.0.2)

Mac OS X 10.3.9, Dual 2GHz G5.

Downloaded the latest build and installed it for the first time on the box. Everytime I try to launch Firefox, I get a alert with 

"Close Firefox : Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart the system"

I checked with ps to see if I have any other process running, and I dont have any. I restarted the machine and launched it, I still get the same error. I removed all files and reinstalled and I get the same error message. I dont have any issues with any other apps on the same system to suggest an installation error with the OS itself.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Just launch the app.
Actual Results:  
Gets the alert panel with :

"Close Firefox : Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart the system"

Expected Results:  
Launch firefox.
