When a new tab is opened offscreen, there is supposed to be an indication that the action has occurred.  Bug 343251 introduced a behavior whereby the "all tabs" menu flashes three times to show this.  However, this flashing does not occur when you open a folder of bookmarks in tabs.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open enough tabs so that some overflow and are no longer visible.
2. Middle-click a bookmark so that the new tab opens 
3. Observe that the "all tabs" menu flashes.
4. Middle-click a folder so that all of the bookmarks in that folder open.  (You can also use the "Open All in Tabs" menu item.

Actual Results:  
The "all tabs" menu does not flash, even though the tabs have opened.

Expected Results:  
The "all tabs" menu should flash.

Although it was fixed in a different bug, Bug 342900 "open tab in background gives no indication that tab opened in overflow area" gives background as to why this indicator is important.

I do not know if the indicator should flash if some of the tabs open on-screen and others open off-screen.
