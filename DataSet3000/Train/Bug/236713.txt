Onclick javascript sizePopup() function crashes Firefox 0.8
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)

This problem can happen anywhere in the Ars Technica forums. But occurs rarely 
due to the situation required to cause the crash.

When logged into the forum, there is an option to "edit" your existing posts. 
The button/link launches a popup windows using Javascript. The first popup 
windows works fine. But if you attempt to click the same button/link or click a 
similar "edit" link, Firefox attempts to spawn another popup window, but 
crashes the application instead.

Here is an example of the HTML that causes the problem:
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="javascript:sizePopup
('reply','http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x?
a=em&s=50009562&f=67909965&m=844003222631&x_popup=Y','open');">

The code for the sizePopup() function can be found in this script:

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
To try this on the Ars Technica forum, you will have to have a user account and 
be logged in. ( http://episteme.arstechnica.com )
1. Create a post/reply in any forum.
2. Try to edit the post after you create it.
3. With the "edit" box still open, click the edit post link again.

Actual Results:  
Browser crashes

Expected Results:  
I am not sure what *should* happen, but IE6 just spawns a new window in place 
of the old one. Whether Firefox should do the same or spawn an entirely new 
window is debateable.

Not sure how to classify this. It does cause the browser to crash, but I don't 
run into the problem all that often. At some levels this is a normal to minor 
problem, but the fact that it crashes the browser while I am in the middle of a 
forum post (losing my whole post) makes it kind of major to me.
