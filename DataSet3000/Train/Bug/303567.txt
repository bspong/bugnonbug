In live bookmarks, entries not having a <link> element should use the <link> child of root
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; fr; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050517 Firefox/1.0.4 (Debian package 1.0.4-2)

In a live bookmark folder, when an entry of the RSS has no <link> (which is
permitted by the spec), Firefox should use the (mandatory) <link> at root level.

This would allow for a "default target" in RSS, which is especially useful when
several news are related to the same page (but not all, since bookmarks wouldn't
be meaningful then). For example, when a RSS feed lists all changes to a site,
some news refer to a specific page, but several aren't bound to a specific
location, and thus are to be linked with the home page.

Currently, entries lacking a <link> aren't displayed, and if none has a <link>
the message "the feed failed to load" is displayed.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Add "http://www.komite.net/pl/hidden/avec.rss" and
"http://www.komite.net/pl/hidden/sans.rss" to the live bookmarks.
The first has five entries, each with a <link>.
The second has those same five entries, but two of them lacking their <link>.

Go and try to open the corresponding folders.
Actual Results:  
The second live bookmark has only three visible items, and the first has five.

Expected Results:  
The second live bookmark should have had five visible items, two of them
pointing towards the default <link> in the RSS.

The current behaviour has been seen on Linux Mozilla 1.0.4, Windows (1.0.6), and
Linux (Deerpark alpha 2).
