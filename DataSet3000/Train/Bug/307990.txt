History and bookmarks window panes so tiny as to be useless

Mozilla and old firefoxen used to have a separate history window for ctrl-h 9and
bookmark window for ctrl-b).

New firefox disables this window, and puts the history in a tiny little pane on
the left hand side of the window, that can't be resized beyond about half a
screen width (similarly, ctrl-b now brings up a bookmarks pane that is similarly
too small and useless, but at least there is an alternative available from the
"bookmarks->manage bookmarks" menu item).

The history manager is very hard to use on even normal length urls and titles
(and useless on moderately long urls and titles; you also have no choice as to
whether you can display either the URL or the title -- either one can make sense
depending on context, and the old window allowed you to choose), and if you are
quickly going through your history list, then you lose valuable screen
real-estate and flexibility because the pane has to be the full height of the
firefox window, and has to be to the left of the firefox window.

Could these regressions (both bookmarks and history) please be looked into?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. ctrl b
2. ctrl h
Actual Results:  
1.  My bookmarks appeared in a pane about 1/3 of the window width across
2.  "  history list "          "           "           "             "

Expected Results:  
1.  My bookmarks appeared in a window that can be resized as much as my heart
desires.  In fact, the size it came up as was the size it was when I last used
the bookmarks list, and so is probably already at the size I want!  And, my
window manager can do its window managingness on it too!
2.  "  history list "          "           "           "             "
