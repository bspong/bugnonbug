Firefox is unable to successfully download .EXE files

I try to download an executable file with firefox and it is either corrupted or displays a message to the effect tha Firefox can't find the .part file, and is unable to save.

I have tried deleting the profile, doing a full reinstall of the operating system, and still run into the problem. I also tried disabling my firewall and virus protection (Sygate and Avast) and have still ran into the problem. The only time it seems to handle a .exe file correctly is immediately after it is first installed, then it goes right back to hell again.

I have only seen this bug show up with 1.501 Firefox...
I also have seen the bug show up with a couple of other people as well.
