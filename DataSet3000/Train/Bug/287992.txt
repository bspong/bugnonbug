Browser crashes consistently (and very quickly) as page loads.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

On the page at http://news.ninemsn.com.au/ this version of Firefox crashes
consistently as the page loads. By 'crash' I mean that the page starts to
render, images start to appear, but before the page can form completely the
program very quickly closes and disappears from view. Pages already displaying
in other tabs were plain text and had been static for some time, so there is no
doubt that the page at http://news.ninemsn.com.au/ is the offender.

I have never seen this before, and this page is one I have frequently visited
before loading this latest version of Firefox.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Visit http://news.ninemsn.com.au/
2. Watch as the page loads. Don't blink or you will miss the very quick crash
3. Scratch your head in wonder, as I did.

Actual Results:  
I was left looking at my desktop. No error message, no offer to report the error
to microsoft or mozilla, no nothing. When I restarted the browser the page was
in the browser history, but there were no signs of anything out of the ordinary.
It simply looked like a new session.

Expected Results:  
I was expecting Firefox to simply load up the page.

I want to be as helpful as I can, but can't offer anything more than the above.
It is a simple matter of trying to display the page, then losing the entire browser.
