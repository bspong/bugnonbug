[cookies?] Cannot login to sourceforge over SSL connection through a proxy
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4a) Gecko/20030422 Firebird Browser/0.6

Working from behind a squid proxy, I cannot login to sourceforge over SSL. This
isn't a problem with a few banking / shopping sites over SSL, seems specific to
sourceforge. Possibly a cookie problem.

Sometimes I may be able to successfully login, but trying to do anything useful
like submitting a tracker asks me to login again. Following any link forgets my
login status.

Works correctly in Mozilla,
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030422

Found another old bug for Mozilla which seems similar: bug 202891

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the sourceforge login page
2. Try to login and use different settings for options like "remember me", "stay
in SSL" etc
3. Try to submit a tracker or comment

Actual Results:  
Sourceforge forgets my login and asks me to authenticate again. On
authentication, it forgets what I wanted to do in the first place.

Expected Results:  
I should have been able to finish submitting the tracker, without authenticating
again.
