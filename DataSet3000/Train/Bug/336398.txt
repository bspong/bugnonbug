When using Firefox to work in WebCT the vertical WebCT iconbar on the left hand side in a WebCT course window does does not expand fully, ie only the icons are shown, but not the text, which explains what the icons mean. Firefox 0.7 worked OK, but since I upgraded to 1.5 the side bar has not expanded fully. At that time I used Mac OS 10.3.x, but now I am using 10.4.6.
