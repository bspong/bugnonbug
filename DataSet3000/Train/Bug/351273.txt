When bookmarking a page, the "Name" field is highlighted by default.  Clicking on the "Create In" down arrow, the focus changes to another element.  The text in the "Name" field now appears to be no longer highlighted.  When going back to the "Name" field, clicking on the right of the text and dragging the text to highlight it, the highlight is lost and you have to try again (or click once, then click+drag).

It seems as though the highlight is left behind even though it is not visible which is why when you click and drag to make that field active again with the highlight, the highlight you're trying to do breaks beacause it was already actually there.  Perhaps reproducing the bug will highlight the issue...

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load a page.  Make sure the title is relatively short as this will give the best example.
2. Click "Bookmarks"
3. Click "Bookmark This Page"
3a. (Note, the Name field is highlighted)
4. Click the down arrow next to "Create In" to expand the categories
4a. (Note, the Name field now appears unhighlighted)
5. Select your category
6. Hover your mouse somewhere in the white section of the field after the page title text.
7. Click once and hold.  
8. Drag your cursor to the left, highlighting the text.
9. Release the click
Actual Results:  
Notice the text was highlighted OK as you dragged and then the highlight was lost and you have to do it again.

Expected Results:  
The text should be highlighted on the first click and drag or the element should not have held the highlight without a visual indicator that that highlight was there.
