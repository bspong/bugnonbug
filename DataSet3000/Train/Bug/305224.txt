In two different pages(www.thehallcenter.com,
www.hestonliebowitz.com/clients/btlj)there are very thin horizontal lines that
protude from block-displayed relatively-positioned <a> elements. The lines
protrude from the right-most edge of the <a> elements and terminate at the
let-most edge of the browser window (portal). They appear to be the color of the
page's background-color CSS property. If I roll over the <a> element the lines
temporarilly disappear, even if there is no hover effect on the element.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the above-mentioned sites using the latest version of FireFox for
Windows. (This bug does not appear in the Mac OS version).
2. Roll over the mast-head graphic to see lines disappear and reappear.

Actual Results:  
Exactly what I described.

Expected Results:  
FireFox should display the elements without any thin horizontal lines.

Default theme; fresh installation.
