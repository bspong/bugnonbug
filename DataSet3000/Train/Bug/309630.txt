Several tabs on the Page Info window contain text fields drawn on the window in
two columns, with headings on the left and values on the right. An example is
the General tab that has "Address:" and "http://www.mozilla.org" near the top.
The values on the right are not properly lined up with the labels on the left.
The values are several pixels too low. The baselines on both sides should be the
same but aren't. It looks messy and makes it hard to read.

Note that this doesn't happen with the text that appears in tables on the Page
Info window, just the other areas where the text field is placed directly on the
window.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open a web page
2.Select the Page Info menu item
3.Look at the various tabs to see the text fields aren't aligned vertically

Actual Results:  
The baselines of the text fields on the right are several pixels below the
corresponding labes on the right.

Expected Results:  
The baselines of the label and value text fields should be aligned vertically.
