The cursor moves back one position while typing in any textbox and in any webpage when connected to VPN.

I get connected to a clientless VPN using Firefox. 
After getting connected to the VPN if i open any browser window and
type in any of the text boxes after a random number of characters the cursor shifts back by one character and therefore the words being typed get messed up. For example if I am typing " This is a test message " it would be shown something like this " Tish is a tste messaeg " - In the above sentence the cursor went back after typing "Th" - "T|h" - "Tish". 
Similarly the cursor shifted one position back at the 'e' in the word 'test' and at 'g' in the word 'message'. 
If someone is working with VPN please could you fix this and help me from getting annoyed. 
Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.connect to clientless VPN using firefox
2.open browser tabs.
3.type into any textbox on any webpage

Actual Results:  
While typing the cursor will shift its position one step back and if you dont see while you are typing all the words get messed up even if you try to delete and type the occurence of the cursor shifting its position increases. But if i type the information in Notepad and copy/paste it in to the textbox or textarea it lets me do it.

Expected Results:  
It should not move the cursor because it is completely annoying. 

I dont have any clue why it is doing this since i dont know how VPN works though i use it. It could be something serious too. Thanks.
