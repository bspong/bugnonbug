crash if selection in textarea is attempted after form submit

I was working in phpmyadmin entering a SQL query in a textarea box and submitted
the form, when at the last minute I decided it might be wise to copy my query to
the clipboard incase I had made some syntax error. The moment I attempted to
select text in the text area I got an error popup saying that the memory is
inaccessable and asking if I want to close or debug Firefox 0.8

I didn't realize what caused the error until after reopening firefox and
re-entering my SQL query at which point I again for got to copy it to clipboard
before submitting. the moment I attempted to select text from the textarea I got
the same error.

I'm not saying I should be able to do what I attempted (although it usauly works
in Incredible Exploitation 6) but just trying shouldn't crash all 3 my firefox
sessions (with about 15 tabs open each)

Bugs asside, Thanks for a great product! :-)
