Deer Park needs to run once after install (1.0.4 didn't)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050524 Firefox/1.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050524 Firefox/1.0+

When installing from a nightly tarball, if firefox 1.1 isn't allowed to run
once with write permissions to the install directory, much unhappiness results:
The menubar doesn't display, the menu headings get reduced to transparent chunk
of Times-Roman text in the upper left corner of the screen, the frame and status
bar don't
display, the page content sometimes flashes but is mostly transparent to the
desktop background image.

1.0.4 did not have this behavior.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
knoppix@ttyp1[knoppix]$ rm -fr ~/.mozilla
knoppix@ttyp1[knoppix]$ wget
'http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-trunk/firefox-1.0+.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz'
knoppix@ttyp1[knoppix]$ tar xzf firefox-1.0+.en-US.linux-i686.tar.gz
knoppix@ttyp1[knoppix]$ chmod -R a-w firefox
knoppix@ttyp1[knoppix]$ firefox/firefox
*** loading the extensions datasource
*** Item Installed via directory addition to Install Location: app-global
ItemID: {972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}, attempting to register...
*** Item Installed/Upgraded at Install Location: app-global Item ID:
{972ce4c6-7e08-4474-a285-3208198ce6fd}, attempting to register...
*** loading the extensions datasource
*** ... success, item is compatible
Actual Results:  
Firefox is entirely unusable, with display problems described above.  The only
way to quit is CTRL-C.

Expected Results:  
Following the steps above, but with the 1.0.4 tarball (not installer tarball)
doesn't have the display problems.  Firefox starts and displays normally.

Restoring write access makes everything happy again.

knoppix@ttyp1[knoppix]$ chmod -R u+w firefox/
knoppix@ttyp1[knoppix]$ firefox/firefox

The other workaround is to use the "*installer.tar.gz" tarball, which forces
firefox to run once after the install, after which write access may be
taken away and there are no problems.
