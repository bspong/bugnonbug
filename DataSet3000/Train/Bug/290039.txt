Displays page randomly in different ways - source is always the same

The table width of the text below the top graphics is displayed randomly in two
different ways: refresh page or press several times on "home" to see the
problem. The way with the smaller width is the right one. It seems to be a
randomly generated bug. Also if the width is displayed correctly, the layer
navigation is positioned in a wrong way on the x-axis, on a right way if the
text width is wrong. Opera and Internet Explorer have no problems here. I cannot
find any mistake within the source.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open given Url
2. Maybe resize window so the content fits in exactly
3. Press several times on the "Home" link and watch the width of the text

Actual Results:  
The width of the text area is displayed randomly too large or every second url
call. Also if text width is right the layer navigation is wrong positioned on
the x-axis (compare to the wrong-width-case).

Expected Results:  
The width of the text should be displayed everytime in the smaller way, the
layer navigation should displayed like in the case if the text width is too
large. See Opera and Internet Explorer for correct displaying. Maybe its because
the layers position is relative?
