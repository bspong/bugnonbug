Wrong glyphs (rendered characters) for certain character codes

There are a number of characters codes that are rendered with the wrong glyph. Most of those that I have 
noticed are correct when "view > page source" is employed and the page is coded in UTF-8. The same 
errors happen when character entity references are used but then view source is unhelpful. One cluster of 
errors is at 170 thru 219 decimal. (character entity references &#170; thru &#219; or &#xaa; ...)
Most of the glyphs in this range are wrong.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to page http://cap-lore.com/cgibin/q.cgi?xx=1
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
I saw an upper case I with a bar above it instead of a plus or minus sign.
At least 10 other characters on this page are wrong as well.
(click on "utf-8" link too)
Attached is a screen shot of Firefox and Safari.
The Safari (2.0) renderings agree with the glyphs used by view-source in Firefox.


Expected Results:  
Show a plus or minus sign for code 177. 

See URLs below for screen shots of Firefox 1.0.6 and Safari 2.0 and Deerpark alpha 2.
The Safari (2.0) renderings agree with the glyphs used by view-source in Firefox.
Mozilla 1.7.11 is good.
