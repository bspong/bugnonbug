<link rel="stylesheet" href="/chile/chile2.css" type="text/css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles2.css" type="text/css">

only /styles2.css is rendered.

They both have been rendering fine in firefox until today.  I installed firefox
on another pc running win xp and everything looks correct.  So, I'm not sure if
something was turned off of my browser without my knowledge.  Since I haven't
touched firefox's options on my computer I don't think that is the issue.

I changed the href of /chile/chile2.css to
http://www.adventure-life.com/chile/chile2.css and it renders correctly.

It should rendered when called either way.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to www.adventure-life.com/chile/chile.php
Actual Results:  
The page is only partially structured with css

Expected Results:  
all styles from both stylesheets should be rendered

I tested this on another machine and it rendered correctly... so I don't know if
you will get the same results.
