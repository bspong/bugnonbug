Forms will not submit due to password file corruption

When I try to login to some websites I find that clicking the submit button does
not work.  I currently can't login to Paypal at all in Firefox and I have no
idea why.  This seems to have broken in the last week or so.

I have experianced this problem intermittently for the past several months on
various websites, including Best Buy's search (though that seems to have
corrected itself somehow, maybe they changed the code on the page).

There does not appear to be any javascript involved in the Paypal logon form (I
only checked quickly), and when I click the button absolutely nothing happens. 
There is no indication that the page was submitted and no length of time waiting
makes any difference.

My JS console does not show any errors and I don't have any other examples of
malfunctioning forms right now.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to https://www.paypal.com
2. Enter an email address and password (invalid or valid, doesn't really matter)
3. Click submit

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens

Expected Results:  
Form should submit (as in Internet Explorer) and you should be forwarded to your
account (or a relogon page if you typed your password wrong).
