Popup window disables child popups/windows, even when popup blocker and all extensions are disabled.

Login to gmail.com, click Contacts, then Import Contacts (allow popup for
gmail.google.com URL), then Learn More.  The Import Contacts popup window should
open a new window, but Firefox disables it, although the target URL is allowed.  
Even with Firefox's popup stopper and all extensions disabled, Firefox disables
the popup window (yellow bar on top says so).  Using direct URL for the target
link works fine.  No such problems in IE6.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Login to gmail.com
2. Select "Import Contacts" (allow popup for gmail.google.com URL)
3. Select "Learn More" (notice althought it's same URL, Firefox won't allow
further new windows/popups).
4. Click on the upper yellow popup info bar and select "Allow <URL>" just causes
another duplicate "Allow <URL>" entry.

Actual Results:  
Firefox disables the popup window (yellow bar on top says so).

Expected Results:  
Allow new windows/popup or open in existing browser session.
