*after* a file has been uploaded using firefox to a remote server, firefox
crashes . The feedback agent offers to send the report but that doesn't work
(but thats another bug completely).
For example, if I use flickr.com to upload an image file, or geocaching.com to
upload an image file or try to upload a zip file to microsoft's bug reporting
website, or upload an image to my movable type website the page that gets
displayed after the file has been uploaded gets displayed, but then the browser
crashes.  The file has been uploaded successfully as it is available for use and
the next web page is displayed for a second before the browser crashes.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.upload a file to flickr.com
2.file gets sent
3.thanks page get displayed
4.browser crashes.

Actual Results:  
talkback tries to send a bug report but can't (haven't been able to send
bugcrashes since the last successful one at 6/2/2005)

Expected Results:  
Keep running.
