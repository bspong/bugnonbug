bookmarklets can't be loaded in the sidebar

I made a javascript bookmarklet couple of time ago, which uses the getSelection
method to get selected text from the browser, as input. Than, I've been asked to
port that code to a sidebar. For the portability and simplifity, I wish to make
it as a regular sidebar, rather than extension. 

I replaced the "window.open" by "location.href=", which works quite well in the
browser window, but it can't work in the sidebar, as the browser load the
javascript url from seperated browser environment.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Look at the attached testcase. The first two codes works well, but the third
work only in the browser, not on the sidebar.


Expected Results:  
javascript: URLs should load on the browser, but with target=-moz-sidebar.
(There is no -moz-sidebar property currently, but maybe this is required to
reslove this bug.)

Also note that Internet Explorer have target=_search, which can be used there
for the built-in toolbar, so we can make a cross-browser solution with
implementing target=_search for Mozilla.
