hangs hard when pulling down several menus - _always_ when moving from open bookmarks menu to go menu

After I have been browsing for a period of time (not more than ten minutes) I
found that Firefox would suddenly becume completely unresponsive.

I detrmined that this would happen when I had been opening several menus in
succession.

I discovered that I could reproduce this problem consistently.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox.
2. Open the Bookmarks menu (mine is very long).
3. While the Bookmarks menu is open, move the pointer to the Go menu.
4. Wait...(program is unresponsive)

Actual Results:  
Pointer turns into the spinning pinwheel/beach ball. Program is unresponsive
(for more than five minutes). Must Force Quit.

Force Quit is difficult because entire system is unresponsive for up to two
minutes after the event.

Expected Results:  
Close the Bookmarks menu and open the Go menu...as Netscape Navigator and
Mozilla both do with no hesitation.

450MHz dual G4 ("gigabit ethernet"), System 10.3.7, New Firefox from nightly
build link, default theme.

The profile information is what was imported from Netscape. Holding down the
Option key while launching doen't bring up the profile manager as was
advertized. I know no other way to access this function.

My wife complains about Netscape. Safari looked like a likely alternative, but
it lacks a "back" item in the contextual menu, which my wife requires. Firefox
looked like the answer, but this constant hanging is a show-stopper.
