clicking a javascript:popupWindow link shows a dotted frame around the linked entities

When clicking the "Click to enlarge" text below the product's image an ugly,
dotted frame appears around image and text. This happens in FF but not IE. The
frame disappeares when I click anywhere else in the page so it seems to be some
kind of focus highlight.
Strangly this does not happen when I click the image itself but does happen when
I click the invisible spacer (done with an invisible GIF; sorry for that, I did
not yet find the time to remove all the spacers and replace them by CSS margins).

If this is not a bug but a feature please let me know how to switch it off in
the page's source because it looks rather bad.

The same happens with all product images in our shop. I looked at other stores
using the same shop system (osCommerce MS 2.2) as I do and there this happens, too.



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
See details :)

1. Open http://www.nunon.de/product_info.php/products_id/40 (or any other
product page)
2. Click the 'click to enlarge' button (in german there is a much longer text
but the same thing happens). Click the text, not the image!
3. Close the opened window or switch the frame back to the original page. Don't
click the page.

Actual Results:  
The image, the spacer GIF and the text are framed with a grey, dotted frame
until I click somewhere on the page.

Expected Results:  
Nothing. Just open the window and be done. :)
