Uninstalling deleted non-Firefox folders (after installing to C:\Program Files\)

The new Firefox Windows installer - for a custom install location - put the
Firefox files into the top level of my d:\Program Files directory.  I did not
want this, so I uninstalled it from the Windows Control Panel Uninstall applet.
 It did not uninstall so I logged in as adminstrator and then ran the uninstall.

THe unintall took a long time with lots of disk activity.  At the end of it,
about 2/3 of the folders in Program Files had been deleted.  I lost dozens of
applications, many of them requiring serial numbers to reinstall, and all the
associated configuration, etc.  Included in the carnage were two other Mozilla
installations and my Thunderbird 0.4 installation, and Winzip which of course I
needed to unzip replacements.

This is DANGEROUS.

Expected Results:  
1) The installer should have made clear where the files were going to be put.  I
had navigated to d:\Program Files, then typed in Mozilla Firefox 0.8, but the
last step of the path was not reflected in the edit box.  However, some
installers add the last step anyway.  So the destination was not clear, and the
installer had not folled my commands.

2) The uninstaller should NEVER touch ANY files it has not installed.
