Copy and Paste - Bug in Firefox

(Different versions, different OS)

See also: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=220900


Situation:

Copy and paste between different tabs or windows does not work at all (100%).
This problem does not affect other applications, just firefox. It seems that the
clipboard is deleted (for security reasons?!) when swiching from one tab/window
to another, but not when working with external programs...

System:

WinXP_Pro_SP1, Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12)
Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (happened in the earlier version I had installed
2), Extensions: DOM Inspector, Wikipedia, Greasemonkey, CopyPlainText (tried is
as a solution for the copy and paste problem), RoboForm;

Unsuccessful tries:

1.Reinstalling after cleaning all data from previous installs
2.New User Profile
3.Open Clipboard
4.CopyPlainText (tried is as a solution for the copy and paste problem)
5.Work only with Firefox Windows, not with tabs
6.Upgrade to Firefox 1.0.7
7.Playing around with security settings

----

Suggested workarounds thus far (comment #142):
 
1. Open the current page in a new window (I usually just open any page in a new
window and check copy/paste there).

2. Start -> Run -> clipbrd.exe (Clipboard Viewer) 

3.Copy from one tab, paste in note/text/any-pad, swich to the new pad, copy from
anypad and paste it. This only works if I swich windows before the second copy
and paste, otherwise the clipboard is blank again 

4.Work with one instance of firefox and do all copy and paste operations from or
2 opera...

5.Drag and Drop sometimes works too...

6.Minimizing Windows and maximizing does work sometimes...

7. Copying a large amount of text in the clipboard does the trick too, sometimes...

----

Solution:


Best solution would be an extension, which works like the clipboard and is
integrated in the right click pull down, as this would give developers enough
time to solve the problem while keeping firefox attractive for users. Added
functionality could include an auto-archive function, a litte database - main
criteria should be fast and ressource friendly running...  


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox and create two tabs/windows
2.Copy and paste from one window
3.Change windows/tabs
4.Try to paste which does not work, because the moment you swiched tabs the
clipboard content is erased...

Actual Results:  
Paste does not work, because the moment you swich tabs the clipboard content is
erased...

Expected Results:  
Paste it baby, please...
