I had to cut (copy) and paste info from one email to another. there was no copy or   paste option opening when I right clicked on my mouse.  This problems also happened when I would copy info from a translation site and had to past it in an email.  Paste option did not appear when I was in email window when I right clicked mouse.  Info was transportable to other windows.  This just started happening in the past 2 weeks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.open email and hit reply.  went to translation site and copied text.
2.went to paste translation in reply email.  right clicked mouse to get options.
3.no paste option would appear

Actual Results:  
same as above

Expected Results:  
I closed and reopened all windows and tried this a few times with same results.  

Softwear in the past would open standard MS word cut, copy, paste mini window with all normal choices.
