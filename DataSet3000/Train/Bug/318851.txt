Dynamic form fields are not being submitted
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)

Background:

I have created a grid-like entry form that is generated on-the-fly by my JavaScript. As far as correctness of generated content is concerned I have tested it without dynamic generation and it is valid.

Problems occurs when I try to submit a form made up of those dynamically generated fields. Form is submitted but field values are NOT being transfered to the server, not via POST nor GET methods. This is not happening if fields are defined statically and render together with the document.

Same code works fine in IE 5.5+

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a form with id attribute
2. Using JavaScript create new input element using document.createElement("input") with all required attributes (i.e. name, type, value, etc.).
3. Append created field into form element using formId.appendChild(inputElement).
4. Submit form.
5. Check for existance of the posted data in the server code,

Actual Results:  
When trying to read posted field values from Request(asp, jsp, php), field is not present and value can not be retrieved.

Expected Results:  
Field value should be posted to the server.

It looks like browser does not register any dynamically created input fields as part of the form, and thus does not submit them.
