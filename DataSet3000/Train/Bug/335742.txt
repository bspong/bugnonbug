Firefox raises the window to the foreground when the mouse cursor is moved in a Flash square on a page.  I do not click in the window in the background.

I use WindowMaker on Gentoo Linux.
WindowMaker is configured with:
1) focus follow mouse
2) click to raise
I do not click and the windows get raise.

Note that I don't even have the Flash plugin installed.  I does it when I go on white square that are supposed to have Flash animation.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open 2 Firefox Window A and B.  Choose B such that it has a Flash animation or Flash white square (if you don't have Flash installed).
2. Have window B behind window A with some overlap.
3. Move the mouse to the Flash square on window B.
4. Window B will be brought to the foreground (in front of window A) even if no click is performed.
Actual Results:  

Background window gets move to the foreground without clicking.

Expected Results:  

Background window should stay in the background unless I click on it.
