Contact Mozilla and complain. I'm serious. Mozilla introduced a bug in 
OSX Panther versions of Firefox. Jaguar is fine. Looks like they 
attempted to take a rendering shortcut to make their browser look faster 
than it really is (which is quite slow in most cases). Camino, which 
uses the same engine, but apparently untweaked for false speed, is fine. 
Netscape 7 and 8 are fine. Mozilla is fine. It's just Firefox and it's 
only on Mac OSX Panther.

The bug is not sufficiently bad to make the menu unusable, it just 
introduces transitory bleedthrough on parent levels. The active level is 
fine and the parent goes back to normal once the menu is closed.

Nothing we can do about it and likely Mozilla will deny it's at fault 
unless a CSS or standards "guru" brings it up.

2.Go to F
3.Go to Fillers and look at submenu

Actual Results:  
"Fillers" submenu becomes transparent and text from underneath shows through
