Image preview in "favicon spot" of tabs sometimes disappears
Trunk nightly 2006-05-12-12 (but it's been happening for a while), Gentoo Linux, Gnome

When you have an image open in a tab instead of a web page, a small preview of that image is displayed in the tab where a favicon normally would. That preview sometimes disappears.

I haven't found a specific reason this happens, however it seems easily reproducible when it does happen, and I can change stuff and then go back and it will happen again.

It seems dependent on a number of things:
Image: it only happens with certain images (perhaps image size matters?)
Window size: only happens at certain window widths, or perhaps certain
     combinations of window width + other stuff
Number of tabs
Position of affected tabs; moving them will lose the bug, moving them back
     will make it happen again.

If you hover over the affected tab, the preview comes back. If you change tabs elsewhere, it will disappear again.

Sometimes the image is not completely gone, but instead shifted to the left.

One case it happens with for me is http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/design_pics/topnav_normal.jpg in the 9th tab out of 12 in a maximized window on a 1600x1200 monitor.
