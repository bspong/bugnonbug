I was using the beta version of firefox 1.0 and was great, so since the final
version is out, I decide the installed. so after this, while I'm seeing some
pages that containg a flash and elaborated javascripts, the web content start
jumping, and is imposible to read anything. ir really no matter if I close the
windows and I open a new one, or either close the tab in what the jumping
started. I have to close by the task manager all the process tree for FIREFOX.EXE.

I described above, not in a exact secuence of events or in one we page. it
happends on www.clarin.com ,  www.ebay.com , kawiforums.com , and sometimes, in
those pages, nothing happend. 
Actual Results:  
close FIREFOX.exe in task manager all the process tree and start again firefox,
and this is not guarantee to the web content start doing it again. is more
likely delaying the process of jumping.
