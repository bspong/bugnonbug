Get rid of redundant "Keep until" options

There are a number of "Keep until" options that are redundant with the Clear Private Data tool.  The Clear Private Data tool clears these pieces of data when Firefox exits, if configured to do so; we do not need another place to do the same.

Here are the examples I've noticed:

 - Privacy:Download History
   Remove files from the Download Manager:  Upon successful download
                                            When Firefox exits
                                            Manually

   This entire dropdown can be eliminated.  We know that the CPD tool will remove the files "when Firefox exits" if configured to do so, and can remove this option.  The resulting options can then be reduced by making "Manually" an implied negative case of a checkbox:

   [X] Remove files from the Download Manager upon successful download

 - Privacy:Cookies
   Keep cookies:  Until they expire
                  Until I close Firefox
                  Ask me every time

   The "Until I close Firefox" option is again in the CPD tool.  I do not understand the use for "Ask me every time" here; that would quickly get annoying.  The CPD tool can be set to ask every time for you; and will allow you to check and uncheck cookies, history, downloads, etc.  That can replace this option.

   This entire dropdown should be eliminated.
