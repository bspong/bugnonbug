Firefox will not load all the time but will not clear it's self from memory so
you have to do a ctrl+alt+delete then clear Firefox from memory and start it
again I have to do this about 50 to 75 times a day as I work on my web page all
day long.  Making changes and use Firefox to test my pages I load it through my
text editor TextPad v4.7.3 best HTML editor I have ever seen I call up Firefox
through TextPad as it just passes the HTML page to Firefox.  I know this is not
a big problem but it does happen too much I think and should be looked into, I
talked to the Author of TextPad and he told me that TextPad only pass
information to the default web browser and nothing else.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.First you would need text/html editor that passes html to Firefox
2.Edit some html pages and it will happen - Firefox will not load
3.Then you will have to hit ctrl+alt=delete to stop process and take out Firefox
and restart Firefox

Actual Results:  
Firefox works fine till it fails to dump memory and you have to do the
ctrl+alt=delete and STOP or take Firefox out of memory

Expected Results:  
After loading and when it is STOPed it should it NOT dump it's memory back to
system ?  I would think so ?
