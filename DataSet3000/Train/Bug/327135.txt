Firefox does not seem to like HTTP/1.1 302 redirects that involve redirecting from a http://www.linkedin.com to https://www.linkedin.com. I didn't have time to test this, but its possible that firefox may not like http://www.whatever.com -> http://www.whatever.com:XX where XX is some port number. 

Here is the response from a telnet query to the server. The http -> https redirects work fine in other browsers like Safari on MacOS X.

HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1
Date: Tue, 14 Feb 2006 14:14:57 GMT
Content-length: 0
Content-type: text/html
Location: https://www.linkedin.com/
Connection: close


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. visit http://www.linkedin.com
2. it just sits there
3. visit https://www.linkedin.com (works ok)

Actual Results:  
To reproduce this I setup under apache a virtual server with a 302 redirect page to direct content to https for the same IP/hostname. The browser just sits there. If you change the redirect so its not https: and just points elsewhere it works fine. In my test both the http and https services are on the same IP.

Expected Results:  
The software should have redirected to the appropriate page. 

workaround:

 If you visit http://www.linkedin.com it doesn't work. But if you visit https://www.linkedin.com first, then visit http://www.linkedin.com it seems to work fine.
