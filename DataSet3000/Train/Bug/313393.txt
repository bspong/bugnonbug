Since upgrading to Firefox 1.5 beta 2, after extensive usage of the browser with
multiple tabs (15+) for a period of time (several days) some features stop working..

HTTP Authentication: this is ignored, resulting in no 'login' box being
presented. Acts as if authentication was cancelled or failed.

Live Bookmarks: Show "Live bookmark failed to load.", and refuse to reload
regardless of actions taken. Only solution without restarting browser is to
delete and re-add them.

New windows/some JS events: JS events which produce new windows fail to work,
nothing happens at all. These are events/links which work fine after a browser
restart / normally.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Use multiple tabs (15+) for several days work.
2. Try authenticating to a HTTP auth site, no dialog is shown.
3.

Actual Results:  
As described in the details

Expected Results:  
The software should operate normally (i.e. none of the described symptoms should
occur).

This is specficially only since upgrading to 1.5 beta 2 (1.5 beta 1 was fine, as
was the 1.0 tree).
