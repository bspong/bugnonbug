Often I need to copy some part of an URL for naming a downloded picture to store it.

1) After starting Firefox/1.0.4 FIRSTTIME NEW it is not poosible, to place the
cursor in the URL-field containing a picture by movement throu left or right
arrow-keys. Only using the touchpad or the mouse will work.

2) After marking the desired URL-part and using right mouse menue do launch the
copy of the picture by naming the file with part of URL, nothing happened, the
clippboard buffer is still the old one. Only after placing the cursor again and
using the copy-command, it will work.

This effect is pecific to URL with pictures and will disappear after the first
successful copy action. Also the malfunction of arrow-keys will then disappear.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. start FF first time and search an picture-URL
2. place cursor on some part of the name in URL-field with arrow-keys (wont
work, use mouse instead of keys)
3. mark that part with mouse
4. make copy of the picture in the URL-page using right mouse menue
5. try to build an filename with the copied part of URL-name to store picture

Actual Results:  
allways the same

Expected Results:  
place the copied part in buffer (clippboard) and perform correct function using
arrow-keys
