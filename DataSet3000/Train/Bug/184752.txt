After I dragged from Customize menu of toolbar the button Bookmark all problems
started. Then there is impossible open Manage Bookmarks feature from Bookmarks
menu or hit onto toolbar located bookmark button.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Right mouse click on toolbar and choose "Customize"
2.Drag and drop the bookmark button onto second toolbar's row (where default are
URL's "Phoenix Help" and "phoenix Discussions"). Dragg also buttons like: new
window; new tab; download prorgess button; history button and print button.
3.Close the toolbars customization windows
4.Try to hit on Bookmarks button to see them left-sided navigation bar. Phoenix
crashes after few seconds (can be seen in Close Program menu.)
Actual Results:  
Phoenix crashed totally. Only end process helped...

Expected Results:  
open bookmarks on left side :-)

After that adding there were no difference - trying to open bookmarks through
menu Bookmarks>Manage Bookmarks or just tried to hit onto Bookmark's button -
always Phoenix crashing... And I cannot now also open the Customize menu...
