freezes up on large slashdot threads if I have moderator points (too many popup menus?)

If you have moderator points, then slashdot gives you a pull-down menu below
each comment.  On a large thread (I think with >>500 comments) that means many
menus.  I think Firefox can't cope with them.  The cursor goes to a
cursor-plus-black-and-white-spinning-disc and if you do a "Quit Firefox" the
window disappears but the application menu bar remains and has to be killed in a
more violent manner.

The only extension I have is NukeEverything.





Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Wait until you get slashdot moderator points
2. Go to a popular topic
3. Firefox is in trouble already.
4. quit and kill firefox
5. Go to slashdot again
6. Use up all moderator points on a less popular topic (<100 comments)
7. Go back to popular thread, Firefox behaves fine.


I've only done this once (Moderator points don't come very often).
Actual Results:  
see above.

Expected Results:  
I suppose Firefox should be able to handle a few thousand pop-up menus.

I couldn't find any crash logs, and Talkback didn't come up.

Extensions: just NukeEverything.
