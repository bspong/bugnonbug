In the page http://www.yaravandenbroek.nl/lennert.html we make use of a
css-style sheet. The underlining of the 2 links on hover doesn't work the right
way. When the links are hovered they should be underlined. In reality only the
first link is partially underlined when hovering over it. When you leave the
link at the top, the line remains.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
We tried to reduce the error page to a minimum. The minimal conditions to
reproduce the problem are:
* there are two links within one p-tag with a br-tag between them
* above the links there is a section for which the stylesheet defines the use of
the fonts 'courier' or 'courier new' at a size of 28pt.
* This all is surrounded by a div-tag
* The stylesheet defines that the links are only underlined when hovered

Actual Results:  
the links are displayed incorrectly when you hover over them. The second link
will not be underlined at all, the first only gets underlined over the length of
the second one. When the first link is left over the top, the line remains visible.

Expected Results:  
When one of the links is hovered i should be entirely underlined. The line
should dissapear when the link is left.

The error occurs on serveral different windows machines. Other browsers don't
display the error.
