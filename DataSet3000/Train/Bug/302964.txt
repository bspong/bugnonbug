bottom button on Web page is horizontally misaligned with other buttons in page
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i586; en-US; rv:1.7.9) Gecko/20050711 Firefox/1.0.5 SUSE/1.0.5-3

I believe that the problem is with Gecko, and not Firefox itself, as the exact
same effect was also observed from within several versions of the Mozilla Suite.

The problem is as follows:

I produced a simple HTML page to be used as the menu page within an HTML
frameset. This page consists of my cartoon caricature logo together with several
PNG buttons aligned horizontally using the <DIV ALIGN="CENTER"></DIV> tag. 

Whenever I display this page either by itself or within an HTML frameset using
any Mozilla browser, I notice the bottom button is rendered slightly to the
right of the buttons directly above it. This problem persists even when I delete
the bottom button from the HTML code; although there would be one less button,
the bottom button would still be out of alignment with the others by the exact
same amount.

I also removed the javascript code within this page to convert the rollover
buttons into simple static buttons, but the problem still persisted.

However I found that this page was rendered with its buttons in perfect
alignment within Konqueror (Linux), Netscape (Windows 98), and IE even with the
rollover buttons enabled.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
View the page in any Mozilla browser.
Actual Results:  
Same as above.

Expected Results:  
The rendering engine (i.e., Gecko) should have horizontally centered all
graphical images on the page. See attachments.
