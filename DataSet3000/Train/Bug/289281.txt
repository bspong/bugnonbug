On loading  http://www.livingvillage.com/concept  the sequentially loading
images should replace each other without changing the page layout, as they do in
Micro$oft IE 6.0.2600).

Bug found in Ff 1.0.2 (untested on other releases, platforms etc, except in IE
for comparison)

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Load  http://www.livingvillage.com/concept  and watch as listed in Actual
Results, below

2. Compare with other browsers - I tried M$ IE6 and page displayed as must have
been intended
Actual Results:  
In Ff:
  Watch panel to right of main image move down with each subsequently displayed
image (sequence is automatic).  Note page length increase with each step.  Blank
space introduced between main image and image number links below it.

  Watch panel eventually return to top, shortening the page again to correct
length, when displaying image number 1. Or don't bother waiting for it to cycle
and skip to this point by choosing the link for Image 1

Expected Results:  
As IE did, Ff should have:
 * kept page size the same length throughout cycle
 * not introduced blank space onto page

Not my website, so I am not responsible for code, nor able to know if source
code was at fault.
