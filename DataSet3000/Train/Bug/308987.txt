Firefox v1.5 beta on W2K SP4 - leaves multiple processes running after close, caused hardware problems
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.10) Gecko/20050716 Firefox/1.0.6

Uninstalled FF 1.0.6 (which is fine...)

Installed v1.5 beta...

After about 24 hours of use, I notice these two severe problems:

1. Firefox v1.5 beta repeatedly left several process instances running on my PC.
 When I looked at Task Manager/Processes after realizing that FF was not
responding, there were no less than 5 separate running instances of firefox.exe
on the Processes list.  Not caused by unusual web page visits/activity.

2. After installing FF v1.5 Beta, my external USB hub, USB card reader, and IEEE
1394 (FireWire) internal adapter started to ***not work correctly***; showed
problems in Hardware Manager.  My USB card reader would stop at about 5-10
minute intervals, and I would have to disconnect it and reconnect it to get it
going again.

Solution:  I uninstalled FF v1.5 beta, and deleted its Program Folders material.
 Scrubbed Registry of all Firefox references manually.  I then restarted my
PC...  my IEEE 1394 and USB hardware re-installed itself successfully. 
Installed Firefox v1.0.6.

I have not had *one* hardware nor software problem since performing these
actions to solve the problem.  I truly believe that FF v1.5 beta led to these
things as this was the only thing I changed that can be attributed to causing my
hardware and softare problems.  My system is once again stable I assure you.  FF
v1.5 beta is the only culprit.  Is FF v1.5 beta stable on a W2K SP4 machine???

I will NOT move beyond FF v1.0.6 for now.  Please investigate.

Thanks!  Doug Whitehill
