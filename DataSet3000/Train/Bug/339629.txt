After closing Firefox for a few minutes, I opened it- and it displayed firefox had  installed a security update. It didn't reust my permission for this update at all. All of my settings wre reset, and I had to download all of my Extensions and Themes again, for the update button didn't work. I use autoscroll lots, and found it to be off. I turned on autoscroll *AND Smoothscroll* yet when using autoscroll, it sticks and is bumpy when moviing it in any other direction then dead straight. I am very upset that this has happened.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. middle clicked
2. Move autoscroll in any direction other than a perfect line straight up, down, left or right.
Actual Results:  
if moving in any way diagonally, autoscroll sticks and bumps around.

Expected Results:  
moved smoothly in the direction I moved it in.

All happened after Firefox upodated without my permission. Themes and extensions refused to work until I redownloaded them all. Settings reverted back to normal.
