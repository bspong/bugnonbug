"Clear" and "Evaluate" in Javascript console crash (with certain optimizations)
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.6a) Gecko/20031104 Firebird/0.7+ (Optimized for AthlonXP SSE by Yek)

After having built the last week's worth of firebird (& thunderbird) on
fedora-core-1 using gcc 3.3.2, I noticed that using the Javascript console via
the tools menu on the browser would crash if I tried to clear the console
messages using 'Clear'. It would also crash (bring firebird to desktop without a
message) if I entered any expression and clicked on Evaluate.

I think that this is related to GCC 3.3.2 and specific chip optimizations
(either AthlonXP or P4). That being the case, I don't know if it should be
reported in this category but thought I'd try it here and see.

I tested after finding it by getting the official linux gtk2/xft build and
noting that it didn't occur there. Then someone else confirmed this and also
noted that it didn't occur when he used the same chip optimizations as the
official build (and he used gcc 3.3.2 as well), but that it did occur when he
built as I did despite his optimizations for a p4 while mine were for an athlonxp. 

Other things I include in my builds are DOMi and Venkman, but they don't appear
to be a problem as long as I compile using the same options as official builds
(chip optimizations I mean). 

My .mozconfig:

export MOZ_PHOENIX=1
mk_add_options MOZ_PHOENIX=1
ac_add_options --enable-crypto
ac_add_options --enable-default-toolkit=gtk2
ac_add_options --disable-tests
ac_add_options --disable-debug
ac_add_options --disable-mailnews
ac_add_options --disable-composer
ac_add_options --disable-ldap
ac_add_options --enable-optimize="-O3 -march=athlon-xp -msse"
ac_add_options --enable-extensions=cookie,xml-rpc,xmlextras,p3p,pref,transformii
x,universalchardet,typeaheadfind,webservices,inspector,venkman
ac_add_options --enable-jsd
ac_add_options --enable-xft
ac_add_options --disable-profilesharing


To test this, 

This has been verified by one other person under similar circumstances.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. build mozillafb using .mozconfig above (in details) with specific chip
optimizations and with gcc 3.3.2
2. run fb
3. goto tools/JavaScript Console
4. click the clear button, or enter 1+1 or some expression and click on evaluate.


Actual Results:  
Crash to desktop.

Expected Results:  
Clear the log or evaluate the expression.

No non-default extensions or themes were used, but I built in Venkman and DOM
Inspector. http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=33185 is a thread I
started in the firebird bugs forum where someone else verified this and helped
narrow it down.
