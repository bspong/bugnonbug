tested with last nightly build of firefox:

this is a very old bug since months and can be reproduced on any version of
firefox / mozilla - but NOT on konqueror - konqueror ALWAYS shows all below
links correctly.

the empty page bug is easily reproducable almost each time on fully w3c
validated pages of my site's blog.

tested with Linux on SuSE Linux 9.2 full updated on regular basis without
positive effect on bug behavior - last update march 16th 2005

using kernel
 >  uname -a
Linux gott 2.6.8-24.11-default #1 Fri Jan 14 13:01:26 UTC 2005 i686 i686 i386
GNU/Linux

on MY blog -  URL 
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php
as well as clicking on ANY link of links "Categories of previous posts:" on
above pagesthe page usually ALWAYS is empty !
here the links that cause the same problem of empty pages

as well as ALL links on the CALENDER of the blog ( upper RIGHT o fabove page )
such as the URLs
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php/20050315
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php/20050314
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php/20050304
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php/20050302
and ALL other calender link with existing posts

problem solving how to :

1. repeated reloading - up to dozens of time reloading MAY sometimes make the
text appear
2. resizing of firefox / mozilla ALWAYS makes the text appear - even SMALLEST
moves on resizing  the browser window - just 1 milimeter or so lets the text
being rendered by the browser!
3. then viewing the source of the EMPTY page - the page content ALWAYS is fully
present in the source window even if that page still is empty in browser window
4. it only concerns the CENTER part of that page and all a.m. mentiond pages
5. the pages is composed by 3 templates top + text body + bottom

furthermore

when using the URL
http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php

and clicking on all links on top of page "Categories of previous posts:" EXCEPT
the chat link which is regular static HTML 4.01 page ) 
opening each link in a NEW TAB or new window 
all tabs are EMPTY ..
but 
resizing the browser smallest amounts - ALL TABS are displayed in FULL
when opening all a.m. links in new window - then each window needs to be resized
seperately to make the text appear in browser


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. load page http://www.kriyayoga.com/love_blog/index.php when posts existing 
2. or any of a.m. links in new tabs or new window when today's posts are missing
3.

Actual Results:  
page BODY section empty each time
only top of page and sidebar displayed

Expected Results:  
page to always be displayed

the page is displayed using MySQL / php and 3 templates
one template for 
- top of page and sidebar - always displayed
- actual text content - usually always missing when page loaded
- footer of page - always displayed

COULD it be that there is a MINOR ( microseconds or miliseconds ) delay of the 3
sections  composed by the 3 templates and the browser engine has a TIME frame
too narrow for all text / page components to *arrive* at the right time to be
rendered properly ??

just a NON-techie feeling ...


since i can NOT view my pages - i hence can NOT test any features of firefox on
my blog nor can my many firefox visitors see the blog section - unfortunately i
promote the firefox actively in newletters, posts and the 5 forums with banner
display such as
http://www.kriyayoga.com/familyforum/gindex.html
or the firefox-button on page
http://www.kriyayoga.com/english/frames_index.html

i am actually punishing myself currently by telling surfers to use firefox or
mozilla
IE surfers appear to have no such problems
