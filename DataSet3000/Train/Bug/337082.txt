Certain POSTS do not appear to be sent to the sites althouse.blogspot.com (or onlineintegrity.org)

Often, when I send "posts" to these sites, filling out a text form, and pressing submit, the "posts" never show up, or if they do show up, they have a weird ephemeral quality to them.  They are present only for a brief time and then they disappear.

I don't believe it is the blog's author doing this, when they delete something, they usually mark it as "this comment has been deleted by the blog administrator"

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Write a post at Ann Althouse's blog
2.  In the post, say something like, "I think your use of Gimme Shelter is ironic. Gimme Shelter is an anti-war song and it seems relevant to today's fiasco in Iraq and our lying Administration.
3.  Or at onlineintegrity.org you could post something like, "Which is worse, posting someone's private information online (truly awful behavior), or saying that all of your opponents are traitors literally deserving of death or asking who will be the one to kill them (truly awful behavior.)  I think that onlineintegrity should address both cases."
4.  Press "post", and watch.

Actual Results:  
5.  Either the post will appear (althouse) or it will not even appear (onlineintegrity.org)
6.  If the post does appear, wait, shortly it will not appear.

Expected Results:  
I would expect the post should have been sent and entered into "the permanent records"

This is a self-ironic parody bug.  I apologize for abusing Mozilla and your time.
