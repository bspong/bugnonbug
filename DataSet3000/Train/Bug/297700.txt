- Renders fine in browser.
- Html is fine (no spurious <div>, <table>, ...)
- anything print-related shows a bug shifting the contents
  after page 3 to the right out of the visible area.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. view specified page
2. set media size to A4 
   (probably necessary to force the page boundary to
    catch the picture "just right", if I guess correctly
    * please check this *
    setting media size to letter or legal seems to just
    catch other pictures at page break time for me; 
    still triggering the error, though not necessarily
    between page 3/4.)
3. either print this page
   or     print to file and ghostview the result
   or     print-preview

Actual Results:  
page output is shifted to right a constant offset
per page after the bug is being triggered. 

Media setting is A4, with default borders.

Pages 1,2: ok
Page  3:   <2 images side by side>
           top of the left image is shown, cut off
Page  4:   everything shifted 1+ inch to the right,
           top contains both pictures, with the top
           of the left one "blanked"
Page  5:   shifted 2+ inches, though no more pictures
           across page boundary 

Expected Results:  
printed without the text/pictures being shifted-to-right out
of visible page.

optional: it shouldn't have printed partial pictures at all, but
          moved them to the next page (splitting only makes sense,
          if picture size is a significant fraction of page size)

really optional: 
          would be nice, if a mode <try to avoid truncating/shrinking
          but use a new page instead for the whole picture> would be
          available in the options.

possibly 294591 is a dupe of this one 
(but I couldn't locate its example and verify this).


The output for legal was interesting: 

page 1 ends with a paragraph between 2 pictures.
This paragraph and both pictures are "cut" correctly
between the pages, without triggering the shift.
(images part of <p>)

page 2 ends with a cut image without text by its side
(actually: <div><img1><img2></div>), where img1 is
cut as per the bug above, with the remnant on page 3).
And page 3 displays the first shift-to-right. 


another tidbit:

all the text is in cascaded <div> paragraphs,
so divs with <p>embedded text</p> seem to be save,
even if containing pictures.

The trigger I suspect <div><img1><img2></div>,
centers the pictures in both print and 
browser window.

At page break time, it centers ONLY img1 and just
displays the top of it (INSTEAD of centering
both images and displaying their topmost portions).

The next page (and all following, regardless of
pictures) are shifted.

I aligned the next page below, assuming both
images would have been centered, and it looked
ok.
