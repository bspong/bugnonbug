CPU use goes to 100%.  Page does not load.  Occassionally, page comes up "Server can not be found."
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.8.0.5) Gecko/20060731 Ubuntu/dapper-security Firefox/1.5.0.5

This is an occassional problem and difficult to pin down.  On a "constant on" computer, where the browser is always open with at least one tab set to http://www.groklaw.net or one of its sub-pages, clicking on EITHER the home page link on the page OR the "HOME" icon on the navigation bar causes the CPU use to jump to 100%.  After an indefinite period of time (measured in minutes to tens of minutes) a page MAY come up saying "Server Not Found".  Other pages from other web sites can be loaded without problem.  It would APPEAR that FireFox is not even transmitting the request onto the net (cannot be confirmed - I don't have the tools or knowledge to do that).  Closing FireFox and re-starting OFTEN resolves the problem.  This problem is not seen on other sites that I frequent.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start FireFox and leave running for an extended period of time with http//www.groklaw.net or one of its sub pages in the first tab. (http://www.groklaw.net is my home page)
2. Click on either the home link on the page or on the "HOME" icon on the navigation bar.


Actual Results:  
CPU use goes to 100% use by system, as shown by system monitor.  Firestarter firewall lists no transmission from FireFox.  Linksys router shows no contact with the internet.  Firefox restart required.  Occassionally, total reboot is required.

Expected Results:
