Moving button on bookmarks toolbar from left to right results in button being moved one too far
If you try to move a button on the bookmarks toolbar, and move it from left to right, it'll insert at a point one index too far. This only works with non-folder buttons.

The reason is that controller.js removes the button from its old position before it inserts it at the new one in PMIT_doTransaction():

Because there's now one element less, the index for the point of insertion needs to be decremented by one.

Adjusting it in that function will fix the problem for bookmarks buttons, but it'll then screw up the moving of bookmarks in the Places tree, because Places also uses that function, but itpreemptively adjusts the insertion point index much earlier, using _adjustInsertionPoint() in tree.xml:

So what's the best way to fix this?
- maybe, in toolbar.xml (which handles toolbar DnD), emulate what's done in tree.xml, by creating an _adjustInsertionPoint() function and calling it in TBV_DO_onDrop()?
- or move the _adjustInsertionPoint() code to somewhere common where it can be accessed by the drop calls in both tree.xml and toolbar.xml?
- or maybe call it in neither, but adjust the insertion point later down the chain in controller.js?
- something else?
