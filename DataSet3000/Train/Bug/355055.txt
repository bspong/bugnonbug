Loading bookmarks.html causes an infinite loop (maxing out CPU usage)

The attached bookmarks.html (renamed) file causes Firefox to hang itself on startup, even in Safe Mode! It just uses near 100% CPU, and won't stop until you kill the process.

I can't find anything wrong with the file, and the backup from the day before works fine. Is this a filesize issue?

I tried importing it, same result : Firefox just hangs itself trying to import it. Opening it up in a tab works fine oddly enough.

I wanted to validate it, but it isn't XML or HTML, so I don't know how...suggestions? Otherwise, I could use my nearly-up-to-date version and redo the changes.

I've tried multiple Firefox installations, they all crash on it. If it really is invalid, Firefox should display an error message anyway.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use the attached bookmarks file
2.start up Firefox
3.wait several hours, then give up and kill the process.

Actual Results:  
Firefox window gets stuck while loading the startup page, and becomes totally unresponsive. A full day later nothing has changed :)

Expected Results:  
Firefox loads and works, displaying the bookmarks and doing everything else it normally does.

Can't get it to use talkback, perhaps the windows log files contain interesting data for you?
