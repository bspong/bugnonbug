Extension for Yahoo Email enhancement shows wrong fonts w/ Firefox; displays differently with IE
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1)
Build Identifier: 

Using Firefox w/Yahoo email enhancement: 1. Comic Sans MS looks right, but 
comes out to recipient as that tiny script font.  2.  Selecting the Script 
font w/Firefox, it only shows as Comic Sans MS.  I confirmed the extension as 
the source of the problem, by re-opening the saved (draft) email using IE, and 
all looks right.  3.  The Script font is terribly small.  4.  The Script and 
Courier fonts, RECEIVED in IE after being created in FFox w/ the Yahoo 
extension, are jagged and hard to read.  HOW THIS WAS DISCOVERED: I sent a 
long email to 200 classmates, in Comic Sans MS.  I got immediate complaints 
about that "tiny script font"  "it hurts my eyes"  etc. So the extension 
causes the Selection, Comic Sans MS, to ACTUALLY use Script.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create Yahoo email w/ FFox using Yahoo extensions for enhancements; fonts, 
etc.  Write a sentence using all the font selections. Note that in FFox, the 
Script font shows on originating screen as Comic Sans MS.
2.  Save as draft then send it using FFox.
3.  Open IE, receive the email and see how fonts have changed. 
I didn't try all of them, only Courier, Times Roman, MS Comic Sans, and Script.
3.

Actual Results:  
Already described

Expected Results:  
I assumed all the fonts were appearing in the originating email correctly, but 
they were not.  

I consider this major; the email this happened in contained critical 
information for about 200 people; I assume many saw it as unreadable and 
trashed it without bothering to tell me.  It has wasted over 4 hours of 
precious time for me and will do the same for other unsuspecting people.  I'm 
glad I wasn't sending it to my boss, or prospective employer, etc.
