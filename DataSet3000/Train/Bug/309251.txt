Set dom.disable_window_move_resize back to false for 1.5/2.0/trunk
bug 299424 brought back the Advanced JavaScript pref UI, with some pref tweaks,
including disabling resizing windows by default, based on Jesse's thoughts in
bug 299424 comment 7. While I agree completely with what Jesse said:

[[[
(1) Move or resize existing windows

Should be disallowed by default, except in windows opened by JavaScript with
only one tab.  It is frequently used to annoy visitors, and I don't think many
web applications need it.  (Bug 144069, bug 186708, bug 60323, bug 262660.)
]]]

that's not what we've done by setting dom.disable_window_move_resize to true.
With a fix for bug 144069, yes, but right now what we've done is also prevented
every (half) reasonable use of it, too. The most common one I know of is what
the site in the URL field does: open a popup to display a larger image when you
click the little image, with a single site-wide standard function, and then
resize the popup to fit that particular image, rather than having to build the
size of every larger image into the calling page. It's not the cleanest code,
but I suspect it's fairly common (I've got two bugs to dupe to this just from
today), and without a fix for bug 144069 I think we're better off telling people
using hostile sites to uncheck the pref than we are telling people trying to buy
air guns or a thousand other products to check the pref so they can see the
whole picture without resizing the popup.
