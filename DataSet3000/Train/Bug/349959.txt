When you classify your bookmarks without using the manager (so directly by drag&drop through the menu), if you drop a bookmark in a folder, then move the mouse in the parent folder without moving straight horizontaly left (so without coming back on your foot traces...), the folder remains developped.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
0. You need to have some folders and link in your bookmarks.
1. Click on "Bookmarks" in the toolbar.
2. Drag a simple link in a folder. 
3. Release the mouse, droping the link in the folder which is developped.
4. Move the mouse to the parent folder where the link comes from but not moving the mouse straight horizontaly left. What I mean is for instance, by moving the mouse entierely out of the menu then coming back to the parent folder on another folder.


Actual Results:  
5. The other folder becomes developped although the first is developped too...

Expected Results:  
The first would be closed.
