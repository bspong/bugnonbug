1. New profile, start firefox.
2. Tools > Options > Tabs, tick 'Always show the tab bar'
3. Open some tabs (middle click on some links in the BBC News RSS feed)
4. Close all tabs using the [x] icon on the tab until only one empty tab is left
5. History > Recently Closed Tabs > Open All In Tabs

Expected:
All the tabs that you closed (that are listed in History > Recently Closed Tabs) should be reopened

Actual:
Only one tab is restored. The rest have exceptions thrown:
