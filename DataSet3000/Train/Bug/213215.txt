crash as soon as try to get any kind of help; clicking on any link on URL causes Firebird to crash
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030714 Mozilla Firebird/0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; rv:1.5a) Gecko/20030714 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

Using the most recent build of Firebird--the former build based on Mozilla heta
caused the same problems as current build, I opened Firebird, entered URL
texturizer.net/firebird/index.html, sometimes the browser crashed just before
completing load of page, but ALWAYS CRASHES BROWSER AS SOON AS I CLICK ON ANY
LINK ON THE PAGE.  It causes my whole PC to crash and freeze; have to press
button on CPU to restart computer; ALT+CTRL+DEL does not work.  I tried to get
help, I tried to get new skins, I tried the extensions links--everything causes
a crash.  In order to get to any link I wanted I had to enter the URL using my
Avant browser; there the URL and its links worked properly.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Type in URL texeurizer.net/firebird/index.html; press Enter.
2.Page opens; sometimes completely; sometimes, browser crashes just before page
    is to complete.
3.If page does completely open, click on any link for help, plugins, extensions,
skins, or anything else.

Actual Results:  
Firebird crashes, causing computer to crash with it.  Crash is so severe that
ALT+CTRL+DEL does not work; have to press button on CPU to restart computer.

Expected Results:  
Firebird should have opened requested link and surfing should have been able to
continue.  

I did send a report to Talkback, but as they never respond to any of my reports
of crashes relating to Netscape, which I have stopped using, Mozilla, and, now,
Firebird, I have no way of knowing if anyone has paid attention to any of my
reports.  It is obvious that no action has ever been taken to correct anything I
have reported.  To me the Talkback is nothing more than PR.

I am operating a PC; OS Windows 98, 2nd ed; 2 hard disks, primary 40 G,
seconday, 20 G; RAM 256 MB
