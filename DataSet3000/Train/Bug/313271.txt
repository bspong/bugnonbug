When I am in an open page (regardless of which), if I roll my mouse wheel to scroll quickly either up or down my web page changes to http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMKRR77ESD_0.html
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050920 Firefox/1.0.7 SUSE/1.0.7-0.1
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86_64); en-US; rv:1.7.12) Gecko/20050920 Firefox/1.0.7 SUSE/1.0.7-0.1

Always to that specific page, no other. I have never willingly visited this page
nor does it appear in any of my favorites. I downloaded Deer Park 2 v
1.6a1/Gecko/20051021, your latest nightly build, and I experience the same exact
problem. My mouse is a Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical USB ran through a PS2
adapter. 

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Firefox
2.Open any page
3.Roll my mouse wheel to quickly scroll up or down

Actual Results:  
Page http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMKRR77ESD_0.html opens up, just
as if I had chosen it. Firefox acts normally from that moment on. But if I go to
any other page and quickly scroll again the same thing happens all the time.

Expected Results:  
Just scroll quickly up or down in the original page that I was browsing without
being redirected to ESA.

I have tried finding any other reports of this bug, but cannot find any using
ESA webapge as keyword.
