Automatically check for updates for "my extensions and themes" is unchecked after checking manually

Whenever I check for updates to my extensions and themes manually, the checkbox
to autocheck for updates to my extensions and themes is automatically unchecked.
 Even though I sometimes like to check for updates manually doesn't mean I would
like to check manually _all_ the time....

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open up DPa1
2. Go to Tools -> Options -> Advanced -> Update
3. Check the box labeled "My Extensions and Themes"
4. Click the "Check Now..." button under the aforementioned checkbox
5. Click the "Finish" or "Cancel" buttons to exit the update window (doesn't
matter if it's done checking or not)
6. Notice that now the "My Extensions and Themes" checkbox is unchecked.


Expected Results:  
The autoupdate extensions and themes checkbox should have remained checked (FF
1.0.4 does this perfectly).
