The problem is that firefox does not redraw its interface or page contents
correctly.

Screenshot: http://aserv.ownage.org.uk/firefox.PNG

As can be seen, in the screenshot, it redraws some things if the mouse is moved
over them (buttons, text fields etc) and it will redraw text if you select it.
It will also redraw areas where another window covered it (aslong as it didn't
cover the WHOLE interface) Resizing the window down to a seemingly randomly
small size makes everything work properly. Scrolling the window will make
anything that moves up/down to the viewing area get drawn correctly.

Other people i know have had the same problem, as well as people on the
mozillazine forum.

The problem still exists in the release firefox-1.0+.en-US.win32.installer.exe

and has existed for quite a while now (around 0.7 i think it started)

If you want me to run any debug versions, or older versions, or give more info,
just ask and i will provide what i can.

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Leave windows running for a while with a few apps open
2. Open firefox
3. After a while the interface refuses to draw (at around 450mb ram usage with
1024 or 512mb ram)
