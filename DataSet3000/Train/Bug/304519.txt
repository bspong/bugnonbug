I use a Logitech 310 MX mouse, there are two special buttons configured as going
back and going forward in the site navigation.
1.0.4 was correct, 1.0.6 have changed the functions. Now the back button on the
mouse causes a forward and the forward button causes a back. It would be no
problem to reconfigure the mouse but unfortunately everything else, other
browser, the OS still use back as back and forward as forward.
Firefox Build 1.0.6 seemed to changed the handles for the buttons/functions

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.Going onto a site than to another
2.Using back mousebutton has no effect, using forward mousebutton causes a back
reaction and pressing back mousebutton causes a forward
3.This problem occurs only at 1.0.6 else nowhere

Actual Results:  
Pressing back mousebutton caused a forward reaction
Pressing forward mousebutton caused a back reaction

Expected Results:  
Pressing back mousebutton should cause a back reaction
Pressing forward mousebutton should cause a forward reaction
