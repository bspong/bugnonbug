Browser opens up a new window each time a scripted URL is encountered in Windows Media Player

I post medical lectures on the web.
I have a script file that is embedded into a .wma audiofile.  The script file has the format:

;Script Commands
start_script_table
00:00:01.0 URL http://www.hdcn.com/symp/05asn/02/ste/ste.htm#1
00:00:30.0 URL http://www.hdcn.com/symp/05asn/02/ste/ste.htm#2
00:00:59.0 URL http://www.hdcn.com/symp/05asn/02/ste/ste.htm#3
00:01:24.0 URL http://www.hdcn.com/symp/05asn/02/ste/ste.htm#4
00:01:44.0 URL http://www.hdcn.com/symp/05asn/02/ste/ste.htm#5

Each slide is anchored in a single long scroll .htm file (ste.htm in this case) with a <a name = #2>img src=slide02.gif</a>  tag, etc. 

So as the file is played, the browser should scroll to the next slide.  

This is what happens in IE.

However, in Mozilla, Firefox, each time the .wma audiofile encounters the next scripted URL, Firefox opens up a new browser window.  In effect, for a 40-slide presentation, it copies the entire presentation 40 times, each time in a new window. 



Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://www.hdcn.com/symp/05anna/01/fis/fis.htm

2. Click on Windows Media Player Option 1  
http://www.hdcn.com/symp/05anna/01/fis/fis.asx

3.  Play the windows media file.  

Make sure that you have Windows Scripting enabled in your Windows Medial Player settings!!

The browse will open up a new window with each slide.

4. Repeat using IE.  This does not happen with IE.  Since we are not calling for a target=_blank with the WMP scripting, a new browser window should not be opening.  

Thanks!

Actual Results:  
New browser window opens when the embedded media script reaches each new URL link.

Expected Results:  
The current browser window should simply scroll to the next slide on the same, already-opened web page.
