Image Manager UI
The current state of the image blocking UI isn't the best.  Currently, if "Block
Images for <sitename>" is checked and you click that option, instead of removing
the site permission, it actually sets the "Always Allow" permission.  This is
something that's partially fixed in Seamonkey, but not quite yet.  There is also
no comparable UI to the Cookies Exceptions window.

Basic UI Thoughts:

Context Menus:
Keep the existing menu options if image loading is enabled (default)
Fix the case mentioned above to remove the permission, not set it to white.

If images are disabled by default, change the context menu item to be "Allow
Images from <sitename>" with the same checkmark style, removing (not reversing)
the permission on second click.  This would allow people who have images off by
default to enable certain site's graphics as desired.  It also makes more sense
than a Block Images context menu item that has no apparent effect if disabled.

Image Manager:
Enable direct entry of sites along the same lines as the Cookie Exceptions
window.  Overall, the UI should be identical to the Cookie Exceptions window.

Alternatively, we could just hide all support for whitelisting and disable the
contextmenu item with images disabled.  I think for the price of a single
context menu item that we already have in the defeault setting, we can enable a
potentially powerful feature that carries no bloat since its just utilizing an
existing interface.
