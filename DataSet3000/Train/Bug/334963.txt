Download failure for 1.5 on all attempts to upgrade

I have had Firefox for over a year and upgraded as each upgrade became available and had no problems until 1.5 which I have attempted to upgrade to at least 3 times and have failed on all attempts. Was able to recover my bookmarks and browser function only by re-downloading 1.0.7

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on link on Firefox start page and click on download Firefox link
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
NO Firefox browser

Expected Results:  
Should have installed Firefox 1.5.0.2

I have the Fasterfox extension on my current 1.0.7 browser and during the download it checks for compatibilty and it goes OK - But still no browser after download complete.
  Also, and this has happened on 2 of the attempts, the side bar with the bookmarks opens automatically every time I open the firefox browser when I re-download 1.0.7 and I have to X it off. After a while this stops happening. 
  I am doing well with version 1.0.7 but internet techs claim it is a securiy issue to upgrade to 1.5. If I have a good firewall and anti-virus is it really necessary to upgrade to 1.5?
-YOur assistance is appreciated, thanks, Jeff
