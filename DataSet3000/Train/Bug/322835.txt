This has been present in (at least) the past 2 Thursday builds: i.e. since 01/05.
Examining the source of the referenced page, all I see is a whole lot of styling.  The "meat" of the page is the JPEG image at around line 584:
<TR VALIGN="TOP">
<TD WIDTH="609" BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" COLSPAN="8"><IMG SRC="/comics/chickweed/archive/images/chickweed27326790060102.jpg" ALT="Today's Comic" BORDER="0"></TD>
</TR>

Everythin EXCEPT that image displays.  The page looks exactly like what I would get if the site had not been updated.

I've viewed the page using AMAYA, and it renders the IMG correctly.

BTW, all the pages at that site are the same story.
But, for example, my daily Astronomy Picture of the Day at
<http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html> renders just fine.

Seems we're tripping over some of the site's styling.
