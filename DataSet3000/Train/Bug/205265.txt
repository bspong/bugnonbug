There are a couple of sites that have forms that are not compatible with
Firebird.  When you click submit, it just pops up a Javascript alert window with
the names and values of the form that it is supposed to send to the server but
when you click OK, it doesn't do anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Amazon.com and login
2. Go to the Your Store tab and find a recommendation.
3. Click on the "Why was I recommended this?" link
4. Click on "I Own It"
5. Click on "Save Changes"

Actual Results:  
Javascript alert with form information.  Clicking OK changes the cursor to the
background waiting cursor and the status bar says "Waiting for amazon.com" but
nothing happens.

Expected Results:  
No alert should popup and the form information should be sent to the server and
amazon.com should redirect to another page.

There are many other sites that this happens on.  For example, I cannot log into
the Best Buy credit card management site because when I submit my login
information, it just pops up the alert (with my username and password!) and does
not do anything.
