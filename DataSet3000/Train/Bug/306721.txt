Application Hijacking has been detected by my Sygate firewall.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.9) Gecko/20050711 Firefox/1.0.5
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.9) Gecko/20050711 Firefox/1.0.5

The application: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Thunderbird\thunderbird.exe  tried to
launch another application: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe  to go
to remote host  sympmsnnews.112.2o7.net, even after I closed Thunderbird. This
occured 9 times in a row over 3 minutes, before I blocked all access for
Thunderbird. I am using version 1.0.5 (20050711).

The firewall is Sygate Personal Firewall Version 5.6 Build 2808.

The firewall reports such highjacking when I am at my homepage,
http://sympatico.msn.ca/ and am scanning the news. This is a recent problem,
which is becoming a continuous problem.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have the firewall confirm access to the network by both Firefox & Thunderbird.
2. Access the homepage & open a news story in a new tab.
3. The firewall will report Thunderbird activity, as quoted in the Details above.

Actual Results:  
The firewall keeps reporting highjacking, each time to a different site.

Expected Results:  
Thunderbird shouldn't be accessing Firefox, should it?

I'll include the firewall log.
