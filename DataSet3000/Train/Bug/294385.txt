Crash when opening Hardcoreware page, especially in a new tab
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4

Firefox 1.04 with Cute 3 theme, GMail Notifier 0.4.2 and IEView 0.84 
installed. I was on another webpage, and tried to open the URL 
http://www.hardcoreware.net/reviews/review-277-1.htm in a new tab, by right-
clicking and selecting "Open Link in New Tab". Firefox crashed.

Then I tried just opening that page directly, by pasting it into the address 
field on a newly started Firefox. It could load sometimes, and sometimes it 
crashed. Perhaps it crashes a bit more when opening in a new tab compared to 
pasting the URL in, but that could be my imagination - I tried 10 times or so, 
not enough for it to be statistically significant.


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to http://forums.storagereview.net/index.php?showtopic=19706 and scroll 
down to post #3.
2. Right-click on the link http://www.hardcoreware.net/reviews/review-277-
1.htm and select "Open Link in New Tab".
3. See Firefox crash.

Alternatively, just pasting the URL above into the address field can also 
generate the crash, as mentioned above.
