Firefox fails to set registry key in making itself the default browser
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040317 Firefox/0.8.0+
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7b) Gecko/20040317 Firefox/0.8.0+

In the latest Windows nightlies, Firefox creates a new key under
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT named "FirefoxHTML", to identify HTML files to be opened with
Firefox.

However, it fails to set the default value in that key-- that is, the 'friendly
name' used for that filetype-- to anything. For some odd reason, this breaks
functionality in Thunderbird, which apparently expects there to be a name in
this key; as a result, Thunderbird display a dialogue box to download an HTML
file upon clicking any link. I'm assuming there are probably other programs that
expect the key to have a name specified in its default value as well.

Setting the friendly name to 'HTML Document', as Seamonkey does in the
MozillaHTML key, fixes the conflict with Thunderbird.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Set one of the latest Firefox nightlies as the default browser.
2. Navigate to the registry key HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML.
Actual Results:  
The default value of the key is empty.

Expected Results:  
The default value of the key is set to "HTML Document" or some similar description.
