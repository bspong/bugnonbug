First attempt to open a site fails (time out) from either external program or within firefox, then works on next try
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.7.6) Gecko/20050317 Firefox/1.0.2

when opening a link to a new site (ie not already seen in the session) from
either an external app (ex: trillian) or from within firefox (ex: google
result), very often the first attempt to load the site fails on a timeout after
a few seconds. trying to open it again then works. 
however, even on timeouts, the site's icon is displayed in the current tab --
which is a good way of seeing that the page should have been loaded and is worth
another try. 

this happens both on a win2k SP4 comp and on a macos X 10.2.8 comp (both with
firefox 1.0.2 i think). 

this bug is somehow related with bug #268915, however it happens so often that i
think it deserves its own entry. 

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
doesn't always work (or rather, opening the links sometimes works), but basically:
1. click on a link 
2. get the timeout
3. see that the icon has been displayed in the tab
4. try to open the link again
5. it works! :-)



Expected Results:  
that the site be opened on the first try. as has been pointed out, the address
is not displayed in tab that timed out, therefore one has to get back to the
link and click on it again.
