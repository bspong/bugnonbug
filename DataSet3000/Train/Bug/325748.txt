eBay's "checkall" JavaScript function fails in Firefox 1.5

When displaying various ebay lists, for example a watchlist, there are checkboxes in the table to enable you to select a row and do various things to all the rows checked (for example to remove them from the list).  In the table header, there is a checkbox which is supposed to check all item.  This checkbox calls a Javascript function called "checkall".  In version 1.1 of Firefox, this feature works correctly.  However, when I upgraded to 1.5, checking this box has no effect except to check itself.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to ebay and do a search for something that will return multiple items (for example "TV".
2. Select a few items and add them to a watchlist.  You can do this as a guest, so you don't need to have an eBay account.
3. Go to "my ebay for guests" to see yur watchlist.
4. Try to check the box in the header row - it should cause all the item checkboxes below it get checked; it doesn't

1. This feature works OK in IE and the latest build of Mozilla.  It also works in older version of Firefox.  It appears to be introduced in version 1.5.0 and persists in 1.5.0.1 (released this week).
2. This feature is also broken if you display a watchlist from within a normal eBay account, i.e. it is not specific to a guest account
