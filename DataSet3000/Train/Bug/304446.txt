Two graphics on this page are blackened  (treeevil.jpg & treelove.jpg).  All
have graphics been given .jpe extensions I did not intend.  The graphics appear
to load correctly, but then quickly blacken.  The graphic can be seen when it is
enlarged. It can be downloaded if I remove the .jpe extension.  I do not
understand where the .jpe extension comes from or what it means.  The problems
do not appear in MS IE.  This condition means that visitors using Firefox are
not able to see my graphics so affected.   

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to the above URL
2. Scroll down the page to find the two "tree" graphics.  If you move fast
enough you will se them blacken.  If you scroll past the graphics, when you
return, they will be blacened.
3. Other graphics not yet affected.

Actual Results:  
The subject graphics disappear, i.e., become blackened.

Expected Results:  
Proprly display the .jpg graphics

I do not know if I correctly identified the component from the options you
provied above.  Thge option I was looking for but did not find was "graphics
display."
