build packages for locales by starting with en-US complete packages
The current build process for creating a copy of Firefox in any locale requires
building the source from scratch (or reusing a set of built files) and then
packaging those files with the locale files.  We should add a new process to our
build system that allows the build to start with a set of en-US package files
(maybe just the .zip or maybe the .zip and the .exe), unpackages them, then
repackages the files for a new locale.

I see the human process for managing the builds occurring something like this:

  * While the trunk/branch is in open development, the l10n build systems build
    as they do today by checking out the CVS code.

  * When we get code complete in en-US, we take the generated files from the
    en-US build systems and place them in a special location on the l10n build
    systems that the build process recognizes as holding finished products.

  * Upon seeing these files, the build process knows to skip checking out most
    of the source code (for example, maybe it only checks out the locale files)
    and instead unpackages the files.

  * The build process then picks up at the point where the locale files are
    packaged with the product files (from the en-US build), completes the
    build, and moves on to the next locale.

  * The resulting files that are uploaded are sent to the FTP site and are
    essentially the same product files as the en-US files, hence having the
    same Talkback ID and symbols as en-US users.
