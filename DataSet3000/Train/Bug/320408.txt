If a bookmark folder or live bookmark is clicked with the middle mouse button, the contents of that folder will open in tabs. Because I use the Bookmarks Toolbar Folder (this could get confusing...) to hold various Live Bookmarks and folders, I will occasionally middle-click a folder there when I go to close a tab, or open a link near the top of the page in a tab. This suddenely creates a large number of tabs, bogging the browser down and effectively destroying my session.

According to this thread on MozillaZine, this functionality can't be disabled, which I think counts as a bug:
