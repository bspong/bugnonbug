search toolbar forgets engine if called from path with wrong case
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030513 Mozilla Firebird/0.6
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030513 Mozilla Firebird/0.6

I use Google as my search in the search bar, but it doesn't stay all the time. 
If you send Mozilla Firebird with a URL as a parameter, it forgets the search
bar's engine.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Change your Search Toolbar to use Google.
2. Note the change in icons.
3. Close Mozilla Firebird.
4. Open Mozilla Firebird.
6. Note the G (for google) is still there.
6. Close Mozilla Firebird.
7. Run MozillaFirebird.exe (or phoenix.exe) from the command line with a URL as
the parameter (ie. "C:\Program Files\MozillaFirebird\MozillaFirebird.exe"
http://www.mozilla.org).


Actual Results:  
The search icon (and the searching function) is now the default "Find in this Page".

Expected Results:  
Mozilla should have kept my settings.

I'm having issues between computers.  I can make this happen everytime on Win2k
with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030513
Mozilla Firebird/0.6 (the second release) at work, but where I really see the
problem is on my computer at home on WinXP with Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows
NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.4b) Gecko/20030513 Mozilla Firebird/0.6, and it doesn't
happen using these steps.

On the Win2k machine, Mozilla Firebird is not the default.  On the WinXP,
Mozilla Firebird is the default.

Specifically, I have Trillian Pro on my WinXP machine, and when I try to open a
link from there, it opens my default browser with a URL as the parameter, and 
the search toolbar becomes forgetful, which prompted me to investigate and file
this bug.
