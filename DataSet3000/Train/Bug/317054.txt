"server not found" in a frame, hard to read when inside a frame itself

If you use bloglines, at 1024x768 (as I do), you'll see something bizarre should your network go down while you're away.

The left frame of bloglines is a list of your blogs, which auto-refreshes every so often.  Should the internet go down, you'll get a 'server not found' page in that window.

Where the 'server not found' page in the new FF 1.5 rcs otherwise looks very nice, in this instance it is impossible to read, and just looks lik more of a mess?

Why?  Because the section:

Firefox can't find the server at www.bloglines.com.

Is inside a frame that is too small for what it is trying to display.  Furthermore, because the triangle warning logo is now taking up half the screen, it is pretty much impossible to read any of the text!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Go to bloglines.com, sign in
2.  Disconnect your internet
3.  Look at the frame to the right




This could be fixed one of two ways:

1)  Put the triangle warning logo ABOVE the text
2)  Take the warning message out of the frame

I'll attach a screenshot to show what I mean.
