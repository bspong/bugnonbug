When i visit a site that needs to load a java applet it will, even thou i have
ticked the box in firefox options to not load/allow the java appletes to load.

Also when closing firefox, it does not close the java console (the java logo in
the syst tray) and firefox stays open in the process list when you press ctrl,
alt and delete.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In tools > otions click on web features and untick the enable java box.
Click on ok and you can close the browser and open it again or leave it open.
2. Visit a site that will load up a java application then it will.
3.visit the tools> options and web features and the box enable java box will now
be ticked.

Actual Results:  
Java became enabled even thou the option was ticked to not enable it.

Expected Results:  
It should have not loaded the java application and should have not made java
enabled in the options.

I have put the software severity to major as i belive this is a personal
security feature, as i myself and my staff only enable java when we need it as
the line of work we are in and the type of sites we need to visit on the
internet often load java apps to infect our system with viruses and
downloaders/trojans.
