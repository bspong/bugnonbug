There are some files whose names are written in Korean.
Mac standard encoding method for the file system is UTF-16.
When you try to see the local file listing with mldonkey's WEB UI,
(Transfer->Scan Temp ), it shows discomposed Korean characters, while the Safari
displays them correctly.
The used encoding method for the Safari and the Firefox is the UTF-8.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. put some files with Korean file name into the mldonkey's temp directory.
2. launch the mldonkey
3. http://127.0.0.1:4080 for opening mldonkey's WEB UI.
4. click "Transfer" and click "Scan Temp".
5. See if the Korean file names are displayed correctly.
6. Compare the result with other browsers like the Safari.


Actual Results:  
Please take a look the screenshot I will attach.

Expected Results:  
Correct conversion to the UTF-8.

I don't think this problem is caused by the mldonkey, because if you open local
directory with file:///blah.. then you also can confirm that Korean file names
are displayed as discomposed.
