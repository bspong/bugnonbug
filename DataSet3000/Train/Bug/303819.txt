At the url I have listed, and likely others similar to it, at time of posting
the sites creator had not put a character limit on the text box and if you were
to copy and paste text into the text box and continue copying and pasting large
amounts of text eventually firefox simply crashes.  I and several friends have
reproduced this effect repeatedly.  We have concluded that if you were to use a
text area with a javascript to fill it, you could potentially do a weak DOS
attack or possibly even execute malicious code.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Enter a page with a text box that has no character limit.
2. Using the keyboard command for copy and paste, simply hold down control + v
copying large amounts of text into the box

Actual Results:  
Firefox dissapeared and quality agent opened.

Expected Results:  
Continued to accept text until machine limit reached.

This bug on a variety of system configurations as my machine is a bit older and
my friends also have a variety of older and newer hardware.  I'm not expert
enough to be sure, but it seems to be a potential security flaw and I will mark
it as such, I apologize in advance if I am incorrect in doing so.
