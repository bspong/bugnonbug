AccessibleObject returned for some A tags is for wrong textnode

Using GetAccessibleObjectFromPoint I normally get the right object that has the
actual text under that point.  But at times i get an adjacent node which does
not have the text under the point.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Load up this html and try using my test program from
bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=297697 over the two anchor tags

<ul><br>
<li>Go to Pharaoh and say to him, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Let My people go that
they may serve ME!’” <a
href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NASB&amp;passage=Exodus+8%3A1"
title="Bible Gateway">Exodus 8:1</a><br>

</li><li>Rise early in the morning and present yourself before Pharaoh, as he
comes out to the water, and say to him, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Let My people go,
that they may serve ME!’” <a
href="http://biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?language=english&amp;version=NASB&amp;passage=Exodus+8%3A20"
title="Bible Gateway">Exodus 8:20</a><br>
1.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
the first anchor's text is produced ("Exodus 8:1") but the second anchor's does
not come up ("Exodus 8:20") but instead you get "Rise up early in the
morning..." as the text.

Expected Results:  
Given Exodus 8:20
