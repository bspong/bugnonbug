Only since updating to 1.5 on Saturday.  Slow to load pages.  Hangs up or stalls computer.  No response to right click (for Close for a tab).  No response to clicking on red X (to close window).  No response to CtrlAltDelete.  Sometimes I can get the CtrlAltDelete (windows task manager?) to work -- and it shows that the CPU function is at 100%.  When I End Task to close Firefox, it drops again.  When I open Firefox, it shoots back up.  Sorry this is not technical enough.  I tried closing Firefox, removing extensions, rebooting, etc.  I have not had a lot of time to try different websites.  But it "works" (that is, stops working) every time I open multiple tabs at eBay or amazon.  Thanks.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open Firefox
2. Go to eBay (generally a top level favorite search)
3. Open individual items (or additional bookmarks) in New Tabs

Actual Results:  
Computer hangs up and I get back to housework and come back later to see if I have any email, and then I also try again to close tabs or CtrlAltDelete.

Expected Results:  
Computer still doesn't work.  Eventually I can usually End Task.  Fortunately nothing I am working on online is critical right now.  It's just annoying.

It should have let me Close Tabs, Close Window, Open New Tab, etc.  Bookmark hasn't been working right either.  I think it is the latest Firefox upgrade but could it be my local internet server?
