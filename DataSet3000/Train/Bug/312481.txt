the items that have inline style declarations are having their style overwritten
by the declarations made on the external stylesheet.  The page initially loads
correctly, but after 3 seconds or so, the inline styles are overwritten. In
previous versions of FF as well as other browsers, the inline styles has higher
precedence.

Reproducible: Always

2.Watch as the page loads the styles
3.After 3 seconds, the styles are overwritten



Expected Results:  
The inline style declarations should take precedence and append their values
over those of the external stylesheet.
