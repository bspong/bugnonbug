Error while printing in Firefox 1.5 Beta 1 and 2 on Mac OS X Tiger

I have a Samsung CLP-550N hooked up to my home network. My Powerbook runs Mac OS
X Tiger and happily prints from all applications to this printer, except from
Firefox 1.5 beta 1 and 2. 

So what do I mean by "all applications"? I've tried printing from other Mac
applications like TextEdit, NeoOffice, Safari, Preview, Adobe Acrobat Reader....
- they all print fine on my printer. Even Firefox 1.0.x prints fine. 

However, when I try to print from Firefox 1.5 Beta 1 or 2, the Mac OS side of
the printer (the printer client) gives an error saying - "Print File was not
accepted (client-error-bad-request)!". The document won't print and I've to
eventually kill the print job.

Since I can print from other Mac OS apps and Firefox 1.0.x, I am thinking this
may have something to do with communication between FF 1.5 b1 and b2 and Mac OS
X print subsystem. I even tried creating a clean profile for FF 1.5 b1/b2 -
still the same error.

I will try to attach a screen shot of the error message - as soon as I figure
out how to do so in Bugzilla.

Reproducible: Always

1.On Mac OS X Tiger with Samsung CLP-550N printer driver, navigate to any web page

Actual Results:  
Got the error message saying "Print File was not accepted
