Flash works only on Macromedia Test Site

A few days ago, I could not access Flash at sites such as www.aa.edu. Right-clicking on the site would popup the Flash box that says "movie not installed" and "About Flash."

I created a new profile, Flash worked fine. Installed my various extensions one at a time, test for Flash, all was fine.

Ran Bon Echo several times over the next few hours. Problem recurred: I can now go to http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/welcome/, where Flash works correctly, but when I return to www.aa.edu (and other Flash-using sites), Flash is there but does not show anything.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Really impossible to say what steps cause the failure, as I never get a Bon Echo crash, nor do I get any error messages, I only found that both my previous profile and the new one I created earlier today don't work properly.
2.
3.

Actual Results:  
As stated above: Flash will work for a while, then work *only* on the test site. Quite odd.

Expected Results:  
Flash should continue to work. I suspect something has changed in a recent Bon Echo nightly release, but I cannot give any specific date as to when the Flash problem arose; that is, I don't know a date prior to which the Flash problem did not exist under Bon Echo nightly releases.
