Impossible to get XMLHttpRequest response data in the opening window when the request was initiated from a popup that has been closed.

Ok What I am doing is sending out a asyncronous xmlhttprequest from a popup. I set the onreadystatechange method to be a method in the opener of the popup window.  Then the popup is closed. Even though the xmlhttprequest object belongs to the opener window it does not function anymore. On the other hand if the popup is kept open the functionality does not break.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Try out the sample html. It consists of 3 files. 
1. ajax.html This is the opener window.
2. popup.html This is the window that is opened from ajax.html
3. response.html this is just what i use for the xml response.

If you put all 3 files on a working server should be no problem to reproduce.

Notitce that  If you clikc the Send request and dont close the text in the opener gets populated with the response. If you clikc Send request and close popup then there is no response what so ever it is simply blank. There is no errors generated in the javascript console.
