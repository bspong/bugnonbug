titlemodifer doesn't - CCK
Currently, if you set titlemodifer in browser.dtd, it doesn't affect the Firefox
window because of this code:

http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/browser/base/content/browser.xul#62

title="&mainWindow.title;"
titlemodifier="&mainWindow.title;"

which should be:

title="&mainWindow.title;"
titlemodifier="&mainWindow.titlemodifier;"

In addition, I'm investigating whether we should change the way titlemodifier works.

Here is the text of a note to hyatt:



So in the title bar it now says:

Website - Mozilla Firefox

We're bringing back the Netscape CCK, and the way it worked was that if
titlemodifier got set to "Company A", it would look like:

Website - Company A

and Netscape was nowhere to be found on the titlebar.

So as we do this for Firefox, we're concerned about branding.

Do you think I should modify the behavior of titlemodifier so that it appends to
Mozilla Firefox instead of replacing? So you would set titlemodifer to "by
Company A" and you would get:

Website - Mozilla Firefox by Company A

or should I leave the existing behavior alone and tell people "Please make your
titlemodifier be Mozilla Firefox by your company" so that the titlebar becomes
whatever they set titlemodifer to.
