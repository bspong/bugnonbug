This is a port of bug 230563 (of Seamonkey) to Firefox, because it exists in
Firefox too, and a patch was written for it. Reading from the bug's description:

This is a comment or elaboration on a problem that has already been reported by
a number of informants.  There's a basic shortcoming with the way that pasting
of bookmarks appears to be intended to operate for the Mozilla user.  Rather
than Ctrl-V inserting the cut/copied item *before* the highlighted line in
Bookmark Manager, it would make more sense if Ctrl-V emulated the behaviour of
Netscape 4.x and inserted the cut/copied item *after* the highlighted line.

Netscape 4.x had it right in the first place as far as pasting behaviour in the
Bookmark Manager was concerned:

1. If you pasted to an open (expanded) folder, the cut/copied item was pasted
*into* that folder, as its first item.

2. If you pasted to a closed (collapsed) folder, the cut/copied item was pasted
immediately below that folder (but not into it), at the same level of nesting
within the bookmark hierarchy as that folder.

3. If you pasted to the last item in a folder, the cut/copied item got inserted
after it to become the new last item within that folder.  (You can't do that in
Mozilla with pasting, nor with keyboard shortcuts.)

4. If you pasted to the pseudo "Bookmarks for <whoever>" folder -- whether it
was open or closed -- the cut/copied item because the very first displayed bookmark.

Intuitive and consistent -- and if the pasting behaviour of Mozilla wasn't
intended to emulate that of Netscape 4.x, then it would be great if Mozilla
*did* emulate Netscape 4.x in that regard.  (Because -- disregarding Mozilla's
multiple bookmarks -- Netscape 4.x had the best bookmark manager around.)
