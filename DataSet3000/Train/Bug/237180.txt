Mozilla saves two keywords with the same name for different URL's.
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; .NET CLR 1.0.3705; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: 

The keyword feature in mozilla gives us the functionality off just typing the 
keyword in mozillas addressbar rather than the whole address. On taking two 
different URL's in the manage bookmarks section, we can save them with the 
same keyword. Therefore when we go enter the keyword in the address bar it 
opens the URL we saved the keyword first in and completely ignores the second 
URL. 


Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go to Bookmarks in the menu bar of Mozilla.
2. Click on Manage Bookmarks.
3. Go to a URL listed as a bookmark and right click on it.
4. On right clicking the info tab window open up with a keyword field. Enter a 
keyword.
5. Click on ok.
6. Go to another URL and do steps 3,4,5 again and enter the same keyword as 
entered before.



Actual Results:  
We see that Bookmarks manager does not check for similar keywords and stores 
the same keyword for two different URL's. On entering the keyword in the 
address bar it opens the URL in which we saved this keyword first. On typing 
it again it still opens the previous URL and not the other URL, completely 
ignoring it

Expected Results:  
A warning should have popped up stating that the keyword has already been 
entered for a previous URL and to enter a new keyword for another URL. This 
would have told us that mozilla does check for similar keywords used in 
different URL's.
