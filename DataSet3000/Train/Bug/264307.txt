The address bar should scroll when you click and drag beyond the boundary of the
drop down list. That is the normal behavior of drop-down lists but doesn't seem
to work with the address bar.

Incase I'm not describing this adequately, "drag and scroll" is when you first
click the arrow button on a drop-down list and instead of using the scrollbar or
the mouse-wheel to scroll the list, you click and hold down the mouse button
over any item in the list and then drag it down or up and beyond the rectangle
of the list. The list will scroll automatically. This is a time saver.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
See this example of a "drag and scroll" action:
1. On this bug report page, go to the top and click on the drop-down list for
"Components".
2. Click and hold down the mouse on the item "General".
3. Move the mouse downwards till it goes beyond the dimensions of the scroll box.
4. The list will scroll itself.
5. Do the same with the address bar and the list does not scroll.
