Updating extensions on startup causes Firefox to lose session restore information

When FireFox asks to update Add-Ons on startup, it loses "session" information (i.e., "Restore Windows and Tabs From Last Time").  This appears to occur even if you do not choose to install the update when asked.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Open FireFox when there is an extension update, and you have a previously saved session.
2.  Either install or cancel the update.
3.  Your previous session will be lost.




As a note - I am marking this as Critical, because (as a heavy user of the former SessionSaver extension) I tend to keep my "top of mind" tabs always open in a few windows.  Losing these tabs is very disruptive, since they can be very difficult to reproduce (it's hard to find them in the browser history, since they could be several days old, or older). 

(As a note - one thing that Session Saver had that was *exceptionally* useful was an ability to restore the last couple of sessions even if SessionSaver itself didn't restore it on startup.  It would be great if that was eventually made available - either as an extension of the built-in functionality, or as an add-on.)
