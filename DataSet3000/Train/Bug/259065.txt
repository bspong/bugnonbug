When changing the size of the toolbar icons, the "Use Small Icons" option in the
Customize Toolbar window is checked when in fact the large icon sizes are used.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Launch Firefox using a fresh profile.
2. Once the Firefox browser window appears, right click on a toolbar and choose
Customize.
3. The Customize Toolbar window appears.  Choose "Icons and Text" in the
drop-down box.
4. Check "Use Small Icons" (it is not checked by default).
5. Switch back to icons only.
6. Uncheck "Use Small Icons".
7. Switch again to "Icons and Text".

Actual Results:  
Toolbar icon size is large (as expected), but the "Use Small Icons" option is
incorrectly checked.  
When dismissing the Customize Toolbar window and then displaying it again, "Use
Small Icons" is correctly unchecked.

Expected Results:  
The "Use Small Icons" option should be unchecked when large icons are being used.

This problem reproduces in Firefox 1.0 PR release candidate (2004-09-10) and
nightly builds going back to 2004-08-19.  This problem does not reproduce in
Firefox 0.9.3.
