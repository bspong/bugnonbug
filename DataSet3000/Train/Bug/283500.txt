It's a frameset that freezes firefox. It was made with frontpage according to
line 5 which explains a lot.

At a glance there are many things wrong with the code but I would guess that the
problem is the incredibly funky malformed way the frames are defined. Viewing
source will make it very apparent.


Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to http://www.keithlango.com/
2. watch page never render and browser freeze
3. profit

Actual Results:  
The page doesn't render and the browser freezes. You do not have access to any
other tabs if you have some open. The frameset on the URL above is badly written
and firefox valiantly tries to render it but gets stuck...

Expected Results:  
Anything but freeze. It's hard to say exactly what should be rendered as the
code on the page exhibits incredible suckitude but it should have rendered
something or   delivered a friendly error message such as "Frontpage created
pages will not render in this universe in your lifetime" or y'know something
similiar.
