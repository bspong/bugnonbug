Problem first appeared about a week and a half ago.
I run anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti-adware scans at least once a week, and
to my knowledge my system is currently clean.
Firefox is the only browser we use regularly (I have IE, Netscape and Opera
installed on my computer, as I check my website pages in all of them to check
appearance before uploading to my sites, but haven't opened them in over a month).
