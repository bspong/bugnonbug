This seems to be an issue that only affects Firefox on MacOSX.

When new windows are created on top of non-maximised, full-height windows, the new windows are offsetted vertically by about 25 pixels, resulting in the bottom part of the new window being truncated from the screen. Subsequent new windows maintain the same vertical offset.

Proposed solution:
For full-height windows (and windows within say 25 pixels of being full height), set vertical offset for new windows to zero. Keep horizontal offset as is.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. set the current window to non-maximised full-height
2. file:new window or simply use command-N to create a new window
3. note new window has the exact dimensions of the first window, but is placed about 25 pixels to the right and below the first window
4. create a third window
5. note the vertical offset is zero now, the top of the second and third windows are the same.

Actual Results:  
The second and subsequent windows are placed about 25 pixels too low.

Expected Results:  
When the current window is non-maximised full-height, new windows should not be placed with vertical offsets.
