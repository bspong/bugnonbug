Location Bar dropdown loads new tab
UA: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.7a) Gecko/20040129 Firebird/0.8.0+

When you manually type a URL into the location bar, and you then drop down the
location bar menu and select a URL, Firebird should open that URL in a new tab.
It does this on a very inconsistent basis.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open new process of Firebird on linux
2. Type in the location bar the URL of a page that you have never been to before
3. Click on something in dropdown URL bar
Actual Result: It opens in a new tab
Expected Result: Same

4. Exit Firebird
5. Open Firebird again
6. Type in location bar same URL as in Step 2.
7. Repeat Step 3
Actual Result: The page loads in same tab, doesn't open new one.
Expected Result: It opens in a new tab
Actual Result (on Windows): It opens in a new tab

This seems to be related to some caching issue on Linux, because any URL that
has been visited before does not seem to count as having been 'typed in', even
if it was. The only way to get the dropdown menu in the location bar to open a
new tab is by entering the URL of an unvisited page and then doing it. So even
if you open a new Firebird process on Linux, and you go to 20 pages, as long as
they're all cached (or in history, not sure), going to the location bar dropdown
and choosing a URL there will not load it in a new tab.

On Windows this problem does not happen.
