FF 1.5 not useable when profile is stored in LAN
User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; de; rv:1.8) Gecko/20051111 Firefox/1.5

When I try to use FF 1.5 with a profile stored on another client in my LAN (workgroup without server), FF needs a long time for starting up (about 2-3 minutes) and often hangs (all few seconds for 1-2 minutes) while browsing. It does not matter, whether the cache is stored locally or in LAN.

Before upgrading to FF 1.5 I completely removed FF 1.07 and did a fresh install. Also I tried it on a PC with a clean XP install. I used the FF 1.5 profile manager to create the new profile in my LAN and this first startup always lasts about 5-10 minutes. With a profile stored locally all works fine.

When I reinstall FF 1.07, everything is okay like it was before FF 1.5.

The LAN is 100% okay, because there are other apps with LAN-Access and they all work fine, but they also hang as long FF 1.5 is running!
