Command-dragging toolbar items should customize the toolbar even when the
Customize toolbar window (should be a sheet) is not open.

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
Command-drag a toolbar item, without the Customize toolbar window open.
Actual Results:  
Toolbar item is not activated and does not move.

Expected Results:  
Toolbar item is not be activated. It's icon becomes translucent and follows the
mouse. While it is dragged and before it is dropped the other toolbar items move
to accomodate it. It stays in the location in the toolbar that it is dropped. If
it is dropped outside of the toolbar, there is a poof animation and the toolbar
item is removed from the toolbar. The customization takes effect in the other
windows when the toolbar item is dropped. Changes to not need to be saved. They
are global and permanent.

This is the normal behavior for Mac OS X toolbars. For example, see Camino or
Activity Monitor.

Thank you.
