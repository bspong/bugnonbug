Middle Click "Back" and "Forward" buttons should jump to next domain

Since middle-click on the "Back" and "Forward" buttons is currently
non-functional, I propose that this should adopt a new behavior of going Back to
the previous domain (or Forward, I will abbreviate by just referring to "Back"
here, you can assume that I'm implying the reverse behaviour for "Forward").

Opera introduce "Fast-Forward" and "Rewind" buttons to the browser genre  in
version 7.5, which performs this functionality. While powerful and useful, it
does require additional buttons be present on the toolbar. Since Firefox is
already encouraging the use of "middle click" (close tab, for example), it would
make sense to extend middle-click (alternate click) functionality to other parts
of the UI.

There is an extension available for FX which mimicks the Opera 'extra buttons'
implementation.

Forward is arguably less useful than Domain-Back, but if implemented should be
provided for consistancy, even if it were used more rarely.

Expected Results:  

Jumping back and forward by entire domain is useful when browsing forums and
blogs, and most types of site. Consider searching Google for a type of page.
You'd click on the top match, check out the site, but might look at a good
number of pages before deciding to jump back to your starting place. Rather than
multiple clicks on the Back arrow, or choosing the back drop down, a single
middle click is both faster and intuitive for users introduced to using the
middle button by other Firefox functionality.
