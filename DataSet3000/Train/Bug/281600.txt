upload bugs (http post) are tcp problems ?

I have massive problems using FireFox to upload pictures via http post to
different webservers. Very often the upload stalls after some kilobytes.

I sniffed the network traffic with ethereal to see what is exactly happening. If
you inspect the packet flow while the upload stalls you will almost see the same
happening:

- The server sends multiple (>50) duplicate TCP ACK packets
:loop
- wait 10
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 10 seconds
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 20 seconds
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 40 seconds
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 40 seconds
- The client is retransmitting
- wait 20 seconds
- The server sends a FIN to close the connection 
- goto loop

Hint: To find the interesting packets add this ethereal filter: "tcp.analysis.flags"

The problem only occurs on my internet connection (128kbit upstream via a DLINK
router). I couldnt reproduce it on my webserver in my lan.

Here is the interesting part. If i upload data via ftp or ssh it sometimes
stalls too. But it stalls for very short time only. Normally the server sends 2
duplicate ACK packets and almost immediately the upload resumes with full speed.
Where is the difference to FF?

Is FF using some kind of "special" TCP sockets ?

Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
1. upload a file via http post

Actual Results:  
transmission stalls

Expected Results:  
transmission should complete
