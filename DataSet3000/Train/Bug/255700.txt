Bookmarks Manager doesn't consolidate folders being imported with ones that already exist.

Bookmarks Manager when importing bookmarks created a duplicate of a folder I
already had on the system rather than taking the two identical folders and
combining them into one.  This is very problematic as I tried importing two
times to see if it would help and I ended up with three Bookmarks Toolbar
Folders so I can't delete the two extras due to the nature of the Bookmarks
Toolbar Folder.

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Open Bookmark Manager
2.Click on file menu
3.Choose import

Actual Results:

Expected Results:  
Consolidated the folders into one each rather than duplicating my existing
bookmarks folders.

I would like this bug to be tested on all versions of Windows as I don't want to
end up with two Bookmarks Toolbar Folders on my Windows XP Pro system.  I'm
using .9.3 of Mozilla Firebird on the PC I found this bug on.
