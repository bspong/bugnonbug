Security signs (padlock, yellow location bar) disappears when I click on #ref links

I heard about this bug from a comment posted on Asa Dotzler's weblog, but didn't
find any related bug in bugzilla. Hope it's not a dupe...


----
If I enter the URL: https://agia.fsf.org/order/
I get the padlock in the bottom and the address bar is yellow.

Now if I click on one of the #refs, eg the link "Software",
I lose the padlock and the yellow address bar.

Pasting the full url https://agia.fsf.org/order/#software
gives the secure feedback, but clicking another #ref
loses it again.

I can confirm it too. This is a new bug introduced by version 1.0.1
Firefox 1.0 handles this fine.


Good luck and congratulations for all your work!

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. go to https://agia.fsf.org/order/
2. Notice the location bar is yellow. Fine.
3. Now click on any of the internal (to the page) links, such as "Software"


Actual Results:  
Location bar isn't yellow anymore. No more padlock as well. But we're still on a
https site.

Expected Results:  
Continue to confirm we're on a https site: location bar should still be yellow
and padlock be displayed.
