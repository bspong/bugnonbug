Deferred Loading for "Open in Tabs"

When I load multiple urls in firefox using the "Open in Tabs" Option in a 
bookmark folder OR by having multiple sites as the "home page"; firefox tries 
to load all the urls all at once

Is it possible to have a gap between the requests for the urls.

For e.g., if I have three sites in my bookmark folder/home page - mozilla.org, 
slashdot.org and google.com. 
Can the loading of the sites be performed per the following steps -

1. Create three tabs.
2. Load mozilla.org in the first tab.
3. Wait for 2 seconds.
4. Load slashdot.org in the second tab.
5. Wait for 2 seconds.
6. Load google.com in the 3rd tab.

The actual implementation steps could be different, but the above is just an 
example of what I'm asking for. The amount of time could be more or less or 
customizable (default zero).

The use - lesser load on my proxy server. 

Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Add multiple sites to the "home page" with a '|' delimiter.
2. Load FireFox

Actual Results:  
All sites loaded simultaneously. The requests go to the proxy server together.

Expected Results:  
A slight lag between the requests to the proxy server.
