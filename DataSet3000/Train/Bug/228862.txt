This is an official request to inline page icons to bookmarks.html.  There are
certainly other workable implementations, such as a gc-able database.

Observations and opinions:
1. The desirable behavior for favicons is *not* cache-like, so should not be
implemented as such.  In particular, if you've got 100 bookmarks with
link/favicons (including sidebar and toolbar folder), you *REALLY* want them to
be displayed all the time.
2. copying bookmarks.html should copy the icons.
3. it would be nice to define your own icons for pages which don't have 'em
(including folders - 
4. icons are no more part of the served content than page titles - the server
provides a default title for the page which the client is free to use, change or
ignore completely. IMHO, page titles should be the model that is used for page
icons.
5. non-bookmarked pages may be considered a separate issue - in particular, I'd
say that using the (proposed) bookmark-supplied icons should be a useful
optimization, rather than a required behavior.
