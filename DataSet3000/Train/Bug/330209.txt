When using right-click + t to open tabs from links in a page firefox crashes unpredictably.  Crashes occur when fewer tabs have been opened if they are opened quickly one after another.  Crashes have ranged from as few as 6 tabs to as many as perhaps 30.  The following page has worked very well for reproducing on my system but I've experienced this on a wide variety of pages: http://www.renderosity.com/gallery.ez?Sectionid=0&filter_genre_id=51&BestRanking=Yes


Reproducible: Sometimes

Steps to Reproduce:
A) GENERIC:
1. goto an index page with many links to other pages (preferably pictures because they're easier to click on)
2. start using right-click + t to open the links in new tabs, do this as fast as possible
3. crash should occur randomly after a new tab has been opened.
B) What Works For Me:
note: you may need to get a free account to follow these instructions, sorry.
1. goto http://www.renderosity.com/gallery.ez?Sectionid=0&filter_genre_id=51&BestRanking=Yes
2. start using right-click + t to open the links (each thumbnail is a link to a full sized version) in new tabs, do this as fast as possible
3. crash should occur randomly after a new tab has been opened.
Actual Results:  
Firefox crashed on my system when I did the above.  When I say crashed, what I mean is that all windows just disappear without warning or delay.

Expected Results:  
I would have expected firefox to not crash.

I'll attach a valgrind log output incase that helps somebody.
My system is AMD Athlon 64 3000+ with 512MB RAM and plenty of video and HD resources so this crash is unlikely to be a hardware failure.
