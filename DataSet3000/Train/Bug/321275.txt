desktop background posting spyware infection on my screen

My concern is regarding my desktop bacground. 

My screen now posts that my laptop has a spyware infection. I've installed Spyware Doctor and Registry Mechanic in order to get rid of the spyware (and fix my registry files) but the message won't go away. 

I found an image called desktop, under display property. It's listed under desktop background w/ the "Mozilla" icon on it. I did browse in other locations of my computer, to verify that I'm not mistaking the icon to another software but it is from Mozilla. The same icon. It's really strange. 

I'm thinking of re-installing Windows XP cause I feel like I'm running out of options. What should I do?

Reproducible: Always

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Go under display image and view under desktop background. The image is named desktop
2. Select other pictures under that list. Nothing happens.
3. Set an image, from picture folder, as desktop background. No change.

Actual Results:  
Nothing happens. The message remains on the screen.

Expected Results:  
The real background should be back

First time it happens w/ Mozilla. I did have the same problem with IE, long ago, but I've been able to reset the real image on screen. The image was no longer under desktop background. The previous incident had a different picture though. Honestly, not quite sure how I "solved" the problem exactly but I recall restoring the system and it helped. I tried with this one also but the system won't allow me to the previous month for some reason.

Thanks!
