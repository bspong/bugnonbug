Mozilla hangs with 100% CPU usage after opening initial window
User-Agent:       Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322)
Build Identifier: Mozilla 1.0.7

After opening a Firefox window, the browser hangs at 100% CPU for all known options except Help/About.

Some of the items that fail are:

*  File/Print
*  Tools/Options
*  Bookmarks/(any)
*  Help/Help Contents
*  Typing any URL in the Address Box (lockup after first character.)

I suspect malware.  Firefox has worked fine for a long time.  I browsed a lot of sites yesterday without a problem, after which I closed Firefox.  When I later opened a new browser window the problem arose leaving no hint as to which site had caused the problem.

Reinstalling Mozilla did not solve the problem.  Neither did installing a new copy of Deer Park Alpha 2.

The problem doesn't appear to be isolated to a Windows environment.  I've also got a 3-day old Linux system running Fedora.  Upon discovering that the Win2K box had this problem I began using the Fedora system.  All was well until a short time ago when I discovered that the problem had also occurred on linux.

I'm not behind a proxy.  The firewall allows all outgoing traffic.

So far, I'm unable to isolate the problem.  I'll gladly send anything that will help find/fix the problem.
